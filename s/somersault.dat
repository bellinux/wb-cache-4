5|$|Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the protagonist Samus Aran from a first-person perspective, and it takes place in an open-ended world with interconnected regions. Gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, and shooting enemies. Progress through the game requires both dimensions to be explored, using power-ups that Samus acquires over time. Equipment players collect include the Screw Attack, which allows Samus to <b>somersault</b> in midair and off certain surfaces, and new beam weapons that have limited ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|A {{note about}} {{twisting}} <b>somersaults</b> - {{although it is}} not impossible to associate different amount of twist with either front or back <b>somersaults</b> it is universal practice that front twisting <b>somersaults</b> will always have an odd half twist while back twisting <b>somersaults</b> will always have a round number of twists. This is {{to make it easier for}} the performer to 'spot' the bed prior to landing.|$|R

They show {{a variety of different}} figures in the air, which are single <b>somersaults,</b> double <b>somersaults,</b> rolling (a number of uncountable <b>somersaults),</b> rotation with open wings, nose dives, sudden change of direction during flight and very rarely axial turns. Some breeds fly up to 1000 m high, others stay in the air for several hours.|$|R
5|$|Raven fought Sean Waltman in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. A Clockwork Orange House of Fun {{match is}} held under no {{disqualification}} rules, involving multiple types of weapons including {{part of a}} steel cage. Waltman scored a near-fall after jumping off the pillars holding up the cage and performing a <b>somersault</b> leg drop onto Raven through a table. Raven won the bout after throwing Waltman into the cage causing it to collapse, Raven then followed with a pinfall victory at thirteen minutes.|$|E
5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the <b>somersault</b> seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object is to place your {{opponent}} on a stretcher and wheel the stretcher across a finish line. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a <b>Somersault</b> Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Somersaults</b> may be {{performed}} in one of four positions: tuck, pike, straight (or layout), and puck. The tuck position is considered the least difficult. <b>Somersaults</b> done in pike or straight position are more difficult, and each complete rotation is awarded a 0.1 bonus to Degree of Difficulty. Puck position is a body position intermediate between tuck and pike, and is used in multiple twisting <b>somersaults.</b>|$|R

5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy scored a two-count on Brown by slamming the back of Brown's head and neck into the mat with a reverse neckbreaker. Hardy then {{climbed to the top}} rope and jumped off with a <b>somersault</b> toward Brown, who was laying on his back in the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver. Once Hardy jumped, Brown moved {{out of the way and}} then performed his signature Pounce maneuver by crashing into Hardy. Brown followed by pinning Hardy at 8 minutes and 43 seconds to win the contest and become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, {{wall-mounted}} blades and saws, and spinning spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a wall {{for a set}} distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a <b>somersault</b> attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's {{third round}} tie {{was against the}} amateur club Corinthians at Crystal Palace. The third round was the furthest Corinithians had ever progressed, though until 1923 the club never entered the cup due to club rules {{preventing}} them from entering any competition with a prize. Manchester City went behind and only equalised three minutes from time. The Corinthians goalkeeper, Benjamin Howard Baker collided with a teammate, causing him to take more than four steps with the ball. From the resulting free kick, Frank Roberts scored in a goalmouth melee to take the tie to a replay, held the following Wednesday. The rematch proved less even. Manchester City won 4–0 courtesy of goals by Austin (twice), Hicks and Johnson. After his goal, Hicks {{had to leave the}} field as he had sustained an injury while performing a celebratory <b>somersault.</b> In the fourth round, City faced league champions Huddersfield Town and again won 4–0. The crowd of 74,799 was by far the highest of the round, and only 1,200 short of the club record.|$|E

5|$|Rey Mysterio versus Sabu {{was next}} in an Extreme Rules match with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line. The match started with several chair shots from both competitors. Sabu had {{the upper part}} {{for most of the}} match, {{executing}} an Arabian Facebuster and a Triple Jump Moonsault, but Mysterio kicked out of both moves. Mysterio regained the upper hand, as he executed a Seated Senton that sent both men through a table at ringside. Sabu countered a second Seated Senton attempt, and put Mysterio on a second table at ringside. Sabu proceeded to execute a Triple-Jump <b>Somersault</b> Splash, but Mysterio made it to his feet while on the table. This turned the move into a DDT, sending both men through the table at ringside. Although neither men were legitimately hurt, Dr. Ferdinand Rios came out and kayfabe declared that the match could not continue. This meant that Mysterio retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, but only a bare minimum were {{provided}} as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant <b>somersault</b> type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations.|$|E
5|$|The {{final round}} {{occurred}} on the September 9 episode of Impact!, with Sabin and Shocker versus Shelley and Waltman. This contest lasted 7 minutes and 20 seconds. Sabin and Shelley started off the match, with Shelley dominating Sabin with mat submission holds. The wrestling left the ring as Waltman performed a <b>somersault</b> splash to the ringside area onto Shocker and Sabin. Later, Sabin ascended to the top-rope to perform a dropkick onto Shelley, to only have Shelley dodge out of the way, resulting in Sabin hitting his partner Shocker instead. After checking on Shocker, Sabin turned around and was met with a kick to the jaw from Shelley. Sabin left the ring after this due to a legitimate injury. With Shocker left and the referee attending to other matters, Waltman hit Shocker in the groin and followed by performing his X-Factor maneuver to gain the pinfall victory and to win the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Monster's Ball II {{was held}} at Bound for Glory. Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match. James Mitchell {{accompanied}} Abyss to the ring. In a Monster's Ball match, pinfalls and submissions count anywhere. There are no disqualifications or count-outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed. It is called Monster's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked {{in a dark room}} for the preceding 24 hours without food or water. In the very beginning, Sabu started bleeding from his right eye, while Hardy had blood coming out of a cut on his arm. Midway through the bout, Rhino also started to bleed. Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended {{to the top of the}} Bound for Glory set. He then jumped off in a <b>somersault</b> and landed on Abyss. Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered, leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver. Afterwards, Rhino drove Hardy's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with a pin to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds. After this match, Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten-Man Gauntlet match would be held later in the show to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Stereotypic {{behavior}} in captive animals has been hypothesized {{to emerge from}} thwarted natural behavior patterns and {{is thought to be}} more common in captive-reared animals. However, data on the early stages of develop-ing stereotypies are currently scarce. We compared the development of stereotypic route-tracing and <b>somersaulting</b> in hand-reared and wild-caught starlings placed in individual cages for the first time. We found that wild-caught birds were less active but showed more escape motivation and more evidence of route-tracing behavior. Furthermore, <b>somersaulting</b> was only observed in wild-caught birds. Development of <b>somersaulting</b> was predicted by subtle differences in behavior during the first few days in cages and developed in individuals with low levels of route-tracing behavior. Our data suggest a role for escape motiva-tion in the development of starling stereotypies and additionally that route-trac-ing and <b>somersaulting</b> may represent alternative outlets for thwarted escape. In contrast to observations from mammals, our results show that stereotypies are more common in wild-caught starlings. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. De...|$|R
