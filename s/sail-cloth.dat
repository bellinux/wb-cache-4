60|$|Carvil seated. Bessie. Captain Hagberd (white beard, <b>sail-cloth</b> jacket).|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on," [...] cried Slagg, {{stuffing}} {{a mass of}} <b>sail-cloth</b> violently, {{by means}} of a hand-spike, underneath the binding rope of the raft.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, {{come on and}} see to the kitchen. Can you cook?" [...] asked Charlie, as {{he led the way}} to {{the rocky}} nook where Archie was putting up a <b>sail-cloth</b> awning.|$|E
60|$|A {{southern}} city never reveals its true charm till the summer, and few English know what Seville {{is under the}} burning sun of July. It was built for the great heat, {{and it is only}} then that the refreshing coolness of the patio can be appreciated. In the streets the white glare is mitigated by awnings that stretch from house to house, and the half light in the Sierpes, the High Street, has a curious effect; the people in their summer garb walk noiselessly, as though the warmth made sound impossible. Towards evening the <b>sail-cloths</b> are withdrawn, and a breath of cold air sinks down; the population bestirs itself, and along the Sierpes the cafés become suddenly crowded and noisy.|$|R
60|$|Two {{rolls of}} {{what looked to be}} <b>sail-cloth</b> were lying on the barn floor, and around them Bob, Reddy, Joe, Ben, and Leander were seated with a look on their faces that was very nearly a troubled one.|$|E
60|$|The hatches {{were taken}} off, {{and the men}} {{proceeded}} to get up a number of barrels and bales, some <b>sail-cloth</b> being thrown on the deck to deaden the sound. Lanterns, passed down into the hold, gave them light for their operations.|$|E
60|$|She imperceptibly crept closer, and {{he wrapped}} round them both {{a large piece}} of <b>sail-cloth,</b> which was {{sometimes}} used to keep the sun off the milk-cans. Tess held it from slipping off him as well as herself, Clare's hands being occupied.|$|E
60|$|Long {{they sat}} and gazed in solemn admiration at the scene, talking in subdued tones of past, present, and future, until their eyes {{refused to do}} their office and the heavy lids began to droop. Then, reluctantly, they crept beneath the <b>sail-cloth</b> {{covering}} and lay down to rest.|$|E
6000|$|Carvil. No. They've {{grown too}} fly. You've got only {{to pass a}} remark on his <b>sail-cloth</b> coat to make him shut up. All the town knows it. But he's got {{you to listen to}} his crazy talk {{whenever}} he chooses. Don't I hear you two at it, jabber, jabber, mumble, mumble------ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} long we worked for Don Jaime; but it was through two or three rainy spells, eight or ten hair cuts, {{and the life of}} three pairs of <b>sail-cloth</b> trousers. All the money we earned went for rum and tobacco; but we ate, and that was something.|$|E
60|$|Soon the imprisoned mariners {{began again}} to plot and plan their escape. Of course {{they thought of}} making ropes of the <b>sail-cloth</b> and twine with which they wrought, but as the turnkey took the {{material}} away every night, and brought it back every morning, they gave up this idea, as they had given up many other ideas before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, miss," [...] Brown ventured, [...] "but the deck's closed at the end, {{as you can}} see, with <b>sail-cloth,</b> and I was leaning over the rail myself when you shrieked. There wasn't any one else near me, {{and no one can}} {{possibly}} have passed round the deck, as you can see plainly for yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|The sails {{were made}} of linen in Homer's time; {{subsequently}} <b>sail-cloth</b> was made of hemp, rushes, and leather. Sails were sometimes dyed of various colours and with curious patterns. Huge ropes were fastened round the ships to bind them more firmly together, and the bulwarks were elevated beyond {{the frame of the}} vessels by wicker-work covered with skins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tie a lot {{of these}} nails in a bit of <b>sail-cloth,</b> Slagg, and fix 'em to the raft--to one of the spars, not the planks. Do the same with a saw, hammer, axe, and cask of biscuit,--water, too; don't forget water. Make a belt of a bit of rope, Robin, and stick that small axe in it. Have it handy." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{proved to}} be a gipsy encampment, {{consisting}} of three or four little cabins, or tents, made of blankets and <b>sail-cloth,</b> spread over hoops that were stuck in the ground. It was on one side of a green lane, close under a hawthorn hedge, with a broad beech-tree spreading above it. A small rill tinkled along close by, through the fresh sward, that looked like a carpet.|$|E
60|$|While the Jew talked (I {{think he}} was a Jew) I was opening the <b>sail-cloth.</b> Within was a piece of linen which had been oiled to keep out water, {{addressed}} in some red pigment to myself or my father. This, too, I opened, not without difficulty, for it was carefully sewn up, and found within it a letter-packet, also addressed to myself or my father, in the handwriting of Marie.|$|E
60|$|They {{have also}} a {{considerable}} trade to Norway {{and to the}} Baltic, from whence they bring back deals and fir timber, oaken plank, balks, spars, oars, pitch, tar, hemp, flax, spruce canvas, and <b>sail-cloth,</b> with all manner of naval stores, which they generally have a consumption for in their own port, where they build a very great number of ships every year, besides refitting and repairing the old.|$|E
6000|$|So {{they drove}} {{on through the}} gloom, forming one bundle inside the <b>sail-cloth,</b> the horse going as he would, and the rain driving against them. She had consented. She {{might as well have}} agreed at first. The [...] "appetite for joy" [...] which pervades all creation, that {{tremendous}} force which sways humanity to its purpose, as the tide sways the helpless weed, was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over the social rubric.|$|E
60|$|Old Edie was {{stirring}} {{with the}} lark, {{and his first}} inquiry was after Steenie and the pocket-book. The young fisherman had been under the necessity of attending his father before daybreak, to avail themselves of the tide, but he had promised that, immediately on his return, the pocket-book, with all its contents, carefully {{wrapped up in a}} piece of <b>sail-cloth,</b> should be delivered by him to Ringan Aikwood, for Dousterswivel, the owner.|$|E
60|$|At length {{the morning}} dawned. It was no sooner light than {{it began to}} rain heavily. As the child could not endure the {{intolerable}} vapours of the cabin, they covered her, in return for her exertions, with some pieces of <b>sail-cloth</b> and ends of tarpaulin, which sufficed to keep her tolerably dry and to shelter her grandfather besides. As the day advanced the rain increased. At noon it poured down more hopelessly and heavily than ever without the faintest promise of abatement.|$|E
60|$|Previous to redescending, {{our hero}} had {{arranged}} with Rooney to have pieces of <b>sail-cloth</b> in readiness {{to wrap the}} bags in the instant of their being got into the small boat, so that when being transferred to the large boat's locker, their form and contents might be concealed from the pilot, Dwarro. The precaution, however, {{did not seem to}} be necessary, for Dwarro was afflicted with laziness, and devoted himself entirely to the occupations of alternately smoking, in a dreamy way, and sleeping.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{the grandest}} {{of all the}} fanciful ideas that have been promulgated on this subject was that of Galien, a Dominican friar, who {{proposed}} to collect the fine diffused air of the higher regions, where hail is formed, above {{the summit of the}} loftiest mountains, and to enclose it in a cubical bag of enormous dimensions--extending more than a mile every way! This vast machine was to be composed of the thickest and strongest <b>sail-cloth,</b> and was expected to be capable of transporting through the air a whole army with all their munitions of war! ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I think,” {{the sailor}} said to Will seriously, “you are a {{fortunate}} fellow {{to have made}} a friend like that. A good chum is {{the next best thing to}} a good wife. In fact, I don’t know if it is not a bit better. Ah, here comes the boatswain with a bit of <b>sail-cloth,</b> so you had better lie down at once. We shall most of us turn in soon down below, for there is nothing to pass the time, and I for one shall be very glad when the cutter comes for us.” ...|$|E
60|$|A {{party of}} men were {{already at work}} nailing battens over the {{shattered}} stern of the Sea-horse. When this was done, <b>sail-cloth</b> was nailed over them, and a coat of pitch given to it. The operation took four hours, by which time all the other arrangements had been completed. The holds of the two privateers {{were found to be}} empty, and they learned from the French crews that the two craft had sailed from Bordeaux in company but four days previously, and that the Sea-horse was the first English ship that they had come across.|$|E
60|$|Some one knocked. Cursing the interruption, Levasseur strode off to open. Cahusac {{stood before}} him. The Breton's face was grave. He came {{to report that}} they had sprung a leak between wind and water, the {{consequence}} of damage sustained {{from one of the}} Dutchman's shots. In alarm Levasseur went off with him. The leakage was not serious so long as the weather kept fine; but should a storm overtake them it might speedily become so. A man was slung overboard to make a partial stoppage with a <b>sail-cloth,</b> and the pumps were got to work.|$|E
60|$|The boys chatted {{for some}} time under cover of the <b>sail-cloth.</b> They agreed that things were much better than they could have expected. The {{protection}} of the boatswain was a great thing, but that of their sailor friend was better. They hoped {{that he would be}} told off to the ship in which they went, for they felt sure that he would be a valuable friend to them. The life on board the cutter, too, had been pleasant, and altogether they congratulated themselves on the course they had taken.|$|E
60|$|She {{was unwilling}} to take it, but had not the {{presence}} of mind to put him off by a jest, and would not be frankly rude. As though certain she set much store on it, he placed it carefully in an envelope. They walked on and suddenly came to a canvas booth on which was an Eastern name. Roughly painted on <b>sail-cloth</b> was a picture of an Arab charming snakes, and above were certain words in Arabic. At the entrance, a native sat cross-legged, listlessly beating a drum. When he saw them stop, he addressed them in bad French.|$|E
60|$|So Grandfather {{told his}} auditors, that, on General Washington’s arrival at Cambridge, his first care was, to reconnoitre the British troops with his spy-glass, {{and to examine}} the {{condition}} of his own army. He found that the American troops amounted to about fourteen thousand men. They were extended all round the peninsula of Boston, a space of twelve miles, from the high grounds of Roxbury on the right, to Mystic river on the left. Some were living in tents of <b>sail-cloth,</b> some in shanties, rudely constructed of boards, some in huts of stone or turf, with curious windows and doors of basket-work.|$|E
60|$|The central space, {{together}} with the recess at one end, was emptied of all incumbrances, and this area, covering {{about two-thirds of the}} whole, was appropriated for the gathering, the remaining end, which was piled to the ceiling with oats, being screened off with <b>sail-cloth.</b> Tufts and garlands of green foliage decorated the walls, beams, and extemporized chandeliers, and immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had been erected, bearing a table and chairs. Here sat three fiddlers, and beside them stood a frantic man with his hair on end, perspiration streaming down his cheeks, and a tambourine quivering in his hand.|$|E
60|$|All {{believed}} that a vast fortune awaited them {{on the other side}} of the continent, and the most fabulous tales of the abundance of gold were circulated and believed. In some cases the parties consisted only of men who had clubbed together and purchased a waggon, and started, leaving their wives and families behind them. In others they were composed of whole families, who had sold off farms or businesses in the east in the assurance of acquiring a fortune at the gold-diggings. Around the little settlement the plain was dotted with the white tilts of the waggons, mingled with the tents which had been extemporised of <b>sail-cloth,</b> tarpaulins, and blankets.|$|E
60|$|Ben mended the {{umbrella}} admirably. At the same time, Bill fashioned and carved {{two or three}} paper-knives of wood with great neatness. But when {{it was discovered that}} they could sew <b>sail-cloth</b> expeditiously and well, a quantity of that material was given to them, and they were ordered to make sacks. They set to work accordingly, and made sack after sack until they grew so wearied of the monotonous work that Ben said it made him wish to sit down in sackcloth and ashes; whereupon Bill remarked that if the Mounseers would only give them the sack altogether, it would be very much to their credit.|$|E
60|$|Foy made a sign, and Martin {{going to}} the cart, pulled off the <b>sail-cloth,</b> {{revealing}} the five mud-stained barrels painted, each of them, with the mark B. There, too, ready for the purpose, were a hammer, mallet, and chisel. Resting the shafts of the cart upon a table, Martin climbed into it, and with a few great blows of the mallet, drove in {{the head of a}} cask selected at hazard. Beneath appeared wool, which he removed, not without fear lest there might be some mistake; then, as he could wait no longer, he tilted the barrel up and shot its contents out upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|He {{had seen}} {{pieces of gold}} like that. Before all the {{treasure}} had been carried from the caves to the Miranda, the supply of coffee-bags had given out, and during {{the last days of}} the loading it had been necessary to tie up the gold in pieces of <b>sail-cloth,</b> after the fashion of a wayfarer's bundle. Before these had been put on board, their fastening had been carefully examined, and some of them had been opened and retied. Thus all the negroes had seen the little bars, for, as they knew the bags contained gold, there was no need of concealing from them the shape and size of the contents.|$|E
60|$|That {{they should}} beg the turnkey {{to let them}} have another old {{umbrella}} to work at by way of recreation, as the sack-making was rather monotonous; that, if they should be successful in prevailing on him to grant their request, they should work at the umbrella very slowly, so as to give them time {{to carry out their}} plan, which was to form a sort of parachute by adding <b>sail-cloth</b> round the margin of the umbrella so as to extend it to twice its circumference. After it should be finished they were to seize a fitting opportunity, cut the bars of their window, and, with the machine, leap down into the yard below.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning the lieutenant took them on board the depot and put them under the charge of the boatswain. “You will have to mix with a roughish crew here,” the latter said, “but everything will go smoothly enough when you once join your ship. You had better hand over your kits to me to keep for you, otherwise there won’t be much left {{at the end of}} the first night; and if you like I will let you stow yourselves away at night in the bitts forward. It is not cold, and I will throw a bit of old <b>sail-cloth</b> over you; you will be better there than down with the others, where the air is almost thick enough to cut.” ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the sailors}} stood as respectfully {{as if he}} had been one of {{themselves}} while the captain read a portion of the Burial Office. Such honours would never have been his in his native land, where at that time even Episcopalians themselves could not have ventured on any out-door rites; and Arthur was thus doubly struck and impressed, when, as the corpse, sewn in <b>sail-cloth</b> and heavily weighted, was launched into the blue waves, he heard the words committing the body to the deep, till the sea should give up her dead. He longed to be able to translate them to poor Fareek, who was weeping and howling so inconsolably as to attest how good a master he had lost.|$|E
