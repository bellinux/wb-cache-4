40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} and diagnosed confabulation in a 20 -year-old {{woman who had}} suffered severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> 12. <b>Spontaneous</b> confabulations <b>were</b> associated with dysexecutive behavior involving perseveration and impulsiveness. The patient was amnesic during neuropsychological tests but did not present intrusion, confabulation or false recognition. She could evoke self-constitutive autobiographical events accurately and without fantasizing. The only difference between her false and true recollections is that the patient could never envision herself as an actor in a scene involving confabulation. She succeeded, albeit slowly, in carrying out the classic executive tests: Stroop, Trail Making A and B and Wisconsin Card Sorting (WCST). She showed particularly slow reaction time and was impulsive and hurried in her performance of the D 2 attention test, the errands (Martin) test and the chocolate cake test. Her working memory was significantly impaired. A peculiar inability to inhibit the generation of fictional constructions may reflect a problem in control of short-term memory. Diagnosis of the confabulation phenomenon has had three clinical consequences: 1) information {{has been given to}} the patient, her family and other people close to her; 2) reeducation by means of voluntary memory control prior to speaking has been proposed; 3) reporting on the case has been improved...|$|R

At the age of 3 months, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> noted to have hypotonia. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> admitted to the hospital for pneumonia at the age of 4 months.
