The methodology was applied in the plain area of the Oltrepo Pavese (Po Plain, Italy) using ERS- 1 / 2 and Radarsat data, processed using the SqueeSAR™ algorithm, and covering time spans, respectively, from 1992 to 2000 and from 2003 to 2010. The test area is a representative site of the Po Plain, affected by various geohazards and characterized by moderate rates of motion, ranging from − 10 to 4 mm/yr. Different components of motion were recognized: linear, non-linear, and seasonal deformational behaviors.

Preceding the design and development of the foundation the physical characteristics of the in-situ peat such as; peat depth, soil consolidation, soil compressibility, water table, liquid limit, soil moisture content, soil bulk density, loss on ignition, soil bearing capacity and soil shear strength were verified. Two types of foundation designs i. e. single shell and pad foundations were assessed. Both utilized Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) as the footing material. They were conceptually designed as floating foundation employing the weight compensation technique. The soil bearing capacity, soil shear strength, self-load and the lateral wind-load are factors taken into consideration in the footing design.

40|$|AbstractFoundation soil {{properties}} {{are influenced by}} many factors. Endogenous processes are one of these. Foundation soil and building constructions are exposed {{to a number of}} factors, which can be influenced {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. Endogenous processes are factors that cannot be avoided. Construction works interact with these processes and have to cope with its effects. If we are unable to predict their occurrence, its impact strength and possible consequences, we are not able to confront these phenomena. Tectonic movements that cause subsidence, landslides, erosion, earthquakes, waterlogging, flooding areas and many others belong to endogenous processes. An earthquake is an endogenous process as well. An earthquake causes quakes, destruction of buildings, landslides, <b>soil</b> liquefaction, <b>subsidence</b> and changes in relief.

This paper is Part I of a two-part case study examining {{the relationship of}} surface heterogeneity to observed ABL structure. Part I focuses on observations. During two days (12 – 13 July 1997) following rain, midday convective ABL depth varied {{by as much as}} 1. 5 km across 400 km, even with moderate winds. Variability in ABL depth was driven primarily by the spatial vari-ation in surface buoyancy flux as measured from short towers and aircraft within the SGP 97 domain. Strong correlation was found between time-integrated buoyancy flux and airborne remotely sensed surface soil moisture for the two case-study days, but only a weak correla-tion was found between surface energy fluxes and vegetation greenness as measured by satel-lite. A simple prognostic one-dimensional ABL model was applied to test to what extent the soil moisture spatial heterogeneity explained the variation in north–south ABL depth across the SGP 97 domain.

40|$|Abstract: Satellite {{differential}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar interferometry (DInSAR) is an attractive technique for detecting and monitoring ground surface deformations arising from regional scale processes (e. g. seismic/volcanic). The technique, however, is not effective for site-specific evaluations, because of coarse resolution and coherence loss limitations. Permanent Scatterers interferometry (PSInSAR), developed at Politecnico di Milano and improved at T. R. E. s. r. l. company, overcomes the limitations of DInSAR and extends the applicability of radar interferometry to local-scale geotechnical investigations of slope instability and <b>soil</b> settlement/ground <b>subsidence.</b> The PSInSAR analysis allows the identification of numerous radar targets (the PS) where very precise displacement information can be obtained. Considering the regular re-visit time and wide-area coverage of satellite radar sensors, and that PS usually correspond to buildings and other man-made structures, this technique is particularly suitable for applications in urban environments, which often represent a harsh setting for GPS or conventional topographic surveying. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PSInSAR in monitoring urban ground deformations we present examples of practical applications in Italy, Japan, and US. PS data can assist in:- Identification and delineation of areas affected by slow deformations. - Estimation of surface velocity and acceleration fields with millimetric precision. - Identification {{of the source of}} ground instability by analysing in situ and multi-temporal remotely sensed data...|$|R

Internal forces originating from matric suction can change soil physical properties.

Results showed that the seedbed (0 - 20 cm) with a bulk density of 1. 2 Mg. m- 3 will be changed to a massive soil with high values of bulk density, cone index, and tensile strength after soil wetting. Slaking, slumping and coalescence of the soil caused soil surface to subside about 1. 5 cm in 20 cm soil layer. After irrigation, cone index and tensile strength increased abruptly with decreasing of moisture content.

This megapolitan has a population of about 10. 2 million people inhabiting an area of about 660 km 2, with relatively rapid urban development. It has been reported for many years that several places in Jakarta are subsiding at different rates.

The results obtained from leveling surveys, GPS surveys and InSAR technique over the period between 1974 and 2010 show that land subsidence in Jakarta has spatial and temporal variations with typical rates of about 3 – 10 cm year − 1. Rapid urban development, relatively young alluvium soil, and relatively weak mitigation and adapatation initiatives, are risk increasing factors of land subsidence in Jakarta.

Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but {{the effects of these}} hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh’s ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated <b>soils,</b> marsh <b>subsidence,</b> and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion...|$|R
