5|$|In 1987, the Norwegian Polar Institute sent five {{scientists}} to spend eleven {{days on the}} island. The main focuses were aerial photography and topographical measurements to allow an accurate map of the island to be produced. The second important area was marine biological investigations, although also geological, biological and other <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> conducted. The team also built an automatic weather station. Three DX-peditions {{have been sent to}} the island, in 1987, 1994 and 2006.|$|E

Ground and aerial <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> also carried out to detect the presence of radioactive substances in troop concentration areas, and at sites in the United Kingdom that had been bombed, but none were detected.|$|E
5|$|Lord Joicey {{bought the}} castle in 1908, and by 1922 the ruins had been cleaned of ivy and repointed. The castle was placed into the {{guardianship}} {{of the state}} in 1975, and archaeological excavations and <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> carried out on the site in 1978, 1983, 1994 and 1998. In the 21st century it is managed by English Heritage, and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as an ancient monument.|$|E
40|$|All social {{surveys of}} residents' {{reactions}} to environmental noise in residential areas which were described in English language publications from 1943 to 1989 are identified.

5|$|On 20 October 1871 two {{engineers}} traversed the {{two possible}} routes from Bergen to Voss; the one via Fana, Os and Hardangerfjord, the other via Dale and Sørfjord. Though covering a less populated area, the latter would be cheaper to build, and have less elevation. A railway committee was created on 25 January 1872 {{with a limited}} mandate, which was increased again 20 December. At {{the same time there}} was a dispute between the Ministry of Labour and Pihl about whether to prioritize the Bergen Line, but in July 1872 <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> performed in person by Pihl and two engineers, and their report was positive. At the same time he launched the idea of a branch line up Valdres to Lærdal.|$|E
5|$|Property {{losses from}} the fire can be {{accounted}} for with relative certainty as detailed <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> made immediately afterwards. City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic <b>survey</b> <b>is</b> one of {{a number}} of methods used in archaeological geophysics. Magnetic surveys record spatial {{variation}} in the Earth's magnetic field.

5|$|In 1763 coal was {{discovered}} in Radstock and mining began in the area, however transport was a major problem because of the poor state of the roads. This cost {{and the potential for}} cheaper delivery of coal from south Wales via the Monmouthshire Canal led to the proposal for a canal which could transport the coal to Bath and Wiltshire. Initial <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> conducted during 1793 by William Jessop and William Smith under the direction of John Rennie who presented the report on 14 October 1793 estimating the cost of construction of the canal at £80,000. Smith, who also worked at the Mearns Pit at High Littleton, made the original observations leading to his important stratification theory by observing the dips in the geological strata through which the canal was cut. Smith became Surveyor to the company, but was dismissed in April 1799, apparently because he had used his position as surveyor to buy a local house at advantageous terms. He then set himself up in a private practice in Bath but was re-engaged by the company in 1811, to provide advice when repairs became necessary to the canal bed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. Deal Castle was in a poor state of repair by 1615, the outer walls damaged by storms and coastal erosion, and a 1616 survey suggested that repairs estimated at £396 were necessary. The problems persisted, with the winter storms filling the moat with water and stones from the beach, and undermining the foundations; the castle's captain, William Byng, sent numerous complaints about this to his superiors. By 1634, <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> suggesting that the repairs would now cost £1,243; a suggestion was put forward by the George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, that nearby Camber Castle should be demolished to help provide materiel for the work at Deal. Most of the garrison were now living {{in the town of}} Deal and complaints were made by the Lord Warden in 1618 that only a small guard force was being left to secure the castle at night. As the condition of the castle waned, fighting between Dutch, French and Spanish ships in the Downs became common. Some repairs were probably finally carried out in the late 1630s.|$|E
25|$|In March 1837, three <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> {{made for}} a {{possible}} link to the northeast to Baltimore: via Westminister, via Monocacy-Linganore, and via Seneca, {{but they were all}} were deemed impractical due to lack of water at the summit level.|$|E

25|$|Significant <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} {{throughout the}} 1830s–1850s. Several rival routes emerged: a southern, a central, and a northern route. In 1849, Major William Robinson recommended the northern route as most secure from American attack. Funding talks were established {{between the various}} colonial administrations and the British government, but progress remained slow and little was accomplished beyond talk.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} a survey of radio frequency interference (RFI) below 270 MHz. The <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> conducted during business hours {{from the roof of}} the Ohio State University ElectroScience Laboratory (ESL) using a commercially avail-able wideband discone antenna. The resolution of the <b>survey</b> <b>is</b> 30 kHz. Because the RFI at the observing site in this band is very strong, the sensitivity of this <b>survey</b> <b>was</b> sacrificed to ensure that the measurements were reasonably linear and free of self-generated harmonics intermodulation products. Thus, this <b>survey</b> <b>is</b> useful only for identifying strong RFI. ...|$|R

The rationale for UV <b>surveys</b> <b>is</b> explained, and the detectors and instrumentation considered for future UV <b>surveys</b> <b>are</b> described. It is noted that for the wavelength range from 1000 to 2000 A, detectors and instrumentation are already available to provide an all-sky UV survey of moderate resolution (10 to 30 arcsec) and moderate sensitivity (reaching hot stars as faint as 18 th visual magnitude in direct imagery and 11 th magnitude spectrographically with 2 -A resolution) ...|$|R
