25|$|Unlike {{the other}} pushers of the Finnpusku system, Rautaruukki {{has not been}} {{involved}} in a severe accident. Its sister vessel, Finn, capsized with the barge Baltic in 1990 with a loss of eight lives and Herakles, a <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> converted to a pusher in 1991, sank with the barge Bulk in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Pasha Bulker {{left the}} port of Newcastle on 26 July 2007. Four {{kilometres}} out to sea the Japanese <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> Koyo Maru connected lines to Pasha Bulker {{for it to be}} towed back to Japan. Metal beams could be seen reinforcing the buckled hull, as these were part of the temporary repair solution affixed at Newcastle.|$|E

25|$|In 1991 Herakles, a <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> {{built in}} 1967 and owned by Finnish towing and marine salvage company Alfons Håkans, was {{converted}} to a pusher and chartered to Rautaruukki as the third pusher of the Finnpusku system. After the conversion Herakles was chartered to Rautaruukki and continued to operate {{as part of the}} transport system until her demise on 3 March 2004, when she sank with the barge Bulk near Swedish Grundkallen lighthouse in the Bothnian Sea.|$|E
25|$|At 20:00 Tuesday, AS-34 was {{launched}} again but was damaged when it struck a boom {{as it was}} being lowered into the sea. It was brought back aboard, repaired, and relaunched at 21:10. On Tuesday, 15 August, {{three days after the}} sinking, the crane ship PK-7500 arrived with the more manoeuvrable Project 18270 Bester-type DSRV (AC-36). But the weather prevented the PK-7500 from launching the DSRV, and the rescue team decided to launch the submersible near the coast and tow it to the rescue site with a <b>salvage</b> <b>tug.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{capsizing}} of Finn-Baltic {{remains the}} worst accident involving the vessels of the Finnpusku system. In 2004 pusher Herakles, which was converted from a <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> in 1991, sank {{along with the}} barge Bulk laden with coal when the pusher lost both main engines in a storm and subsequently foundered near the Swedish Grundkallen lighthouse. While both vessels of the combination were total losses and the fuel oil from the ruptured tanks polluted Finnish and Swedish coastlines, the crew was successfully evacuated by Finnish and Swedish helicopters. One of the Finnish Border Guard helicopters, OH-HVF, participated in both rescue operations.|$|E

50|$|The name {{also was}} given to the S.A. Wolraad Woltemade, one of a pair of <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs</b> built in 1976, which at the time were the most {{powerful}} tugs in the world.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the accident, the South African Department of Transport {{realised}} that despite many Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) using the Cape sea route each year, the authorities did not have ocean-going tugs that were able to assist them in distress, and to protect sensitive marine areas by breaking up oil spills with chemical dispersants. [...] They therefore set up an oil spill prevention service known as Kuswag (Coastwatch) and commissioned two new <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs,</b> the John Ross and Wolrade Woltemade. [...] The two tugs, with their [...] engines, held the record as the world's largest <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Constructions {{began on}} 27 October 2009 on the P+S Werften yards, {{formerly}} known as Peene-Werft, in Wolgast, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, with yard number 563. Sea trials were held in October 2010. In the course of these trials, the Nordic delivered a bollard pull of 207 tons (ca. 2,030 kN). After its completion on 15 November 2010 and the christening on 8 December 2010 by Susanne Ramsauer, the wife of Federal German Minister of Transport Peter Ramsauer, the ship replaced the <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> Oceanic which was decommissioned after 41 years in service on New Year's Day 2011. Unofficially, the construction costs of the Nordic {{were said to have}} been about € 50 million.|$|E
25|$|MTS Dong Hai Jiu 101 was {{a rescue}} and <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> {{supplied}} by the Chinese government. The vessel joined the search in February 2016; it left the search area on 3 December 2016. In September 2016, Australian media {{pointed out that the}} Dong Hai Jiu 101 spent few days participating in the search—an estimated 17–30 days between February and September—but spent a significant amount of time anchored in or near the port of Fremantle; the media suggested that the Chinese vessel was likely engaged in espionage—signals intelligence gathering and monitoring of Australian and allied naval traffic—around the port of Fremantle. When active in the search, it carried a remotely operated underwater vehicle(ROV) from Fremantle to recover the towfish lost in March and was mobilised from October through December with an ROV to participate in the search.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, four ETVs, Anglian Prince, Anglian Princess, Anglian Sovereign and Anglian Monarch, {{were based}} in {{strategic}} {{locations around the}} UK, with two covering the south coast of England, at Falmouth in Cornwall and Dover in Kent, and two in Scottish waters, at Stornoway the Western Isles (the Outer Hebrides), and Lerwick in the Northern Isles (Shetland and Orkney). The four strong ETV fleet {{was intended to be}} operational 24 hours a day 365 days a year and maintained at 30 minutes readiness to sail, with one tug is allocated to each of the four operating areas on a rotational basis, worked around maintenance schedules. The Dover station was funded jointly with French maritime authorities. A fifth tug, the Anglian Earl, was an anchorhandling and <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> regularly used on commercial work, but also fitted the ETV criteria, and acted as cover for any of the four ETV stations as and when required.|$|E

25|$|On 20 December 1960, Bon Jour {{departed}} Copenhagen {{bound for}} Stockholm, Sweden. During the voyage, {{some of the}} mast stays worked loose and the ship was anchored off Gotska Sandön whilst the mast was made secure. On 23 December, Bon Jour ran into a storm. The fishing vessel Danette located her {{the next day and}} on 25 December the crew abandoned Bon Jour as they feared the mast would collapse. They were taken to Sandhamn by pilot boat. On 26 December, the <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> Neptune took the crew back to Bon Jour. The next day, Neptune towed Bon Jour to Sandhamn. It was suggested that the ship should be taken to Lidingö for repairs, but on arrival there it was discovered that the shipyard had closed six months previously. Repairs were carried out by the Crichton-Vulcan shipyard, Turku, Finland. The work had to be done offshore as the Finnish Government applied pressure on Crichton-Vulcan not to fulfil the job.|$|E
25|$|Salvage efforts began immediately, and divers {{were sent}} {{down from a}} <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> that arrived from Coco Solo. By 10:00am, {{they were on the}} bottom {{examining}} the wreck. To search for trapped personnel, they hammered on the hull near the aft end of the ship and worked forward. Upon reaching the torpedo room, they heard answering hammer blows from inside the boat. In 1923 the only way the salvage crew could get the men out of the submarine was to lift it physically from the mud using cranes or pontoons. One of the largest crane barges in the world, Ajax, built specifically for handling the gates of the canal locks, was in the Canal Zone. However, there had been a landslide at the famous Gaillard Cut and Ajax {{was on the other side}} of the slide, assisting in clearing the Canal. The excavation shifted into high gear and by 2:00pm on the afternoon of the sinking, the crane barge Ajax squeezed through and was on its way to the O-5 site.|$|E
500|$|At 19:08 on 21 October 1918, Frankfurt accidentally rammed {{and sank}} the U-boat UB-89 in Kiel-Holtenau, killing seven of her crew. Twenty-seven {{survivors}} were {{pulled from the}} water. UB-89 was raised by the <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> [...] on 30 October but with the war almost over, she was not repaired and did not see further service.|$|E
5000|$|The next day, on March 3, the Lone Jack {{was still}} afloat {{and a team}} from the USS Hammann was sent to check its seaworthiness. After examination, it was {{declared}} she may be worth saving, though she was low in the water. Two <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs,</b> the USS Kiowa and USS Escape, towed the Lone Jack back to port.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 720 Helgoland class tugs {{are large}} {{seagoing}} <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs</b> {{used by the}} German Navy. After the decommissioning of Helgoland, the class is now referred to as Fehmarn Klasse in the German Navy. As with other auxiliary ship classes in Germany, these tugboats are manned by a civilian crew. The ships are named after the [...] Helgoland (Heligoland) and Fehmarn.|$|R
50|$|At 10:00AM {{the next}} day, crew from HMT Hertfordshire, a British trawler, boarded Ashkhabad and took {{valuable}} navigational equipment and clothing. The Russians {{returned to their}} ship at 3:00PM and discovered it had been looted. The next day the Russians returned to their ship {{in time to catch}} Hertfordshires crew removing more loose items from the ship. Once they were told the ship was not abandoned and <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs</b> were on the way, the British returned the items they had taken.|$|R
500|$|From October 1968 through May 1969, she {{underwent}} {{preservation and}} deactivation processes, {{and she was}} decommissioned on 3 May 1969. [...] Triton became the U.S. Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine {{to be taken out}} of service, and second in the world, after the Soviet Navy's November-class submarine K-27 in 1968. [...] On 6 May 1969, Triton departed New London under tow and proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was placed in the reserve fleet. She remained berthed at Norfolk or at the St. Julien's Creek Annex of Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, into 1993. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 30 April 1986. [...] In August 1993, the hulks of the ex-Triton and the ex-Ray were towed by the <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> Bolster to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS), in Bremerton, Washington, arriving on 3 September 1993, to await their turn in the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program (SRP).|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Brest, Gneisenau {{was the subject}} of repeated British air raids. The first attack took place on the night of 30–31 March, and a second occurred on 4–5 April. During the second raid, a [...] armor-piercing (AP) bomb narrowly missed the ship. As a result of the attacks, the ship was moved out of the dry dock and moved to the harbor. On 6 April, the ship was attacked by British torpedo bombers, which managed to score a single hit. The Bristol Beaufort that struck the ship was piloted by Flying Officer Kenneth Campbell. The torpedo struck Gneisenau {{in the vicinity of the}} rear main battery turret. Some [...] of water flooded the ship and caused a 2degree list to starboard. The flooding also disabled several components of the ship's propulsion system. The explosion caused significant destruction to the side plating as well as the starboard and centerline propeller shafts. The concussive shock also caused widespread damage to the ship's electronic components. A <b>salvage</b> <b>tug</b> came alongside to assist in the pumping effort. Following the attack, Gneisenau returned to the drydock for repairs.|$|E

50|$|In October 1980 Mellon {{assisted}} in the rescue of over 400 passengers and crew of the MS Prinsendam, a luxury liner in distress in the Gulf Of Alaska. After the rescue operations were completed, the Mellon remained on scene in a futile attempt to fight the fire, that had originated in the Prinsendam engine room and progressed throughout the ship. While the Prinsendam was under tow by <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs,</b> and escorted by Mellon the burning ship suddenly listed hard over to Port and sank within a few minutes.|$|R
50|$|The ship's captain told U.S. Coast Guard rescuers {{that his}} boat was in {{imminent}} danger of sinking {{as a result}} of its engine room being flooded in high winds and 25-foot seas. At the time, the Coast Guard rescuers believed that it was highly unlikely for a ship that large to sink that quickly, and were astonished when the Greek captain demanded that all hands be extracted from the ship, instead of requesting <b>salvage</b> <b>tugs</b> and trying to tow it to shore for recovery. Subsequently, all 34 crewmembers were rescued; there were no passengers on board.|$|R
50|$|Six years later, in {{the summer}} of 1948, Cardena ran aground again, this time on a reef near False Bay on Lasqueti Island. All {{passengers}} were evacuated but the crew remained on board. <b>Salvage</b> <b>tugs</b> were eventually able to free the ship from the reef and, even though her hull was holed in two places, Cardena was escorted to Vancouver under her own steam. The ship’s next two mishaps actually occurred on the same day in the Fall 1950. First, when she grounded in the sand off Savary Island dock, and shortly afterwards, when she drifted onto the shore while attempting a landing at Surge Narrows in a running tide.|$|R
