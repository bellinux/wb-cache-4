5|$|On the October 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Heyman, on Lesnar's behalf, {{challenged}} Goldberg to a fight after the pair had been feuding {{for several months}} through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. Heyman stated that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnar's WWE career, as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004. On the October 17 episode of Raw, Goldberg returned to the WWE after a twelve-year absence and accepted Lesnar's request for a fight with their match later scheduled for Survivor Series. On the final Raw before Survivor Series, Lesnar and Goldberg had a confrontation {{for the first time}} in twelve years, resulting in a brawl with security after Heyman insulted Goldberg's family. On November 20 at Survivor Series, Lesnar lost to Goldberg in 1 minute and 26 seconds, marking the first time in three years that Lesnar was pinned. The next night on Raw, Goldberg declared himself the first entrant in the 2017 Royal Rumble match. The following week on Raw, Heyman addressed the Survivor Series match, stating that they underestimated Goldberg and that the match was a humiliation and embarrassment for him and Lesnar, who would also be in the Royal Rumble as he has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> Lesnar returned on the January 16 episode of Raw to confront other Royal Rumble participants, attacking Sami Zayn, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Lesnar entered at number 26 and went on to eliminate Enzo Amore, Dean Ambrose and Dolph Ziggler before confronting Goldberg, who entered at number 28 and quickly eliminated Lesnar after a spear.|$|E
25|$|Having {{lost the}} Test {{series on the}} {{previous}} Saturday, the mid-week Lions came to Eden Park with <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> Refereed by New Zealander Steve Walsh, the match was marked by the Lions' inability to find touch and Auckland's willingness to attack and run the angles. Auckland gave up some guaranteed points from early penalties to take the Lions on in set piece play. Auckland tighthead prop John Afoa was denied a try after a tap and run saw him held up in goal. A series of handling errors throughout the first half let Auckland down and saw the Lions to a 14–3 lead at the half. The second half saw the Lions give away points to a stoic Auckland pack and the scoreline was narrowed to 14–13 Lions lead. A late Ronan O'Gara penalty saw the Lions extend to a 4-point winning margin of 17–13. This victory completed an impressive clean sweep of matches for the mid week Lions against host Unions throughout New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. But I know it exists." [...] The show was not acclaimed: Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said it was [...] "too cartoonish to work." [...] Appel then wrote {{and worked as a}} co-executive producer on The Bernie Mac Show and Kitchen Confidential, and appeared as Josh in the 2004 film I ♥ Huckabees.|$|E

500|$|The {{youngest}} {{sister of}} the [...] "precious Jackson clan", Janet Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael {{and the rest of}} the Jackson family. Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that [...] "he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys." [...] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, [...] "or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a [...] "superstar" [...] in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while [...] "successfully [...] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult." [...] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the [...] "Queen of Pop". Klein argued that [...] "stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.".|$|E

Clarett is hungry and has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove.</b> He has a chip on his shoulder and wants to show he can still play." [...] However, Clarett never signed with the Stampede. In an interview with the Columbus Dispatch published on August 10, 2006, Terry claimed that Clarett attempted to call him just minutes before the events on the morning of August 9 that led to Clarett's arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{returned}} to the UK from the United States in August 1976, Slade found themselves out-of-favour {{at the time of}} the UK's Punk rock explosion. The band's 1977 album Whatever Happened to Slade proved a commercial failure while their tour that spring had shown that they could no longer fill large venues. Slade's waning success soon led to the band taking any gig they could. They found themselves playing small venues, mainly universities and clubs. The band's tours often ran at a loss, with the band having to bring their own PA and lightshow. Bassist Jim Lea however was unphazed. [...] "I still thought the band was great," [...] he told Chris Charlesworth in 1983, [...] "We were playing as well if not better than we ever had... now we had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E

After writing the little note to Nedda, he hurried to the station and found a train about to start. To see and talk with the laborers; <b>to</b> do <b>something,</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that this tragic companion had no real existence! He went first to the Gaunts' cottage.
