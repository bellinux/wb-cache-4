40|$|This {{pilot study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} and examine an instrument that integrates relevant aspects of cross-sectoral (in- and outpatients) mental health care, is simply to use and shows satisfactory psychometric properties. The development of the scale comprised literature research, held 14 focus groups and 12 interviews with patients and health care providers, item-pool generation, content validation by a <b>scientific</b> <b>expert</b> <b>panel,</b> and face validation by 90 patients. The preliminary scale was tested on 385 patients across seven German hospitals with cross-sectoral mental health care (CSMHC) {{as part of their}} treatment program. Psychometric properties of the scale were evaluated using genuine and transformed data scoring. To check reliability and postdictive validity of the scale, Cronbach’s α coefficient and multivariable linear regression were used. This development process {{led to the development of}} an 18 -item scale called the “Scale for Evaluation of Psychiatric Integrative and Continuous Care (SEPICC) ” with a two-point and five-point response options. The scale consists of two sections. The first section assesses the presence or absence of patients’ experiences with various CSMHC’ relevant components such as home treatment, flexibility of treatments’ switching, case management, continuity of care, cross-sectoral therapeutic groups, and multidisciplinary teams. The second section evaluates the patients’ opinions about these relevant components. Using raw and transformed scoring resulted into comparable results. However, data distribution using transformed scoring showed a smaller deviation from normality. For the overall scale, the Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0. 82. Self-reported experiences with relevant components of the CSMHC were positively associated with the patients approval of these components. In conclusion, the new scale provides a good starting point for further validation. It can be used as a tool to evaluate CSMHC. Methodologically, using transformed data scoring appeared to be preferable because of a smaller deviation from normality and a higher reliability measured by Cronbach’s α...|$|E

40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome (MS) represents {{a cluster of}} cardiovascular (CV) risk factors associated to CV disease and type 2 diabetes. It is still under debate whether MS is a mere aggregation of risk factors or it represents a clinical entity with visceral obesity as underlying pathophysiological trigger. The publication of several diagnostic criteria of MS by <b>scientific</b> associations or <b>experts</b> <b>panels</b> reflects this uncertainty in understanding the real nature of MS. Besides the metabolic disturbances of MS, as visceral obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, hypertension and hyperglycemia, novel mechanisms of arterial damage have been identified. This paper reviews the evidence showing that MS and MS factors are characterized by increased oxidative stress, a relevant factor contributing {{to the development of}} metabolic and cardiovascular complications.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Within {{the past}} 3 years, four major {{evaluations}} of bisphenol A (BPA) safety have been undertaken. However, these assessments {{have arrived at}} quite different conclusions regarding the safety of BPA at current human exposure levels. OBJECTIVES: We compared the reasons provided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) BPA risk assessment panel for their conclusion that human exposures are negligible with the conclusions reached by the other panels, with all panels having the same body of literature at their disposal. DISCUSSION: The EFSA panel dismissed 3 ̆e or = 80 biomonitoring studies that documented significant levels of BPA exposure in humans, including internal exposures to unconjugated BPA, {{on the basis that}} they did not match a model of BPA metabolism. Instead, the EFSA panel relied on two toxicokinetic studies-conducted in 15 adults administered BPA-to draw conclusions about exposure levels in the population, including exposures of neonates. CONCLUSIONS: As with all exposure assessments, models should be developed to explain actual data that are collected. In the case of BPA, samples from a large number of human subjects clearly indicate that humans are internally exposed to unconjugated BPA. The dismissal of these biomonitoring studies simply because their results do not conform to a model violates <b>scientific</b> principles. <b>Expert</b> <b>panels</b> should evaluate all data-including human biomonitoring studies-to make informed risk assessments...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the term}} “whole grain” is well defined, {{there has been}} no {{universal}} standard of what constitutes a “whole-grain food,” creating challenges for researchers, the food industry, regulatory authorities, and consumers around the world. As part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the U. S. Dietary Guidelines Technical Advisory Committee issued a call to action to develop definitions for whole-grain foods that could be universally accepted and applied to dietary recommendations and planning. The Committee’s call to action, and the lack of a global whole-grain food definition, was the impetus for theWhole Grain Roundtable held 3 – 5 December 2012 in Chicago, Illinois. The objective was to develop a whole-grain food definition that is consistent with the quartet of needs of science, food product formulation, consumer behavior, and label education. The roundtable’s <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> represented a broad range of expertise from the United States and Europe, including epidemiology and dietary intervention researchers, consumer educators, government policy makers, and food and nutrition scientists from academia and the grain food industry. Taking into account the totality, quality, and consistency of available <b>scientific</b> evidence, the <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> recommended that 8 g of whole grain/ 30 g serving (27 g/ 100 g), without a fiber requirement, be considered a minimum content of whole grains that is nutritionally meaningful and that a food providing at least 8 g of whole grains/ 30 -g serving be defined as a whole-grain food. Having an established whole-grain food definition will encourage manufacturers to produce foods with meaningful amounts of whole grain, allow consistent product labeling and messaging, and empower consumers to readily identify whole-grain foods and achieve whole-grain dietary recommendations...|$|R

40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{of genetically engineered}} plants (GEP) increased worldwide during the last 10 years, up to about 100 million ha yearly. Soybean, maize, rapeseed, and cotton are the predominant crops. These plants, the so-called first generation GEP, are characterized by input traits such as tolerance to pesticides or herbicides, or resistance against insects. They are considered substantially equivalent to their isogenic counterparts {{because they do not}} exhibit substantial differences in their composition or their nutritional value. Second generation GEP are characterized by their output traits, such as an increase in valuable compounds (nutrient precursors, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, enzymes, etc.), an improved availability of nutrients, or a decreased concentration of undesirable substances (e. g., phytate, lignin, allergenic substances, etc.). Nutritional and safety assessment of second generation GEP presents a formidable challenge for animal nutritionists. This article reviews the nutritional and safety assessment of feeds from first generation GEP, and comments on the parameters for assessing second generation GEP. Feeds from GEP with input traits (first generation) Most GEP currently under cultivation are first generation, i. e., varieties without substantial changes in composition or nutritive value.

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians 2 ̆ 7 Report and {{proposals}} {{from the perspective}} of constitutional theory. Introduction In January 2012, the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians (‘Expert Panel’) delivered its report to the then Prime Minister making a number of recommendations to amend the Australian Constitution to ‘recognise’ Indigenous Australians. Rather than engage in a legal critique of the substance of the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> various proposals, this article approaches the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> Report and proposals as a whole {{from the perspective of}} constitutional theory. It argues that the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> Report and proposals strongly reflect the constitutional theory of the American constitutional theorist Jack Balkin. In his book Living Originalism, Balkin conceives of the United States Constitution functioning not only as ‘basic law’, distributing powers and setting up institutions of government, but also as ‘higher law’, embodying values and aspirations for the nation, and as ‘our law’, helping to constitute the people of the nation as a people. The first claim made in this article is that the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> conceives of the functions of the Australian Constitution {{in much the same way}} as Balkin conceives of the functions of the United States Constitution. The article makes a second claim. For Balkin, a constitution successfully functioning as basic law gives it procedural legitimacy whilst its success in functioning as higher law and our law gives it moral and sociological legitimacy respectively. Whilst the Australian Constitution does not really function as higher law or our law in Balkin’s sense, the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> adoption of that kind of thinking can be seen as a critique of the legitimacy of the Australian Constitution. The <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> implicitly suggests that the Australian Constitution can be made more legitimate. The article also makes a third claim building upon the first two. It is argued that the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> is engaged in a project of constitutional redemption, a concept that features heavily in Living Originalism and which is the principal subject of its companion work Constitutional Redemption: Political Faith in an Unjust World. This article begins by setting out the background to the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> Report and notes its various proposals for amendments to the Australian Constitution. The article then turns to the first main claim. It explains Balkin’s tripartite view of constitutional functions and explores how the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> report and recommendations appear to be based on a view of the Australian Constitution as higher law and as our law. The article then turns to the second main claim, explaining how it is difficult to accept that the Australian Constitution functions as higher law and our law in Balkin’s sense and showing how the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel’s</b> adoption of that thinking offers a critique of the legitimacy of the Australian Constitution. The article then turns to the third main claim and explores how the <b>Expert</b> <b>Panel</b> appears to be engaged in a project of constitutional redemption. The article concludes with a reference to The Castle and ‘the vibe’ and suggests that it is possible that the Australian people may one day look to the Australian Constitution as higher law and our law...|$|R
