The direction of alternating current is such that it creates a north pole at the top and a south pole at the bottom. The direction of induced emf is given by Lenz's law, according to which the direction of induced emf opposes the cause producing it. The induced emf induces current in the armature conductors and the direction of the induced current depends on the position of the brushes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new outer-rotor stator-doubly-fed doubly-salient permanent-magnet (SDF-DSPM) machine, {{which can be}} used as the integrated starter-generator for modern automobiles and mild hybrid electric vehicles. The key of the proposed machine is to incorporate both dc field windings and PMs in the inner stator, hence, offering a compact arrangement of hybrid field excitations. While armature windings are located in <b>salient</b> <b>poles</b> of the outer stator, the outer rotor is simply composed of <b>salient</b> <b>poles</b> without windings or PMs. In addition, an air bridge is purposely created in shunt with each PM in the inner stator, hence, providing an amplification effect for flux regulation. With this idea, the air-gap flux can be strengthened or weakened with a small dc field current so that the electromagnetic torque and induced electromotive force (EMF) can be effectively regulated. The newly designed SDF-DSPM machine is analyzed by using both the magnetic circuit model and finite element method, and assessed by performance simulation. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5000|$|The SRM has {{wound field}} coils as in a DC motor for the stator windings. The rotor however has no magnets or coils attached. It {{is a solid}} salient-pole rotor (having {{projecting}} magnetic poles) made of soft magnetic material (often laminated-steel). When power {{is applied to the}} stator windings, the rotor's magnetic reluctance creates a force that attempts to align the rotor pole with the nearest stator pole. In order to maintain rotation, an electronic control system switches on the windings of successive stator poles in sequence so that the magnetic field of the stator [...] "leads" [...] the rotor pole, pulling it forward. Rather than using a troublesome high-maintenance mechanical commutator to switch the winding current as in traditional motors, the switched-reluctance motor uses an electronic position sensor to determine the angle of the rotor shaft and solid state electronics to switch the stator windings, which also offers the opportunity for dynamic control of pulse timing and shaping. This differs from the apparently similar induction motor which also has windings that are energised in a rotating phased sequence, in that the magnetization of the rotor is static (a <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> that is made 'North' remains so as the motor rotates) while an induction motor has slip, and rotates at slightly less than synchronous speed. This absence of slip makes it possible to know the rotor position exactly, and the motor can be stepped arbitrarily slowly.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Electric and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{critical}} evaluation of the torque performance of the optimum designed reluctance DC machine (RDCM). The thesis focuses on multi-phase RDCM drives with normal laminated <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotors allowing for high power and high-speed applications. An RDCM is a normal reluctance synchronous machine (RSM) but with direct control of flux and torque just as in brush DC machines. Flux and torque of the RDCM are controlled directly {{by the use of}} special phase current waveforms. Specific attention is given in the thesis for the selection of the best current waveform for the RDCM allowing for smooth rotating airgap MMF and less ripple torque. The absolute optimum designed RDCM can best be obtained by the use of the finite element (FE) method in the design optimisation process. In this thesis a multi-dimensional FE based design optimisation method for the optimum design of the current controlled RDCM is implemented. To compare the torque performance of the RDCM with other RSMs the torque performances of optimum designed 3 -phase, 5 -phase and 5 -phase with the injection of third harmonic current RSMs are performed under the same copper losses and stack volume. The torque performances of RSMs are done with both <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor and the round rotor with internal flux barriers. The armature reaction effect of 6 -phase RDCMs is also investigated in detail by considering three different rotor structures. These rotor structures are the standard <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor, the <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor with slitted poles and the <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor with chamfered poles. It was shown that the RDCM with the <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotor has a severe armature reaction effect, which can be reduced by slitted or chamfered <b>salient</b> <b>pole</b> rotors. A per-phase equivalent circuit model of the 6 -phase RDCM is also proposed in this thesis. The torque of the machine is calculated based on the per-phase equivalent model and compared with the torque calculated by the FE Maxwell stress tensor method. There is a good agreement between these calculated torques. This thesis shows that the implemented FE based optimisation method can be applied with success to optimally design current controlled RDCMs. It was found, amongst other things, that the torque performance of the optimum designed 6 -phase RDCM is slightly higher than that of the optimum designed 5 -phase RSM with the injection of 3 rd harmonic currents and with the same copper losses and stack volume. The analytical and FE calculated results are confirmed by measured results on a 35 kW 6 -phase RDCM drive...|$|E
