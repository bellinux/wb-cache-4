Distinguished for his researches in Organic Chemistry, and especially in the section of this subject which comprises vegetable <b>colouring</b> <b>matters.</b> The results of these researches are published in upwards of 60 papers in the 'Journal of the Chemical Society.' Partly in conjunction with the late Prof J J Hummel he investigated Chay Root, Rubia Sikkimensis, and other similar plants, and succeeded in isolating and clearly proving the constitution of the Anthracene derivatives which they contain. His researches on Mang-kondu, Ventilago madraspatana , and many other plants largely used in India, Java, and elsewhere, on account of their valuable dyeing properties, have not only made us acquainted with the dyeing principles contained in these plants, but their chemical investigation has, in nearly all cases, led to a clear conception of their constitution. During the course of his researches on luteolin, morin, apinin, quercitin, and other flavone compounds, he discovered and investigated curious compounds which such dyestuffs forms with acids. This work has afforded a valuable means of determining the molecular weight of such substances. In another paper he has described a new behaviour of <b>colouring</b> <b>matters,</b> which consists in their forming crystalline potassium salts when treated with potassium acetate. As only <b>colouring</b> <b>matters</b> which contain two hydroxyls relatively in the other position show this behaviour, the test affords further means of determining constitution. His researches include the investigation of the valuable compounds which <b>colouring</b> <b>matters</b> and other substances form with Diazobenzine chloride and the careful examination of the glucosides, tannins, Catechus, and similar compounds closely allied to the natural <b>colouring</b> <b>matters.</b> He has also published important investigations on Resorcylic Acid and its derivatives, on haematein and brazilein, on Kamala, purpurogallin, etc, etc." ...|$|R

50|$|Colours vary {{considerably}} in composition. Most of them contain {{all the elements}} necessary for direct production and fixation.

30|$|The {{bleaching}} process is applied after degumming and neutralization in the chemical refining {{and it is}} more appropriately referred to as adsorption treatment. Crude edible oil still contains undesirable substances such as FFA, gummy materials and <b>colouring</b> <b>matters.</b> <b>Colouring</b> <b>matters</b> are due {{to the presence of}} pigments in the crude edible oil. These pigments are carotenoids, chlorophyll, gossypol and related compounds. These impurities from crude oils are removed by using the materials with a strong adsorption power. The usual method of bleaching is the adsorption of the colouring substances on an adsorbent material. Refiners have a wide choice of adsorbents for using and their main criteria are cost and performance of the adsorbent materials. Examples of bleaching agents are natural bleaching earth, acid-activated bleaching earth, synthetic silicates, synthetic resins and activated carbons. Bleaching agents normally possess a large surface that has a more or less specific affinity for pigment-type molecules, thus removing them from oil without damaging the oil itself. Acid-activated bleaching earth is sometimes called bentonite; it is the adsorbent material that has been used most extensively. This substance consists primarily of hydrated aluminium silicate. Usually, bleaching earth does not remove all the colour-producing materials; the majority of them are actually removed by thermal destruction during the deodorization process. Anhydrous silica gel and activated carbon are also used as bleaching adsorbents [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].|$|R
