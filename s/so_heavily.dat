5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy {{has been}} <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> modified for flight, and immediate transitional fossil predecessors have {{not so far}} been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{important}} to the local economy with spending generating over £53,000,000 GVA, Christchurch is not <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours. Tourism's contribution to the local economy is about 9% compared to 18% for Weymouth and Portland, 15% for Purbeck and 12% for Bournemouth. Visitor accommodation consists of 11 caravan and camping parks and some 900 bed spaces in eight hotels and 75 guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E
5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to do}} this effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region <b>so</b> <b>heavily.</b>|$|E

5|$|It was {{the subject}} of a 60 Minutes segment, in which Jacobson told Mike Wallace, after pausing for several seconds and looking downward, that he broke down and ordered Boys Who Love Boys because he wanted to see just what it was that he was being <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> {{solicited}} to buy. A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E
5|$|The few {{species of}} demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with no hard {{elements}} {{have been used}} by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been overfished <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. Dolphins have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} species of Siricidae, the Sirex {{woodwasp}} can damage relatively healthy trees <b>so</b> <b>heavily,</b> they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need healthy wood, the Sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested.|$|E

5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse {{is associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of the}} Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
50|$|In {{statistical}} hypothesis testing, p-rep or prep {{has been proposed}} as a statistical alternative to the classic p-value. Whereas a p-value is the probability of obtaining a result under the null hypothesis, p-rep computes the probability of replicating an effect. Whether it does <b>so</b> is <b>heavily</b> disputed - {{some have argued that}} the concept rests on a mathematical falsehood.|$|R
50|$|Piston-engined petrol {{military}} aircraft used water injection technology prior to World War II to increase takeoff power. This was used <b>so</b> that <b>heavily</b> laden fighters could {{take off from}} shorter runways, climb faster, and quickly reach high altitudes to intercept enemy bomber formations. Some fighter aircraft also used water injection for a boost in short bursts during dogfights.|$|R
5000|$|The bridge's {{original}} construction {{date was}} estimated to be sometime in the 1830s. At one time, an attempt to strengthen the bridge was made by doubling the trusses, <b>so</b> that <b>heavily</b> laden trucks could pass over the bridge; this was deemed ineffective, and the change was eventually reversed. [...] The bridge was completely rebuilt in 1989.|$|R
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1948, No.23 Squadron was redesignated No. 6 Squadron. The {{unit was}} based at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland and {{equipped}} with Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. No 6 Squadron formed part of No.82 Wing, and was {{primarily responsible for}} training aircrews to serve with the wing's two front line units; No.1 and No.2 Squadrons. Its training effort was increased from 1950 when No.1 Squadron was deployed to Malaya as part of Australia's contribution to the Malayan Emergency. During October that year three of No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were deliberately flown through the cloud which resulted from the first British atomic bomb test (Operation Hurricane) {{which took place in}} the Montebello Islands off Western Australian. These aircraft had the role of determining the level of radioactivity caused by the atomic blast, and No.6 Squadron performed similar duties for the subsequent British atomic bomb tests at Maralinga, South Australia. Several Lincolns were <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> contaminated with radioactivity during these flights that they could not be flown again. The squadron lost three Lincolns in one day on 8 April 1953 when one was written off after its undercarriage collapsed while landing at Amberley and a further two were destroyed when they collided on the ground at Cloncurry, Queensland; no aircrew were injured in these accidents.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{received}} the nickname [...] "Lust in the Dust", which eventually became {{the name of}} another movie. A scene in which Pearl does a seductive dance for Lewton was cut from the film before it was released.

25|$|The {{disaster}} {{site was}} <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> contaminated with benzene that firefighters and investigators {{in the first}} month worked in fifteen-minute shifts due to heat and toxic conditions. The waterfront at Veteran's Park and the town marina were contaminated by hydrocarbons, which were contained by a series of booms.

25|$|There is an {{area where}} Nanban is used {{exclusively}} to refer to a certain style, and that is cooking and the names of dishes. Nanban dishes are not American or European, but an odd variety not using soy sauce or miso but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese Goan cuisine. Some of these dishes resemble Southeast Asian cuisines but are <b>so</b> <b>heavily</b> changed to fit Japanese tastes like ramen that they should be considered separate.|$|E
