5|$|Inside the LBC, {{visitors}} {{pass through}} a number of exhibits about the bell before reaching the Liberty Bell itself. Due to security concerns following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a <b>security</b> <b>screening.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ferries, which {{depart from}} Liberty State Park in Jersey City and Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, also stop at Ellis Island {{when it is}} open to the public, making a {{combined}} trip possible. All ferry riders are subject to <b>security</b> <b>screening,</b> similar to airport procedures, prior to boarding. Visitors intending to enter the statue's base and pedestal must obtain a complimentary museum/pedestal ticket along with their ferry ticket. Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue to the crown purchase a special ticket, which may be reserved up to a year in advance. A total of 240 people per day are permitted to ascend: ten per group, three groups per hour. Climbers may bring only medication and cameras—lockers are provided for other items—and must undergo a second <b>security</b> <b>screening.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor <b>security</b> <b>screening</b> center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Security</b> <b>screen</b> doors add {{a second}} set of hinges or locks to defeat before access to a {{structure}} can be granted. If the intention is to keep thieves out, or keep disturbed individuals in, this is a better solution. <b>Security</b> <b>screen</b> doors also make it possible to open the main door, and communicate with those outside. Some even have mail slots. As an added benefit, <b>security</b> <b>screen</b> doors can allow the door to be opened, and provide for secure ventilation. The main downside is the cost, which is generally about as much as a regular door, and locks are usually sold separately. Installation can also be difficult, as the doorknobs of the two doors may interfere with each other, and the screen material usually interferes with any peephole devices on the door.|$|R
5|$|International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air {{states that}} {{provided}} that pressure in diving cylinders {{is less than}} , these can be carried as checked in or carry-on baggage. It maybe necessary to empty the cylinder to verify this. Once emptied, the cylinder valve should be closed to prevent moisture entering the cylinder. Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of some items permitted by ICAO, and airlines and <b>security</b> <b>screening</b> agencies {{have the right to}} refuse the carriage of certain items.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) {{operates}} an A-Star helicopter at the airport, {{while the}} BC Forest Service occasionally uses the airfield with their helicopters. It maintains an aircraft maintenance centre, while aircraft parts are sold by Inland Communications, Mountainaire Services, Progressive Air Services, Pro Aero Engines, Spring Aviation and Westcan Aircraft Sales & Salvage. Meanwhile, packages {{can be delivered}} through FedEx at the Kamloops Airport, while custom and security services are provided by Canada Border Services Agency and Garda <b>Security</b> <b>Screening.</b> There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Kamloops Airport which is used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system is owned by Nav Canada, which operate an {{air traffic control system}} at it. The Airside Business Park and Fulton Industrial Park are the airport's development areas.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{a three-story}} {{observation}} deck, located on floors 100–102, {{in addition to}} existing broadcast and antenna facilities. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors are separated from the tenants, having their own separate entrance next to the museum, descending down to a below-ground <b>security</b> <b>screening</b> area. On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, {{but there is a}} food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor. To show visitors the city, and give them information and stories about New York, an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors. The admission fee is $32 per person, but admission discounts are available for children and seniors, and the deck is free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims. When it opens, the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year. Tickets went on sale starting on April 8. However, the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck. It officially opened on May 28, 2015, one day ahead of schedule.|$|E
