25|$|In {{the first}} {{electronic}} keyboards {{in the early}} 1970s, the key switches were individual switches inserted into holes in metal frames. These keyboards cost from 80 to 120USD and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were reed switches (contacts enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the <b>switch</b> <b>plunger).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation {{introduced}} keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of {{the first}} keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the <b>switch</b> <b>plunger,</b> and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other [...] "solid-state switch" [...] keyboards such as inductive and Hall-effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved, and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer.|$|E

2500|$|Plastic {{materials}} {{played a}} very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until [...] "monoblocks" [...] came along, GE's [...] "self-lubricating" [...] Delrin was the only plastic material for keyboard <b>switch</b> <b>plungers</b> that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling <b>switch</b> <b>plungers</b> was undesirable because it would attract dirt over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key plungers and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But Delrin was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use ABS plastic. [...] However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75mm to 2.79mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monolocks also made of ABS.|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{to prevent}} {{access to the}} inside of an {{electric}} kiln while it is operating, a trapped key system may be used to interlock a disconnecting switch and the kiln door. Whenever the kiln power switch is turned on, the key is automatically held by the interlock, and cannot be manually removed. In order to open the kiln door, the power switch must first be turned off, which releases the key and allows it to be removed from the interlock. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the <b>switch</b> interlock, a <b>plunger</b> from the interlock mechanically prevents the power switch from being turned on. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the power switch interlock. A similar two-part interlock system can be used anywhere it is necessary to ensure the energy supply to a machine is interrupted before the machine is entered for adjustment or maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] "Trapped Key" [...] as it works by {{releasing}} and trapping keys in a predetermined sequence. After the control or {{power has been}} isolated, a key is released {{that can be used}} to grant access to individual or multiple doors. For example, to prevent access to the inside of an electric kiln, a trapped key system may be used to interlock a disconnecting switch and the kiln door. While the switch is turned on, the key is held by the interlock attached to the disconnecting switch. To open the kiln door, the switch is first opened, which releases the key. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the <b>switch</b> interlock, a <b>plunger</b> from the interlock mechanically prevents the switch from closing. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the disconnecting switch interlock.

5000|$|The Tyer's no. 7 tablet {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a wooden case, on top {{of which is a}} metal slide, a <b>switch</b> <b>plunger,</b> a bell plunger and an electric current indicator. On the front is an indicator which may show either of three indications: [...] "Line Closed"; [...] "Train Approaching" [...] and [...] "Train on Line". Below this there is a second slide, which has three positions: fully home, withdrawn half way, and fully withdrawn. The three indications correspond to the three positions of the slide. The case contains several tablets; they are removed from the instrument using the bottom slide, and replaced using the top slide. The instrument was so constructed that if a tablet had been withdrawn from either instrument of a pair, no further tablets could be withdrawn until the withdrawn tablet had been placed either in the other instrument, or in the same instrument from which it had been withdrawn.|$|E
