40|$|Even if {{parts of}} a {{chemical}} process are well known and can be described precisely, describing a complete chemical plant is a difficult task. In this paper a steel plant is modeled {{that can be seen}} as a nonlinear MIMO system. The control of the plant is currently based on human experience. A model of the plant is asked in order to optimize the steel quality and plant throughput. The problems that have to be overcome are a limited number of measurement samples, low accuracy and a high uncertainty. Different Neural Network models are described in order to make an optimal use of the given measurements. Two novel techniques are used in this paper. First an optimal plant model is assumed based on the results of a large number of NN models and early stopping. <b>Second</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> for optimization of the plant is given by introducing a novel method that uses Variance Backpropagation of the controlled output to obtain the input variances that can influence the product quality.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{optimization}} proposal in the automated guided vehicles design used in hospital logistics, as well as to analyze the impact of its implementation in a real environment. This proposal is based on the design of those elements that would allow the vehicles to deliver an extra cart by the towing method. So, the proposal intention is to improve the productivity and the performance of the current vehicles by using a transportation method of combined carts. The study has been developed following concurrent engineering premises from three different viewpoints. First, the sequence of operations has been described, and <b>second,</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> of design of the equipment has been undertaken. Finally, the impact of the proposal has been analyzed according to real data from the Hospital Universitario Rio Hortega in Valladolid (Spain). In this particular case, by the implementation of the analyzed proposal in the hospital a reduction of over 35 % of the current time of use can be achieved. This result may allow adding new tasks to the vehicles, and according to this, both a new kind of vehicle and a specific module can be developed in order to get a better performance...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{focus of}} my work was to recall various Management, Marketing, Finance, and Sports Management skills I have learned at Northern Illinois University. Beyond merely recalling these skills I utilize them to propose and analyze the {{requirements}} for opening a physical fitness center. My work {{can be divided into}} two parts, the first one an analysis of the industry and the <b>second,</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> of a Strategic Business Plan for a specific facility. In the first part I analyzed the Exercise Salon and Health Club industry. For example, the industry's forces, competitive structure, and investment requirements. I looked at the present industry position and also made some speculations about the future. This growing, customer oriented industry has a bright future for someone who is willing to grow and adapt to the environment. In the second part, a Strategic Business Plan was developed. Since this plan is specific for a particular facility a general plan was developed that would then need to be adapted to a site. A strategic Business Plan involves steps such as setting goals and objectives, allocating resources, and creating an organization design. All of these steps require educated decisions to be made on behalf of the owner and management. In preparing this capstone I was able to turn the business and sports theories I have learned into a working model of the requirements for starting my own facility, which is something I aspire to do in the future.

40|$|New {{imputation}} algorithms for estimating {{missing values}} in compositional data are introduced. <b>A</b> first <b>proposal</b> uses the k-nearest neighbor procedure {{based on the}} Aitchison distance, a distance measure especially designed for compositional data. It is important to adjust the estimated missing values to the overall size of the compositional parts of the neighbors. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>an</b> iterative model-based imputation technique is introduced which initially starts from {{the result of the}} proposed k-nearest neighbor procedure. The method is based on iterative regressions, thereby accounting for the whole multivariate data information. The regressions have to be performed in a transformed space, and depending on the data quality classical or robust regression techniques can be employed. The proposed methods are tested on a real and on simulated data sets. The results show that the proposed methods outperform standard imputation methods. In the presence of outliers, the model-based method with robust regressions is preferable. ...|$|R
