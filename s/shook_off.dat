5|$|Against the Chicago Bulls in {{the first}} round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> a few {{injuries}} that scared Heat fans, including a severely bruised hip in Game 5. Returning late in the half, Wade resurrected his team by scoring 15 of his 28 points while suffering from intense pain, leading the Heat to the much-needed 3–2 series lead. After this, Wade successfully led his team to the 2006 NBA Finals, despite suffering from flu-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons. He put up a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists in that game, including an 8-point flurry to close out the third quarter that put the game out of reach.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the fifteenth stage was moved ahead from Bormio to Spondigna, because of snow {{covering}} the Stevio Pass, but the summit finish in Merano was maintained. As soon as the climb started, Bernard, Urs Zimmermann and Chioccioli attacked. Bernard eventually <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> the two riders and won the stage, but with minimal time gain. The sixteenth stage was marked by rain – which turned into snow as the peloton rose higher – and by two protests while climbing the Rombo Pass. Near {{the summit of the}} last climb, Hampsten and a few others formed an escape group that was eventually caught in the final kilometers. The group raced into Innsbruck, where Franco Vona made a last minute attack that won him the stage. Bernard – who was in sixth place overall at the {{start of the}} seventeenth stage – crashed in a tunnel but managed to finish the stage; however, the following day he did not start the leg and withdrew from the race.|$|E
25|$|During the {{troubles}} between the Abbasid Caliphate and the Umayyad Caliphate the local emirs <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> all {{allegiance to the}} caliphs and by the 10th century the region the Umayyad control was destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni. The Abbasids took this opportunity to {{set up their own}} government in Sindh. The Soomra dynasty ruled Sindh as the functionary of the Abbasid Caliphate until the Siege of Baghdad (1258). Mansurah was the capital of the Soomra Dynasty.|$|E

25|$|At Östersund, on June 10, Victory Tilly raced for {{the last}} time. Guided by Adielsson, he won the event Jämtlands Stora Pris for the fourth time. During the summer, he was again injured in a hind leg. In October, the gelding still had not <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> his problem. Stig H. Johansson and the owners decided to call it quits. The {{decision}} was made official on October 25. On December 30, Victory Tilly was honoured during a ceremony at Solvalla.|$|E
25|$|Louisville {{plays the}} role of {{newcomer}} to the Final Four by missing its first 13 shots. Over seven minutes into the game, Louisville has taken their second full timeout, has yet to hit a basket, and is losing 16-2. Louisville <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> the opening jitters and began scoring. Just after the final media timeout of the first half, two Angel McCoughtry free throws would cut the lead to six, but Oklahoma would outscore Louisville 10-4 to take a twelve-point lead into the half.|$|E
25|$|While the Boardmans and Ko Tha Byu were {{penetrating}} the jungles to the south, Judson <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> a paralyzing year-long siege of depression that overcame {{him after the}} death of his wife and set out alone on long canoe trips up the Salween River into the tiger-infested jungles to evangelize the northern Karen. Between trips, he worked unceasingly at his lifelong goal of translating the entire Bible into Burmese. When he finished it at last in 1834, he had been labouring on it for 24 years. It was printed and published in 1835.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he played}} for South Africa at U19 level, Trott is {{eligible}} to play for England {{as a result of}} his grandparents being English. Following a good season in 2007 he was selected in June 2007 for England's one day squad for the series against the West Indies. He was given the nickname Leon, after Marxist theorist Leon Trotsky by the England team. Trott <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> a hand injury and played in both Twenty20 Internationals against the West Indies but failed to contribute in double figures and the series ended 1–1.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs' {{first round}} playoff {{series with the}} Mavs was a {{breakout}} series for Hill. He was ineffective in Game 1, scoring 0 points in 17 minutes after coming back from an ankle injury. He <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> his tentativeness {{in the next few}} games, scoring 7 and 17 points in Games 2 and 3. Then, Hill led the Spurs to a Game 4 victory on a night when the Spurs' Big Three of Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili shot a combined 9-of-34 from the field. Hill scored a career playoff high 29 points, shooting 11-16 from the field and 5-6 from downtown. Hill averaged 22.3 points in the series, helping the Spurs to win the series in six games.|$|E
25|$|To Wellington's amazement, Clausel quickly rallied his beaten {{army and}} {{launched}} a raid in the north. On 13 August, the French general marched on Valladolid with 25,000 troops. In {{the face of this}} advance, Clinton fell back to Arévalo with 7,000 soldiers while José María Santocildes's Spanish corps abandoned Valladolid. Clausel sent his lieutenant Maximilien Sebastien Foy to rescue the trapped French garrisons. While the Spanish attackers concluded the Siege of Astorga before he could reach it, Foy rescued the garrisons of Toro and Zamora and reunited with Clausel at Valladolid on 4 September. Wellington and 21,000 troops rejoined Clinton at Arévalo on 3 September. The British army commander set out after Clausel, but that general easily <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> his pursuers and dashed out of reach, leaving a garrison of 2,000 men in Burgos. Wellington left Lieutenant General Rowland Hill to defend Madrid with 31,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 12,000 Spanish. This force included Wellington's three best divisions.|$|E

25|$|Vedel carried {{new orders}} from Madrid and Bayonne: Dupont was {{instructed}} to stop his march on Cádiz and fall back north-eastwards on the mountains (a fait accompli), watching the Spanish movements in Andalusia while awaiting the reinforcements to be released upon the capitulation of Zaragoza and Valencia. These capitulations never came. For a time Marshal Moncey was simply nowhere to be found; at length his defeat {{at the gates of}} Valencia surfaced; some 17,000 Spaniards under the Conde de Cervellón massed victoriously around that city as Moncey gave up in disgust, having lost 1,000 men in a vain attempt to storm the walls. Suddenly, all prospects evaporated of Moncey's corps pivoting west from Valencia toward Granada and coupling with Dupont in a two-pronged invasion of Andalusia. Nor were troops forthcoming from Aragon, as Zaragoza <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> repeated French assaults and vowed to fight to the death. Meanwhile, Savary set to work preparing for the arrival of Joseph in his new capital. Many of the scattered French formations were drawn back around Madrid for security; Dupont would remain close at hand to succour the capital if Bessières' campaign in the north took {{a turn for the worse}} and Spanish armies appeared on the horizon.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Canavan <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> his tag as 'the {{greatest}} player {{never to}} win an All-Ireland', captaining Tyrone to their first All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. As he approached the podium on Croke Park's Hogan Stand after the final, his nervousness was visible, and after being handed the trophy, he made an emotional speech about how he had to enviously watch other Ulster teams lift the Sam Maguire Cup, but [...] "to eventually win it is something else." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 1941, the German {{battleship}} [...] {{and heavy}} cruiser [...] began Operation Rheinübung by {{breaking into the}} Atlantic to raid shipping.

Ark Royal, Renown, and Sheffield—accompanied by , , , , , and —were dispatched to the Atlantic on 23 May to search for the battleship. On 26 May, a Swordfish from Ark Royal located Bismarck and began to shadow her, while the Home Fleet was mobilised to pursue.|$|E

500|$|Some Texas {{supporters}} blamed {{its lack}} of depth {{on the line for}} the loss. The Longhorns' passing game was considered satisfactory, going 10 of 31 for 125 yards with five interceptions (two for touchdowns), and some felt that any failure of the passing game could be blamed on the line play. According to Dallas sportswriter Joe Utay, Texas lost because of overconfidence. Blinkey Horn, sportswriter for The Tennessean, wrote: [...] "Vandy outcharged, outfought, and outgamed the boastful Texans. Their courage was finer. Their stamina was greater. Thrust into the throes of a Turkish bath day which blistered tongues and made legs weary the McGuginites <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> the galling heat and won a hellish battle on a hellish afternoon." ...|$|E
500|$|Until 1946, {{racehorses}} in England {{were allowed}} to race without an official name and the colt who would become Ladas was still unnamed when he made a successful debut on 31 May in the Woodcote Stakes at the Epsom Derby meeting. He showed impressive acceleration to easily beat the filly Mecca and was identified as [...] "a colt full of promise" [...] by one correspondent. He was then sent to Royal Ascot where he started 6/4 (1.5/1) favourite for the Coventry Stakes on 13 June. He led from the start on this occasion and <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> the opposition in the closing stages to win by {{one and a half}} lengths from a colt named Bullingdon.|$|E
500|$|On 27 March 1918, again near Tul Karem, Drummond {{and another}} pilot {{scrambled}} {{to attack a}} German scout. As his wingman dealt with the intruder, Drummond, flying a Nieuport, single-handedly engaged six other German aircraft that had suddenly appeared. After he had destroyed one and [...] "sent another down in a spin", Drummond developed engine trouble and had to land behind enemy lines. Finding his engine firing again, he took off before he could be captured by Turkish troops and gained a start over the four still-circling German scouts, [...] "who had also concluded that the fight was over". Drummond was forced to land three more times in enemy territory—once in a cavalry camp where he [...] "carried away a line full of washing" [...] with his undercarriage in his escape—before he <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> {{all but one of}} the pursuing fighters and landed safely behind Allied lines. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO for his [...] "gallant and successful" [...] actions.|$|E

500|$|Elisabeth Mahoney from The Guardian {{observed}} that Ruth and David's marriage imploded while Sophie was around {{and she said}} {{the speed at which}} it happened made for genuinely shocking listening. Mahoney said [...] "Felicity Finch and Tim Bentinck spat their toxic lines out with much relish, and for once emphatically <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> their characters' middle-of-the-road cosiness and golden couple status." [...] After seeking Sam out for comfort, Ruth kissed him. When Sam declared his love for Ruth, she agreed to spend the night with him at a hotel in Oxford. Ruth told David she was meeting an friend for the night. Tim Teeman from The Times commented that the moment Ruth became stuck in traffic contrasted with [...] "the scary new land she was travelling towards". Ruth's decision to spend the night with Sam was the focus of The Archers 15,000th episode, which was broadcast on 7 November 2006. The episode was written by Joanna Toye, who told Emily Lambert of the Western Mail that the traffic jam was used to increase the tension.|$|E
500|$|La Fleche won {{all four}} of her races as a two-year-old. She made her first {{appearance}} on 16 July at Newmarket in the Chesterfield Stakes, for which she started 6/4 favourite. Although she had not grown as much as {{might have been expected}} from her yearling days, she was reported to be deceptively powerful, being described by one observer as [...] "all wire and whipcord." [...] Ridden by George Barrett, she led from the start and <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> he rivals [...] "without an effort" [...] to win by two lengths, in an impressive time of 1:04.2. The third placed finisher, a colt called Bonavista (or Bona Vista), {{went on to win the}} following year's 2000 Guineas. On 29 July, La Fleche was sent to Goodwood for the five furlong Lavant Stakes in which she met Priestess, another filly whose sale price (£4,000) had attracted comment. La Fleche tracked Priestess, who set a strong pace, before moving ahead in the final furlong to win [...] "very cleverly" [...] by a length. Two days later, she reappeared at the same course for the Molecomb Stakes and recorded another easy win, beating Adoration by one and a half lengths. At Doncaster in September she won the Champagne Stakes to take her earnings for the year to £3,415.|$|E
500|$|Early on 25 May, Bismarck doubled back {{past her}} pursuers {{in a wide}} circle. The {{manoeuvre}} successfully <b>shook</b> <b>off</b> the British ships, which turned west {{in an attempt to}} find the ship. Despite the manoeuvre, Admiral Lütjens was unaware that he had evaded the British, and so sent a series of radio transmissions, which were intercepted by the British and used to gain a rough fix on his position. Due to the damage his ship had sustained, Lütjens decided to head for occupied France rather than continue his mission. On the morning of 26 May, a Coastal Command PBY Catalina flying boat spotted Bismarck [...] to the north-west of Brest; she was steaming at a speed that would put her under the protective umbrella of German aircraft and U-boats within 24hours. The only British forces close enough to slow her down were the aircraft carrier [...] and her escort, the battlecruiser [...] At approximately 20:30, a flight of fifteen Ark Royals 820 Naval Air Squadrons Swordfish torpedo bombers launched an attack on Bismarck. Three torpedoes were believed to have struck the ship; the first two torpedoes failed to do serious damage to the ship, but the third hit jammed Bismarcks rudders hard to starboard. The damage could not be repaired, and the battleship began turning in a large circle, back towards her pursuers.|$|E
