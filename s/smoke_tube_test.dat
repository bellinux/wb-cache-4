On May 9, an initial evaluation of the 4 -story Courthouse building was conducted. On the first visit, a meeting was held with county administrators, an environmental consulting firm, affected employees, and supervisors of affected employees. Completed questionnaires from employees in the building were collected and reviewed {{between the first and}} second visits. Responses were received from 47 % of the building occupants. Workers in the building started reporting problems in 1984 after a major building expansion was completed. The major complaints, other than comfort-related, were about itchy eyes and stuffy/runny nose. A thorough visual inspection of the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units serving the building was conducted. Also, carbon dioxide (CO 2), temperature, relative humidity, and <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted to evaluate efficiency of the HVAC systems. Selected employees from throughout the building were interviewed. A second visit was conducted on June 6, 1991, where additional CO 2, temperature, and humidity measurements were made alon...|$|R

This paper studies heat transfer coefficient of water-cooled furnace smoke pipe at different flow rate and flue gas temperature though a established water-cooled furnace smoke pipe test bed.

50|$|In {{infectious}} disease control a smoke test {{is done to}} see whether a room is under negative pressure. A <b>tube</b> containing <b>smoke</b> is held {{near the bottom of}} the negative pressure room door, about two inches in front of the door.

40|$|This Bureau of Mines {{investigation}} addressed {{two primary}} issues of air velocity measurement in mines: the determination {{and use of}} correction factors, {{and the development of}} guidelines for the selection of a suitable site at which the measurements should be taken. Other facets of the investigation included a comparison of measurement methods and devices, and aircourse cross-sectional area measurement. The study consisted of theoretical, laboratory, and in- mine investigations. The measurement devices included in the experimental phase were vane anemometer, vortex shedding anemometer, a prototype thermoanemometer, <b>smoke</b> <b>tube,</b> and oil of wintergreen sprayer. The measurement methods included single-point centerline, timed-point traverse, continuous traverse for the anemometers, and various distances and cloud positions for the <b>smoke</b> <b>tube</b> and oil of wintergreen devices. The study resulted in guidelines for measurement site selection that are applicable to most in-mine situations. It also showed that the use of correction factors is problematic. There are many potential pitfalls and there are cogent arguments against using certain correction factors. However, generalized correction factors were developed that can be successfully applied in routine ventilation work, provided that their use is properly understood.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 6 years, a revised {{classification}} of the streptococci and enterococci, {{based primarily on}} molecular techniques such as 16 S rRNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization, emerged. However, little attention was placed on routine physiological tests {{that could be used}} in food and clinical laboratories to differentiate between species of a new genus, Enterococcus, and fecal Streptococcus spp. The purpose of this study was to devise a convenient and reliable system to identify enterococci and fecal streptococci by using conventional procedures. Fifty-nine strains of 13 Enterococcus spp., including the type strains and many strains used by previous investigators, were characterized by using conventional <b>tube</b> <b>tests,</b> the API Rapid Strep system, and MicroScan Pos ID panels. Results were compared with each other and with previously published results. A comparison of conventional <b>tube</b> <b>tests</b> versus published <b>tube</b> <b>test</b> results yielded 17 discrepancies. Although not all tests were done with each of the three systems, 28 discrepancies between results obtained with the API system and those obtained with conventional <b>tube</b> <b>tests</b> were found. There were 24 discrepancies between results obtained with the MicroScan Pos ID panel and those obtained with conventional <b>tube</b> <b>tests.</b> There were 12 discrepancies between the results with the API Rapid Strep system and those with the MicroScan Pos ID panels.
