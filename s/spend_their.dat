5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Female {{elephants}} <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> {{entire lives}} in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which}} are made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E

5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, but most {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably {{an attempt by the}} birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.|$|E
