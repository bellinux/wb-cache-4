500|$|Entirely amateur, {{the team}} mostly {{comprised}} players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer Duncan Fletcher. Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee {{who had played}} for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor. The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital Lusaka and then to Luanda in Angola, from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. [...] "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. [...] "There were no seats, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes {{to play on the}} artificial hockey surface." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Clumsy" [...] {{was written}} by Talay Riley, Warren [...] "Oak" [...] Felder and Alex Niceforo, with {{production}} being handled by the latter two; Mischke served as a vocal producer. Spears, Riley, Felder, Zaire Koalo, Trevor Brown and Mischke provided crowd vocals on the track, which were recorded at 158 Studios, Westlake Village, California, and at House of Blues Studio, Encino, California. Musically, [...] "Clumsy" [...] portrays a [...] "synth-laden" [...] electro track, with a [...] "folksy verse stomp" [...] and a [...] "futuristic club beat." [...] It additionally incorporates [...] "stomping drums and finger snaps" [...] in its instrumentation, as well as doo-wop [...] "hand-claps and soulful vocal riffs as it builds to an explosive electronic drop." [...] In an interview with radio show The Cooper Lawrence Show, the singer confirmed {{that she and her}} team [...] "literally went into the booth together and did all the claps [...] all the sound effects are real, they're from us, our feet and everything, it's all real, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> did it together, it's like very old-school." [...] Joey Nolfi, writing for Entertainment Weekly, saw [...] "Clumsy" [...] as being [...] " [...] sonically in-line with songs heard on 2011's Femme Fatale and 2013's Britney Jean." [...] The Guardian Alex Macpherson opined that [...] "its rapacious giddiness shares something of the same spirit as Ariana Grande's 'Greedy'." ...|$|E

You never pay that much for the computer time and I think that research will show that they were using someone else's computer time; someone else was paying for that. It could have been Honeywell where Paul Allen was working. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> knew {{this to be a}} spurious argument." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton {{wrote and}} sang lead vocals on [...] "Action Needs an Audience", marking his first lead vocal {{appearance}} in eleven years. Adkins states that [...] "the music for 'Action Needs an Audience' was sitting {{around for a}} long time. I was trying to write lyrics for it but wasn't happy with anything I was coming up with. Tom was always championing that song as something we needed to keep working on, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> decided that he should take a crack at writing lyrics for it then. It's cool. I think it really works." ...|$|E

Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe. This is the faith of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus? These are the things Dioscorus hid away." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{pulled back}} to where the vessel had sunk and on our way picked up six men who were {{swimming}} – two of whom were drunk and gave us much trouble all the time. The six men we picked up were hauled into the boat by the women. Two of these men died in the boat. The boat we were in started to take in water; I do not know how. We had to bail. I was standing in ice cold water {{up to the top}} of my boots all the time, and rowing continuously for nearly five hours. We took off about fifteen more people who were standing on a capsized boat. In all, our boat had by that time sixty-five or sixty-six people. There was no room to sit down in our boat, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> stood, except some sitting along the side.|$|E

2500|$|As soon as our line, set on its jolting way, emerged, I {{felt that}} two men close by had been hit, two shadows {{fell to the}} ground and rolled under our feet, one with a high-pitched scream and the other in silence like an ox. Another {{disappeared}} with a movement like a madman, {{as if he had been}} carried away. Instinctively, we closed ranks and pushed each other forward, always forward, and the wound in our midst closed itself. The warrant officer stopped and raised his sword, dropped it, fell to his knees, his kneeling body falling backwards in jerks, his helmet fell on his heels and he remained there, his head uncovered, looking up to the sky. The line has promptly split to avoid breaking this immobility. [...] But we couldn't see the lieutenant any more. No more superiors, then... A moment's hesitation held back the human wave which had reached the beginning of the plateau. The hoarse sound of air passing through our lungs could be heard over the stamping of feet. [...] Forward! cried a soldier. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> marched forward, moving faster and faster in our race towards the abyss.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{was profoundly}} deaf and communicated on-field with his {{teammates}} in sign language. [...] He {{is credited with}} helping to expand and make universal the use of sign language throughout the modern baseball infield, including {{but not limited to}} the use of pitching signs. [...] According to Sean Lahman in his biography of Taylor, [...] "The Giants didn't just add Taylor to their roster; they embraced him {{as a member of the}} family. [...] Player-manager George Davis learned sign language and encouraged his players to do the same. [...] John McGraw did likewise when he took over as Giants manager in July 1902." [...] In Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Taylor's teammate, Fred Snodgrass, recalled:We could all read and speak the deaf-and-dumb sign language, because Dummy Taylor took it as an affront if you didn't learn to converse with him. [...] He wanted to be one of us, to be a full-fledged member of the team. [...] If we went to the vaudeville show, he wanted to know what the joke was, and somebody had to tell him. [...] <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> learned. [...] We practiced all the time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{resulting}} {{conclusion of}} noting similarities {{of the two}} events, including {{the description of the}} event within Psalms 105 and 106, such as, [...] "In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test," [...] the reason for Jesus' temptation was that the Lamb of God was taking on the sins of the forefathers of Israel who had rebelled against him when he led them with his Holy Spirit through the desert, and, as John the Baptist did in the desert around the same time to prepare the way for him, show everyone the path of righteousness <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> would repent and understand. He did all of this so that the [...] "lost sheep of Israel" [...] and later, all people, would believe in him and know him, the good Shepherd who saves from condemnation and death by laying down his life for his sheep, those who come to him to learn from him, who hear his voice and know him, that they would have eternal life in him and be able to call on the Name of the Lord and have the Lord be their Righteousness and Salvation, Immanuel forever.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of their {{previous}} album, The Real Thing and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break {{for a year and a}} half before beginning work on the follow-up, Angel Dust. During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous début album. This situation had an effect on the band, since drummer Mike Bordin thought the writing process was like the state of a [...] "magic slate" [...] having been [...] "completely covered in writing; there was not any more room for any more writing on that slate, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> went and said all right, and erased everything, and started writing new stuff," [...] and Patton was creatively revitalized. They decided not to [...] "play it safe" [...] and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. [...] Martin also didn't like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum. [...] In an interview taken while they were in the studio he said that [...] "Roddy [...] wanted to name it Angel Dust, I don't know why, I just want you to know that if it's named Angel Dust, it didn't have anything to do with me.|$|E
2500|$|... "Attack" [...] {{had been}} around for a while and the band was unconvinced of its worth. The song proved to be {{somewhat}} problematic, and was nearly excluded from the album. During an interview in 2005, Jared Leto said [...] "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it – I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand – I was playing it everywhere." [...] When Jared tried performing the song {{with the rest of the}} band, something was wrong. [...] "On acoustic it was great; but when we played it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." [...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was just talking. I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it." [...] Jared told Josh Abraham that night [...] "This song deserves to be a hit just so we can tell this story." ...|$|E
