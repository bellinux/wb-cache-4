25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} has been {{included}} in several phylogenetic analyses of the Carangidae, with each study suggesting slightly different relationships. All studies confirmed its placement in the subfamily Caranginae, a monophyletic grouping including the trevallies, jacks, <b>scads</b> and horse mackerels. The first of these studies by Soko Gushiken was based on morphological characteristics and found the species {{was part of a}} monophyletic clade of the <b>scads</b> and horse mackerels with Atule, Selar, Trachurus and Decapterus, being most closely related to Atule. A 1987 analysis of genetic divergence amongst the <b>scads</b> and horse mackerels using isozyme electrophoresis indicated the species was most closely related to Selar, forming a monophyletic clade with Trachurus, but being more distant from Decapterus. Two studies in 2002 and 2007 of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences generally agreed that Selaroides was most closely related to Selar (depending on analysis type), however both indicated a closer relationship to the deeper bodied genera such as Caranx and Hemicaranx than to the <b>scads</b> of Trachurus and Decapterus.|$|E
25|$|The yellowstripe scad, Selaroides leptolepis, (also {{known as}} the yellowstripe {{trevally}}, yellow-banded trevally, smooth-tailed trevally, slender-scaled trevally and slender trevally) is a species of small inshore fish in the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, and {{the only member of}} the genus Selaroides. The yellowstripe trevally is distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific region, ranging from the Persian Gulf in the west to Vanuatu and New Caledonia in the east. The species is distinguished by its prominent lateral yellow band, and differs from the <b>scads</b> of the genus Selar in having a smaller eye and different dentition. The yellowstripe scad reaches a maximum recorded length of 22 cm, however is normally encountered at sizes less than 15cm. Phylogenetic studies indicate the yellowstripe scad is closely related to the <b>scads</b> of the genus Selar, although its exact placement in the family Carangidae is less well agreed upon.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, <b>scads,</b> leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E

25|$|The razorbelly scad (Alepes kleinii) (also {{known as}} the banded scad, golden scad and goggle-eye scad) is a small species of {{tropical}} marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species inhabits coastal waters in the Indo-Pacific, from Pakistan {{in the west to}} Japan and Australia in the east, often found over reefs. The razorbelly scad has a complex taxonomic history, and even recently has had its position in the genus Alepes challenged, but appears to be stable after a molecular phylogeny study supported its placement in Alepes. It is very similar to other <b>scads</b> in the same genus, but is readily identified by its unique teeth. Razorbelly scad are predatory fish, taking a variety of crustaceans and shrimps, and show a change in feeding intensity over the year. Reproduction and development has been extensively studied in India, where spawning occurs in a single event from January to September. The species is commonly taken in tropical fisheries, where it is marketed fresh or dried.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the expression of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (<b>SCAD),</b> a key enzyme of fatty acid b-oxidation, during rat heart development and the difference of <b>SCAD</b> between pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy. The expression of <b>SCAD</b> was lowest in the foetal and neonatal heart, which had time-dependent increase during normal heart development. In contrast, a significant decrease in <b>SCAD</b> expression was observed in different ages of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). On the other hand, swim-trained rats developed physiological cardiac hypertrophy, whereas SHR developed pathological cardiac hypertrophy. The two kinds of cardiac hypertrophy exhibited divergent <b>SCAD</b> changes in myocardial fatty acids utilization. In addition, the expression of <b>SCAD</b> was significantly decreased in patho-logical cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, however, increased in physiological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. <b>SCAD</b> siRNA treatment triggered the path-ological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which showed that the down-regulation of <b>SCAD</b> expression may {{play an important role in}} pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{understand}} the expanding clinical and biochemical spectrum of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (<b>SCAD)</b> deficiency, {{the impact of}} which is not fully understood. STUDY DESIGN: We studied a family with <b>SCAD</b> deficiency and determined urinary ethylmalonic acid excretion, plasma C(4) -carnitine, <b>SCAD</b> enzyme activity in fibroblasts and lymphocytes, DNA mutations in the <b>SCAD</b> gene, and clinical expression. The index patient was born prematurely and had otherwise unexplained cholestasis and hepatomegaly {{during the first year}} of life. His mother developed a hemolysis-elevated liver enzymes-low platelets (HELLP) syndrome while pregnant with the index patient. RESULTS: Two siblings had a homozygous inactivating 1138 C>T mutation, whereas the father was compound heterozygous for this mutation and the common 625 G>A polymorphism. There was a good correlation between the type of <b>SCAD</b> mutation, the residual <b>SCAD</b> enzyme activity, and the levels of urinary ethylmalonic acid and plasma C(4) -carnitine in each of the eight family members. Retrospective acylcarnitine analysis of the index patient's Guthrie screening card confirmed the abnormal increase of C(4) -carnitine, suggestive of <b>SCAD</b> deficiency. None of the family members had hypotonia, developmental delay, or episodes of ketotic hypoglycemia. CONCLUSION: Homozygosity for an inactivating <b>SCAD</b> mutation does not necessarily result in disease. The previously held opinion that <b>SCAD</b> deficiency is always a serious disorder may have been influenced by a clinical bias. Homozygosity for an inactivating 1138 C>T <b>SCAD</b> mutation was assessed by neonatal screening of blood spot acylcarnitines. <b>SCAD</b> deficiency may be associated with maternal HELLP syndrom...|$|R

2500|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} {{is a small}} species, {{attaining}} a maximum length of 22 cm, but is more common at lengths less than 15cm. The species has a body shape typical of many <b>scads,</b> with a compressed elongate, oblong body with the dorsal and ventral profiles equally curved. There is a fairly well developed adipose eyelid on {{the latter half of}} the eye. The dentition of the yellowstripe scad is one of the diagnostic features of the species, with the upper jaw and mouth being devoid of any teeth while the lower has a single series of fine villiform teeth. The dorsal fin is in two parts; the first having 8 spines and the second 1 spine and 24 to 26 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 detached spines followed by 20 to 23 soft rays. In one recorded case these two spines were not present. The soft dorsal and anal fins both have scaly basal sheaths. The pectoral fin is falcate and doesn't reach the junction of the curved and straight sections of the lateral line. The pectoral girdle has no groove, and is another defining characteristic. The anterior curve in the lateral line is moderate, with the straight section containing 13 to 25 scales and 24 to 29 small scutes. The breast is completely scaled.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spontaneous cervicocephalic artery {{dissection}} (<b>sCAD)</b> of {{more than}} two cervical arteries is rare. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Vascular and potential <b>sCAD</b> risk factors, triggering events, clinical and neuroimaging findings, and outcome of patients with multiple <b>sCAD</b> were studied. Patients were drawn from prospective hospital-based <b>sCAD</b> registries. RESULTS: Of 740 consecutive patients with <b>sCAD,</b> 11 (1. 5 %) had three, and one had four (0. 1 %) <b>sCAD.</b> Eight of these 12 patients were women. One patient had additional dissections of the celiac trunk and hepatic artery. Vascular risk factors included hypertension (n = 1), hypercholesterolaemia (n = 6), current smoking (n = 5) and migraine (n = 6). No patient had a family history of <b>sCAD,</b> fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) or connective tissue disease. <b>SCAD</b> was preceded by a minor trauma in five and infection in four patients. Clinical manifestations included ischaemic stroke (n = 8), transient ischaemic attack (n = 3), headache (n = 9), neck pain (n = 4), Horner syndrome (n = 5), pulsatile tinnitus (n = 2) and dysgeusia (n = 1). Brain MRI revealed ischaemic infarcts that affected one vessel territory in seven and two territories in two patients. The 3 -month outcome was favourable (modified Rankin scale score 0 - 1) in 10 patients (83 %). No new recurrent stroke or <b>sCAD</b> occurred during a mean follow-up of 50 (SD 29) months. CONCLUSION: Multiple <b>sCAD</b> occurred preferentially in women and caused clinical symptoms and signs mainly in one vascular territory. In none of the patients was FMD or any other underlying arteriopathy apparent. The majority of multiple <b>sCAD</b> was preceded by a minor trauma or infection. Clinical outcome was favourable in most patients, and long-term prognosis benign. The data suggest that transient vasculopathy may be a major mechanism for multiple <b>sCAD...</b>|$|R
