5|$|After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade {{was again}} municipalised, and reorganised. London Road Fire Station was {{restored}} as {{the headquarters of}} the brigade and became the only fire station serving the city centre. A fire <b>service</b> <b>training</b> centre was established in 1948. At about the same time, the ambulance station closed and was converted into the fire brigade's workshops. The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1936, an air {{training}} scheme was inaugurated at Cranborne, near Salisbury, where the civilian flying school instructed pilots. Facilities were later extended to Bulawayo. In August 1937, Squadron Leader G.A Powell and Flight Lieutenant V.E. Maxwell were seconded from the RAF to oversee <b>service</b> <b>training.</b> In September 1939, the Rhodesian Air Training Group, {{under the direction}} of Air Vice Marshal (later Sir) Charles Warburton Meredith, took in 500 recruits at Cranborne. An offer was made to British Air Ministry to run a flying school and to train personnel to man three squadrons, which was duly accepted.|$|E

25|$|The Cadet, while {{smaller and}} more {{economical}} than the Tutor, was still more expensive to run than competing two-seat light civil aircraft and was harder to hangar because of its lack of folding wings, so it was used mainly as a trainer for flying schools or the military. By far, the largest civil user was Air <b>Service</b> <b>Training</b> Ltd, which operated 17 Avro 631s at Hamble, together with a further four operated by its Hong Kong subsidiary, the Far East Aviation Co. Air <b>Service</b> <b>Training</b> also operated 23 Mk II Cadets, with both these and the earlier Cadets remaining in service with Reserve Training Schools run by Air <b>Service</b> <b>Training</b> until they were impressed as ATC instructional airframes in 1941.|$|E

5|$|When Amtrak began {{returning}} rented Jersey Arrows to New Jersey Transit in late 1980, {{other equipment}} {{was needed to}} cover Silverliner <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> on the Harrisburg corridor. Test runs of Metroliners on the corridor began in January 1981, and revenue service began in February, despite warnings a decade before that the cars were not suitable for the service. The last non-rebuilt Metroliners in regular use on Metroliner <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> were removed on April 1, 1981, followed by the GG1s in May. The last Metroliner <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> using Metroliners ran on October 23, 1981. With all Metroliner <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> covered by AEM-7/Amfleet sets, all Keystone <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> to Harrisburg then used Metroliners, rebranded as Capitoliners.|$|R

25|$|The Norman Thompson N.T.2B was a British single-engined Flying boat trainer of the First World War.

50|$|During rush hour, Track Nos. 1 and 4 {{are used}} for Rapid <b>Service,</b> while Local <b>trains</b> stop at Track Nos. 2 and 3. This allows people to {{transfer}} quickly from Local to Rapid <b>Service</b> <b>trains,</b> and allows the Rapid <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> to pass ahead of the Local trains, which operate on the same track, unlike the Special Rapid Service and Limited Express trains. During the afternoon and night hours, when there is less traffic, Rapid <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> stop at Track Nos. 2 and 3 only, and Track Nos. 1 and 4 are roped off as {{they are not in}} use.|$|R

50|$|In 1957, a {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find a station that would be suitable as a Rapid Service stop. An argument unfolded between the adjacent Ashiya Station and Nishinomiya Station. In the end, it was decided that Rapid <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> running on the inner tracks of the four track line, the Local service tracks, would stop at Ashiya Station. The Rapid <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> operating on the two outer tracks would stop at Nishinomiya Station. However, in 2003, it was decided that all Local and Rapid <b>Service</b> <b>trains</b> would stop at both stations.|$|R

25|$|After the war, the Admiralty {{ships were}} sold to the Turkish Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy, and {{civilian}} operators, while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy, temporarily reactivated to facilitate National <b>Service</b> <b>Training,</b> or sold to civilians. Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy, {{one of which was}} destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy' political system. The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects. Two vessels are preserved as museum ships.|$|E

25|$|The {{squadron}} {{settled into}} a two-year training pattern, with the first consisting of General <b>Service</b> <b>training</b> and the second Specialist, while continuing to accept new recruits as each course graduated. The squadron also provided an introduction to Air Force life for those who been awarded RAAF Undergraduate Scholarships as recipients were posted to University Squadrons. Biouvouacs and survival training were held at Greenbank and the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra {{under the control of}} Army personnel, and at Beechmont, Lake Manchester and Colleges Crossing. General <b>Service</b> <b>Training</b> and/or on the job training was held at RAAF establishments at Rathmines, Richmond, Laverton, Elizabeth, Wagga, Williamtown, Garbutt, and Amberley (almost exclusively from the late 1960s). During the academic year, training was held on Wednesday evening. Members enlisted into the PAF under the Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme were required to attend Wednesday parades to undertake the basic Officer Training Course. Graduation parades after about 1958 were held at the squadron's base. However, in the late 1960s when the squadron's continuous training camps were held at Amberley a good relationship between the RAAF base and the squadron developed. With the encouragement of the then Air Commodore Deryck Kingwell CBE DSO, graduation parades were held at Amberley.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} each {{academic}} session, Midshipmen and Officer Cadets move {{to their}} respective single service colleges for Single <b>Service</b> <b>Training</b> (SST). Such training prepares them to be officers in the ADF. Army Officer Cadets continue this training for another 12 months after leaving ADFA at the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC-D), to later be commissioned as Lieutenants. Most Officer Cadets and Midshipmen undertake six SST periods over a three-year period. However, Midshipmen have already completed 12 months of training in the Navy so they may not be required to train in these periods.|$|E
