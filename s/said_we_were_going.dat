6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed the other, {{brightening}} {{for a brief}} moment; [...] "yes, I {{did hear}} him. He <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> six knots. Now I do not understand what that means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{through on}} this road--and we are," [...] {{answered}} Dave, calmly, {{and he started}} to turn on the power again. As he did this Nat Poole leaped to the road {{directly in front of the}} touring car, and Jasniff and Merwell followed suit.|$|E

5000|$|There {{had been}} a drought that had lasted for weeks, and the weather report {{predicted}} continued drought across the Eastern United States. Then Reich pointed the apparatus {{at a certain point}} in the sky and left it on {{for an hour and a}} half. If this is correctly set up, he <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to experience rain within 8 [...] - [...] 9 hours. And quite correctly. After 8 hours we received an 8-hour streaming downpour across some tens of square kilometers surrounding the apparatus! An experience of that sort makes a certain impression. (Gabrielsen, 1962) ...|$|R
60|$|MEN. Matter! <b>said</b> they; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{that way}} as you <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> and {{went as far}} as we durst; and indeed <b>we</b> <b>were</b> almost past coming back; for had we gone a little further, <b>we</b> had not <b>been</b> here to bring the news to thee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, a fig for the land," [...] {{answered}} Nick; [...] "as soon as Nollichucky Jack is safe I'll {{follow you}} into Kentucky." [...] He slapped {{me on the}} knee. [...] "Egad, Davy, {{it seems like a}} fairy tale. We always <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to Kentucky, didn't we? What {{is the name of the}} place you are to startle with your learning and calm by your example?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But perhaps innocence {{so great}} as ours had wrought upon him. When we <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> and {{thanked him for}} his unavailing good-will, {{he looked at his}} watch and said they were just going to feed the prisoners; and after some parley he {{suddenly}} called out, [...] "Music of the guard!" [...] Instead of a regimental band, which I had supposed summoned, a single corporal ran out the barracks, touching his cap.|$|E
60|$|Both {{that home}} of the {{patriotic}} Chicago families, and the other best hotel were too full for us, and after a round of the second- best we decided for lodgings, hoping as usual that they would bring us nearer the native life. The best we could get, facing the sea midway of the crescent, were not exactly Welsh in their keeping. The landladies were, in fact, two elderly Church-of- England sisters from Dublin, who had named their house out of a novel they had read. They said they believed the name was Italian, and the reader shall judge if it were so from its analogue of Osier Wood. The maids in the house, however, were very truly and very wickedly Welsh: two tough little ponies of girls, who tied their hair up with shoe-strings, and were forbidden, when about their work, to talk Welsh together, lest they should speak lezing of those Irish ladies. The rogues were half English, but the gentle creature who served our table was wholly Welsh; small, sweet-voiced, dark-eyed, intelligent, who suffered from the universal rheumatism of the British Isles, but kept steadily to her duty, and accepted her fate with patience and even cheerfulness. She waited on several other tables, for the house was full of lodgers, all rather less permanent than ourselves, who were there for a fortnight; we found our landladies hoping, when we <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> to have had us with them through the winter.|$|E
6000|$|RENCH (going up to GEORGE). Good to see you, Captain, on a {{day like}} this. As Larz Fersen <b>said</b> when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to strike, [...] "It's a fine day for it." [...] Well, this is a better day--you home and well, and the strike off.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really," [...] she <b>said</b> bitterly, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> up {{the garden}} path, [...] "You think rather quiet folks {{have a lot}} in them, but it's only stupidity—they are mostly fools." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to begin}} by a disagreement. I do not {{consider}} that America has realised in the least the duties of a neutral nation." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{very hot}} day indeed. We were unshaved, unwashed, undressed, unfed, and could hardly enjoy the absurdity of lying {{blistering}} in a lazy harbour, with the town looking on from a respectful distance, all manner of whiskered men in cocked hats discussing our fate at a remote guard-house, with gestures (we looked very hard at them through telescopes) expressive of a week's detention at least: and nothing whatever the matter all the time. But even in this crisis the brave Courier achieved a triumph. He telegraphed somebody (I saw nobody) either naturally connected with the hotel, or put en rapport with the establishment for that occasion only. The telegraph was answered, and {{in half an hour}} or less, there came a loud shout from the guard-house. The captain was wanted. Everybody helped the captain into his boat. Everybody got his luggage, and <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> The captain rowed away, and disappeared behind a little jutting corner of the Galley- slaves' Prison: and presently came back with something, very sulkily. The brave Courier met him at the side, and received the something as its rightful owner. It was a wicker basket, folded in a linen cloth; and in it were two great bottles of wine, a roast fowl, some salt fish chopped with garlic, a great loaf of bread, a dozen or so of peaches, and a few other trifles. When we had selected our own breakfast, the brave Courier invited a chosen party to partake of these refreshments, and assured them that they need not be deterred by motives of delicacy, as he would order a second basket to be furnished at their expense. Which he did--no one knew how--and by-and-by, the captain being again summoned, again sulkily returned with another something; over which my popular attendant presided as before: carving with a clasp-knife, his own personal property, something smaller than a Roman sword.|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Denis said, [...] "One of {{the cast}} had {{actually}} been in the Legion, so we took all their real exercises and did them together every day, to concentrate the actors as a group. We never <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to choreograph the film. But afterwards, when we started shooting, using Britten's music, those exercises became like a dance." ...|$|E
5000|$|Williams {{claimed she}} {{was set up}} to be held by the six {{suspects}} under the assumption {{that she was going to}} a party. [...] "When I first went up there, a girl I knew named Christa, she took me up there, she <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to a party. She said she had to make a run and she would be right back. She didn’t come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] he said, [...] "it'll soak in. It's {{good for}} the texture. Or am I {{thinking}} of tobacco-ash on the carpet? Well, never mind. Listen to me! When I <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to keep fowls, I didn't mean in a small, piffling sort of way--two cocks {{and a couple of}} hens and a golf-ball for a nest-egg. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do it on a large scale. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to run a chicken farm!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's go up {{and change}} our clothes," [...] Dalton <b>said.</b> [...] "Remember <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to travel, Austen, {{especially}} up the north road. You will want some thickish tweeds and an overcoat, although it seems so stifling here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I will sling {{a hammock}} for you,” the man <b>said.</b> “Now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> just <b>going</b> to have dinner, and I dare {{say you can}} eat something. You are the boy they call Miss Warden’s pet, are you not?” ...|$|R
5000|$|Random House {{was founded}} in 1925 by Americans Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, two years after they {{acquired}} the Modern Library imprint from publisher Horace Liveright, which reprints classic works of literature. Cerf is quoted as saying, [...] "We just <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to publish a few books on the side at random," [...] which suggested the name Random House. In 1934 they published the first authorized edition of James Joyces novel Ulysses in the Anglophone world.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{inclusion}} of the song Town Clowns in the [...] "Rough Trade Singles Club" [...] {{caught the attention of}} several labels, and the band finally decided on China Records. They released a single for China, Don't Say You're Sorry, and then went to Fort Apache Studios in Boston, Massachusetts to record their debut album, The Signs Are All There. Jared Daley later said, [...] "When China <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to Boston, we thought they meant Boston, Lincolnshire." [...] The album was produced by Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, and was released in October 1995 on China Records/Atlantic Records.|$|E
5000|$|Our vinyls are {{strictly}} limited collectors items and are something {{we really wanted}} to do as we've always demanded our singles are released on 7". Even when previous labels didn't want to release them we forced their hand. The box when complete is worth it'sprice, it's a very sexy piece.We always <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do A-Z compilations. Those who feel duped / ripped off can get off their soapboxes, my heart bleeds for you... We're just past the 1/3 mark of the A-Z and the bonus tracks are only just starting to trickle out to subscribers. We've publicized the sheer quantity of tracks that have been recorded. These are all going to get used. This has been the most prolific writing / recording period of our career and we love the diversity of the output. We're under no illusions that not everyone's going to like every song / direction but hopefully we'll cover all bases by the series' end. - Mark Hamilton on the subject of release format, February 2010 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! I woke to see {{her face}} over me, all bright in wavy hair just as when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> children, and she <b>said,</b> 'Bear! Bear! <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> together!' Then somehow she tried to help me to trust for Phyllis and Lily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{admitted}} Weston, [...] "that seems reasonably evident, {{though we}} certainly saw {{no sign of}} it." [...] He broke off and laughed. [...] "The whole thing sounds crazy, doesn't it? Still, as I <b>said,</b> I believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> successful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{they can}} hardly be called serviceable," [...] the master agreed. [...] "I spoke to the owner about it, but he <b>said</b> that as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to sail with a convoy it did not matter, {{and that we should}} have some others for the next voyage." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, the bWo {{challenged}} The Mexicools to a {{match at}} The Great American Bash, with Stevie Richards saying the bWo {{was tired of}} the Mexicools interfering in people's matches, saying {{they were going to}} take over and rise up against the gringos because [...] "We invented that!" [...] - which then prompted Hollywood Nova to say [...] "Actually, we never <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to rise up against the gringos". The three members appeared on WWE Velocity in a six-man tag match against 3 jobbers to prepare themselves for their tag match against the Mexicools. At the Great American Bash, the bWo and Mexicools met in a six-man tag match. They even drove into the ring on tricycles to parody the Mexicools' usual ring entrance on John Deere lawnmowers. The bWo lost the match after Super Crazy hit a moonsault and Psicosis hit the guillotine legdrop on Big Stevie Cool for the win. As the month of July ended, the bWo faded from the scene. Stevie Richards went back to his old gimmick, as did Hollywood Nova, while Blue Meanie was never officially contracted by WWE.|$|E
5000|$|... {{day before}} the 1999 Macworld,bought me a {{matching}} pair of {{blue jeans and a}} black turtleneck sweater and matching round eyeglasses. He'd written a sketch for us to perform the next day at Macworld. I'd put my hands together in a kind of Jobs-like silent-prayer pose and then launch into his keynote. And then a few minutes into the address he'd come storming onto the stage and say, 'Wyle, you don't have me at all! What the hell are you doing? First I pick up my slide-clicker and then I put my hands together.' He'd say,'Ladies and gentlemen, Noah Wyle!; And then he'd kick me off the stage and take over, introducing the latest piece of Apple technology. And that's exactly how we did it. The first few rows, I think, could obviously tell it wasn't him, but most others didn't know at all. And there was this growing ripple of laughter throughout the auditorium when people got what was happening.I honestly had {{had no idea what to}} expect: I thought the whole thing might be an ambush—that he’d get me to his event and that what he <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do in fact wasn’t what we were going to do, and I would somehow be humiliated. But he stayed on script and was very kind to me. —Noah Wyle ...|$|E
5000|$|Connolly {{summarized}} how {{the recording}} lineup fell into place:...we said we're {{just going to}} go in here and have fun with this. We had a bunch of songs lying around that we wanted to take in. Originally, it was just going to be me going in there and doing most everything. The more we talked about it and the more we got together a game plan and studio time, the more we kind of started talking about, [...] "Hey, Scott, remember ten years ago when we first talked about doing that thing, that side project? Well, {{what are you doing in}} March?" [...] laughs Literally, it was pretty much that. Erock Friedman was like, [...] "Hey, man I want to get in on this." [...] I had already talked to Vinnie about doing it, because we knew that Sevendust members Morgan Rose and Clint Lowery were going to be doing Call Me No One. It literally came together, for lack of a better description and explanation for how it really happened. It wasn't like I sat down and said, here is my top fifty drummers that I'm going to go after, here's my top 25 guitar players — it wasn't that at all. It was just us saying, [...] "Hey, man, let's just go in and do what we always <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do." [...] I think the end result at the end of the day surprised us just as much as it surprised everyone else.|$|E
60|$|Our {{friend the}} {{carpenter}} spied us out: at least, {{he was not}} my friend. He didn't find me simpatico, I am sure. But up he came, and proceeded to entertain us with weary banality. Again the young woman called, had we had coffee? <b>We</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just <b>going</b> down. And then she <b>said</b> that whatever <b>we</b> had today {{we had to pay}} for: our food ended with the one day. At which the q-b was angry, feeling swindled. But I had known before.|$|R
5000|$|Universal Pictures {{president}} of film music and publishing Mike Knobloch explains that Hooper [...] "went to Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain and Herbert and <b>said,</b> 'If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do a new song, {{what if it}} were there? What if Jean Valjean sang a song that helped the audience {{understand that this is}} a big moment for him?' Herbert was the first to suggest the title 'Suddenly,' as in he suddenly realizes his value and purpose. He went to Alain and they brought it to life quickly." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} {{criticism}} from supporters regarding the organisation of the event. In response the Leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, <b>said</b> [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to put a}} finger of blame anywhere {{it has to be}} with those fans having {{to take responsibility for their}} own behaviour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{the fact}} is,' <b>said</b> Short, 'that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> the longest way, because {{then we could}} stop for the night, {{a mile and a}} half on. But three or four mile gained to-night is so many saved to-morrow, and if you keep on, I think our best way is to do the same.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Hillary Clinton said {{regarding}} Martin Luther King, Jr. {{in an interview}} with Fox News, [...] "I would point to the fact that that Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do, the President before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done. That dream became a reality, the power of that dream became real in people's lives because we had a president who <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do it, and actually got it accomplished." [...] Some African-American leaders took this statement as a denigration of the accomplishments of King and the larger Civil Rights Movement. Hillary Clinton proceeded to blame Obama for the controversy, claiming his campaign had fanned the flames, a charge which Obama dismissed as [...] "ludicrous." [...] By shortly before, and during, a January 15 Democratic debate in Nevada, Clinton and Obama declared a truce on the matter, with both making reconciliatory statements about race, gender, and each other. However, Clinton's support among African Americans was thought to be damaged, with SUNY Albany's Debra Dickerson stating [...] "The Clintons have to do something dramatic and symbolic to win back the trust of many African-Americans." ...|$|R

5000|$|Our {{first meeting}} with the sponsor's PRO, Reg Pugh, was a near-fiasco, for the three of us, Eddie Lawton, Les Keith and myself, were working and groping in the dark, having to rely on figures conjured {{out of thin air}} by {{treasurer}} Ruben Smith. So poor, too, <b>were</b> <b>we</b> at this time that we arrived at the posh West End hotel with only enough money between the three of us to get back home.
