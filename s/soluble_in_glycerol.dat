40|$|Various {{complexes}} {{that contain}} the core subunits of RNA polymerase II associated with different transcription {{factors have been}} isolated from eukaryotes; their precise molecular constitution depends on the purification procedure. We estimated the numbers of various components of such complexes in an HeLa cell by quantitative immunoblotting. The cells were lysed with saponin in a physiological buffer; ∼ 140, 000 unengaged polymerases (mainly of form IIA) were released. Only ∼ 4, 000 of these <b>soluble</b> molecules sedimented <b>in</b> <b>glycerol</b> gradients as holoenzyme-sized complexes. About 180, 000 molecules of polymerases (∼ 110, 000 molecules of form IIO) and 10, 000 to 30, 000 molecules of each of TFIIB, TFIIEα, TFIIEβ, TFIIF-RAP 74, TFIIF-RAP 30, and TFIIH-MAT 1 remained tightly associated with the nuclear substructure. Most proteins and run-on activity were retained when ∼ 50 % of the chromatin was detached with a nuclease, but ∼ 45, 000 molecules of bound TATA binding protein (TBP) were detached. Similar results were obtained after cross-linking living cells with formaldehyde. The results provide little support {{for the existence of}} a large pool of soluble holoenzyme; they are consistent with TBP-promoter complexes in nuclease-sensitive chromatin being assembled into preinitiation complexes attached to the underlying structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} weight is 406. 05. It is a yellow microcrystalline powder {{with a faint}} smell of saffron, burning taste, slightly hygroscopic. It is highly <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> water, even cold. Slightly <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> ethanol and <b>glycerol,</b> insoluble <b>in</b> ether. The 2 % aqueous solution has a pH of 3. 2. How Made: The compounds known as quinolines and isoquinolines {{have been the subject}} of extensive investigation since their extraction from coal tar in the nineteenth century. They are considered a heterocylic aromatic compound, with a double ring structure similar to a benzene ring; derived from napthalene with a trivalent nitrogen atom substituted for a carbon atom on one of the rings. Substitution of a hydroxyl group on position 8 of the aromatic nucleus of quinoline converts it to oxyquinoline(also called 8 -quinolinol) and confers phenolic properties (Lipnicki, 2001 b). Quinoline can be extracted from coal tar distillated by caustic extraction and then by distillation of the oil to produce a methylnapthalene fraction. This is then washed with dilute sulfuric acid to produce sulfate salts. The mixture of compounds attained can then be further separated using forms of chromatography. ∗ OMRI’s information is enclosed in square brackets in Italics.

40|$|This work {{focused on}} the {{potential}} of glycerol as a scrubbing solvent for stripping of highly polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial waste gas streams. Results for glycerol interactions were compared to those of water. Solubility predictions {{in the form of}} infinite dilution activity coefficients were made using the Modified UNIFAC Dortmund group contribution model, which was set up on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet specifically designed for this purpose. Activity coefficients for VOCs in water and glycerol (highly polar solvents) increased with an increase in the length of the VOC solute nonpolar tail. Furthermore, activity coefficients decreased with an increase in the degree of branching of the VOC solute. The results show that low chain length highly polar alcohol, ketone, organic acid and aldehyde solutes are very <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>glycerol.</b> Diols, dicarbonyl aldehydes, some ketone derivatives and the ethanolamines also show good solubility. Highly polar diesters and ester derivatives are less <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>glycerol</b> and water. This study has found glycerol to be a better scrubbing solvent than water in treating highly polar VOCs. However {{it is possible that the}} standard method of building up the glycerol molecule in the UNIFAC may result in under-predictions of activity coefficients and thus special group interaction parameters for glycerol are required...|$|E
