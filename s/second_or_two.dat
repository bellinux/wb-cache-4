25|$|Healthcare and pre-hospital-care {{providers}} (EMTs or paramedics) {{often use}} the fingernail beds as a cursory indicator of distal tissue perfusion {{of individuals who}} may be dehydrated or in shock. However, this test is not considered reliable in adults. This {{is known as the}} CRT or blanch test. The fingernail bed is briefly depressed to turn the nail-bed white. When the pressure is released, the normal pink colour should be restored within a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> Delayed return to pink color can be an indicator of certain shock states such as hypovolemia.|$|E
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E

500|$|Playing as a defender, Miller debuted for St Kilda {{in their}} fifth round home game against Carlton, at the Junction Oval on 25 May, {{playing on the}} half-back flank. At {{the start of the}} game, Miller's {{opponent}} Ron Cooper [...] and concussed him. Miller said of the experience, [...] "I learnt more in a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> than I would have in a year".Perry, p. 47. When St Kilda met Carlton in the return match at Princes Park, Miller [...] Cooper in the first minute of the match, forcing his opponent to leave the field. In a match against Richmond, Miller was physically targeted by renowned enforcer Jack Dyer, known as Captain Blood. However, Dyer slipped and missed Miller. In one game, Miller was reported for showing dissent to a goal umpire, but was let off without punishment. St Kilda came second to last, so they did not make the finals.Perry, p. 49.|$|E

2500|$|The catcher {{can help}} his pitcher get more strike {{calls from the}} umpire by using a {{technique}} called [...] "framing". This practice {{is a matter of}} a catcher keeping his mitt inside the strike zone, or making the pitch appear as close to the strikezone, when receiving the pitch, thereby giving the plate umpire the impression that the pitch is in the strike zone, even if it is not. When framing, a catcher will also hold his mitt still for a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> so that the umpire has an opportunity to thoroughly consider his call (and, hopefully, let his innate biases influence his decision in a direction favorable to the catcher's team).|$|E
2500|$|According to an RSA {{laboratories}} FAQ, RFID tags can {{be destroyed}} by a standard microwave oven; however some types of RFID tags, particularly those constructed to radiate using large metallic antennas (in particular RF tags and EPC tags), may catch fire if subjected to this process for too long (as would any metallic item inside a microwave oven). This simple method cannot safely be used to deactivate RFID features in electronic devices, or those implanted in living tissue, {{because of the risk}} of damage to the [...] "host". However the time required is extremely short (a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of radiation) and the method works in many other non-electronic and inanimate items, long before heat or fire become of concern.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{original}} film, the zombies moved very slowly and were most menacing when they collected in large groups. In the remake, the zombies are fast and agile. Many admirers of {{the original}}, {{as well as}} Romero himself, protested this change, feeling that it limited {{the impact of the}} undead. This is somewhat borne out {{by the fact that the}} remake has almost no close-up shots of zombies that last more than a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> Snyder mentions this in the commentary track of the remake's DVD, pointing out that they seem too human when the camera lingers upon them for longer. However, it was for this change that Wizard Magazine ranked the zombies #5 on their [...] "100 Greatest Villains Ever" [...] list.|$|E

He felt that there was simply no way that five men would be able to hold the Indians out more than a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> as they could use ropes to scale the walls. He felt that the war party would then kill everyone in the fort, and the unsuspecting men in the fields. He argued with Silas that they had to barter their lives for time for everyone else. Their father agreed with Benjamin.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike many umpires, Evans {{never made}} claims to infallibility. [...] "I missed {{a lot of}} {{decision}}s", he once said. [...] "At the time of making such a decision {{there was no doubt}} in my mind as to its correctness. However, a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later I felt that I erred and wished I could change my original ruling". Evans' humility and impartiality did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sports writers Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, [...] "roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands". On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious. The New York Times described the incident as [...] "one of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed on a ball field".|$|E
2500|$|Recently, similar {{methods to}} {{determine}} chlorophyll content in leaves non-destructively {{have been applied}} to measuring anthocyanin content. [...] There are now a couple of optical absorbance instruments available commercially which are designed to measure and compute an index value that correlates highly with the actual amount of anthocyanin content in a sample. [...] To use with grapes, the skin is removed and placed across the sensor of the meter. [...] Measurements take only a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> [...] These Anthocyanin Content Meters use an additional Near Infra-Red (NIR) signal, which {{takes into account the}} thickness of the sample, along with the absorbance wavelength to calculate a very accurate index value which is repeatable and consistent enough for comparative testing. [...] A new method just being explored is to dip a piece of filter paper into a solution/sample to be measured and put that across the sensor head as the test sample. [...] There have been positive reports on the second method, but they have not been published.|$|E
2500|$|In contradistinction to Dover Wilson and Waith, several {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} whilst the speech may not work on the page, it can work in performance. Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech [...] "became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had {{the sense of a}} suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to flash through the character's mind, like a bad dream." [...] Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|E

[...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, for a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant.
