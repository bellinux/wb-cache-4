50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note, then, that the uniformity of alternating current in the U.S., which was necessary to build large power-grids, was initially ensured by a very traditional clock system. Furthermore, Henry Warren invented his master clock at first simply in order to guarantee that his <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> motor would provide accurate time.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, Hammond {{founded the}} Hammond Clock Company, after {{designing}} a <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> motor that {{was inspired by}} Henry Warren's Telechrons, but was not self-starting. These clocks were still popular in Britain in the 1960s, because they would not display a false time. (If a transient power failure occurs, a self-starting clock will afterwards restart and display an incorrect time.) The British generating stations also corrected the number of cycles {{at the end of}} the day so that Hammond clocks would be accurate. His clock business ran into difficulties in the early 1930s, and he struggled to save it with a number of other inventions, such as an electric bridge table and, slightly later, his famous organ.|$|E
50|$|<b>Synchronous</b> motor <b>clocks</b> are rugged {{because they}} do not have a {{delicate}} pendulum or balance wheel. However, a temporary power outage will stop the clock, which will show the wrong time when power is restored. Some <b>synchronous</b> <b>clocks</b> have an indicator which shows if it has stopped and restarted.|$|R
50|$|Henry Ellis Warren (1872-1957) {{invented the}} first <b>synchronous</b> {{electric}} <b>clock</b> which kept {{time from the}} oscillations of the power grid, in 1918. The first commercial <b>synchronous</b> electric <b>clock</b> sold in the UK, the Synclock, was brought out in 1931.|$|R

5000|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric clock}} does not contain a timekeeping oscillator such as a pendulum or balance wheel, but instead counts the oscillations of the AC utility current from its wall plug to keep time. It consists of a small AC synchronous motor, which turns the clock's hands through a reduction gear train. [...] The motor contains electromagnets which create a rotating magnetic field which turns an iron rotor. The rotation rate of the motor shaft is synchronized to the utility frequency; 60 cycles per second (Hz) in North and South America, 50 cycles per second in most other countries. The gear train scales this rotation so the minute hand rotates once per hour. Thus the <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> {{can be regarded as}} not so much a timekeeper as a mechanical counter, whose hands display a running count of the number of cycles of alternating current.|$|E
50|$|These {{mechanisms}} {{were found}} in some types of synchronous-motor-driven electric clocks. Many different types of <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> motors were used, including the pre-World War II Hammond manual-start clocks. Some types of self-starting synchronous motors always started when power was applied, but in detail, their behaviour was chaotic and they were equally likely to start rotating in the wrong direction. Coupled to the rotor by one (or possibly two) stages of reduction gearing was a wrap-spring clutch-brake. The spring did not rotate. One end was fixed; the other was free. It rode freely but closely on the rotating member, part of the clock's gear train. The clutch-brake locked up when rotated backwards, but also had some spring action. The inertia of the rotor going backwards engaged the clutch and wound the spring. As it unwound, it restarted the motor in the correct direction. Some designs had no explicit spring as such—but were simply compliant mechanisms. The mechanism was lubricated and wear did not present a problem.|$|E
5000|$|Telechron—now the [...] "Clock and Timer Division" [...] of GE—declined in the 1950s, {{mainly because}} {{batteries}} had {{become much more}} long-lived and reliable. Battery-powered clocks have the obvious advantage of not depending on the proximity of a power outlet, and do not require the often somewhat unattractive electric cable. Furthermore, {{the accuracy of the}} quartz clock superseded the principles of the synchronous motor. GE tried to respond to the declining market for Warren's technology by producing cheaper, less solidly manufactured clocks. Thus, plastic replaced bakelite or wood as the material for the cases; glass crystals were phased out in favor of plastic ones; and the much less durable S rotor took the place of the H rotor. Nevertheless, the decline of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> could not be stopped. GE sold the last of its former Telechron plants in 1979. After successive attempts to revive the business remained fruitless, it closed permanently in 1992.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a hybrid automatic {{test pattern generation}} (ATPG) technique using the staggered launch-on-capture (LOC) scheme followed by the one-hot LOC scheme for testing delay faults in a scan design containing asynchronous clock domains. Typically, the staggered scheme produces small test sets but needs long ATPG runtime, whereas the one-hot scheme takes short ATPG runtime but yields large test sets. The proposed hybrid technique is intended to reduce test pattern count with acceptable ATPG runtime for multi-million-gate scan designs. In case the scan design contains multiple <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> domains, each group of <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> domains is treated as a clock group and tested using a launch aligned or a capture aligned LOC scheme. By combining these schemes together, we found the pattern counts for two large industrial designs were reduced by approximately 1. 7 X to 2. 1 X, while th...|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{digital signal}} processing-free, {{low-cost}} and robust <b>synchronous</b> <b>clocking</b> technique is proposed and experimentally demonstrated, {{for the first}} time, in a 64 -QAM-encoded, 11. 25 Gb/s over 25 km SSMF, real-time end-to-end optical OFDM (OOFDM) system using directly modulated DFB laser-based intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IMDD). Detailed experimental investigations show that, {{in comparison with the}} common clock approach utilised in previous experimental demonstrations, the proposed clocking technique can be implemented to achieve no system BER performance degradation or optical power budget penalty and more importantly to improve system stability. As a viable <b>synchronous</b> <b>clocking</b> solution for real-time OOFDM transmission, this work is a vital step towards the realisation of practical OOFDM transmission systems and has particular significance for synchronisation of OOFDM multiple access-based passive optical networks where highly accurate synchronisation of all network elements is essential...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when designing large ASICs today is to distribute a low power <b>synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> over the whole chip {{and a lot of}} remedies to this problem has been proposed over the years. For Networks-on-Chip (NoC), where computational Resources are organised in a 2 -D mesh connected together through Switches in an on-chip interconnection network, another possibility exists: Globally Pseudochronous Locally <b>Synchronous</b> <b>clock</b> distribution. In this paper, we present a clocking scheme for NoCs that we call Globally Pseudochronous Locally Synchronous, in which we distribute a clock with a constant phase difference between the switches. As a consequence of the phase difference, some paths along the NoC switch network become faster than the others. We call these paths Data Motorways. By adapting the switching policy in the switches to prefer data to use the motorways, we show that the latency within the network is reduced with up to 40 % compared to a synchronous reference case. The phase difference between the resources also makes the circuit more tolerant to clock skew. It also distributes the current peaks more evenly across the clock period, which lead to a reduction in peak power, which in turn further reduces the clock skew and the jitter in the clock network...|$|E
