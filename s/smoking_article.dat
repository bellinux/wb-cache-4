40|$|We report {{here the}} results of studies documenting the {{contamination}} of a cigarette-appearing <b>smoking</b> <b>article</b> labeled Eclipse with glass fibers, fragments, and particles. Eclipse, {{a product of the}} R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR), was commercialized in June of 1996. Eclipse is unlike conventional cigarettes in that, like its predecessor Premier, it is designed to heat and not burn tobacco. The purpose of Eclipse was to simplify the chemical composition and reduce the biological activity of the mainstream and sidestream smoke and to achieve a significant reduction of environmental tobacco smoke. In Eclipse, tobacco pyrolysis is reduced by a carbon fuel rod that serves as a heat source for generating an aerosol having nicotine and tobacco flavor. The carbon rod, a...|$|E

Reported herein {{are the results}} of a study in which consumers were questioned about their opinions as to whether exposure to glass fibers in such a filter poses an added health risk beyond that from smoking and whether the manufacturer has an obligation to inform consumers about the glass contamination problem. The study queried 137 adults who were interviewed while waiting at a Division of Motor Vehicles office in Erie County, New York in 1997. All but one person expressed the view that the presence of glass fibers on the filters poses an added health risk beyond that associated with exposure to tobacco smoke alone. Nearly all expressed the position that the cigarette manufacturer has a duty to inform the public about the potential for glass exposure...|$|E
40|$|Objective. —To {{determine}} whether the conclusions of review articles on {{the health effects of}} passive smoking are associated with article quality, the affiliations of their authors, or other article characteristics. Data Sources. —Review articles published from 1980 to 1995 were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE and from a database of symposium proceedings on passive <b>smoking.</b> <b>Article</b> Selection. —An article was included if its stated or implied purpose was to review the scientific evidence that passive smoking is associated with 1 or more health outcomes. Articles were excluded if they did not focus specifically on the health effects of passive smoking or if they were not written in English. Data Extraction. —Review article quality was evaluated by 2 independent assessors who were trained, followed a written protocol, had no disclosed conflicts of interest, and were blinded to all study hypotheses and identifying characteristics of articles. Article conclusions were categorized by the 2 assessors and by one of the authors. Author affiliation was classified as either tobacco industry affiliated o...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{plausibility}} of health claims for Eclipse, a novel <b>smoking</b> <b>article</b> being mar-keted by the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) as potentially {{reducing the risk}} of cancer and other diseases compared to conventional cigarettes. Data sources: A company product website (www. eclipse. rjrt. com) summarising scientific studies of various versions of Eclipse, and the published review of these studies by an expert panel convened by RJR, an independent study comparing the smoke yields of major carcinogens from Eclipse and two low yield “ultralight ” brands (Now and Carlton), and an analysis of the levels of these compounds in Eclipse and Premier (its predecessor) over time. Analysis: The overall doses and effects of toxins in the aerosol from Eclipse are smaller than those from most conventional cigarettes on a per mg basis. However, two tests that compared Eclipse on a per cigarette basis revealed that Eclipse was as or more toxic than an ultralight cigarette. Studies show that consumers smoke Eclipse (like they do cigarettes) at puff volumes and puff frequencies far higher than those used for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) test. RJR’s test results, which are based on aerosols generated under FTC conditions, may not reflect actual human dosing, since the operating temperature of Eclipse is highly dependent on these puffing parameters. Even under FTC/International Organiza...|$|E
40|$|With {{the entry}} into force of the Second Tobacco Products Directive 1 (hereinafter TPD), new {{labelling}} requirements for tobacco products are being introduced for ensuring greater protection of public health. Notably, the TPD harmonises minimum requirements of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and its Guidelines, consisting of pictorial warnings and information about {{the harmful effects of}} <b>smoking</b> (<b>Article</b> 9 and 10 TPD), covering 65 % of the tobacco package 2, but also provides the possibility for Member States to introduce further more stringent measures (Article 24 (2) TPD). Only brand names in a standard font are allowed to be displayed on a package with neutral colour without any trademarks. 3 This thesis is specifically concerned with the effect of the TPD’s new labelling requirements (plain packaging) on the intellectual property rights (trademark rights) of the tobacco manufacturers. The justifications for the new limitations are considered from a broader EU perspective and from an Intellectual Property law one. The paper reflects on the character of protection that there is no deprivation nor expropriation of property, but a mere control of use and that the right conferred upon registration of a mark is ius excludenti alios and not a right to use. These justifications are based on examination of case law, legislation provisions and it is relied on the surveys approved by the WHO and made post-implementation of plain packaging in Australia. However, it is suggested that the use of trademarks has become an indispensable part of the economic reality and through plain packaging the trademark proprietors’ interests are being undermined. Consequently, it is argued that the new regime is oppressive towards the interests of the trademark proprietors and is not the most effective for attaining the public health objective, by drawing upon sociological and economical research. Finally, the thesis criticises a plain packaging regime as being detrimental to trademark owners and its potential spillover effect to other industries, the risk of increase of illicit trade and counterfeits, which will cause a whole area of intellectual property to become redundant...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Malignancies {{account for}} {{more than a third of}} all deaths in human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -positive patients. Although acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related mortality is decreasing with the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of lung cancer in patients with HIV remains high. Lung cancer has now become the leading cause of mortality among the nonacquired immunodeficiency syndrome defining malignancies. Within the HIV population, the incidence of lung cancer is estimated to be approximately 2 to 4 times that of the general population. Often these patients present with advanced disease (stage III or IV) at a younger age and have an inferior overall survival, when compared with non-HIV patients. Development of lung cancer in patients with HIV has been linked to various factors including immunosuppression, CD 4 count, viral load, and <b>smoking.</b> This <b>article</b> reviews the impact of HIV on the incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, and treatment of lung cancer...|$|R

40|$|The European Smoking Tobacco Association (ESTA) in {{conjunction}} with the Joint Research Centre of the European Union (JRC) agreed to a joint experiment to determine the variability of data from routine smoking of fine-cut <b>smoking</b> <b>articles.</b> The study was conducted in four phases, each phase taking approximately six months to complete. Each phase consisted of the analysis of three commercially available brands of fine-cut tobacco. The tobacco and tubes for each phase were distributed to each participating laboratory by the manufacturing company. As a result of the co-operation 19 laboratories began this study by taking part in phase 1. Five of these laboratories are directly responsible for, or contracted to provide, analysis of tobacco products for five national Governments within the European Union. Two laboratories were independent contract laboratories and the remainder were associated with the tobacco industry. As a result of company mergers and takeovers or laboratory closures, the number of laboratories that completed all four phases was reduced to 14. The procedures outlined in method ISO 125592 - 3 were followed throughout. At each phase, each laboratory was required to make four samples according to the protocol using two papers at each of the two weights specified in the method. One hundred FCSAs of each sample were smoked and analysed for each phase using the smoking machine normally used in that laboratory. Each laboratory analysed the samples for NFDPM and nicotine yield. As not all laboratories were able to analyse carbon monoxide, this was not a requirement of the protocol for the study but those laboratories that were able to do so were invited to submit data. The data was analysed on completion of each phase and in total at the completion of the study. The poster provided details of the protocol for the study and also the main data for NFDPM and nicotine with limited data for CO. The conclusions of the study suggest that a higher tolerance will be required for the analysis of FCSAs than for manufactured cigarettes. Nevertheless, the study suggested that the analysis outlined in the ISO/CORESTA method is viable. Proposed values were presented and discussed. JRC. I. 5 -Physical and chemical exposure...|$|R

Discussion: Evidence based approaches to smoking cessation include brief counselling, pharmacotherapy, referral to a specialised Service such as Quitline, and follow up. The five As approach - Ask, Assess, Advise, Assist and Arrange follow up - provides a structure for intervention. Smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion) have been shown to double quit rates. A new pharmacotherapy (varenicline) has recently become available which evidence to date suggests is more effective.
