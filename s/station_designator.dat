50|$|The U.S. Army built a top-secret {{communications}} {{station on}} this site during World War II. The Coast Guard took possession on July 1, 1971 and converted {{it into a}} training facility.Up until that time, the facility {{was one of the}} major radio intercept posts in the U.S., referred to by a Monitoring <b>Station</b> <b>Designator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vint Hill Farms Station was {{established}} during World War II in 1942 by the Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS). The 701 acre facility was built because the Army needed a secure location near SIS headquarters in Arlington Hall {{to serve as}} a cryptography school and as a refitting station for signal units returning from combat prior to redeployment overseas. The unit on station had a World War II Monitoring <b>Station</b> <b>Designator</b> of MS-1. VHFS was one of the United States' most important intelligence gathering stations during the war, playing a pivotal role in eavesdropping on enemy communications. In 1943, the VHFS intercepted a message from the Japanese ambassador in Berlin to his superiors in Tokyo. It also provided a detailed description of Nazi fortifications along the French Coast, and General Dwight D. Eisenhower later said the information made a significant contribution to the D-Day invasion at Normandy.|$|E

50|$|Monitoring <b>Station</b> <b>Designators</b> {{were used}} by the United States Army Signals Intelligence Service to {{designate}} a specific signal intelligence monitoring station {{in order to allow}} analysts to understand the source and type of SIGINT they were analyzing. These were used as shorthand rather than writing or typing out the PLA (Plain Language Address), which consisted of the formal unit name and location of the unit who performed the signals collection.|$|R

5000|$|This {{transmission}} {{is from the}} <b>station</b> whose <b>designator</b> immediately follows. For clarity, the station called should be named before the station calling. So, [...] "Mike Juliet zero, this is Golf Whiskey three..." [...] or for brevity, [...] "Mike Juliet zero, Golf Whiskey three, roger and out". Never [...] "This is GW3 calling MJ0", [...] "Ground control to Major Tom" [...] nor any other reversed combination.|$|R
