5|$|Within the Quichean sub-branch K'iche' (Quiché), the Mayan {{language}} {{with the largest}} number of speakers, is <b>spoken</b> <b>by</b> around 1,000,000 K'iche' Maya in the Guatemalan highlands, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the Cuchumatán mountains, as well as by urban emigrants in Guatemala City. The famous Maya mythological document, Popol Vuh, is written in an antiquated K'iche' often called Classical K'iche' (or Quiché). The K'iche' culture was at its pinnacle {{at the time of the}} Spanish conquest. Q'umarkaj, near the present-day city of Santa Cruz del Quiché, was its economic and ceremonial center. Achi is <b>spoken</b> <b>by</b> 85,000 people in Cubulco and Rabinal, two municipios of Baja Verapaz. In some classifications, e.g. the one by Campbell, Achi is counted as a form of K'iche'. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as K'iche'. The Kaqchikel language is <b>spoken</b> <b>by</b> about 400,000 people in an area stretching from Guatemala City westward to the northern shore of Lake Atitlán. Tz'utujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán.
