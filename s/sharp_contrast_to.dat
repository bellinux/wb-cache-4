5|$|Differences between Chinese and Khitan society {{included}} {{gender roles}} and marital practices: the Khitans {{took a more}} egalitarian view towards gender, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Chinese cultural practices that segregated men's and women's roles. Khitan women were taught to hunt, managed family property, and held military posts. Many marriages were not arranged, women {{were not required to}} be virgins at their first marriage, and women had the right to divorce and remarry.|$|E

5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all the trappings of a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|In <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{the mostly}} mild {{weather in the}} first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the {{continent}} was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
50|$|In July 1946 Malbrant {{organized}} the States General of Colonization (a congress of French colonists, held in Paris). The convention gathered colonists that opposed giving French citizenships to {{the inhabitants of}} the overseas territories collectively. Through the pressure from these colonists, in October the same year the National Assembly adopted new draft constitutions for the overseas territories (which were in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> the ones adopted by the National Assembly in April 1946).|$|R
50|$|More specifically, antithetical {{parallelism}} {{is defined}} as text where the meaning {{in the first part}} of the couplet contrasts with an opposite theme contained in the second part (see above). The use of opposites clarifies both extremes. In poetry the use of opposites can bring a <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> an image and provide a greater focus to the desired message. It is often marked by the use of the conjunction ‘but’, placed between two statements to juxtapose them and helps the reader or to view both the positive and negative perspectives of the text.|$|R

5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, {{as part of his}} doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, {{an explanation of}} almost 200 glyphs. His work {{was believed to be}} authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} three {{versions}} of the [...] "Steve" [...] character, the creators having twice made considerable adjustments to his design. Steve's initial design ended up being a one-off execution limited to the unaired precursory pilot (not {{to be confused with}} the series premiere, entitled [...] "Pilot"). By the season premiere, Scott Grimes had begun voicing Steve, and his design was made taller, more filled out, and less geeky. After early seasons of the series, Steve was remodeled again. This time he was made softer, more emotional, cuter and more endearing, creating a <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> his father Stan's ruggedness and machismo.|$|R
40|$|First-principles {{study of}} BO 2 complex in B-doped Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) reveals a novel, self-trapping-enhanced carrier {{recombination}} mechanism, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> the standard fixed-level Shockley-Read-Hall theory for carrier recombination. We {{found that an}} O 2 dimer, distant from any B, would cause only weak carrier recombination under illumination [...] only enough to drive its diffusion to find B and form the BO 2 complexes. Surprisingly, BO 2 and O 2 produce nearly identical defect gap states. Despite this, recombination at BO 2 is substantially faster than that at O 2, because the charge state of the latter inhibits hole capture, the key step for such recombination...|$|R
2500|$|Conversi rarely (if ever) set verse {{by living}} poets, preferring {{writers such as}} Petrarch, Pietro Bembo, Castiglione, and Luca Contile. [...] Nowhere is his {{tendency}} <b>to</b> use <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> underline and enhance his texts more apparent than in his setting of Petrarch's Zefiro torna, a setting which was evidently known to Claudio Monteverdi, whose own version in his Sixth Book of Madrigals is considerably more famous. [...] The form of the poem is a Petrarchan sonnet, and Conversi sets the octave, which celebrates the return of springtime, with a quick and light patter of notes drawn from the pastoral Neapolitan canzona; and the sestet, in which the lover mourns {{the loss of his}} beloved, arrives in a sombre and slow G minor.|$|R
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5000|$|The House of the Faun {{was named}} for the bronze statue of the dancing faun located, originally, {{on the lip of}} the impluvium, a basin for {{catching}} rainwater; it has been moved {{to the center of the}} impluvium, as seen in the adjacent picture. Fauns are spirits of untamed woodland, which literate and Hellenized Romans often connected to Pan and Greek satyrs, or wild followers of the Greek god of wine and agriculture, Dionysus. It is purely decorative sculpture of a high order: [...] "the pose is light and graceful," [...] Sir Kenneth Clark observed, the modeling well understood, the general sense of movement admirably sustained," [...] though he missed in its suavity the stimulus of <b>sharper</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> be found in Renaissance nudes.|$|R

25|$|Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised, however, {{on the basis}} that some female primates show both extended female sexuality and sexual swellings. In terms of Hrdy's hypothesis these two concepts are incompatible. Sexual swellings appear only during the most fertile phase of the female's ovarian cycle, with the purpose of advertising fertility. In <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast,</b> according <b>to</b> Hrdy, extended sexuality is adapted to conceal fertility and ensure mating across all stages of the ovarian cycle, to aid paternity confusion.|$|R
5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1950–51 season with an unbeaten 201 in a Shield match against Queensland. At 438minutes, {{it was his}} longest {{first-class}} innings. In the return match, he scored 138notout in just 118minutes in a successful run-chase, a <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> his double-century. In a tour match against the visiting England team at the SCG before the Test series, Miller scored 214, having been 99notout at stumps on the previous day. He hit 15 fours and three sixes. However, he made ducks in consecutive matches leading into the First Test in Brisbane. Miller scored 15 and eight on a rain-affected pitch, and took match figures of 3/50 in an Australian victory, dismissing Dewes twice. He had another quiet match in the Second Test, scoring 18 and 14 and taking a match total of 2/55. After struggling {{in the first two}} Tests, Miller rediscovered his batting form with 98 against the tourists for New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the Earl, Fisher was a {{teetotaler}} and a vegetarian, and he hoped {{she would be a}} calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E

50|$|Park Yongrae’s poetic {{career was}} {{essentially}} quaratpartite. Beginning in the mid-1940s until {{the publication of}} his first collection Snow Grains (Ssarangnun), primarily exposits upon a motif of the primal consciousness of loneliness and despair. The poems from the second period of his career, which includes all the work after Snow Grains (Ssarangnun) until the published collection of Foxtails (Gangajipul), focus upon the purity of natural phenomena, celebrating it as such devoid from the artifice and pretense that contaminates the world constructed by man. Park’s poetry from his third stage of writing, after the publication of Foxtails (Gangajipul) to the publication of Baekbarui Kkotdaegung, provides a <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the poems of the two previous stages of Park’s career. These poems, unlike those of the first two periods which celebrated a rustic lyrical consciousness, also include tentative explorations of relationships between man, as well as addressing address the weighty specter of death.|$|R

40|$|The study empirically and {{systematically}} examines the YouTube presence of candidates during the 2012 Republican presidential nomination campaign. The Internet broadcast yourself world of YouTube offers some <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> the television broadcast world. Unlike on television, candidates {{and the news}} media are being challenged by citizens in shaping their video presence on YouTube. Interest groups that leverage financial resources to force viewers to watch broadcast advertisements are marginalized on YouTube where accidental exposure is limited. While the broadcast world converges on a few video formats, YouTube campaign videos exhibit substantial diversity of format. 3 One dimension of the modern grassroots political campaign is the competition to shape the video presence of candidates. In the broadcast world, candidates {{and the news media}} have enjoyed a privileged position through televised ads, news stories, and debates. As software improvements are democratizing video production and YouTube is democratizing video distribution, there is now the potential for the video presence of candidates to reflect a greater diversity of producers and formats.

5000|$|Unlike the {{original}} era of court shows, the 2nd era {{consists of a}} great deal of ethnic and racial diversity. Few pay much attention to the shifting demographics of court show judges. In 2001, reportedly 7 of 10 judges were male; however 6 of these judges were black, comprising 4 black males and 2 black females. Only 4 were white. By 2008, female television judges had outnumbered their male counterparts. Additionally, 4 judges were Latina/o and another four were black. Judy Sheindlin and David Young (an openly gay male) were the only non-Hispanic whites. It has been argued, however, that television judge demographics can distort images of real-life judge demographics. Real-life judge demographics show <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> television judge demographics. Women are only 18.6% of federal judges and about 20% of state judges. Only 3% of judges are black in the United States. Overwhelmingly, American judges are white males.
