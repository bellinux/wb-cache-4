The best-known practical example of the extraction of biological agents using <b>supercritical</b> <b>liquids</b> is probably the extraction of caffeine from unroasted coffee beans.

The specific goal of this project is research on the extraction of biological agents from plant matrices, specifically from red clover, sage and rapeseed, and the treatment of heterogenic matrices like wood or paper, which is possible with hydrophobic substances by means of supercritical carbon dioxide. During the course of the extraction and treatment experiments, researchers will explore the impact of a wide variety of parameters on the matrix and the products.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{design tool}} which emphasizes {{the analysis of}} flowfields near the injector face of liquid rocket engines has been developed and used to simulate preliminary configurations of NASA's Fastrac and vortex engines. This computational design tool is sufficiently detailed to predict {{the interactive effects of}} injector element impingement angles and points and the momenta of the individual orifice flows and the combusting flow which results. In order to simulate a significant number of individual orifices, a homogeneous computational fluid dynamics model was developed. To describe sub- and <b>supercritical</b> <b>liquid</b> and vapor flows, the model utilized thermal and caloric equations of state which were valid over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. The model was constructed such that the local quality of the flow was determined directly. Since both the Fastrac and vortex engines utilize RP- 1 /LOX propellants, a simplified hydrocarbon combustion model was devised in order to accomplish three-dimensional, multiphase flow simulations.

40|$|Using a pore {{network model}} to {{represent}} porous media we investigate adsorption-desorption processes {{over the entire}} range of the relative pressure, highlighting in particular capillary condensation. The model incorporates recent advances from density functional theory for adsorption-desorption in narrow pores (of order as low as 1 nm), which improve upon the traditional multi-layer adsorption and Kelvin's equation for phase change and provide for the dependence of the critical pore size on temperature. The limited accessibility of the pore network gives rise to hysteresis in the adsorption-desorption cycle. This is due to the blocking of larger pores, where adsorbed liquid is allowed to but cannot desorb, by smaller pores containing liquid that may not desorb. By allowing for the existence of <b>supercritical</b> <b>liquid</b> in pores in the nm range, it is found that the hysteresis area increases with an increase in temperature, in agreement with experiments of water adsorption-desorption in rock samples from The Geysers.

40|$|Recent {{advance in}} {{understanding}} the supercritical state posits {{the existence of a}} new line above the critical point separating two physically distinct states of matter: rigid liquid and non-rigid gas-like fluid. The location of this line, the Frenkel line, remains unknown for important real systems. Here, we map the Frenkel line on the phase diagram of supercritical iron using molecular dynamics simulations. On the basis of our data, we propose a general recipe to locate the Frenkel line for any system, the recipe that importantly does not involve system-specific detailed calculations and relies on the knowledge of the melting line only. We further discuss the relationship between the Frenkel line and the metal-insulator transition in <b>supercritical</b> <b>liquid</b> metals. Our results enable predicting the state of supercritical iron in several conditions of interest. In particular, we predict that liquid iron in the Jupiter core is in the "rigid liquid" state and is highly conducting. We finally analyse the evolution of iron conductivity in the core of smaller planets such as Earth and Venus as well as exoplanets: as planets cool off, the supercritical core undergoes the transition to the rigid-liquid conducting state at the Frenkel line.
