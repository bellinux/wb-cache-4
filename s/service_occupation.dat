50|$|The <b>Service</b> <b>Occupation</b> Tax {{is imposed}} upon the {{privilege}} of engaging in service businesses and {{is measured by the}} selling price of tangible personal property transferred as an incident to providing a service. The Service Use Tax is imposed upon {{the privilege of}} using or consuming tangible personal property transferred as an incident to the provision of a service. An example would be a printer of business cards. The printer owes <b>Service</b> <b>Occupation</b> Tax on the value of the paper and ink transferred to the customer in the form of printed business cards. The serviceperson may satisfy this tax by paying Use Tax to his supplier of paper and ink or, alternatively, may charge Service Use Tax to the purchaser of the business cards and remit the amount collected as <b>Service</b> <b>Occupation</b> Tax on the serviceperson's tax return. The service itself, however, is not subject to tax.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the {{increase}} in service output on the demand for different categories of <b>service</b> <b>occupations</b> in the EU manufacturing sector. Furthermore, we investigate {{the impact of}} the global sourcing of producer services on the demand for different <b>service</b> <b>occupations.</b> Using fixed-effects models based on the manufacturing sector for 18 EU countries for the period 1995 - 2008, we find that the employment share of <b>service</b> <b>occupations</b> is significantly and positively related to the output share of producer services in manufacturing. In particular, the increase in the output share of services accounts for an average of 13 percent of the increase in the share of <b>service</b> <b>occupations.</b> When <b>service</b> <b>occupations</b> are disaggregated by different categories, we find that the output share of services is significantly and positively related to the share of managers, professionals, and technicians. In contrast, <b>service</b> <b>occupations</b> involving clerks, administrative support, and other office-related personnel do not benefit from increasing service revenues. Finally, professionals and technicians are complementary to intermediate producer services (either from domestic or foreign suppliers), while clerks do not benefit from the rise in intermediate service inputs in manufacturing. ...|$|R

40|$|A b s t r a c t Individual dentists and {{organized}} dentistry alike invariably {{claim to be}} (members of) a profession. This label is cherished because it suggests special social, moral and political status. However, almost every self-respecting occupation nowadays {{claims to be a}} profession. Hence, the question arises as to what exactly is meant when dentists claim to be professionals and, more important, whether they can justifiably lay claim to this label. Rather than reviewing the manifold and divergent discussions in the literature about professionalism, the author proposes — in this first of 3 consecutive articles — a definition of the term “profession ” that is based on the literal origins of the word. Next, it is argued that a profession arises out of a social contract between the public and a <b>service</b> <b>occupation</b> that professes to give priority to the existential needs of the people served.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} and to identify groups {{at high risk of}} tuberculosis (TB) among South African gold miners. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was carried out with hospital and personnel databases on a random sample of the workforce of Freegold Mines, served by Ernest Oppenheimer Hospital, Welkom, South Africa. The outcome measure of interest was a reported first episode of TB while employed at Freegold. A person-years analysis was carried out to estimate incidence ratios between different categories of age group, period, cumulative service, mining occupation, and silicosis status. A separate analysis was carried out on a subgroup of men (non-random) whose HIV status was known. RESULTS: The main finding of the study was that TB was more strongly associated with age than expected with a rate ratio of reported incidence of 21 for the oldest age group compared with the youngest, after adjustment for period, cumulative <b>service,</b> <b>occupation,</b> and silicosis status. There was also a significant association between TB and occupations such as drilling with a rate ratio of 2. 3 compared with low dust surface and maintenance workers, after adjustment for age, period, cumulative service, and silicosis. Analysis of the HIV tested subgroup showed that these results are unlikely {{to be the result of}} confounding due to HIV infection. Prevalence of HIV in this group has been rising sharply since 1991, but the increase was slowing towards the end of the study period. CONCLUSION: A profile of mineworkers who are at high risk of TB can be defined by age, mining occupation, silicosis status, and HIV infection with predicted rates of 100 / 1000 person-years. TB screening programmes should take special cognisance of high risk groups of gold miners...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has a dual purpose. Firstly {{to describe}} what funeral directors do and how they experience their work. Secondly to see if, {{and in that case}} how, funeral directors influence rites around the deceased, both official as well as more private rites. The study is based on text analysis, interviews with 32 funeral directors and field studies on four funeral parlours. Only funeral directors working at businesses that are members of Sveriges Begravningsbyråers Förbund (an association of funeral directors in Sweden), SBF are included. Different theories about stigma, body culture, rites and religiosity, and professionalisation are used to explain the experiences and thoughts of the funeral directors. The study shows that the funeral directors live with a double representation of their occupation. On the one side, as an occupation related to dead bodies, the occupation is "dirty" and strange, and can thus be a stigma in their social life. On the other side, the funeral directors are seen as experts on deceased persons, funerals and wills. To move away from the negative representation, the funeral directors focus their work on the bereaved families and their needs. The occupation should therefore be seen as dealing with life more than with death. The actual work conducted by the funeral directors is presented through field observations from the parlours, for example meetings with the bereaved family, dressings of the deceased, viewings, funeral services and interments of the urn. The study examines the professionalisation of the funeral directors in four different ways: by looking at the organisation, at the base of knowledge, at the acknowledgement and at the work on the specific task areas. The acknowledgement from society and the bereaved families has made it possible for the funeral directors to enter new task areas and the base of knowledge shows a change from a sales occupation to a <b>service</b> <b>occupation.</b> By leading rites surrounding the deceased, such as the viewing and the interment of the urn, the funeral directors have been able use the field of rites for their professionalisation...|$|E
40|$|Earth {{observation}} using small satellites {{is leaving}} demonstration status and being proposed {{for more and}} more commercial applications. By analysing such a service from both end-user and satellite operator point-of-view, it is hoped to provide the information such as service performance, on-board resource status and key parameters for system optimisation before the spacecraft is designed, launched and put into service. In this paper, queueing theory, traditionally used to perform tra_c and e_ciency analysis in tele-communication and other queueing system, is applied in this new area - a commercial imaging service using small satellites. The introduction of queueing theory in our application will eliminate the main di_culty of using the traditional solution - operation simulation which is huge computational complexity that arises when the operation spans a long period. In this paper, only the imaging download process, which is usually the system bottleneck for Low Earth Observation spacecraft, will be analyzed. Unlike traditional queueing systems where the service is continuous, our application su_ers regular idle periods when the satellite is not visible from the ground-station for image download. The distribution and duration of such idle periods are the subject of orbital-dynamics. Therefore available queueing theory is not applicable directly and needs some extension to handle this speci_c problem of satellite imaging services. In this paper, three queueing models are discussed: M/G/ 1, M/Gx/ 1 and GI/G/ 1 together with the analysis of their suitability to our application. An extension to using M/Gx/ 1 is outlined which can provide a better approximation of the service than traditional queueing models. Some basic service parameters, such as queue length distribution, mean <b>service</b> <b>occupation</b> and mean service waiting time, can thereby be calculated. All results presented are compared with that from operation simulation. Limitation and constraints of using queueing theory in this application are also discussed. As a conclusion of this research work, it is shown that queueing theory will be appropriate for the early stage performance analysis in a quick but gross manner which can provide some basic performance parameters, while operation simulation can be treated as a re_nement and a method capable of providing more complete solutions that will certainly take much longer time...|$|E
40|$|This study {{uses the}} service of Red Cross nursing sisters, African American health workers and male {{graduate}} nurses during the War of 1898 as a window into three vibrant occupational work cultures {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. The self-conscious crafting of war remembrance by nursing professionalizers fashioned the “Spanish-American War Nurse” into a white female graduate, disguising the fact that few such practitioners tended soldiers overseas between May and August 1898. Instead, nurses from other sectors of the variegated occupation supplemented enlisted hospital personnel. Recovering these wartime labors restores a cross-section of the period 2 ̆ 7 s nursing majority to the historical record, since the transplantation of workers from local contexts to labor alongside occupational rivals raised distinct work practices in high relief. ^ Traditional work cultures accommodated the progressive push for certified expertise without sacrificing established occupational identities or community standards of good care. The successful adaptation of Europe 2 ̆ 7 s nursing sisterhoods to North American shores redefined medical charity in urban neighborhoods, and changing standards of scientific practice found their place amidst a family model of organization and expressions of ethnic or religious belonging. Likewise, nascent southern African American institutions responded to calls for certified proficiency with curricula that reaffirmed age, experience, and other attributes of expertise that black nurses inherited from the skilled healing traditions of enslaved women. Finally, the rise of training schools for men at large general hospitals recognized a third occupational variant, the informal apprenticeship to physicians that made nursing a stepping stone to a medical career. ^ Sexuality played a central role in the definition, experience and evolution of this leading <b>service</b> <b>occupation.</b> The increasing institutionalization of nursing education and practice created new sites for the organization of romance. Concomitantly, intimate knowledge of the body, feminization, and longstanding associations between servitude and sexual availability made assertions of respectability central to the occupational identity of diverse practitioners. The lack of any exclusive claim to nursing knowledge also ensured the prominence of race- and class-coded accusations of sexual deviancy and disrepute in campaigns to discredit rival practitioners and to combat occupational change. ...|$|E
