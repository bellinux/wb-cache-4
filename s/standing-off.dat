40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} the {{synthesis}} {{of a series of}} second-generation hyperbranched polyesters with a variable composition of alkyl-terminated groups. We observed that the chemical modification of the hyperbranched cores by substituting a controlled fraction of the terminal hydroxyl groups with hydrophobic alkyl chains is an effective method for a controlling amphiphilic balance of hyperbranched cores with a degree of branching of 50 %. Even for imperfect cores, the chemical reaction of hydroxyl groups alkyl tails was very efficient. In fact, the number of attached alkyl tails was fairly close to the theoretical value {{based on the assumption that}} all targeted hydroxyl groups were available for the reaction despite their different interior/exterior location. Detailed microstructural analysis of the structure revealed that organized monolayers could be formed at the air-water interface if the number of alkyl tails was higher than two per core. Similar to regular dendrimers, the alkyl tails of hyperbranched molecules at high surface pressure form intramonolayer ordering of the quasi-hexagonal type. However, higher defectness and irregularities of the hyperbranched cores are responsible for poor intralayer ordering of alkyl tails in comparison with regular dendrimers. At high surface pressure, the alkyl tails became arranged in an up-right orientation. The highly water-swollen state of the hyperbranched cores of prolate shape and the partially submerged and <b>standing-off</b> alkyl tails is a characteristic of hyperbranched molecules with fewer alkyl chains in condensed monolayer state at the air-water interface. The core structure is transformed into the oblate, flattened state with preservation of <b>standing-off</b> orientation of the alkyl tails for hyperbranched molecules with crowded outer shells...|$|E
40|$|High {{velocity}} oxyfuel (HVOF) {{thermal spraying}} {{is one of}} the most significant developments in the thermal spray industry since the development of the original plasma spray technique. The first investigation deals with the combustion and discrete particle models within the general purpose commercial CFD code FLUENT to solve the combustion of kerosene and couple the motion of fuel droplets with the gas flow dynamics in a Lagrangian fashion. The effects of liquid fuel droplets on the thermodynamics of the combusting gas flow are examined thoroughly showing that combustion process of kerosene is independent on the initial fuel droplet sizes. The second analysis copes with the full water cooling numerical model, which can assist on thermal performance optimisation or to determine the best method for heat removal without the cost of building physical prototypes. The numerical results indicate that the water flow rate and direction has noticeable influence on the cooling efficiency but no noticeable effect on the gas flow dynamics within the thermal spraying gun. The third investigation deals with the development and implementation of discrete phase particle models. The results indicate that most powder particles are not melted upon hitting the substrate to be coated. The oxidation model confirms that HVOF guns can produce metallic coating with low oxidation within the typical <b>standing-off</b> distance about 30 cm.

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{diagnostic}} between two different {{states of the}} local interstellar medium (LISM) near our solar system using a sensitivity study constrained by several distinct and complementary observations of the LISM, solar wind, and inner heliosphere. Assuming the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) He flow parameters for the LISM, we obtain a strength of ∼ 2. 7 ± 0. 2 μG and a direction pointing away from galactic coordinates (28, 52) ± 3 ^∘ for the interstellar magnetic field as resulting from fitting Voyager 1 & 2 in situ plasma measurements and IBEX energetic neutral atoms ribbon. When using Ulysses parameters for the LISM He flow, we recently reported the same direction but a strength of 2. 2 ± 0. 1 μG. First, we notice that with Ulysses He flow, our solution is in the expected hydrogen deflection plane (HDP). In contrast, for the IBEX He flow, the solution is ∼ 20 ^∘ away from the corresponding HDP plane. Second, the long-term monitoring of the interplanetary H I flow speed shows a value of ∼ 26 km/s measured at upwind from the Doppler-shift in the strong Lyman-α sky background emission line. All elements of diagnostics seem therefore to support Ulysses He flow parameters for the interstellar state. In that frame, we argue that reliable discrimination between superfast, subfast, or superslow states of the interstellar flow {{should be based on}} most existing in situ and remote observations used together with global modelling of the heliosphere. For commonly accepted LISM ionization rates, we show that a fast interstellar bow-shock should be <b>standing-off</b> upstream of the heliopause. Comment: Astrophysical Journal, in pres...|$|E
