5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, {{for a number of years}} in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.|$|E
25|$|One method Nilsson {{used for}} murdering the {{children}} {{was to put}} them into a washtub and then place heavy objects—such as a washboard and coal scuttle—on top of them. She then left the room and returned hours later when the children were dead. The next step in her procedure was to burn their bodies. On occasions when she did not burn them, <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> graves and buried them.|$|E
2500|$|... "Start All Over", a song co-written by Dobson and {{featuring}} her on background vocals, {{was recorded}} by Miley Cyrus for her album [...] (2007) {{and was released}} as a single, reaching number 57 on the Billboard Pop 100. During a 2009 interview Dobson said, [...] "I wrote a song, <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> it, and she sang it. But I didn't want it for my record. It just wasn't right for me, and I just {{felt like it was}} better for someone else, and she does a great job on it. I was really impressed. She sounded great. I'm actually happier she did it than I did it." ...|$|E

60|$|Whereupon <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> {{him with}} her spurs. Sage King snorted. His action shifted marvelously. Thunder rolled from under his hoofs. And he broke out of that {{clattering}} roar into his fleet stride, where his hoof-beats were swift, regular, rhythmic.|$|E
60|$|As for St. Auban, Vilmorin's flight {{left him}} unequal {{to the task}} of {{dragging}} the girl along. <b>She</b> <b>dug</b> her heels into the ground, and, tug as he might, for all that he set both hands to work, he could not move her. In this plight I came upon him, and challenged him to stand and face me.|$|E
60|$|Little {{did good}} Miss Stivergill imagine that <b>she</b> had <b>dug</b> a mine that night under Rosebud Cottage, {{and that the}} match which was destined to light it {{was none other than}} her {{innocent}} protegee, little Bones.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{never make}} another; {{but it will}} save my dresses from ink-stains, so I'm glad I've got it'; and the erudite Miss Pierson laboured on, finding it a harder task than any Greek root <b>she</b> ever <b>dug</b> up.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{accordingly}} <b>dug</b> {{a hole in}} {{the sand}} with her fingers, and put the potatoes in, and then after covering them, over with the sand, she went to the oven to get her fire-pan for her watering-pot, in order to water her garden.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>dug</b> {{away at the}} red plush {{with the}} hatpin, picking out little bits and {{dropping}} them over the edge.

There's a time comes when things aren't going right, and you've had all you can stand, when you have got to tell somebody about it, no matter who it is.|$|E
60|$|When she exerted the {{pressure}} {{she cried out}} with pain, for she had succeeded only in hurting herself. Billy grinned at her futility. <b>She</b> <b>dug</b> her thumbs into his neck in imitation of the Japanese death touch, then gazed ruefully at the bent ends of her nails. She punched him smartly {{on the point of}} the chin, and again cried out, this time to the bruise of her knuckles.|$|E
6000|$|Charley, {{the sheep}} herder! Then the {{thunderbolt}} {{of his words}} burst upon her, and she collapsed to the cold stones. She lay quivering from head to toe. <b>She</b> <b>dug</b> her fingers into the moss and lichen. [...] "Oh, God, to think--after all--it happened!" [...] she moaned. There had been a rending within her breast, as of physical violence, from which she now suffered anguish. There were a thousand stinging nerves. There was a mortal sickness of horror, of insupportable heartbreaking loss. She could not endure it. She could not live under it.|$|E

60|$|Since their {{separation}} no greeting or look {{had ever}} passed between husband and wife. When they met, as they occasionally did, neither impassive face changed.

60|$|Her lapses of {{consciousness}} continued. The strangest {{thing she did}} while in such condition was on Sandy Beach. There she discovered herself, one windy afternoon, lying in a hole <b>she</b> had <b>dug,</b> with sacks for blankets. She had even roofed the hole in rough fashion by means of drift wood and marsh grass. On top of the grass she had piled sand.|$|R
6000|$|She smiled her restrained, Chaldean smile. [...] "Because I KNOW Sebastian," [...] she answered, quietly. [...] "I {{can read}} that {{man to the}} core. He is simple as a book.

He goes straight for his ends; and whatever comes in his way," [...] <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> her little heel in the brown soil, [...] "he tramples on it as ruthlessly as a child will trample on a worm or a beetle." ...|$|E
60|$|Her vague, unreal {{existence}} continued. It {{seemed in}} some previous life-time that Billy had gone away, that another life-time {{would have to}} come before he returned. She still suffered from insomnia. Long nights passed in succession, during which she never closed her eyes. At other times she slept through long stupors, waking stunned and numbed, scarcely able to open her heavy eyes, to move her weary limbs. The pressure of the iron band on her head never relaxed. She was poorly nourished. Nor had she a cent of money. She often went a whole day without eating. Once, seventy-two hours elapsed without food passing her lips. <b>She</b> <b>dug</b> clams in the marsh, knocked the tiny oysters from the rocks, and gathered mussels.|$|E
60|$|At length, {{one morning}} early, a cock began to crow {{so loud that}} she could sleep no longer and as he {{continued}} to crow she seemed to understand what he was saying, and that he was telling her that Djulung was dead, killed and eaten by her sisters, and that his bones lay buried under the kitchen fire. Very softly she got up, and took up the large stone under the fire, and creeping out carried the bones to the cave by the fountain, where <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> a hole and buried them anew. And as she scooped out the hole with a stick she sang a song, bidding the bones grow till they became a tree--a tree that reached up so high into the heavens that its leaves would fall across the sea into another island, whose king would pick them up.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{how they}} feared her! Some widow {{standing}} on the grave mould <b>she</b> had <b>dug,</b> pointed as we passed {{to the body of}} Leo, uttering bitter words which I could not catch. Thereon her companions flung themselves upon her and felling her with fist and spade, prostrated themselves upon the ground, throwing dust on their hair in token of their submission to the priestess of Death.|$|R
60|$|The {{blade of}} the hoe was long, {{and it seemed}} very heavy. The girl was digging up the ground by {{standing}} upon the part which <b>she</b> had already <b>dug</b> and striking the hoe down into the hard ground a few inches back from where she had struck before.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{hearing of}} Li Jingye's rebellion, Empress Dowager Wu {{commissioned}} the general Li Xiaoyi (李孝逸), assisted by the generals Li Zhishi (李知十) and Ma Jingchen (馬敬臣), to attack Li Jingye. <b>She</b> also <b>dug</b> up {{the graves of}} Li Jingye's grandfather Li Ji and father Li Zhen, posthumously stripped them of their titles, and ordered that the clan have their family name changed from Li back to Li Ji's original family name of Xu. (Li Ji had been granted the imperial family name of Li after submitting to Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu in 619.) ...|$|R
60|$|Mainmast's {{first act}} was to kindle a large fire, into which {{she put a}} number of goodly-sized and rounded stones. While these were heating, <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> a large {{hole in the ground}} with a broken shovel, which was the only {{implement}} of husbandry possessed at that time by the community. This hole was the oven. The bottom of it she covered with fresh plantain leaves. The stones having been heated, were spread over the bottom of the hole and then covered with leaves. On this hotbed the carcass of the pig was placed, and another layer of leaves spread over it. Some more hot stones were placed above that, over which green leaves were strewn in bunches, and, finally, the whole was covered up with earth and rubbish piled up so as to keep in the heat.|$|E
60|$|When old Granny Fox found Prickly Porky, {{with his}} {{thousand}} little spears all pointing at her, standing {{between her and}} Peter Rabbit, she was the angriest old Fox ever seen. She didn't dare touch Prickly Porky, for she knew well enough {{what it would mean}} to get one of those sharp, barbed little spears in her skin. To think that she actually had caught Peter Rabbit and then lost him was too provoking! It was more than her temper, never of the best, could stand. In her anger <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> up the leaves and earth with her hind feet, and all the time her tongue fairly flew as she called Prickly Porky, Jimmy Skunk, and Unc' Billy Possum everything bad she could think of. Her yellow eyes snapped so that it seemed almost as if sparks of fire flew from them. It made Peter shiver just to look at her.|$|E
60|$|One day the mother-otter {{appeared}} on the bank among {{the roots of the}} great tree under which was their secret doorway. That was surprising, for up to this time both otters had always approached it from the river, and were never seen on the bank near their den. She appeared to be digging, but was immensely cautious about it, looking, listening, sniffing continually. I had never gone near the place for fear of frightening them away; and it was months afterward, when the den was deserted, before I examined it to understand just what she was doing. Then I found that she had made another doorway from her den leading out to the bank. She had selected the spot with wonderful cunning,--a hollow under a great root that would never be noticed,--and <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> from inside, carrying the earth down to the river bottom, so that there should be nothing about the tree to indicate the haunt of an animal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the cartoon}} {{continuity}} Young Justice, it is revealed that Danette Reilly was secretly an android built by T.O. Morrow, who built her to infiltrate the Justice Society. Many {{years after her}} supposed death, <b>she</b> was <b>dug</b> up, reactivated, and christened [...] "Red Inferno" [...] by an android duplicate of her creator. She was sent alongside Red Torpedo, another of Morrow's former infiltrators, to capture Red Tornado, following which Red Tornado convinced her and Red Torpedo to destroy the Morrow android's latest creation, the apocalyptic Red Volcano, in a suicide attack. This succeeded, and Morrow's plot to destroy humanity was foiled.|$|R
60|$|There is {{something}} very sweet and juvenile and innocent and pretty about these little tinsel vanities, these grave apings of monarchical fuss and feathers and ceremony, here on our ostentatiously democratic soil. She is the same lady that we found in the Autobiography, who was so naively vain of all that little ancestral military riffraff that <b>she</b> had <b>dug</b> up and annexed. A person's nature never changes. What it is in childhood, it remains. Under pressure, or a change of interest, it can partially or wholly disappear from sight, and for considerable stretches of time, but nothing can ever permanently modify it, nothing can ever remove it.|$|R

6000|$|PAGE 73. l. 385. wormy circumstance, ghastly detail. Keats envies the un-self-conscious {{simplicity}} of the old ballad-writers in treating such a theme as this, and bids the reader turn to Boccaccio, whose description of the scene he cannot hope to rival. Boccaccio writes: 'Nor had <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> long before she found the body of her hapless lover, whereon as yet there was no trace of corruption or decay; and thus she saw without any manner of doubt that her vision was true. And so, saddest of women, knowing that she might not bewail him there, she would gladly, if she could, have carried away the body and given it more honourable sepulture elsewhere; but as she might not do so, she took a knife, and, as best she could, severed the head from the trunk, and wrapped it in a napkin and laid it {{in the lap of}} the maid; and having covered the rest of the corpse with earth, she left the spot, having been seen by none, and went home.' ...|$|E
60|$|Herodotus [395] tells us, {{that there}} were two famous Queens of Babylon, Semiramis and Nitocris; and that the latter was more skilful: she observing that the Kingdom of the Medes, having subdued many cities, and among others Nineveh, was become great and potent, intercepted and {{fortified}} the passages out of Media into Babylonia; and the river which before was straight, she made crooked with great windings, that it might be more sedate and less apt to overflow: and {{on the side of the}} river above Babylon, in imitation of the Lake of Mœris in Egypt, <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> a Lake every way forty miles broad, to receive the water of the river, and keep it for watering the land. She built also a bridge over the river in the middle of Babylon, turning the stream into the Lake 'till the bridge was built. Philostratus saith, [396] that she made a bridge under the river two fathoms broad, meaning an arched vault over which the river flowed, and under which they might walk cross the river: he calls her Μηδεια, a Mede.|$|E
60|$|Already the head-sails and the main-sail {{had been}} raised, while a hundred willing hands poled her {{off from the}} wharf. Now the wind caught her; heeling over, and quivering with eagerness like an {{unleashed}} hound she flew through the opening {{and out into the}} Channel. She was a famous little schooner, the Marie Rose of Winchelsea, and under her daring owner Cock Badding, half trader and half pirate, had brought back into port many a rich cargo taken in mid-Channel, and paid for in blood rather than money. Small as she was, her great speed and the fierce character of her master had made her a name of terror along the French coast, and many a bulky Eastlander or Fleming as he passed the narrow seas had scanned the distant Kentish shore, fearing lest that ill-omened purple sail with a gold Christopher upon it should shoot out suddenly from the dim gray cliffs. Now she was clear of the land, with the wind on her larboard quarter, every inch of canvas set, and her high sharp bows smothered in foam, as <b>she</b> <b>dug</b> through the waves.|$|E
50|$|In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy {{role-playing}} game, {{a portable}} hole is a magic item. It generally resembles a circular cloth which {{is placed on}} a surface to create a hole.

However, if closed with a living creature inside without some form of air supply, {{they are likely to}} suffocate.

The first of these was {{the death of her}} father; later events that inspired her interest in death were the shooting of a prison escapee on the grounds of her Lexington, Virginia, farm and the death of her pet greyhound, Eva. Mann arranged for Eva's skin to be preserved by tanning and buried her body in a cage in order to prevent the remains from being carried off by wild animals. <b>She</b> later <b>dug</b> up the cage and photographed the dog's skeletal remains.

Chasing him down, Rebus learns {{that he worked}} with Tony El to attack Mitchison, and that they both were hired by a mysterious Mr. H. With Jack’s encouragement, Rebus finally gives up alcohol and cigarettes. Rebus begins to tie all the Johnny Bible killings to the oil industry, suspecting that he may well be an oilman. Rebus meets Marie, where she hands over information <b>she</b> has <b>dug</b> up on Weir; unaware that he is being watched by Bible John.
