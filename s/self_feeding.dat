5000|$|Self-esteem can {{be defined}} as how favorably {{individuals}} evaluate themselves. According to Leary, self-esteem is the relationship between one’s real self and one’s ideal <b>self,</b> <b>feeding</b> off of favorable behaviors. It refers to an individual's sense of his or her value or worth, or {{the extent to which a}} person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes him or herself. Self-esteem is generally considered the evaluative component of the self-concept, a broader representation of the self that includes cognitive and behavioral aspects as well as evaluative or affective ones. There are several different proposals as to the functions of self-esteem. One proposal includes to satisfy the inherent need to feel good about one self. Another one would be to minimize social rejection [...] Self-esteem is also known as A way for a person to remain dominant in relationships (Barkow, 1980). Self-esteem is known to protect people from fear that has potential of arising from the prospect of death- terror management theory. Self-esteem helps motivate people to achieve their goals- high self-esteem leading to coping in situations and low self-esteem leading to avoidance.|$|E

40|$|Metamorphosis {{is defined}} as the change {{in the form of the}} {{organism}} due to the dramatic developmental reprogramming. This developmental reprogramming is generally seen in those animals where the post embryonic stages of an animal are different from that of the adult. These post embryonic stages are called larvae. Metamorphosis is thus a change from completely different form that is larva to the adult. Direct and indirect development: As we have studied earlier, that egg laying animals are called oviparous but those animals which give birth to young ones are called viviparous. In oviparous animals, the egg stores reserve food material in the form of yolk. In vertebrates eggs have been categorized on the basis of amount and distribution of yolk. The polylecithal eggs with large amount of yolk can cater to the nutritional requirements of the growing embryo totally, therefore, there is no larval stage in their developmental history as exemplified by the eggs of reptiles and birds.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the functional {{relationships between the}} diet, foraging behaviour and life history traits of crested tern populations in South Australia between 2004 and 2008. Diet analyses indicated that crested terns are a generalist predator on surface-schooling fishes. Clupeiform fish (Australian anchovy Engraulis australis, sardine Sardinops sagax) comprised a large component of the diet of crested terns. Ontogenetic differences in prey size indicated that adults selected small prey for their chicks during early provisioning but increased the size and rate of prey delivered throughout the breeding season as chicks grew. Adults also selected higher quality prey for their chicks compared to what they consumed themselves. Chick and adult diets may have reflected spatial differences in the species composition of prey assemblages near colonies and a North-South gradient in prey size. I also investigated the provisioning patterns of crested terns and how reproductive timing and adult body condition affect the growth and survival of crested tern chicks. Provisioning rates {{were related to the}} daily mass change of chicks, and chick growth was correlated with asymptotic mass, suggesting that prey availability and adult foraging proficiency influences fledgling size. Parental ‘quality’ affected reproductive performance. Adults with good body condition hatched chicks earlier and early breeding was positively related to hatchling mass, fledgling condition and chick survival. Adults aged < 7 years had significantly poorer body condition and hatched their chicks later compared to adults ≥ 7 years. However, adult body condition also varied within cohorts, indicating that reproductive performance is affected by phenotypic differences in parental quality. Consequently, the growth of crested tern populations may be most sensitive to the foraging behaviour and reproductive output of high quality adults ≥ 7 years old. Disease-related mortality events in 1995 and 1998, which killed ~ 70 % of adult sardine Sardinops sagax biomass, provided an opportunity to assess whether crested tern populations were affected by decreases in prey abundance. Age-specific information collected from adults indicated that chicks reared during poor prey conditions caused by the first sardine mortality event in 1995 exhibited lower rates of recruitment to the breeding colony. Females from cohorts reared 0. 5 mg. m⁻³). Intra-specific variations in foraging behaviour reflected either prior knowledge of where prey aggregations exist, distinctions in individual niche use driven by the types or sizes of prey available, and/or alternate behavioural states (<b>self</b> <b>feeding</b> and provisioning). The restricted foraging range of crested terns while breeding may make them sensitive to competition with fisheries that operate within their foraging range. Diet and demographic information collected from crested tern populations may provide ecological performance indicators to enhance conservation strategies for crested tern populations and augment current fisheries management approaches.

40|$|We {{investigated}} ontogenetic, {{temporal and}} spatial patterns in the composition and size of prey in the diet of crested terns, Sterna bergii. Diet analyses indicated that crested terns are a generalist predator on surface-schooling clupeids (Australian anchovy Engraulis australis, sardine Sardinops sagax and blue sprat Spratelloides robustus), Degens leatherjacket Thamnaconus degeni, southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir, Australian herring Arripis georgianus, slender bullseye Parapriacanthus elongatus and barracouta Thyrsites atun. Ontogenetic differences in prey size indicated that adults are constrained in their foraging behaviour during the early chick-provisioning period {{by the need to}} <b>self</b> <b>feed</b> and select smaller prey that can be ingested by their chicks. Chicks consumed significantly higher proportions of clupeids than adults, which consumed mainly Degens leatherjackets and barracouta, suggesting that adults may select higher quality prey for their chicks compared to what they consume themselves. Spatial differences in prey composition were driven by differing proportions of sardine, Australian anchovy and Degens leatherjacket and could reflect local differences in the abundances of these prey. The size of prey taxa consumed by adults also reflected a North–South gradient in prey size. The large component of juvenile sardine in the diet of crested terns suggests future dietary measures may inform fisheries managers about changes in local juvenile sardine abundance. These data could assist in highlighting any fishery-related decreases in sardine recruitment and help ensure commercial fishing practices address principals of Ecologically Sustainable Development developed for Australian fisheries.

40|$|The back {{propagation}} algorithm {{is one of}} the popular learning algorithms to train <b>self</b> learning <b>feed</b> forward neural networks. However, the convergence of this algorithm is slow mainly because the algorithm required the designers to arbitrarily select parameters such as network topology, initial weights and biases, learning rate value, the activation function, value for gain in activation function and momentum. An improper choice of theses parameters can result the training process comes to as standstill or get stuck at local minima. Previous research demonstrated that in a {{back propagation}} algorithm, the slope of the activation function is directly influenced by a parameter referred to as ‘gain’.

Cl 2. 4 H 2 O). For each treatment, five broiler chicken were grouped each week (from week I up to week VI). Results of the first stage of this study was analyzed descriptively. A polinomial regression equation was used as an empirical model to describe the heavy metal bioaccumulation phenomenon in broiler carcasses. The quadratic equation  {{turned out to be the}} most suitable model for describing the bioaccumulation of heavy metal in broiler carcasses. From the simulation, it was found that  quadratic model fit to 61. 31 % and 54. 17 %  bioaccumulation data of Pb and Cd respectively. According to the model, initially metal concentrations declined since the first week and started to rebound at the fifth week, both in terms of chronological and physiological age. The patterns of Pb and Cd bioaccumulation in this study can be used as a reference to determine the proper slaughter period. It can be concluded that for reducing the risk of metal contamination the proper slaughter time of the broiler is before the fifth week. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is {{a chronic}} {{disorder}} of posture and movement associated with other disabilities. Among these is failure of normal development of feeding ability which leads in slowness and inefficiency in feeding. As {{a result of}} the feeding problems children with cerebral palsy are at increased risk of inadequate intake of nutrients compared to the general population of children. Ultimately they are at a higher risk of developing malnutrition. Objectives: To determine the magnitude of malnutrition and associated feeding problems among children with cerebral palsy who were attending at Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of six months. During the study period, 239 children with cerebral palsy were consecutively recruited. Their nutritional status was assessed clinically and using anthropometric measurements (weight and length/height). Malnutrition was categorized using Waterlow classification. Results: A total of 239 children with CP aged between three months and 14 years were recruited. Among them 146 (61. 1 %) children were males. Spastic type of motor disorder was the most prevalent (56. 1 %) type of cerebral palsy. About half (50. 2 %) of the children had severe type of CP. Among the enrolled children 73. 1 % had variable degrees of wasting. The prevalence of severe wasting was found to be 20. 1 % while severe stunting accounted for 49. 4 % [...] There was a statistical significant direct relationship between the severity of CP and severity of malnutrition. Severe wasting prevailed more among children with severe CP accounting for 28. 3 %(p=O. OOI). More children with dyskinetic/athetoid type of CP 15 (28. 6 %) had severe wasting. However, this finding was not found to be statistically significant (p= 0. 616). Feeding problems commonly noted among the children were inability to <b>self</b> <b>feed</b> 133 (73. 5 %), inability to chew solids 80 (34. 3 %), swallowing problems 71 (29. 7 %), cough/chocking during feeding 65 (27. 2 %), cry/extensor dystonia during feeding 52 (21. 8 %) and inability of tongue lateralization in 47 (20. 2 %) of children. In general, majority of the children, were taking less than 30 minutes time to finish a feed. However, for those children who were taking longer time, more than 30 minutes to more than one hour to finish their feeds, majority were children with feeding problems. This was significant in children who were unable to feed themselves, inappropriate wide mouth opening, inability to 	 Vl open mouth when fed, inadequate/absent tongue lateralization, no closure of lips around the spoon, chewing problems and cough/chocking during feeding. The presence of feeding problems was associated with increased prevalence of severe wasting (11. 1 %- 45. 5 %) and stunting (52. 5 %- 72. 3 %). Illiteracy of the mothers/care givers was associated with having more children who were wasted to variable degrees (p=O. 044). Conclusion: This study has shown that among this selected population of children with CP attending MNH, the prevalence of malnutrition was relatively high. The severity of malnutrition was found to be directly related to the severity of CP and the presence of feeding problems. Recommendation: Growth monitoring among children with cerebral palsy should be intensified in order to identify malnutrition and feeding problems early on, and instituting appropriate feeding programmes, nutritional counselling and follow-up actions...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the meat and egg production of Aigamo ducks between formula feed (control) (ME: 2, 850 kcal/kg, CP: 18. 0 %) and experimental feed replaced 60 % of formula feed with paddy rice as feed (PRF) on a dry matter basis (ME: 2, 877 kcal/kg, CP: 17. 4 %). The average body weight (BW) of the ducks fed a PRF diet was 1, 673 g at 12 weeks of age, being significantly lower than that of control (2, 003 g, P< 0. 05). As for the carcass characteristics, no significant difference was observed in the dressing percentage between the treatments, though the dressed carcass weight of the PRF group was significantly lower than that of control (P< 0. 05). The sensory test for breast meats was not significantly different between treatments. The egg production rate (hen day's average) of the PRF group was 27. 0 %, being significantly lower than that of control (53. 4 %, P< 0. 05). The average egg weight of the PRF group was also significantly smaller (P< 0. 05). As for egg quality, percentages of the yolk, albumen and shell weight to total egg weight, and shell thickness were not significantly different between treatments. The color fan scores of egg yolks were 10. 8 and 5. 0 for control and the PRF, respectively, showing that the latter was significantly lower (P< 0. 05). The results indicated that paddy rice as feed {{could be one of the}} most promising <b>self</b> sufficient <b>feed</b> for Aigamo ducks, though the diet replaced 60 % of formula feed with paddy rice as feed (DM basis) caused a lower meat and egg productivity than the formula feed only...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of survey {{conducted}} on livestock development in selected Asian countries. Livestock plays {{a vital role in}} economic development and {{play a major role in}} the life of farmers in developing Asian countries. In the Asian region, livestock provides major additional contribution to agriculture through draft power, manure, fuel, and as a fertilizer. Animal products such as meat, milk and eggs provide daily cash income to agricultural families and also provide much required nutrition to rural population. The outlook for the poultry farming is promising. The average consumption of animal products among these countries is well below the world average but with the growth in disposable income and purchasing power will increase the demand for animal products. This study found that the Asian share of the world meat production has been quite low when compared to its animal population. According to our survey, there is a characteristic reduction of farm families raising cattle and pigs. However, the farm families raising poultry is increasing in developing countries but with large scale poultry farming becoming more profitable in developed and industrialized countries resulting reduction of farm families raising poultry. Along with a wide variety of religious followings, cultures, with different food habits, the livestock industry in Asia has been trying to satisfy variety of consumers in the region. Since feed cost is becoming the most important factor in livestock production, increasing <b>self</b> sufficiency in <b>feed</b> production will be an important factor in future development programs. Demand for animal products has been increasing with the rapid economic development in Asia...|$|R
