40|$|Autonomy for {{information}} systems planning {{may have an}} impact on the effectiveness of that planning. Theory Y suggests that when managers have more autonomy, they have greater feelings of ownership, commitment, and responsibility, and thus perform better. A postal survey of 131 chief information officers of US subsidiaries of multinational firms collected data to test hypotheses based on the theory. Data analysis revealed that autonomy for IS planning in general and the strategy selection planning activity in particular significantly predicted IS planning effectiveness. These findings thus extend the theory to a new domain, namely IS planning in multinational firms, and thereby facilitate a better understanding of the management of IS planning. They further suggest that parent managers consider delegating greater autonomy to the managers of their foreign <b>subsidiaries.</b> <b>Information</b> systems planning Multinational firms Autonomy Theory Y...|$|R

Th e two particles do indeed have the same function, as described by Kroon (1995, 144) : “nam marks discourse units that provide <b>subsidiary</b> <b>information</b> with regard to another, more central discourse unit”. And namque is preferred before vowels in poetry. But more important is that namque seems to be more grammaticalized and hence less marked than nam. Unlike nam, in prose namque can appear in another position in the sentence than the first. Moreover, namque is avoided in complicated situations, where the addressee needs a clear signal of subsidiarity. Hence nam is preferred before coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, in praeteritio and occupatio and in interrogative sentences...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn a {{clinical}} environment are produced on daily basis huge volumes of information. In the radiology context, {{the realization of}} {{an increasing number of}} studies, in particular those associated with modalities that produce huge amounts of images, has given rise to large PACS archives. Proprietary tools available for the analysis of the stored information are limited and usually do not allow efficient analysis of the radiology department performance. In this work we demonstrate that with seamless access to DICOM metadata we can provide a consolidated view of departmental production data regardless of the heterogeneous imaging sources and <b>subsidiary</b> <b>information</b> systems. With our non-proprietary approach it is therefore feasible to conceive indicators that may be included in wider scope institutional performance evaluation. The results from the consolidated DICOM information analysis of more than 20 million images, belonging to more than 467 thousand studies performed on more than 162 thousand patients, justify the relevance of the implementation of similar methodologies in order to optimize the management of Radiology departments...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{problem areas}} facing {{marketing}} researchers handling information are discussed. information is production-driven; needs of clients; demands for specific information; comparability; availability and access; time-lags; credibility and presentation. Problem 1 : Information providers are production-driven There’s {{a lot of}} talk about the information industry and the information explosion, but I think that it is still fair to say that the information market is still very much production-driven, rather than market-driven. I mean production-driven in two senses. Firstly, it is very concerned with production. Statistics tend to be geared towards how much of a product has been manufactured and some <b>subsidiary</b> <b>information</b> about how many employees are working in production industries. It tends to ignore service industries and hence to concentrate on dying industries rather than growing industries.

The intrinsic reactivity in the gas phase of the iron(IV) oxo porphyrin cation radical complex, [(TPFPP) Fe-center dot+(IV) =O](+), has been probed toward selected substrates (S), chosen among naturally occurring and model compounds.

40|$|Rice {{is one of}} the world’s staple foods. Paddy {{rice fields}} have unique biophysical {{characteristics}} that the rice is grown on flooded soils unlike other crops. Information on the spatial distribution of paddy fields and the timing of irrigation are of importance to determine hydrological balance and efficiency of water resource management. In this paper, we detected the timing of irrigation and spatial distribution of paddy fields using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the NASA EOS Aqua satellite. The timing of irrigation was detected by the combined use of MODIS-based vegetation index and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). The detected timing of irrigation showed good agreement with field observations from two flux sites in Korea and Japan. Based on the irrigation detection, a land cover map of paddy fields was generated with <b>subsidiary</b> <b>information</b> on seasonal patterns of MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI). When the MODIS-based paddy field map was compared with a land cover map from the Ministry of Environment, Korea, it overestimated the regions with large paddies but underestimated those with small and fragmented paddies. Potential reasons for such spatial discrepancies may be attributed to coarse pixel resolution (500 m) of MODIS images, uncertainty in parameterization of threshold values for discardin...|$|E

Recently, the local government has shown interest in implementing environmental stewardship as part of its governmental strategies. Our goal is to provide information through geo-technologies in order to apply State Environmental Laws regarding riparian vegetation. We have used remote sensing and GIS technologies to map all of the permanent protection areas defined by law, and have estimated the cost of implementing activities aimed at restoring the area back to a functional forest. The results show that Colíder has 20, 247 hectares of permanent protection areas in need of restoration, and that the total cost for this is of R$ 27, 900, 276 in current value.

40|$|Periconceptional supplementation could {{extend the}} period over which {{maternal}} and fetal nutrition is improved, {{but there are}} many challenges facing early-life intervention studies. Periconceptional trials differ from pregnancy supplementation trials, {{not only because of the}} very early or pre-gestational timing of nutrient exposure but also because they generate <b>subsidiary</b> <b>information</b> on participants who remain non-pregnant. The methodological challenges are more complex although, if well designed, they provide opportunities to evaluate concurrent hypotheses related to the health of non-pregnant women, especially nulliparous adolescents. This review examines the framework of published and ongoing randomised trial designs. Four cohorts typically arise from the periconceptional trial design — two of which are non-pregnant and two are pregnant — and this structure provides assessment options related to pre-pregnant, maternal, pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Conceptually the initial decision for single or micronutrient intervention is central — as is the choice of dosage and content — in order to establish a comparative framework across trials, improve standardisation, and facilitate interpretation of mechanistic hypotheses. Other trial features considered in the review include: measurement options for baseline and outcome assessments; adherence to long-term supplementation; sample size considerations in relation to duration of nutrient supplementation; cohort size for non-pregnant and pregnant cohorts as the latter is influenced by parity selection; integrating qualitative studies and data management issues. Emphasis is given to low resource settings where high infection rates and the possibility of nutrient-infection interactions may require appropriate safety monitoring. The focus is on pragmatic issues that may help investigators planning a periconceptional trial...|$|E

This research project, which has involved seven experimental primary school classes and seven control classes in the Lombardy region for two consecutive years, concerns the potential improvement of the quantitative and qualitative level of language learning and the positive effects on learning a subject in a CLIL environment. A sample of about 300 pupils who learn part of the curriculum of History, Art, Technology or Science through the English language is involved. Besides presenting empirical data from the first year of experimentation, this paper examines the results of the qualitative analysis of the journals kept by the teachers and pupils throughout the process.
