25|$|The {{characters}} of Kath, Kim (created by Riley and Turner) and Sharon (created and played by Magda Szubanski) first {{featured in the}} early 1990s as a weekly segment of the Australian comedy series Big Girl's Blouse (Seven, 1994–95). They also appeared in <b>Something</b> <b>Stupid</b> (Seven, 1998).|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge would joke {{around at}} shows, {{as he would}} with Blink-182, the mood was much different. [...] "With Blink, I cant wait until I get done playing a song so I can say <b>something</b> <b>stupid.</b> With this band I hardly talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, {{emotional}} experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about anything but the music itself." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|The name of {{the band}} was {{suggested}} by Omar Akhtar after a discussion with Khawer Khan. In response to Khawer's suggestions, Omar said, [...] "man that's just dumb, {{we might as well}} call ourselves <b>something</b> <b>stupider,</b> like …I dunno [...] "Aunty Disco Project".|$|R

500|$|Shiina is {{a female}} ninja who fights with dual-wielding kodachi and shuriken. She {{is able to}} sense when danger is coming and is a highly capable fighter. Despite her serious demeanor, she has a {{weakness}} for cute things like stuffed animals. She is strict in her training and is very self-critical when she fails, especially to a newcomer like Otonashi. She decides that her weakness is having little concentration. She is shown balancing a broom and other objects with her fingers for long amounts of time. She rarely speaks but will normally remark [...] "how shallow-minded" [...] or [...] "how foolish" [...] ("this is so stupid" [...] in the English dub) whenever the obvious or <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> is said. As {{she did not have}} a name when she arrived in the afterlife, Yuri named her Shiina after her callsign, 'C7' (Shi-nana).|$|E
500|$|Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", is {{typically}} uttered when he injures himself, {{realizes that he}} has done <b>something</b> <b>stupid,</b> or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an [...] "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out [...] "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word [...] "Damn!" [...] Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered [...] "D'oh!" [...] The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He said that he liked the episode, but not because it was a typical Next Generation episode, saying that it was instead [...] "a story about an old man who has been carrying guilt for four decades over <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> he did in his youth, and he tries to recapture his youth in a move of even greater stupidity". He described the return of Michael Pataki to Star Trek as [...] "triumphant" [...] but thought that Clayton Rohner was [...] "simply horrible", and that Marsha Hunt [...] "creates no impression whatsoever". He summed up the episode saying that it was a [...] "missed opportunity", and gave it a score of 5/10. James Hunt watched the episode in January 2013 for the website Den of Geek. He felt that the episode had a good story at the core but highlighted the [...] "rather dubious make-up and over-acting". His main criticism was that Jameson was [...] "fundamentally unlikeable", and the lack of a Subplot in the episode.|$|E
5000|$|If {{you ever}} {{decide to do}} <b>something</b> as <b>stupid</b> as build an {{automatic}} terrorism detector, here's a math lesson {{you need to learn}} first. It's called [...] "the paradox of the false positive," [...] and it's a doozy.|$|R
5000|$|As for {{the meaning}} of the title, it's a cross between [...] "Video" [...] and [...] "Idioteces" [...] which is a rough latin Spanish version of the word [...] "Idiocies" [...] {{referring}} to someone doing <b>something</b> considered <b>stupid</b> or idiotic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you idiot!" [...] Mary exclaimed, {{very nearly}} aloud, {{with a sense}} that Ralph had said <b>something</b> very <b>stupid.</b> So, after three lessons in Latin grammar, one might correct a fellow student, whose {{knowledge}} did not embrace the ablative of [...] "mensa." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Black & Blue" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. John Bergstrom of PopMatters described it as [...] "smooth, winning blue-eyed soul", and Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that its breathy vocals, piano chords and synth backing made it a [...] "successful blend of melancholy and dancefloor-ready rhythms". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian deemed the falsetto vocals and synths [...] "naggingly infectious", citing it as the band's strong point: [...] "the trio may be faceless, but they write a good tune". Sputnikmusic's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the [...] "techno swirl" [...] of the song [...] "nail the juxtaposition between Wyatt's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Black & Blue" [...] four stars out of five and recommended it for when [...] "you just need something to lift the spirits a bit, without someone shouting <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> in your ear". He continued, [...] "It basically wants to rub your shoulders {{at the end of}} a long hard day, and whisper something funny in your ear while your shoulders untie." [...] Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy, it [...] "swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow". Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy McAloon's breathy vocal style on [...] "Black & Blue", but without the [...] "lyrical wit". He rated the song three stars out of five and called it [...] "decent", finding the remixes available on the release more interesting. A more critical review came from Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan, who wrote that it [...] "promisingly... splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole".|$|E
2500|$|Guillermo's Epic Sound of the Day – a producer, Guillermo [...] "Billy" [...] Gil, {{introduces}} a sound clip that typically involves someone saying <b>something</b> <b>stupid.</b> [...] The segment always begins with Gil exclaiming [...] "Hey guys!" [...] {{followed by a}} simplistic and nonsensical explanation of the clip about to be played.|$|E
2500|$|Yellowcard {{was formed}} in 1997 in Jacksonville, Florida, after meeting at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. The band got its name from a phrase its members used in high school: {{whenever}} somebody did <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> at a party, such as spilling a beer on the carpet, they cited soccer laws and gave the offender a [...] "yellow card" [...] for committing a [...] "party foul".|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, Coburn {{did make}} a {{statement}} to The New York Times about Ensign's affair and cover-up: [...] "John got trapped doing <b>something</b> really <b>stupid</b> and then {{made a lot of}} other mistakes afterward. Judgment gets impaired by arrogance and that's what's going on here." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked to}} comment on the {{departure}} of team members in August 2013, Carroll stated, [...] "When people quit for other companies for just more money, or <b>something,</b> that's <b>stupid.</b> But, if someone quits because they don't feel right on a team, or something, then, and for another company, that makes sense." ...|$|R

2500|$|Flashing {{headlights}} to {{the vehicle}} in front (intended for the other driver to see in their mirror) has two meanings. Long flashes are used to signal a truck driver that they are clear {{to return to the}} lane. A series of rapid flashes generally means [...] "You're doing <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> and/or dangerous" [...] as in [...] "Do not move in front, trailer not clear!" [...] or [...] "I'm overtaking, move aside".|$|E
2500|$|During 1943, the RNPG {{gradually}} {{changed from}} providing false papers to information-gathering for France libre. Pierre de Bénouville said, [...] "Mitterrand created a true spy {{network in the}} POW camps which gave us information, often decisive, {{about what was going}} on behind the German borders." [...] On 10 July Mitterrand and Piatzook (a militant communist) interrupted a public meeting in the Salle Wagram in Paris. The meeting was about allowing French POWs to go home if they were replaced by young French men forced to go and work in Germany (in French this was called [...] "la relève"). When André Masson began to talk about [...] "la trahison des gaullistes" [...] (the Gaullist treason), Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right to talk on behalf of POWs and calling la relève a [...] "con" [...] (i.e., <b>something</b> <b>stupid).</b> Mitterrand avoided arrest as Piatzook covered his escape.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 January 2012, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, gave {{a speech}} calling on African nations to repeal laws that place {{sanctions}} on homosexual conduct. Speaking to a journalist, African Cardinal Robert Sarah, president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, called the speech stupid. The journalist reported: [...] "Asked if Ban Ki-moon was overstepping his responsibilities, Cardinal Sarah replied: 'Sure, you cannot impose <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> like that.' He added: 'Poor countries like Africa just accept it because it's imposed upon them through money, through being tied to aid.'" [...] He said that African bishops must react against this move against African culture. Meanwhile, Cardinal Peter Turkson, while recognising {{that some of the}} sanctions imposed on homosexuals in Africa are an [...] "exaggeration", stated that the [...] "intensity of the reaction is probably commensurate with tradition". [...] "Just as there's a sense of a call for rights, there's also a call to respect culture, of all kinds of people", he said. [...] "So, if it's being stigmatized, in fairness, it's probably right to find out why it is being stigmatized." [...] He also called for distinction to be made between human rights and moral issues.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a public}} speaker and Internet {{personality}} (Tim Guest's book Second Lives: A Journey Through Virtual Worlds features Hughes in a chapter) he shares his experiences {{both of the}} growing virtual worlds industry, the changes in culture, personal experiences of challenging {{the status quo and}} leading through doing. [...] "Every time I see <b>something</b> as <b>stupid,</b> I realise it's the thing I should pay the most attention to," [...] he said in a 2008 interview.|$|R
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done <b>something</b> really <b>stupid,</b> it is best to admit it.|$|R
50|$|Once outside, King {{realized}} that he had left his guitar inside so he went back into the burning building to retrieve his beloved $30 Gibson guitar. King learned the next day that the two men that started the fire had been fighting over a woman who worked at the hall named Lucille. King named that guitar, and every guitar he subsequently owned, Lucille, as a reminder never again to do <b>something</b> as <b>stupid</b> as run into a burning building or fight over women.|$|R
2500|$|It is at {{this point}} that Wilson's own {{memories}} end, but the Scarecrow Guide informs him that all Dreamscapes are connected, and {{he will be able to}} uncover the truth of Amelia's disappearance if he continues searching. He begins by going back to the barn and discovering Amelia's necklace. It is also while he is here that he remembers a conversation he had with Amelia the day before the wedding, where she expressed concern for Frank after he called her and told her to cancel the wedding. As a result of this, she told Wilson she didn't want him at the wedding in case he did <b>something</b> <b>stupid.</b> Wilson recalls a telephone conversation he overheard Frank having one day at the airfield, and realizes that this conversation was the one Amelia was referring to. He remembers that Frank told her to meet him at their special spot so they can talk. This special spot is the lake, which is the location where Amelia and Frank had their one and only date many years prior. After he discovered that Amelia intended to follow through and marry Wilson, he drowned her in a fit of anger, telling her that [...] "If I can't have you, no one can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do <b>something</b> <b>stupid,</b> including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|E

5000|$|Goodis has {{influenced}} contemporary crime fiction writers, notably Duane Swierczynski, and Ken Bruen. A character in Jean-Luc Godard's 1966 film Made in U.S.A. {{was named after}} Goodis. However, in Godard's 1972 film Tout va bien, the character Jacques (played by Yves Montand), a filmmaker, says he moved into making commercials as more [...] "honest" [...] work when, after May 1968, {{he was asked to}} direct a film based on a Goodis detective novel and decided he couldn't see himself making <b>something</b> so <b>stupid.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the {{theatrical}} film {{based on the}} series, Crow distinguishes himself early on by attempting to tunnel back to Earth using a pickaxe. Even he admits the faulty logic employed in this scheme when he examines his calculations: [...] "Well, look at that! 'Breach hull, all die' [...] - [...] I even had it underlined!" [...] / [...] "Well, believe me, Mike, I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus the odds I was doing <b>something</b> incredibly <b>stupid,</b> and...I went ahead anyway." ...|$|R
500|$|The suits were {{eradicated}} when Take-Two petitioned U.S. District Court, SD FL {{to block}} the impending lawsuit, {{on the grounds that}} video games purchased for private entertainment could not be considered public nuisances. The following day, Thompson wrote on his website [...] "I have been praying, literally, that Take-Two and its lawyers would do <b>something</b> so <b>stupid,</b> that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two.

6000|$|She {{had listened}} to this only staring, and she was silent after he had said it, so silent for some instants that while he {{considered}} her something seemed to fail him, much {{as if he had}} thrown out his foot for a step and not found the place to rest it. He jerked round to the window again, and then she answered, but without passion unless it was that of her weariness for <b>something</b> <b>stupid</b> and forgiven in him, [...] "Oh, the blind, the pitiful folly!"--to which, as it might perfectly have applied to her own behaviour, he returned nothing. She had moreover at once gone on. [...] "Have it then that there wasn't much to do--between your finding that you loathed me for another woman or discovering only, {{when it came to the}} point, that you loathed me quite enough for myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding, Thompson said: [...] "I {{have been}} praying, literally, that Take-Two and its lawyers would do <b>something</b> so <b>stupid,</b> so arrogant, so dumb, even dumber {{than what they}} have to date done, that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two." [...] On April 19, 2007, Thompson and Take-Two settled the suit, with Thompson agreeing not to seek any legal {{restriction}} on sales of Take-Two's games, threaten to sue the company, or accuse Take-Two of any wrongdoing based on the sale of any of its games.|$|R
