50|$|The second {{generation}} of the FIA technique, called sequential injection analysis (SIA), was conceived in 1990 by Ruzicka and Marshal, and has been further developed and miniaturized {{over the course of}} the following decade. It uses flow programming instead of the continuous flow regime (as used by CFA and FIA), that allows the flow rate and flow direction to be tailored to the need of individual steps of analytical protocol. Reactants are mixed by flow reversals and a measurement is carried out while the reaction mixture is arrested within the detector by stepping the flow. Microminiaturized chromatography is carried out on microcolumns that are automatically renewed by microfluidic manipulations. The discrete pumping and metering of microliter sample and reagent volumes used in SI only generates waste per each sample injection. The enormous volume of FI and <b>SI</b> literature <b>documents</b> the versatility of FI and SI and their usefulness for routine assays (in soil, water, environmental, biochemical and biotechnological assays) has demonstrated their potential to be used as a versatile research tool.|$|R

Using two-color and pump-probe spectroscopy with a free-electron laser we establish a direct link between the 1. 5 µm emission from Er 3 + ions and the 9 µm vibrational band of interstitial oxygen in Si. We show that: i) intensity of the 1. 5 µm emission quenches when the 9 µm oxygen vibration is resonantly excited, and ii) the lifetime of the 9 µm vibrational band is affected by Er presence. Both findings evidence microscopic relation of interstitial oxygen and Er and their close proximity in Si matrix...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Congo Basin in Central Africa {{is one of}} {{the major}} river basins of the world. Its history overthe last 75 Myr should record global and major {{regional}} events, including the Paleocene-EoceneThermal Maximum at ~ 55 Ma and the Miocene aperture of the Western branch of the EastAfrican Rift System along its eastern border at ~ 25 Ma. Available data for associated off-shoredeposits show that the Congo River delta experienced a starvation period during the MidtoLate Cretaceous and Paleogene, with endorheic lacustrine to desert environments in theupstream basin, followed by a period marked by high rates of drainage and sediment supplyin the Neogene. Here we complement this sedimentation history with a multi-proxy analysis of an on-shorePaleogene section along the west coast of Central Africa (Landana, Cabinda Enclave, Angola) and with new age determination results for paleosurface-related manganese oxide depositsfrom the southern margin of the Congo Basin in the DR Congo. Newly obtained 39 Ar- 40 Ar ages for cryptomelane from Katanga (Kasekelesa) and Kasaï (MtMwatshimwa) reveal an old (Cretaceous?) surface that developed before ~ 76 Ma and they suggestthe existence of at least two younger Eocene denudation episodes, during the Lutetian(~ 45 Ma) and the Priabonian (~ 35 Ma). They furthermore confirm the identification of a seriesof Mio-Pliocene denudation surfaces that were previously recognized by the same methods forthe Kisenge area, Katanga (De Putter et al., 2015). It is likely that the newly obtained Cretaceousage records the subcontinental ‘African Surface’ that had previously not been identified forCentral Africa. The Landana section presents a condensed (~ 45 m) Paleogene-Neogene sequence. The Paleogenedeposits (~ 25 m), dated by the rich fossil assemblage they contain (Solé et al., in prep.),record a shallow marine carbonate environment with minor to moderate fine-grained terrigenousdetrital input. Sediment provenance, as documented by εNd, does not change significantlyin the course of the Paleogene, whereas weathering, as documented by εHf and δ 30 Si,increases slightly from the Danian to the Lutetian (Bayon et al., 2016). This time interval correspondsroughly to the assumed period of deposition of the Kalahari Group of the westernpart of the Congo Basin, where it occurs as a ~ 150 m thick sand accumulation. The top of theLutetian beds of the Landana section is a major discontinuity, marked by strong silicification,which would correspond to the Lutetian denudation surface in Katanga. Sedimentation recorded by the Landana section changes drastically after this hiatus with Lutetian onset, becoming dominated by coarse-grained siliciclastic sediments. A major changein sediment source is confirmed by εNd, whereas isotopic proxies of weathering (εHf, δ 30 <b>Si)</b> <b>document</b> a major decrease in weathering intensity. The sharp increase in sediment dischargeis attributed to uplift along the southern and eastern margins of the Congo Basin, precedingthe opening of the East African Rift in the Oligocene. A combination of sedimentological, geochemical and geochronological proxies provides newconstraints for a Paleogene time interval that is only poorly documented for the Congo Basin. During this period, sediments, including those of the Kalahari Group, were deposited ona denudation surface tentatively identified as the Cretaceous African Surface. The uplift thatoccurred before opening of the East African Rift resulted in increased terrigenous off-shoresedimentation after the Lutetian. De Putter et al., 2015. Ore Geol.

After 24 months the evidence shows a sustained improvement in the housing circumstances of the J 2 SI participants compared to those in the control group. Critically, most (86 %) have maintained their housing. While the move to independent housing was difficult in the beginning, the high rate of housing retention suggests that most of the participants are developing the skills and confidence needed to keep their housing. The report contains the results of a cost-benefit analysis of the program after 2 years of operation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{determine}} {{the correlation between}} insulin sensitivity (S(I)) obtained by the minimal model method applied to a frequently sampled (n= 33) intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT(33)), and values obtained by reduced FSIGTs, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or fasting. DESIGN:Retrospective analysis on tests performed in prospective studies. METHODS:A total of 78 FSIGT(33), and 59 OGTT were performed in non-diabetic women of which 10 were young cyclic females in the early follicular menstrual phase, 10 were young non-obese subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 30 were in post-menopause. Some of these individuals were investigated both prior to and during specified treatments. FSIGT(33) was transformed into FSIGT(22) and FSIGT(12) by removing samples from the analysis. Values of SI derived from reduced FSIGTs or calculations performed on glucose and insulin values observed in fasting conditions and/or during OGTT were related to those of FSIGT(33). RESULTS:S(I) values derived from FSIGT(33) were highly correlated with those derived from FSIGT(22) (r= 0. 965) or FSIGT(12) (r= 0. 955), but were only weakly correlated with those derived from fasting or OGTT calculations (r below 0. 5). Between-group (PCOS vs normal) or within-group (prior to and during treatment) comparisons showed that reduced FSIGTs were only slightly less powerful than FSIGT(33) in detecting differences in S(I). CONCLUSIONS:In non-diabetic women, reduced FSIGTs but not calculations based on fasting or OGTT values {{may be used in}} place of FSIGT(33) to <b>document</b> <b>S(I)</b> and its variation...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the major}} stress factors {{reducing}} cereal production worldwide. There is ample evidence that the mineral nutrient status of plants plays a critical role in increasing plant tolerance to different biotic and abiotic stresses. In this regard, the important role of various nutrients e. g., potassium (K) or silicon (Si) in the mitigation of different stress factors, such as drought, heat or frost has been well <b>documented.</b> <b>Si</b> application has been reported to ameliorate plant nutrient deficiency. Here, we used K and Si either solely or in combination to investigate whether an additive positive effect on barley growth can be achieved under osmotic stress and which mechanisms contribute to a better tolerance to osmotic stress. To achieve this goal, barley plants were subjected to polyethylene glycol (PEG) -induced osmotic stress under low or high K supply and two Si regimes. The results showed that barley silicon transporters HvLsi 1 and HvLsi 2 regulate the accumulation of Si in the shoot only when plant suffered from K deficiency. Si, in turn, increased the starch level under both osmotic stress and K deficiency and modulated the glycolytic and TCA pathways. Hormone profiling revealed that the beneficial effect of Si is most likely mediated also by ABA homeostasis and active cytokinin isopentenyl adenine (iP). We conclude that Si may effectively improve stress tolerance under K deficient condition in particular when additional stress like osmotic stress interferes...|$|R
40|$|An RMIT University {{research}} project with Sacred Heart Mission comparing {{two groups of}} chronically homeless people has shown the shortfalls of the current system. Journey to Social Inclusion (J 2 SI) is a pilot program designed {{to break the cycle}} of long-term homelessness. The program provides intensive support for up to three years to assist long-term homeless people receive the range of services they need. The J 2 SI model contrasts with existing services that tend to be short-term responses which do not address the underlying issues causing long-term homelessness. This is the first of four reports evaluating the J 2 <b>SI</b> program. It <b>documents</b> preliminary outcomes from the first 12 months of a randomised controlled trial evaluating J 2 SI’s effectiveness. The evaluation tracks the outcomes of J 2 SI participants over time. The randomised control trial approach then compares their outcomes with those of a comparison group who are being supported by existing services. The report reveals the extent of the problems faced by those who are amongst the most disadvantaged in our society. People who are long-term homeless almost always have traumatic childhoods (87 %). Virtually all grew up in poverty, and experienced major and often repeated childhood trauma such as sexual or physical abuse, the involvement of child protection, or an experience of homelessness at a young age. Over 90 % now have chronic ill health and drug and alcohol problems and over three quarters have been physically assaulted {{at some point in their}} lives. None have paid employment and most have not worked for five years or more. Traditional service responses may assist some who are long-term homeless to find stable housing, but most do not. Even at this early stage, there are signs that the J 2 SI program is assisting participants to overcome their disadvantages. Relative to the comparison group,many more now have permanent housing (75 % vs. 30 %) and they are using expensive acute physical, mental health and homelessness services less often. A few have started paid employment. This report makes plain the extent of the challenges facing people who are long-term homeless. Over the next three years we will track whether the approach adopted by J 2 SI provides a permanent solution to longterm homelessness. Future evaluation reports will assess program outcomes after 2, 3 and 4 years, and whether the benefits justify the costs. Authors: Guy Johnson, Sharon Parkinson, Yi-Ping Tseng, Daniel Kuehnl...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of the 1 <b>sI</b> century Jewish <b>document</b> Psalms of Solomon, the primary focus of which concerns the theological framework and authorial intention that gave rise to its formation and function. As a response to Pompey's invasion of Jerusalem, the authors construct an apologetic predicated on a specific theological framework from the Hebrew Bible, herein termed the 'prophetic paradigm'. This paradigm provided the basic elements of punishment for sinfulness and redemption for repentance that constitute the theological trajectory of the document. By reading history through this particular theological lens, the authors effectively create a didactic response to the historical conflagration, and the document reads as 'literature of assurance'. The project proceeds in seven parts. The introduction contains a discussion of the general features of the document, such as authorship, date, provenance, language, textual history, as well as the most recent scholarly conclusions. Specific details pertinent to this particular dissertation are also introduced, such as inter-textuality, working definitions of apocalyptic and prophetic genres, and the need for a re-examination the document. In the first section, Psalms of Solomon and Deuteronomy 32 are set in comparison along the lines of my approach to inter-textuality. The effort in this first section is to ascertain to what extent Psalms of Solomon was written with the biblical prophetic material in mind, and to probe the extent to which this program dominated the composition. With this view in mind, the second section seeks to examine the overall cohesion of the document in light of its poetic structure and reveals certain hermeneutical insights encountered in the process. Section three acts on the observations of the frrst two sections, that a dominant theological program governs the document and that it is to be read as a cohesive whole, by critiquing a particular concept in this light, namely the Temple motif. The findings reveal that the Temple motif figures prominently in the text and that categories such as sinners, righteous, purity, impurity, Jews, non-Jews are defined from the perspective that God is present in the Temple at Jerusalem. Inasmuch as the issues of sinners, righteous, purity, impurity, Jews, and non-Jews are of central importance to the community at Qumran, the fmdings of section three commend a comparison between Psalms of Solomon and Qumran, which gives a point of comparison in highlighting these concepts within the document. In section four, a comparison between the theology of Psalms of Solomon and Qumran is made on three points, the Law of Moses, the Temple, and the will of God. Section five consists of a brief evaluation of the use of Psalms of Solomon by NT scholarship. The intention of this final section is to promote an awareness of the need for re-evaluating Psalms of Solomon's position and place within the history of the deVelopment of religious concepts, in this case messianism and use of the document by NT scholarship.
