25|$|The Can of Worms at ICI was the {{headline}} in Business & Finance magazine on 8 November 1984. The Insurance Corporation of Ireland (ICI) was a wholly owned subsidiary of AIB when it collapsed in 1985 with losses of over £200 million. When {{it was discovered}} in November 1984 that ICI was operating below the <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio, a request for further capital was made to AIB— ICI had returned a profit of more than £80 million the previous year. This collapse occurred {{at a time of}} deep economic recession in Ireland. The level of Government debt at that time was 116% of GDP. But the Irish taxpayer bailed ICI out of its difficulties. The Irish Government did so to ensure a continuation of the insurance business and to protect policyholders. AIB claimed that it could not resolve the problems of ICI without putting its core banking business in jeopardy. The investment of £85 million by AIB in ICI was written off and the cost to the Irish taxpayer was £400 million.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings on}} the impact of revisions to a unique bank regulation yet studied. An old hypothesis in banking literature is tested by examining share price reactions to two-way changes to <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio (SRR) requirement over a recent eight-year period. Announcements of these regulatory changes appear to lead to statistically and economically significant abnormal returns.

Thus, his study provides a test of the prediction of theory that SRR is a powerful macroeconomic policy tool to revive an economy {{in the aftermath of a}} financial crisis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{recent changes in}} the U. S. financial system have affected the appropriate definition, construction and interpretation of the St. Louis adjusted monetary base and adjusted reserves. Since 1990, reductions in <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements have significantly reduced {{the importance of the}} requirements as a constraint on the deposit and lending behavior of banks and other depository institutions. During the same period, depositories' interbank payments activities have come to determine most, if not all of their, demand for Federal Reserve Bank deposits. Our analysis suggests that measures of the monetary source base should be broadened to include all Federal Reserve deposits held by domestic depository institutions rather than just those deposits available to satisfy <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, and that adjustments for the effects of changes in reserve requirements must recognize that many depositories' behavior is not affected by such requirements.

40|$|Deposits held at Federal Reserve Banks are an {{essential}} input {{to the business}} activity of most depository institutions in the United States. Managing these deposits is an important and complex inventory problem, for two reasons. First, Federal Reserve regulations require that depository institutions hold certain amounts of such deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks to satisfy <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements against customers* transaction accounts (demand deposits and other checkable deposits). Second, some inventory of such deposits is essential for banks to operate one of their core lines of business: furnishing payment services to households and firms. including wire transfers, ACH payments, and check clearing settlement. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on such deposits used to satisfy <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, banks seek to minimize their inventory of such deposits. In 1994, the banking industry introduced a new inventory management tool for such deposits, the retail deposit sweep program, which avoids the statutory requirement by reclassifying transaction deposits as savings deposits. In this analysis, we examine two algorithms for operating such sweeps programs {{within the limits of}} Federal Reserve regulations. Banks and banking; Retail trade...|$|E

40|$|During the {{financial}} crisis, life insurers sold long-term policies at deep discounts relative to actuarial value. In December 2008, the average markup was − 19 percent for life annuities and − 57 percent for universal life insurance. This extraordinary pricing behavior was {{a consequence of}} financial frictions and <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> regulation that allowed life insurers to record far less than a dollar of reserve per dollar of future insurance liability. We identify the shadow cost of financial frictions through exogenous variation in required reserves across different types of policies. The shadow cost wa...|$|E

50|$|Modified {{reserves}} {{are based on}} premiums which are not level by duration. Almost all modified {{reserves are}} intended to accumulate lower reserves in early policy years than they would under the net level premium method.

To do this, modified reserves assume a lower premium {{in the first year}} or two than the net level premium, and later premiums are higher. The Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method, used for <b>statutory</b> <b>reserves</b> in the United States, allows for use of modified reserves.|$|R

40|$|The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' {{adjusted}} {{monetary base}} combines {{in a single}} index Federal Reserve actions that affect the supply base money [...] open market operations, discount window lending and unsterilized foreign exchange market intervention [...] with actions that affect depository institutions' demand for base money [...] changes in <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements. The adjusted monetary base equals {{the sum of the}} monetary base and a reserve adjustment magnitude (RAM) that maps changes in reserve requirements into equivalent changes in the (unadjusted) monetary base. This paper presents a revised measure of the adjusted total reserves component of the monetary base and a new RAM. The revised measure of the adjusted reserves component differs from the current measure by including the aggregate amount of depository institutions' required clearing balance contracts with the Federal Reserve. The new RAM differs from the current RAM by recognizing that, since the Monetary Control Act of 1980, an increasing number of depository institutions have not significantly changed their demand for base money (vault cash and Federal Reserve deposits) relative to transactions deposits following changes in <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements. The new adjusted reserves data suggest that the stance of monetary policy, measured by the growth rate of adjusted reserves, has been more volatile since 1980 then suggested by the current measure.
