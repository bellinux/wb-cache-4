40|$|Some diaryl <b>sulphones</b> {{have been}} {{prepared}} by the reaction of p-toluene sulphonic acid with aromatic hydrocarbons {{in the presence of}} trifluoroacetic anhydride. The various isomeric products were separated by g. l. c., the major isomers isolated by fractional recrystallisation and their structures confirmed using various spectroscopic techniques. The kinetics of the interactions between trifluoroacetic anhydride and the sulphonic acids (methane sulphonic and mesitylene sulphonic acid) have been studied and these results used to propose a mechanism for the trifluoroacetic anhydride 'catalysed' formation of <b>sulphones</b> in the reaction of p-toluene sulphonic acid with aromatic hydrocarbons in nitromethane. This mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate (p-toluene sulphonyl trifluoroacetate) which ionises into p-toluene sulphonylium and trifluoroacetate ions. Electrophilic attack by the sulphonylium ions on the aromatic hydrocarbon results in the formation of <b>sulphones.</b> Symmetrical diaryl <b>sulphones</b> {{have been prepared}} from the reaction of sulphuric acid with aromatic hydrocarbons using trifluoroacetic anhydride. The major isomers were isolated and identified. Unsymmetrical diaryl <b>sulphones</b> have also been prepared by a similar method by the sequential addition of two different aromatic hydrocarbons to solutions of trifluoroacetic anhydride and sulphuric acid in nitromethane. The isomeric products formed in both these reactions were separated by g. l. c. The interactions of trifluoroacetic anhydride and sulphuric acid in various mixtures of dichloro-methane and nitromethane were studied and the results again utilised to propose the mechanisms for the reactions ofsulphuric acid with aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride. This mechanism involves the formation of first a monoanhydride (trifluoroacetyl sulphuric acid) which reacts further to give the dianhydride [di-(trifluoroacetyl) sulphate]. The dianhydride gives rise to an initial regiospecific electrophilic attack upon the aromatic hydrocarbon to form the aryl sulphonyl trifluoro-acetate. The aryl sulphonyl trifluoroacetate then reacts with the second aromatic hydrocarbon to give <b>sulphones</b> with the normal pattern of electrophilic substitution.

A number of 2 - substituted thietan <b>sulphones</b> have been shown to give the appropriately substituted cyclopropanes in high yields. The corresponding reactions of 3 -substituted theitan <b>sulphones</b> are not quite so clean however, and a number of products are formed.

The products of these reactions are generally ?,?- unsaturated ketones, and the mechanism has been probed by deuterium labelling experiments. The flash thermolyses of some substituted ?-sultines have been studied in detail. Generally, sulphur dioxide is extruded and the products are derived from the remaining biradical species. In one case however, one of the products is derived from a loss of sulphur monoxide from the starting material.

50|$|In the literature, {{particularly}} lay literature, sulfones commonly {{are confused}} with sulfonamides, though the latter have one carbon and one nitrogen atom {{attached to the}} sulfur atom, instead of two carbon atoms.

50|$|The {{first major}} route of {{degradation}} of carbophenothion in rats is sulfoxidation, as displayed on the right. This product can be further transformed into 4-chlorobenzenesulphinic and 4-chlorobenzenesulphonic acid. A second major route involves the formation of 4-chlorothiophenol, which is further transformed via methylation and ring-hydroxylation to 4-Chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl methyl sulfone. This is then converted in approximately equal proportions to sulphate and glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, there are metabolites that presumably arise from the cleavage of the P-S bond such as 4-chlorophenylsulphinylmethyl methyl <b>sulphone.</b> An overview of the metabolites and their occurrence as has been studied in rats {{can be found in}} the table below.One study on rats found that during 48 hours 66% of the administered carbophenothion was excreted in the urine and according to other experiments it takes approximately six days before complete excretion was achieved. Other studies say that even after 14 days there was a detectable level of the oxidation product present.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolism}} of carbophenothion {{in human}} beings, {{is comparable to}} the metabolism in mice, insects and plants. There is little data of the quantitative degradation of carbophenothion to oxidative and hydrolytic compounds in mammals. It was found that in the rat more than 75% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hours. Carbophenothion is therefore estimated to be rapidly excreted in humans as well. The compound is most toxic when it is not metabolized. The acute toxicity {{of the majority of the}} metabolites of carbophenothion have been studied in rats. They are considerably less toxic and thus show that metabolism of carbophenothion does probably not involve bioactivation but rather detoxification. The two main products of this metabolism are sulphoxide and <b>sulphone.</b> Five oxidative products have been identified: the oxygen analogue of the carbophenothion, the sulphoxide and its oxygen analogue and finally sulphones and its oxygen analogue, all of which are depicted on the right.|$|E

Animal and in vitro {{studies have shown that}} both the sulphide metabolite of sulindac, which is able to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase, and the <b>sulphone</b> metabolite, which lacks this ability, are able to inhibit the growth of colonic carcinoma cells. The exact mechanism by which these effects occurs is not known. AIMS [...] To examine the effect of sulindac sulphide and sulindac <b>sulphone</b> on the expression of APC messenger RNA (mRNA), and on the proliferation of colonic carcinoma cells in vitro. METHODS [...] The colonic carcinoma cell line LIM 1215 was treated with sulindac sulphide and sulindac <b>sulphone</b> (10 microM or 100 microM) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and APC mRNA was quantitated using competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Measurements of cell number, cell proliferation, and prostaglandin E 2 concentrations were also made. RESULTS [...] A significant increase in APC mRNA was observed after treatment with 10 microM of both sulindac sulphide and sulindac <b>sulphone</b> (control: 37. 2 (19. 7); 10 microM sulindac sulphide: 129 (112. 8); 10 microM sulindac sulphone: 207. 7 (102. 9) pg/(g total RNA) (p < 0. 05). Prostaglandin E 2 concentrations were significantly reduced after treatment with sulindac sulphide, but not after sulindac <b>sulphone.</b> Both agents produced a dose dependent reduction in cell numbers and cell proliferation, which was more noticeable after treatment with sulindac sulphide.
