5|$|The US federal {{government}} intervened, obtaining an injunction against the strike {{on the theory}} that the strikers had obstructed the US Mail, carried on Pullman cars, by refusing to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> President Grover Cleveland, who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce the injunction. The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike. Overall, 30 strikers were killed in the strike, 13 of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating the injunction and sent to federal prison.|$|E

500|$|In September 2001, D.C. {{police and}} federal {{prosecutors}} were {{contacted by the}} lawyer of an informant, held in a D.C. jail, {{who claimed to have}} knowledge of Levy's killer. The informant, whose identity was protected for his safety, said that Ingmar Guandique, a 20-year-old illegal alien from El Salvador also being held in the jail, told him that Condit paid him $25,000 to kill Levy. Investigators ruled out the story about Condit, because Guandique had already admitted to assaulting two other women in the same park where Levy's remains were found. Guandique failed to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> on the day of Levy's disappearance. His former landlady recalled that his face appeared scratched and bruised at around that time.

Assistant chief Terrance W. Gainer said that if Guandique had been considered a suspect, D.C. police would have been after him [...] "like flies on honey".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{entering}} the campaign with relatively low poll numbers, the NDP recovered and increased their support significantly after Layton's {{performance in the}} leaders debates.

The Globe and Mail described Layton's attack as a [...] "knock-out punch" [...] while the Toronto Star stated it was the [...] "pivot in the debate [...] {{was a turning point}} in the federal campaign". Layton's New Democrats successfully capitalized on Ignatieff's attendance record in the Toronto area.|$|E

2500|$|The Liberals had {{considerable}} momentum when the writ was dropped, and Ignatieff successfully squeezed NDP leader Jack Layton out of media attention, by issuing challenges to Harper for one-on-one debates. In {{the first couple}} weeks of the campaign, Ignatieff kept his party in {{second place in the}} polls, and his personal ratings exceeded that of Layton for the first time. However opponents frequently criticized Ignatieff's perceived political opportunism, particularly during the leaders debates when Layton criticized Ignatieff for having a poor attendance record for Commons votes saying [...] "You know, most Canadians, if they don't <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> they don't get a promotion". Ignatieff failed to defend himself against these charges, and the debates were said to be a turning point for his party's campaign. Near the end of the campaign, a late surge in support for Layton and the NDP relegated Ignatieff and the Liberals to third in the polls.|$|E

Willis was a frequent customer at her place of employment, he matched a police artist's sketch of a man seen [...] "being real flirty" [...] {{with her on the}} night of her disappearance, and his minivan matched the description of one seen at the crime scene and recorded on security camera footage speeding away from the location of her workplace after she went missing.
