5|$|The {{building}} had {{stained glass windows}} and the interior was decorated with glazed bricks, similar to other public buildings of this era in the city, such as the Victoria Baths.

5|$|Although {{not without}} its critics, his {{architecture}} is widely appreciated. He was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA's) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's <b>standard</b> <b>design</b> influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. He twice declined the offer of a knighthood.|$|E

5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the <b>standard</b> <b>design</b> for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 an {{environmental}} study into building a freeway to freeway interchange in Gila Bend from SR 85 to I-8 {{was completed by}} ADOT and the Federal Highway Administration. The study found no {{significant impact on the}} local environment and outlined a finalized full freeway <b>standard</b> <b>design,</b> bypassing the I-8 Business/Maricopa Road intersection SR 85 currently traverses through. A diamond interchange Exit 121 is planned at Maricopa Road/I-8 Business along with a second diamond interchange slightly northeast of the proposed Exit 121.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its <b>standard</b> <b>design.</b> In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E

As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive build to be commenced to a British Railways <b>standard</b> <b>design.</b> The Standard Steam Locomotive Company believes that significant costs will be avoided as many of the required cast parts can be made from patterns held by fellow members of the British Railways Standard Locomotive Owners Group (BRSLOG).|$|E
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a <b>standard</b> <b>design</b> were used.|$|E
