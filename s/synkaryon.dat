If nuclear fusion occurs, the fused nucleus initially contains the complete chromosomal content of both fusion partners (4N), but ultimately chromosomes are lost and/or re-sorted (see arrows). If nuclear fusion does not occur, a heterokaryon (or syncytium) can become a <b>synkaryon</b> by shedding an entire nucleus.|$|E
50|$|Heterotypic {{cell fusion}} occurs between cells of {{different}} types, {{making it the}} exact opposite of homotypic cell fusion. The result of this fusion is also a <b>synkaryon</b> produced by the merging of the nuclei, and a binucleated heterokaryon in the absence of nuclear fusion. An example of this would be BMDCs being fused with parenchymatous organs.|$|E
50|$|Homotypic {{cell fusion}} occurs between {{cells of the}} same type. An example {{of this would be}} osteoclasts or myofibers being fusing {{together}} with their respective type of cells. Whenever the two nuclei merge a <b>synkaryon</b> is produced. Cell fusion normally occurs with nuclear fusion, but in the absence of nuclear fusion, the cell would be described as a binucleated heterokaryon. A heterokaryon is the melding of two or more cells into one and it may reproduce itself for several generations. If two of the same type of cells fuse, but their nuclei do not fuse, then the resulting cell is called a syncytium.|$|E
40|$|Chromosomes {{were studied}} by {{autoradiography}} in a mixed culture of diploid and tetraploid cells, after having induced fusion with Sendai virus between two Chinese hamster cell populations, one labelled with 3 H-, {{the other with}} 14 C-thymidine; sister chromatid exchanges were studied in the 3 H diploid cells and exchanges between chromosomes in the 3 H- 14 C tetraploid <b>synkaryons.</b> In both cases, the frequency of exchanges increases after U. V. irradiation. © 1973 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Pure {{populations of}} proliferating <b>synkaryons</b> were {{obtained}} from polyethylene glycol-mediated crosses between diploid human foreskin fibroblasts and epithelioid amniotic fluid cells. These hybrids proved to be chromosomally stable tetraploids. They continuously produced heteropolymeric G 6 PD and showed strictly additive patterns of silver staining of both parental sets of nucleolar organizing chromosomes. Collagenous proteins characteristic of the fibroblast parent were synthesized, while fibronectin production appeared to be directed by the epithelioid portion of the genome. Even though these heterotypic hybrids proliferated at a reduced rate and achieved fewer population doublings relative to homotypic (fibroblast X fibroblast) crosses, they survived passage by trypsinization better than pure populations of epithelioid cells. These observations suggest a concerted action of both parental genomes with respect to proteins responsible for "household" functions, but complementation and possibly modulation of gene action with respect to "luxury" protein synthesis and cell growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{fusion of}} human fetal erythroid (HFE) cells with mouse {{erythroleukemia}} (MEL) cells produces stable <b>synkaryons</b> (HFE x MEL) {{which can be}} monitored for {{extended periods of time}} in culture. Initially these hybrids express a human fetal globin program (gamma >> beta), but after weeks or months in culture, they switch to an adult pattern of globin expression (beta >> gamma). The rate at which hybrids switch to the adult phenotype is roughly dependent on the gestational age of the fetal erythroid cells used in the fusion, suggesting that the rate of switching in vitro may be determined by a developmental clock type of mechanism, possibly involving the cumulative number of divisions experienced by the human fetal cells. To investigate whether the number or rate of cell divisions postfusion can influence the rate of switching, we monitored the rate of switching in hybrids from independent fusions under growth-promoting (serum-replete) and growth-suppressing (serum-deprived) conditions. We found that hybrids grown under serum-deprived or serumless conditions switched more rapidly to adult globin expression than did their counterparts in serum-replete conditions. Neither the number of cumulative cell divisions nor time in culture per se predicted the rate of switching in vitro. Our data suggest that factors present in serum either retard switching of hybrids by their presence or promote switching by their absence, indicating that globin switching in vitro can be modulated by the environment; however, once switching in HFE x MEL hybrids is complete, serum factors cannot reverse this process...|$|R
50|$|In 1847 Theodore Schwann {{expanded}} {{upon the}} theory that all living organisms are composed of cells when he added to it that discrete cells are the basis of life. Schwann observed that in certain cells the walls and cavities of the cells coalesce together. It was this observation that provided the first hint that cells fuse.It was not until 1960 that cell biologists deliberately fused cells for the first time. To fuse the cells, biologists combined isolated mouse cells, {{with the same kind}} of tissue, and induced fusion of their outer membrane using the Sendai virus (a respiratory virus in mice). Each of the fused hybrid cells contained a single nucleus with chromosomes from both fusion partners. <b>Synkaryon</b> became the name of this type of cell combined with a nucleus.In the late 1960s biologists successfully fused cells of different types and from different species. The hybrid products of these fusions, heterokaryon, were hybrids that maintained two or more separate nuclei. This work was headed by Henry Harris at the University of Oxford and Nils Ringertz from Sweden's Karolinska Institute. These two men are responsible for reviving the interest of cell fusion. The hybrid cells interested biologists in the area of how different kinds of cytoplasm affect different kinds of nuclei. The work conducted by Henry and Nils showed that proteins from one gene fusion affect gene expression in the other partner's nucleus, and vice versa. These hybrid cells that were created were considered forced exceptions to normal cellular integrity and it was not until 2002 that the possibility of cell fusion between cells of different types may have a real function in mammals.|$|E
40|$|The unfertilized eggs {{of a sea}} urchin, Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus, were firstimmersed in {{hypotonic}} sea water, then, centrifugalized by {{an ordinary}} driven electric centrifuger. The eggs were remarkably stratified forming conspicuous clear hyaloplasmic layer. In {{the case of the}} sperm attachment at the site of this layer, the behavior of the spermatozoon in the process of invasion, and the course of penetration through the egg surface, were precisely observed. To ascertain the mechanism of <b>synkaryon</b> (fusion of two pronuclei), the fertilized eggs in the various stages of development were exposed to sea water containing phenylurethan. In the exposure, the formation of the astral rays and spindle fibers were completely suppressed. Through the experiments, the behavior of two pronuclei in each period of the exposure, andthe recovering process were observed. As the results, following conclusions were obtained. Phenylurethan completely inhibits the formation of the astral rays which are radiating from the centrosome of the sperm head (the sperm head later swells into male pronucleus). Under these situations, the fusion of both pronuclei never took place as far as the writer 2 ̆ 7 s experiments were concerned. From the above facts, it seems clear, that the astral rays of the sperm pronucleus {{play an important role in}} the mechanism of the compromise and the fusion of two pronuclei. In the eggs, exposing to phenylurethan beginning ten minutes after insemination, andtransferred to sea water within 45 minutes, <b>synkaryon</b> took place about 30 minutes later. In this case, the mitotic apparatus was rapidly formed. Cleavage began almost at the same time in the control eggs. The rapid formation of the mitotic apparatus and synchronous cleavage of the recovering eggs are probably based upon the adaptation to the endoplasmic condition of the treated eggs, advanced regularly irrespective of the immersion of the reagent...|$|E
40|$|The Indian race of Blepharisma undulans {{described}} in this paper measures 150 μ in length. The macronucleus consists of 5 – 7 nodes, all of equal size. During binary fission, condensation of macronucleus is followed by its elongation and a thinning of the middle region which breaks with {{the division of the}} animal. It later attains the typical vegetative form. During conjugation 7 or 8 micronuclei pass through the first pregamic division, 5 to 7 through the second pregamic division and one product of the second division takes part in the third division. The rest degenerate. At the same time, the macronucleus also starts degenerating. After the <b>synkaryon</b> has divided twice, the conjugating pairs separate. Of the 4 products, 3 become macronuclear anlagen and one, micronuclear anlage. The micronuclei divide asynchronously both during binary fission and during conjugation. There is apparently considerable diversity in the structure and behaviour of the macronucleus and micronuclei in the different races of Blepharisma undulans...|$|E

40|$|The {{story of}} our {{knowledge}} of ciliate mating types and their relevant signaling molecules, originally referred to as mating type substances/factors and today usually described as pheromones (to imply a more general function as chemicals used to communicate between individuals of the same species), is inextricably bound to our understanding about ciliate sexual activity. This activity is commonly manifested as conjugation, autogamy in ciliates, like parthenogenesis in animals, being an additional and much more sporadic alternative. Although conjugation has been described {{in a variety of}} organisms, ciliate conjugation is a unique phenomenon of cell-cell interaction and reversible union in mating pairs, {{that has nothing to do}} with phenomena of gamete-gamete interaction and irreversible union into a <b>synkaryon.</b> The two ciliates (designated as gamonts) which unite into a conjugal, or mating pair are de facto hermaphrodite, vegetatively reproducing cells which will generate two sexually complementary haploid gametic nuclei, one migratory (male) and one stationary (female), only as result of a meiotic process that involves their diploid micronuclei and is triggered by the cell mating union itself...|$|E
40|$|An {{account of}} {{conjugation}} in an American species of Blepharisma is given. A comparison is also {{made with the}} available knowledge of the two Indian species of this genus. In the conjugating pair, the condensed macronucleus shows Feulgen negative regions. Before the conjugants separate, the macronuclear and micronuclear anlagen become distinguishable. The species {{is characterized by a}} number of striking features which become noticeable after syngamy. The <b>synkaryon</b> divides thrice giving rise to 8 bodies. Of these, 3 to 7 become the macronuclear anlagen and the rest, the micronuclei. The resorption of the old macronucleus occurs much later, just before the exconjugant attains the vegetative form. No metagamic fissions occur in this species and each exconjugant becomes a vegetative animal in 5 or 6 days. During this period, the macronuclear anlagen arrange themselves in a series and develop slender connections with one another to produce the moniliform macronucleus of the vegetative animal. The micronuclear anlagen, on the other hand, divide by mitosis to attain the vegetative number. In this species 40 % to 45 % of the exconjugants are viable and the rest die...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence cytophotometry {{was used}} to study nuclear DNA content and {{synthesis}} patterns during meiosis, fertilization and macronuclear development in the ciliated protozoon, Tetra-hymena pyriformis, syngen 1. It was found that cells entered conjugation with a G 1 (45 C) macro-nucleus and a G 3 (4 C) micronucleus. During meiosis the micronucleus was reduced to 4 haploid nuclei, each with a iC amount of DNA; each meiotic product then replicated to 2 C, but only the nucleus next to the attachment membrane in each conjugant divided to form the two iC gametic nuclei. The gametic nuclei replicated to 2 C prior to fertilization; hence there was no S-period in the 4 C fertilization nucleus (<b>synkaryon).</b> The first postzygotic division products immediately entered an 5 -period to become 4 C, and at the second postzygotic division, {{each of the two}} 4 C nuclei in each conjugant divided to form one 2 C micronucleus and one 2 C macro-nuclear Anlage. The macronuclear Aniagen began DNA synthesis immediately and were about 8 C at the completion of conjugation; the micronuclei did not undergo rapid DNA doubling and measured between 2 C and 3 C when the conjugants separated. The old macronucleus did not participate in any>S-period during conjugation and began to decompose after the second post-zygotic division; it contained an average of 24 C at the end of conjugation.

40|$|Microorganisms {{represent}} the smallest but arguably most {{important component of}} the ocean life. They are essential to all nutrient cycles because they form the bottom of the marine food chain and outnumber all other marine species by orders of magnitude. Sampling of remote and inaccessible habitats and large-scale genomic analysis have shown how little we know about the microbial life in the oceans, and how our poor knowledge of the marine chemistry and biology is preventing us from foreseeing the detrimental effects that a too rapidly changing world has on the oceans’ ecosystems. In this context, polar microorganisms are attracting particular interest because of their role in global-scale biogeochemical cycles, in particular the carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere (Falkowski et al. 2008). Considering this interest, planktonic and benthic microbial communities from Arctic and Antarctic areas have become the focus of more systematic samplingand rigorous analyses for their taxonomic, prokaryotic (bacterial) and eukaryotic (protist), biodiversity. A relevant result of these analyses was the finding of microbial species that, like a diverse range of plant and animal species (Lindberg 1991; Crame 1993), warrant the definition ‘‘bipolar’’ (or ‘‘anti-tropical’’), i. e. species represented by high-latitude populations physically separated in distribution across the tropics (Darling et al. 2000; Montresor et al. 2003; Brandt et al. 2007; Pawlowski et al. 2007). This concept of species bipolarity has inherently raised the intriguing question whether co-specific Antarctic and Arctic populations evolved independently since the effective separation (approximately 10 – 15 million years ago) between the Arctic and Antarctic cold-water provinces, or whether a trans-tropical gene flow ensures that these polar populations maintain genetic continuity (Darling et al. 2000). Morphological studies alone are clearly insufficient to address this question, due to recurrent phenomena of parallel or convergent morphological evolution that take place under similar environmental forces. Therefore, more solid grounds supporting the concept of species bipolarity have been obtained in some species of foraminifera and dinozoans from analysis of genetic variation in sequences of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA nuclear gene (Darling et al. 2000; Montresor et al. 2003; Brandt et al. 2007; Pawlowski et al. 2007). Nevertheless, unless the calibration of a molecular clock is supported by abundance in fossil records, {{as is the case in}} foraminifera (Pawlowski et al. 1997), also this genetic approach is impaired by the fact that the same DNA regions may evolve at different rates among closely related organisms. A solution to overcoming this challenge is provided by the well-defined, monophyletic group of ciliates which are ideal organisms for the analysis of the breeding structure of natural microbial populations and, therefore, for obtaining data which satisfy the interbreeding criterion on which the biological (Darwinian) concept of species is founded. Ciliates govern their gene exchanges through a unique sexual phenomenon, known as conjugation (or mating), in which two functionally hermaphroditic individuals unite temporarily in pairs for a mutual exchange of a ‘‘migratory’’ (‘‘male’’) gametic nucleus destined to fuse into a <b>synkaryon</b> with a ‘‘resident’’ (‘‘female’’) gametic nucleus. In addition, ciliates more than any other group of polar microorganisms can readily provide living laboratory material in virtually unlimited amounts, since every aquatic polar habitat hosts a large variety of ciliate species that are relatively easy to collect and expand into permanent clonal cultures (i. e., descendants from single wild-type specimens). Here we review results that have been obtained from breeding analyses of Antarctic, Fuegian and Arctic populations of the ciliate Euplotes nobilii. These results have provided compelling evidence that these populations are genetically interconnected by gene flow and form a unique interbreeding biological species. The description of these results is preceded by an outline of our current knowledge of ciliate biodiversity in the polar regions, and by a rationalization of the genetic mechanism of the mating types that represents the major driving force of ciliate breeding strategies...|$|E
