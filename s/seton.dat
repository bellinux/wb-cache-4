5|$|During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight {{times and}} the American Civil War, the College {{continued}} to expand. <b>Seton</b> Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) {{during the summer of}} 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the Spanish–American War. Perhaps one of the most pivotal events in the history of <b>Seton</b> Hall came in 1897 when <b>Seton</b> Hall's preparatory (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated. By 1937, <b>Seton</b> Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at <b>Seton</b> Hall. <b>Seton</b> Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, <b>Seton</b> Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU-FM.|$|E

5|$|Like many Catholic {{universities}} in the United States, <b>Seton</b> Hall arose out of the Plenary Council of American Bishops, held in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1844, {{with the goal of}} bringing Catholicism to higher education in order to help propagate the faith. The Diocese of Newark had been established by Pope Pius IX in 1853, just three years before the founding of the college, and it necessitated an institution for higher learning. <b>Seton</b> Hall College was formally founded on September 1, 1856, by Newark Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley, a cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt. Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt, Mother Elizabeth Ann <b>Seton,</b> who was later named the first American-born Catholic saint.|$|E

5|$|The University seal as it {{is today}} is {{symbolic}} of hundreds of years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley Coat of Arms and the <b>Seton</b> family crest.

Ryan designed the current form of the <b>Seton</b> Hall crest, which is notable for its three crescents and three torteau. The motto on the seal Hazard Zet Forward (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of Norman French and archaic English meaning at whatever risk, yet go forward. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal {{in the middle of the}} university green.
