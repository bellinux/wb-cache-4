40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} confirmed {{the importance of}} rat chromosome 3 (RNO 3) genetic loci on blood pressure elevation, pulse pressure (PP) variability and renal pathology during salt challenge in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rat. The aims {{of this study were}} to generate a panel of RNO 3 congenic <b>sub-strains</b> to genetically dissect the implicated loci and identify positional candidate genes by microarray expression profiling and analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Method and results: A panel of congenic <b>sub-strains</b> were generated containing Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) -introgressed segments of varying size on the SHRSP genetic background, focused within the first 50 Mbp of RNO 3. Haemodynamic profiling during salt challenge demonstrated significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and PP variability in SP. WKYGla 3 a, SP. WKYGla 3 c, SP. WKYGla 3 d and SP. WKYGla 3 e <b>sub-strains.</b> Only SBP and DBP were significantly reduced during salt challenge in SP. WKYGla 3 b and SP. WKYGla 3 f <b>sub-strains,</b> whereas SP. WKYGla 3 g rats did not differ in haemodynamic response to SHRSP. Those <b>sub-strains</b> demonstrating significantly reduced PP variability during salt challenge also demonstrated significantly reduced renal pathology and proteinuria. Microarray expression profiling prioritized two candidate genes for blood pressure regulation (Dnm 1, Tor 1 b), localized within the common congenic interval shared by SP. WKYGla 3 d and SP. WKYGla 3 f strains, and one candidate gene for salt-induced PP variability and renal pathology (Rabgap 1), located within the region unique to the SP. WKYGla 3 d strain. Comparison of next-generation sequencing data identified variants within additional positional genes that are likely to affect protein function. Conclusion: This study has identified distinct intervals on RNO 3 -containing genes that may be important for blood pressure regulation and renal pathology during salt challenge...|$|R

Hepatic mRNA profiles {{after treatment}} with xenobiotic chemicals are used to predict and understand drug toxicity and mechanisms. Surprisingly, neither inter- and intra-strain variability of mRNA abundances in control rats nor the heritability of rat mRNA abundances yet been established. We address these issues by studying five populations: the popular Sprague-Dawley strain, <b>sub-strains</b> of Long-Evans and Wistar rats, and two lines derived from crosses between the Long-Evans and Wistar <b>sub-strains.</b> Using three independent techniques – variance analysis, linear modelling, and unsupervised pattern recognition – we characterize extensive intra- and inter-strain variability in mRNA levels. We find that both sources of variability are non-random and are enriched for specific functional groups. Specific transcription-factor binding-sites are enriched in their promoter regions and these genes occur in “islands” scattered throughout the rat genome. Using the two lines generated by crossbreeding we tested heritability of hepatic mRNA levels: the majority of rat genes appear to exhibit directional genetics, {{with only a few}} interacting loci. Finally, a comparison of inter-strain heterogeneity between mouse and rat orthologs shows more heterogeneity in rats than mice; thus rat and mouse heterogeneity are uncorrelated. Our results establish that control hepatic mRNA levels are relatively homogeneous within rat strains but highly variable between strains. This variability may be related to increased activity of specific transcription-factors and has clear functional consequences. Future studies may take advantage of this phenomenon by surveying panels of rat strains...|$|R

40|$|The use of Escherichia coli {{as a model}} {{organism}} {{has provided}} {{a great deal of}} basic information in biomolecular sciences. Examining trait differences among closely related strains of the same species addresses a fundamental biological question: how much diversity is there at the single species level? The main aim of our research was to identify significant differences in the activities of groups of genes between two laboratory strains of an organism closely related in genome structure. We demonstrate that despite strict and controlled growth conditions, there is high plasticity in the global proteome and genome expression in two closely related E. coli K 12 <b>sub-strains</b> (W 3110 and MG 1655), which differ insignificantly in genome structure. The growth patterns of these two <b>sub-strains</b> were very similar in a well-equipped bioreactor, and their genome structures were shown to be almost identical by DNA microarray. However, detailed profiling of protein and gene expression by 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis and microarray analysis showed many differentially expressed genes and proteins, combinations of which were highly correlated. The differentially regulated genes and proteins belonged to the following functional categories: genes regulated by sigma subunit of RNA polymerase (RpoS), enterobactin-related genes, and genes involved in central metabolism. Genes involved in central cell metabolism - the glycolysis pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate bypass - were differentially regulated at both the mRNA and proteome levels. The strains differ significantly in central metabolism and thus in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy. This high plasticity probably represents a universal feature of metabolic activities in closely related species, and has the potential to reveal differences in regulatory networks. We suggest that unless care is taken in the choice of strains for any validating experiment, the results might be misleading...|$|R

40|$|Maladaptive fear, such as {{fear that}} is {{persistent}} or easily generalized to a nonthreatening stimuli, {{is associated with}} anxiety-related disorders in humans. In the laboratory, maladaptive fear can be modeled in rodents using Pavlovian fear conditioning. Recently, an inbred mouse strain known as 129 S 1 /SvImJ, or 129 S 1 have been reported as exhibiting impairments in fear extinction and enhanced fear generalization. With a long-term goal of identifying segregating genetic markers of maladaptive fear, we used Pavlovian fear conditioning to characterize a closely related substrain designated as 129 S 6 /SvEvTac, or 129 S 6. Here we report that, like 129 S 1 animals, 129 S 6 mice exhibit appropriate levels of fear upon conditioning, but are unable to extinguish fear memories once they are consolidated. Importantly, the maladaptive fear phenotype in this inbred stain can be segregated by <b>sub-strain</b> when probed using conditioning protocols designed to assess generalized fear. We find that unlike the 129 S 1 substrain, mice from the 129 S 6 <b>sub-strain</b> do not generalize conditioned fear to previously novel contexts and can learn to discriminate between two similar contexts when trained using a discrimination protocol. These results suggest {{that at least two}} forms of maladaptive fear (deficits in fear extinction and fear generalization) can be can be functionally segregated, further suggesting that the underlying neurobiology is heritable. Given the observation that two closely related sub-strains can exhibit different constellations of maladaptive fear suggests that these findings could be exploited to facilitate the identification of candidate genes for anxiety-related disorders...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrokinetic}} {{properties of}} five <b>sub-strains</b> of Mycobacterium bovis BCG were studied {{in an attempt}} to explain inter-strain differences and the aggregation phenomena characteristic of all strains during growth. Cells of all strains behaved as a typical macropolyanion. Studies of the variation of charge with the pH and ionic strength of the suspension medium before and after chemical and enzymic treatments revealed that the surface charge of these organisms was due solely to ionizable phosphate groups. Anion adsorption on the surface was negligible and no carboxyl, amino or sulphydryl groups could be detected. The charge on cells of all strains was constant and independent of the growth medium, the age of the cells up to 28 days and storage of the washed cells at 4 °C. The large quantity of lipid material, known to be present in the cell walls of mycobacteria, was not detectable at either the inner or outer surfaces of the cell wall. It was concluded that the lipid must be located in the middle regions of the wall. Cells of M. phlei, M. smegmatis and M. microti exhibited surface charge properties which were identical to those of all <b>sub-strains</b> of BCG. The results are discussed in the light of proposed cell wall structures of mycobacteria and it is concluded that the phosphate groups, which form the predominant charging species and which therefore occur at the surface, are the phosphodiester groups linking the peptidoglycan backbone with the arabinoglactan of the cell wall. A "slime-like" amorphous material which coats aggregates of cells, but not individual cells, was revealed by stereoscan electron microscopy. This substance, which is easily removed by manual tissue-grinding, is believed to be responsible for the aggregation of mycobacterial cells during growth; physico-chemical, forces arising from the charged surface groups play no part in this aggregation phenomenon. <p...|$|R

40|$|The studies {{examined}} {{mechanisms and}} treatments of experimental neuropathic pain with {{particular emphasis on}} the differences between rat strains and <b>sub-strains</b> in basal nociceptive sensitivity, development of neuropathic behaviors and sensitivity to opioid analgesia. In order to study the mechanisms that mediate mechanical allodynia (touch-evoked pain) following ischemic nerve injury to the sciatic nerve in rats, the myelinated primary afferents have been examined in the injured and intact nerves. Although the properties of myelinated afferents after nerve injury were not {{different from that of}} control, spontaneous ectopic discharges were observed in damaged myelinated fibers which may be involved in triggering and maintaining central sensitization causing touch-evoked, A(beta) fiber mediated allodynia. Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs) are significantly less sensitive to nociceptive stimulation and less susceptible to the development of mechanical hypersensitivity compared to Sprague-Dawley rats (SD). The present studies revealed that the properties of myelinated primary afferents in SHRs are not different from those of SDs. Therefore, the reduced development of mechanical hypersensitivity in SHRs is not related to the properties of cutaneous mechanoreceptors, but may be due to central mechanisms. Chronic opioid treatment leads to tolerance. We showed that development of tolerance to the antiallodynic effect of methadone was significantly delayed compared to morphine in neuropathic rats and there is an incomplete cross-tolerance between the two opioids. This may be related to higher intrinsic activity of methadone or its NMDA receptor antagonistic properties. Since the development of neuropathic pain behaviors differ between the two <b>sub-strains</b> of SD rats, we tested the antinociceptive effect of different opioids, in order to study the relationship between opioid analgesia and the development of neuropathic pain. SD-Möllegaard (SD-MÖ) rats are more prone to develop neuropathic pain-like behaviors compared to SD-B&K Universal (SD-BK), and less sensitive to the antinociceptive effect of morphine and methadone.

40|$|The devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) {{is caused}} by clonal {{transmissible}} cancers {{that have led to}} a catastrophic decline in the wild Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) population. The first transmissible tumor, now termed devil facial tumor 1 (DFT 1), was first discovered in 1996 and has been continually transmitted to new hosts for at least 20 years. In 2015, a second transmissible cancer [devil facial tumor 2 (DFT 2) ] was discovered in wild devils, and the DFT 2 is genetically distinct and independent from the DFT 1. Despite the estimated 136, 559 base pair substitutions and 14, 647 insertions/deletions in the DFT 1 genome as compared to two normal devil reference genomes, the allograft tumors are not rejected by the host immune system. Additionally, genome sequencing of two <b>sub-strains</b> of DFT 1 detected greater than 15, 000 single-base substitutions that were found in only one of the DFT 1 <b>sub-strains,</b> demonstrating the transmissible tumors are evolving and that generation of neoantigens is likely ongoing. Recent evidence in human clinical trials suggests that blocking PD- 1 :PD-L 1 interactions promotes antitumor immune responses and is most effective in cancers with a high number of mutations. We hypothesized that DFTD cells could exploit the PD- 1 :PD-L 1 inhibitory pathway to evade antitumor immune responses. We developed recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to provide the first demonstration that PD- 1 binds to both PD-L 1 and PD-L 2 in a non-placental mammal and show that PD-L 1 is upregulated in DFTD cells in response to IFN-γ. Immunohistochemistry showed that PD-L 1 is rarely expressed in primary tumor masses, but low numbers of PD-L 1 + non-tumor cells were detected in the microenvironment of several metastatic tumors. Importantly, in vitro testing suggests that PD- 1 binding to PD-L 1 and PD-L 2 can be blocked by mAbs, which could be critical to understanding how the DFT allografts evade the immune system.

40|$|International audienceHuman {{neurological}} disorders include {{a wide range}} of illnesses which have a disproportionately high prevalence in the increasingly populous geriatric community. Any research effort directed at discovering the aetiology of neurological disease is greatly enhanced with models of the disease of interest. Scientific research incorporating the use of mice has advanced rapidly in the last three decades. Relatively simple to breed, maintain and train, mice have many advantages over other species for use in research. More than a century of selective breeding has provided investigators with a rich gene pool and <b>sub-strain</b> diversity from which to choose for their research. Thus the dramatic increase in genetic screening and gene engineering that has occurred in research in recent decades has enabled the generation of a multitude of mouse models. This review discusses the relative utility of mouse models in which a heritable or non-heritable (acquired) manipulation has been used to model a specified trait of a human neurological disorder. The techniques used in deriving useful genetic alterations or modifications and in generating acquired mouse models are outlined with examples of each provided...|$|E
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{kidney stones}} are rare in animals. The Japanese strains of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are normotensive at birth but develop high blood pressure, hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia as they mature. The SHR strain {{is prone to}} develop kidney stones. A unique <b>sub-strain</b> of SHR has been developed in which some animals develop hypothalamic obesity concomitantly with their rising blood pressure, i. e. Obese/SHR. The Obese/SHR characteristically develop microscopic kidney stones which become detached {{at an early stage}} of formation, migrate to the bladder, and grow by concretion into huge, rounded calculi. The stone nidus starts as a subepithelial cyst-like focus containing oedema, colloidal acidic mucoprotein, and red and white blood cells suspended on a delicate network of fibrils. THe nidi grow by concretion of an admixture of calcium and acidic protein in a lamellar arrangement. The disparate morphogenesis and anatomic location of kidney stones in Obese is opposed to non-obese/SHR suggest that calculus formation may be governed by specific differences in genetic programming. The incidence of kidney stones parallels the severity and chronicity of the hypertension in SHR, non-obese and Obese/SHR, and the Cushingoid habitus in the Obese/SHR...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to detect blood Transmitted Transfusion Virus (TTV) among Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) {{patients}} and investigate the genetic diversity of an isolated TTV strain. Fifty blood samples of patients with HCC non-A through non-G hepatitis were collected and 25 blood donors as controls. TTV DNA was detected by the second generation of TTV PCR primers (NG 059, NG 061, NG 062 and NG 063) after extraction of DNA from 50 �L serum. TTV DNA was detected in 90 % (45 / 50) of HCC patients and the prevalence in control group was 40 % (10 / 25). To assess genetic heterogeneity of the TTV genome in more detail, a sequence analysis of PCR fragments, amplified from open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) was performed. A total of 137 bp PCR fragments were sequenced and compared to sequences derived from the corresponding TTV genome region deposited in Gen Bank. Present sequencing was closely related to TTV-like mini virus, complete genome (Accession NC_ 002195), at nucleotide number 855 to 1019. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that present strain might be <b>sub-strain</b> or mutation from the parent gene 2195. These observations suggest a high degree of genetic complexity within the TTV population...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{period before}} World War I {{led to the}} {{initiation}} of inbreeding in rats by Dr Helen King in about 1909 and in mice by Dr C. C. Little in 1909. The latter project {{led to the development}} of the DBA strain of mice, now widely distributed as the two major <b>sub-strains</b> DBA/1 and DBA/2, which were separated in 1929-1930. DBA mice were nearly lost in 1918, when the main stocks were wiped out by murine paratyphoid, and only three un-pedigreed mice remained alive. Soon after World War I, inbreeding in mice was started on a much larger scale by Dr L. C. Strong, leading in particular to the development of strains C3H and CBA, and by Dr C. C. Little, leading to the C57 family of strains (C57BL, C57BR and C57L). Many of the most popular strains of mice were developed during the next decade, and some are closely related. Evidence from the uniformity of mitochondrian DNA suggests that most of the common inbred mouse strains were probably derived from a single breeding female about 150-200 years ago." ...|$|R
5000|$|Over time, the Bedouin {{developed}} several sub-types or {{strains of}} Arabian horse, each with unique characteristics, and traced through the maternal line only. The five primary strains, attributed to have {{descended from the}} Al Khamsa were known as the Keheilan, Seglawi, Abeyan or Obeyan, Hamdani, and Hadban or Hedban. Carl Raswan, a promoter and writer about Arabian horses {{from the middle of}} the 20th century, held the belief that there were only three strains, Kehilan, Seglawi and Muniqi or Maanagi. Raswan felt that these strains represented body [...] "types" [...] of the breed, with the Kehilan being [...] "masculine", the Seglawi being [...] "feminine" [...] and the Muniqi being [...] "speedy". [...] There were also lesser strains, <b>sub-strains,</b> and regional variations in strain names. Purity of bloodline was very important to the Bedouin, and they also believed in telegony, believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of [...] "impure" [...] blood, the mare herself and all future offspring would be [...] "contaminated" [...] by the stallion and hence no longer Asil.|$|R
