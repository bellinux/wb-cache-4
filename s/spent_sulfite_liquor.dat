We screened 3 polysulfone (PS) membranes with cutoffs of 100, 50, and 25 kDa, respectively. Flux and retention for the 100 - and 50 -kDa membranes had the same order of magnitude, indicating that these properties were determined by fouling that formed on the membrane—not pore size. The PS membrane with the 50 -kDa cutoff performed best in terms of flux and retention of lignin-carbohydrate complexes and experienced the least membrane fouling. Two prefiltration methods were used to decrease the fouling of the 50 -kDa membrane: a 0. 2 -μm PS microfiltration membrane and dead-end filtration with 10 -um filter cloth and a 4 wt% mixture of kieselguhr (diatomite) and <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> prior to filtration. Prefiltration of the SSL with microfiltration increased the flux 3 -fold and decreased the fouling grade from 49 % to 7. 2 %. Dead-end filtration effected a 16 % increase in flux and a fouling grade of 17 %. The retention of LCC during microfiltration was high, {{which resulted in a}} loss of high-molecular-weight products, whereas the loss of LCC during dead-end filtration was negligible.

Hence, the biotechnological application of these microorganisms can cover many aspects, such as the treatment of hypersaline waste streams of different origin. Due to the fact that the high osmotic pressure of hypersaline environments reduces the risk of contamination, the capacity for cost-effective non-sterile cultivation can make extreme halophilic microorganisms potentially valuable organisms for biotechnological applications. In this contribution, the stepwise use of screening approaches, employing design of experiment (DoE) on model media and subsequently using industrial waste as substrate have been implemented to investigate the applicability of halophiles to generate PHB from the industrial waste stream <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL). The production of PHB on model media as well as dilutions of industrial substrate in a complex medium has been screened for by fluorescence microscopy using Nile Blue staining.

It could be shown that neither single inhibiting substances nor a mixture thereof inhibited growth in the investigated range, hence, leaving the question on the inhibiting mechanisms open.

To reduce the {{biological oxygen demand}} of SSL associated with dissolved sugars, we studied the capacity of Pichia stipitis FPL-YS 30 (xyl 3 Delta) to convert these sugars into useful products. FPL-YS 30 produces a negligible amount of ethanol while converting xylose into xylitol. This work describes the xylose fermentation kinetics of yeast strain P. stipitis FPL-YS 30. Yeast was grown in rich medium supplemented with different carbon sources: glucose, xylose, or ammonia-base SSL. The SSL and glucose-acclimatized cells showed similar maximum specific growth rates (0. 146 h(- 1)). The highest xylose consumption {{at the beginning of}} the fermentation process occurred using cells precultivated in xylose, which showed relatively high specific activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 49). However, the maximum specific rates of xylose consumption (0. 19 g(xylose) /g(cel) h) and xylitol production (0. 059 g(xylitol) /g(cel) h) were obtained with cells acclimatized in glucose, in which the ratio between xylose reductase (EC 1. 1. 1. 21) and xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 9) was kept at higher level (0. 82). In this case, xylitol production (31. 6 g/l) was 19 and 8 % higher than in SSL and xylose-acclimatized cells, respectively. Maximum glycerol (6. 26 g/l) and arabitol (0. 206 g/l) production were obtained using SSL and xylose-acclimatized cells, respectively. The medium composition used for the yeast precultivation directly reflected their xylose fermentation performance. The SSL could be used as a carbon source for cell production.

However, fermentative yeasts used for the fermentation of the sugars in SSL are adversely affected by the inhibitory substances in this complex feedstock. To overcome this limitation, evolutionary engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was carried out using genome-shuffling technology based on large-scale population cross mating. Populations of UV-light-induced yeast mutants more tolerant than the wild type to hardwood <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (HWSSL) were first isolated and then recursively mated and enriched for more-tolerant populations. After five rounds of genome shuffling, three strains were isolated that were able to grow on undiluted HWSSL and to support efficient ethanol production from the sugars therein for prolonged fermentation of HWSSL. Analyses showed that greater HWSSL tolerance is associated with improved viability {{in the presence of}} salt, sorbitol, peroxide, and acetic acid. Our results showed that evolutionary engineering through genome shuffling will yield robust yeasts capable of fermenting the sugars present in HWSSL, which is a complex substrate containing multiple sources of inhibitors.

40|$|From a {{continuous}} <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> fermentation plant, {{two species of}} yeast were isolated, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia membranaefaciens. One of the isolates of S. cerevisiae, no. 3, was heavily flocculating and produced a higher ethanol yield from <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> than did commercial baker's yeast. The greatest difference between isolate 3 and baker's yeast was that of galactose fermentation, even when galactose utilization was induced, i. e., when they were grown {{in the presence of}} galactose, prior to fermentation. Without acetic acid present, both baker's yeast and isolate 3 fermented glucose and galactose sequentially. Galactose fermentation with baker's yeast was strongly inhibited by acetic acid at pH values below 6. Isolate 3 fermented galactose, glucose, and mannose without catabolite repression in the presence of acetic acid, even at pH 4. 5.

However, to date hardly any data on thermophiles growing directly on industrial substrates like <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) are available. This contribution investigates the ability of Thermoanaerobacter species to utilize the main sugars in the used SSL (mannose, glucose and xylose) and the effect of process parameters (pH, temperature and sugar concentration) on their growth. Based on these results the strain T. mathranii was chosen for further studies. The ability of T. mathranii to grow directly on SSL was investigated and the effect of several inhibiting substances on growth was elucidated. Furthermore it was tested whether pretreatment with activated charcoal can increase the fermentability of SSL. The fermentations were evaluated based on yields and specific rates. It could be shown that T. mathranii was able to ferment all sugars in the investigated softwood SSL and fermented diluted, untreated SSL (up to 2. 7 % (w/w) dry matter). Pretreatment with activated charcoal could slightly reduce the amount of phenols in the substrate and thus facilitate growth and ethanol production on higher SSL concentrations (up to 4. 7 % (w/v) dry matter).

The MMC was able to accumulate PHA from the different HSSL carbon components (acetic acid, xylose and lignosulfonates) with a PHA storage content during the reactor operation of 54. 2 +/- 10. 6 % PHB. In order to clarify the MMC composition, isolation was performed from the MMC, using HSSL or its main components.

40|$|Fish has for a {{long time}} been a very {{important}} source of protein for human kind and with the world population at an all-time high, 7. 5 billion and rapidly growing, the demand for fish as a food source is also at an all-time high and rapidly increasing. This has in turn led to overexploitation of many of the fish stocks of the world ocean’s and in many cases to depletion of fish stocks. The demand for sustainable food sources and sustainable usage of the world ocean’s fish stocks is therefore a subject with great deal of interest today. Much of the fish caught today are used for production of fish meal for usage as fish food at fish farms, which also increases the depletion of fish stocks around the globe. One way of dealing with this problem is to replace the fish meal as protein source in fish feed with protein from agricultural crops which in many cases are done today by usage of soy bean protein. This however poses another problem as the agricultural crops take up vast amount of land, in many cases obtained by diminishing the rainforests in the area. Another usage for the soybean would be as a direct human food source. Agricultural products are also dependent on environmental conditions to ensure reasonable production. The problems related to production of fish meal and soy has sparked the idea of using microorganisms for production of Single cell protein for usage as protein source in fish feed. Single cell protein can be produced in closed fermentation vessels and can be produced at a controlled rate and under controlled manners, while taking up negligible land space. During this thesis, the production of single cell protein from <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> using the filamentous fungi Paecilomyces variotii was examined. The aim of the project was to examine the effect of cultivation parameters (i. e., pH, temperature and nutrients) on the production of biomass as well as the protein content of the biomass. The correlation of the biomass growth and protein content have also been examined. The project was carried out by performing several experiment cultivations using <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> provided by Domsjö Fabriker in Örnsköldsvik. This process enables the utilization of a residual stream from the pulp industry which gives this process a huge environmental upside compared to similar processes as for example the commercial production of Quorn (a Single cell based food product) which utilizes pure glucose. The results showed that the protein content will steadily decrease as the biomass production increases hence it is desirable to keep the cultivation time at a minimum while maximizing biomass production during that time frame. It also points towards that the highest protein content is present in the young cell mass. The key conclusion from this thesis is however {{that it is possible to}} lower the pH of the cultivation from pH 6 down to pH 4. 5 while still maintaining the biomass production and increasing the protein content. The highest obtained protein content was 62. 7 % at pH 4. 5. The high protein content might be due to a slightly longer lag phase in the beginning of the cultivation which yields a higher number of younger cells in the final broth thus increasing protein content. Running the process at a lower pH is a huge advantage for industrial implementation as this on large scale means significant lower amounts of chemicals needed for pH adjusting of the <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> which renders the process much more economical. This is because pH adjustment today is one of the most costly process steps in the production of bioethanol from <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor.</b> ...|$|E

Biotechnology for Biofuels, 7 (1) : 169, doi: 10. 1186 /s 13068 - 014 - 0169 - 8. The original publication is available at [URL] Flow sheet options for integrating ethanol production from <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) into the acid-based sulfite pulping process at the Sappi Saiccor mill (Umkomaas, South Africa) were investigated, including options for generation of thermal and electrical energy from onsite bio-wastes, such as bark. Processes were simulated with Aspen Plus&# 174; for mass- and energy-balances, followed by an estimation of the economic viability and environmental impacts. Various concentration levels of the total dissolved solids in magnesium oxide-based SSL, which currently fuels a recovery boiler, prior to fermentation was considered, together with return of the fermentation residues (distillation bottoms) to the recovery boiler after ethanol separation. The generation of renewable thermal and electrical energy from onsite bio-wastes were {{also included in the}} energy balance of the combined pulping-ethanol process, in order to partially replace coal consumption. The bio-energy supplementations included the combustion of bark for heat and electricity generation and the bio-digestion of the calcium oxide SSL to produce methane as additional energy source. Results Ethanol production from SSL at the highest substrate concentration was the most economically feasible when coal was used for process energy. However this solution did not provide any savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the concentration-fermentation-distillation process. Maximizing the use of renewable energy sources to partially replace coal consumption yielded a satisfactory economic performance, with a minimum ethanol selling price of 0. 83 US$/l, and a drastic reduction in the overall greenhouse gas emissions for the entire facility. Conclusion High substrate concentrations and conventional distillation should be used when considering integrating ethanol production at sulfite pulping mills. Bio-wastes generated onsite should be utilized at their maximum potential for energy generation in order to maximize the GHG emissions reduction. Publishers’ versio...|$|E

However, depending on the pulping process conditions, the release of monosaccharides also generates a range of compounds that negatively affect microbial fermentation.

Two isolation processes were performed, before and after the re-inoculation of the plant with a commercial baker’s yeast strain.

30|$|Lignocellulosic biomass, {{composed}} of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, represents a {{potential source of}} fermentable sugars {{for the production of}} fuels and bulk chemicals (Wyman and Goodman 1993; Hahn-Hägerdal et al. 2006). In ethanol plants, the heat pretreated biomass is hydrolysed and all sugars are potential substrates for ethanol production (recently reviewed by (Alvira et al. 2010)). In pulp and paper mills, however, the cellulose fraction can be used for the production of pulp, paper, board and cellulose-based products. This requires treating wood biomass with a cooking liquor to obtain the discrete fibres. During the process, the monomeric sugars from the hemicellulose fraction are also released into the cooking liquor during the delignification process (Biermann 1996). When the generated cellulose pulp is removed from the cooking liquor, the resulting by-product stream (e.g. <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) when using sulfite-based liquor), that contains the remaining monomeric sugars, can be used for the production of ethanol as a co-product (see e.g. (Borregaard (2012); Domsjö Fabriker AB (2012))).

40|$|The {{integration}} {{a recovery}} process for <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> from a sulfite cooking process with a kraft pulp mill was studied {{in this thesis}} work. The process includes a fermentation process {{for the production of}} biofuel. The calculation for three cases was done. The three cases considered were with a spruce sulfite pulp production of 100, 250 and 1000 Adt/day corresponding to 10, 25 and 100 % of the total pulp production. A kraft cooking process with prehydrolysis was taken in consideration as reference. Compared to kraft cooking with prehydrolysis a bigger amount of ethanol can be produced by sulfite cooking. In the kraft prehydrolysis case 40 t/day of ethanol and 1000 Adt/day pine pulp is produced and in the sulfite case the production is 113 t/day of ethanol and 1000 Adt/day of spruce pulp. The energy consumption in the sulfite process is assumed to be slightly higher than in the kraft prehydrolysis process. The recovery system for spent liquor mix was studied. The evaporation of the spent cooking liquors should be done separately. The approximately composition of melt was calculated. A comparison of all four cases was done and profitability was estimate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spent</b> <b>Sulfite</b> <b>Liquor</b> (SSL) {{from wood}} pulping {{facilities}} is a sugar rich effluent {{that can be}} used as feedstock for ethanol production. However, depending on the pulping process conditions, the release of monosaccharides also generates a range of compounds that negatively affect microbial fermentation. In the present study, we investigated whether endogenous yeasts in SSL-based ethanol plant could represent a source of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with a naturally acquired tolerance towards this inhibitory environment. Two isolation processes were performed, before and after the re-inoculation of the plant with a commercial baker’s yeast strain. The isolates were clustered by DNA fingerprinting and a recurrent Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, different from the inoculated commercial baker’s yeast strain, was isolated. The strain, named TMB 3720, flocculated heavily and presented high furaldehyde reductase activity. During fermentation of undiluted SSL, TMB 3720 displayed a 4 -fold higher ethanol production rate and 1. 8 -fold higher ethanol yield as compared to the commercial baker’s yeast. Another non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae species, identified as the pentose utilizing Pichia galeiformis, was also recovered in the last tanks of the process where the hexose to pentose sugar ratio and the inhibitory pressure are expected to be the lowest...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) {{is a waste}} {{effluent}} from sulfite pulping {{that contains}} monomeric sugars that can be fermented to ethanol. However, the inhibitory substances found in this complex feedstock adversely affect yeasts used for the fermentation of the sugars in SSL. To overcome this limitation, evolutionary engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was carried out using genome shuffling based on large-scale population recursive meiotic recombination. Populations of UV-induced yeast mutants more tolerant to hardwood <b>spent</b> <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (HWSSL) were isolated and then recursively mated and enriched for more tolerant populations. After five rounds of genome shuffling, three strains were isolated that were able to grow on undiluted HWSSL and support efficient ethanol production from the sugars therein for prolonged fermentation of HWSSL. Analyses showed that greater HWSSL tolerance is associated with improved viability {{in the presence of}} salt, sorbitol, peroxide, and acetic acid. These results demonstrate that evolutionary engineering through genome shuffling will yield robust yeasts capable of fermenting the sugars present in HWSSL, which is a complex substrate containing multiple sources of inhibitors. The genome of R 57, the most inhibitor-tolerant strain generated in this study, was sequenced by massively parallel sequencing and twenty single nucleotide polymorphism mutations were located. Many of these mutations affect genes that correlate with known stress responses to the types of inhibition found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Cross-referencing the mutation findings with RNA-seq-derived differential gene expression analysis of R 57 yields genes and biological processes that are likely playing determinant roles in the HWSSL tolerance trait of R 57. The strongest findings support important roles for the following mutation-bearing proteins and biological processes: stress response transcriptional repressor, Nrg 1 p; NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, Gdh 1 p, and a modified nitrogen usage and assimilation physiology including alterations to aromatic amino acid synthesis pathways and the associated Aro 1 p; protein homeostasis machinery including heat-shock 70 -family proteins, especially Ssa 1 p, and Ubp 7 p and Art 5 p, which are related to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Redox-associated metabolites NADPH, glutathione, mainly via GSH 1 mutation, and iron are also implicated. Overall, these data provide important findings for understanding inhibition by multi-inhibitory lignocellulosic substrates; a meiotic recombination-mediated engineering strategy for generating inhibition-tolerant strains that may be unobtainable through classical evolutionary engineering; novel genetic targets for future rational biocatalyst design and inhibitor-tolerance studies; and a promising work-flow model for generating strains with desirable and complex phenotypic traits along with understanding of the genetic factors and biological processes involved in those traits...|$|E
50|$|The <b>spent</b> cooking <b>liquor</b> from <b>sulfite</b> pulping {{is usually}} called brown liquor, but the terms red liquor, thick <b>liquor</b> and <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> {{are also used}} (compared to black liquor in the kraft process). Pulp washers, using countercurrent flow, remove the spent cooking {{chemicals}} and degraded lignin and hemicellulose. The extracted brown liquor is concentrated, in multiple effect evaporators. The concentrated brown liquor can be burned in the recovery boiler to generate steam and recover the inorganic chemicals for reuse in the pulping process {{or it can be}} neutralized to recover the useful byproducts of pulping. Recent developments in Chemrec's black liquor gasification process, adapting the technology to use in the sulfite pulping process, could make second generation biofuels production an alternative to the conventional recovery boiler technology. Around 1906 Gösta Ekström a Swedish engineer patented a process of ethanol generation from the residual 2-2.5% fermentable sugars in the spent liquor.|$|R
