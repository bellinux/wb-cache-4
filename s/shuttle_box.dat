5000|$|Learned {{helplessness}}: The {{learned helplessness}} model (LH), {{one of the}} well validated animal models, is the best replicated one. The rationale is that exposure to uncontrollable and stressful life events makes people to feel like they are losing control, and this sometimes leads to depressive like behaviors. The model {{is based on the}} observation that animals also develop deficits in escape, cognitive and rewarded behaviors when they have been subjected to repeated unavoidable and uncontrollable shocks. LH is induced in one day or over several days of repeated inescapable stress by the treating of tail shock or foot shock in <b>shuttle</b> <b>boxes.</b> Helpless behavior is evaluated by analyzing the performance in an active escape test, such as the latency to press a lever or cross a door.|$|R
30|$|Although {{depression}} {{is one of}} the prevailing central nervous system disorders, there is still not enough knowledge about the exact alterations underlying its pathophysiology and the treatment is often inefficient. Our study aims at exploring a potential relationship between major depressive disorder and the purinergic P 2 X 7 receptor (P 2 X 7 R), since in previous behavioural tests P 2 rx 7 knock out mice displayed an antidepressant-like phenotype. Among many other known symptoms, the loss of hippocampal spine synapses is a revealing feature of the disorder. Therefore we wanted to measure the density of spine synapses in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in the learned helplessness paradigm and later see if genetic inhibition of P 2 X 7 R could have influence on this condition. Wild type C 57 Bl/ 6 and P 2 rx 7 knock out male mice were exposed to inescapable footshocks (IES) in <b>shuttle</b> <b>boxes</b> during 2 training days and on the 3 rd day learned helplessness was tested, where helpless animals usually failed to escape. Control animals were also placed in <b>shuttle</b> <b>boxes</b> but did not receive footshocks until testing. Escape failures and the latency to escape were measured to determine helpless behaviour. Electron microscopy analysis was performed to determine spine synapse density in the different groups. In wild type mice both average escape latency and the number of failed escapes were significantly higher in the IES treated group, however, we could not find such divergency in P 2 rx 7 knock out mice. Electron microscopy analysis confirmed alterations in spine synapse density in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus subsequent to learned helplessness experiments, as results indicated a significant decrease in spine synapse density in wild type mice, but not in knock out animals. These findings may lead to presume a role of the P 2 X 7 receptor in this disorder and further experiments will hopefully help get a better understanding and thus more effective treatment of major depression.|$|R

The dogs {{had the ability to}} move freely between compartments by going over the barrier. Both compartments had a metal floor designed to administer an unpleasant electric shock. Each compartment also had a light above each, which would turn on and off. Every few minutes, the light in the room the dog was occupying was turned off, while the other remained on. If after 10 seconds in the dark, the dog did not move to the lit compartment, a shock was delivered {{to the floor of the}} room the dog was in. The shock continued until the dog moved into the other compartment. In doing this, the dog was escaping the shock by jumping the barrier into the next room. The dog could avoid the shock completely though by jumping the barrier before the 10 seconds of darkness led to a shock. Each trial worked this way with avoiding the shock as the response. In the first few trials, the dog did not move until the shocks began and then it jumped over the barrier. However, after several trials, the dog began to make avoidance responses and would jump over the barrier when the light turned off, and would not receive the shock. Many dogs never received the shock after the first trial. These results led to questioning in the term avoidance paradox (the question of how the nonoccurrance of an aversive event can be a reinforcer for an avoidance response?) ...|$|E

40|$|Aversive stimuli {{that are}} signaled, and {{therefore}} predictable, are preferred to unsignaled ones and promote less severe stress-related disturbances. Since stressful events {{are known to}} activate mesoaccumbens dopamine (DA) transmission, in the present experiments, we evaluated possible differences in mesoaccumbens DA response to predictable and unpredictable footshocks. Mice of the inbred strain DBA/ 2 were trained for conditioned place preference (CPP) in <b>shuttle</b> <b>boxes.</b> The procedure promoted significant preference for the compartment previously paired with predictable shocks (PR) to that paired with unpredictable shocks (NP). Mesoaccumbens levels of DA and its metabolites were therefore evaluated either after the first or the last (third) training session.

5000|$|On a {{conventional}} loom, the weft thread {{is carried on}} a pirn, in a shuttle that passes through the shed. A handloom weaver could propel the shuttle by throwing it {{from side to side}} {{with the aid of a}} picking stick.

Multiple <b>shuttle</b> <b>boxes</b> allow more than one shuttle to be used.

Experiment I compared a new training procedure, which produces rates of lever-press avoidance learning {{comparable to those}} obtained in <b>shuttle</b> <b>boxes,</b> with a “conventional”, less efficient training procedure. A factorial design {{was used to compare}} continuous versus intermittent shock and a long-variable versus a short-fixed signal-shock interval. Learning was best in the groups trained with the long and variable interval and poorest in those trained with the short and fixed interval. Type of shock had no effect. Experiment II separated the effects of duration from those of variability of the signal-shock interval. Fixed and variable intervals of 10 and 60 sec were tested and duration was the only significant factor. Experiment III addressed the effect of the differential opportunity to avoid provided by long signal-shock intervals by varying this interval from 10 to 60 sec in 10 -sec steps. Only the 10 -sec group showed slow acquisition relative to the others. Analysis of avoidance response latencies showed that the distributions for all groups were positively skewed and that skewness increased with increasing duration of the signal-shock interval. At intervals longer than 20 sec, the animals made progressively less use of their increased opportunity to respond. The data do not support the opportunity-to-respond interpretation of the effects of duration of signal-shock interval and suggest that some type of inhibitory process may block lever-press avoidance learning at intervals as short as 10 sec.

Three {{days before the}} end of treatment, each group was divided into two subgroups which received either inescapable shock (IS) or no shock (NS) treatment in <b>shuttle</b> <b>boxes.</b> All groups were subsequently submitted to an escape test on the following day and then sacrificed one day after the escape test, when blood samples were taken to measure serum Li+, Na+ and K+ concentrations by flame photometry.

The IS and not the NS chronically treated rats presented increased serum Li+ levels which cannot be accounted for in terms of differences in Li+ intake. The IS group treated chronically with lithium had a better escape performance than the IS group receiving either tap water or acute Li+ administration. We conclude that chronic but not acute Li+ treatment at a serum level within the prophylactic range (0. 5 mEq/l) is able to prevent learned helplessness in the rat. These results agree with the data obtained in clinical practice indicating that Li+ is only effective after chronic administration and that Li(+) -induced hyperkalemia is a side effect...|$|R

The ratio of each reward type can also be compared between mouse strains and the change in this ratio can be monitored within testing sessions to measure satiation with a given reward type.

The specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial properties of exercise, however, remain unclear. One relevant pharmacological target {{in the treatment of}} psychiatric disorders is the 5 -HT 2 C receptor (5 -HT 2 CR). Consistent with data demonstrating the anxiogenic consequences of 5 -HT 2 CR activation in humans and rodents, we have previously reported that site-specific administration of the selective 5 -HT 2 CR agonist CP- 809101 in the lateral/basolateral amygdala (BLA) increases shock-elicited fear while administration of CP- 809101 in the dorsal striatum (DS) interferes with <b>shuttle</b> <b>box</b> escape learning. These findings suggest that activation of 5 -HT 2 CR in discrete brain regions contributes to specific anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and may indicate potential brain sites involved in the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of exercise.

NADPH-d positive neuron counts in HS group were significantly decreased at 12 h. Conclusion: Acute heat stress could result in obvious damages on learning and memory function of mice, which was possibly related with the increased NADPH-d positive neuron expression...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:The {{hippocampus}} is one for {{the major}} centers of learning and memory. Role of the opioid system has been investigated {{and on the other}} hand receptors related to this system such as mu-opioid receptors (MOR) are extended in the hippocampus. In this study the effect of Naloxone administration as a mu opioid receptor antagonist on passive avoidance memory in adult male rats was investigated by using <b>shuttle</b> <b>box</b> instrument. Methods:Methods: In this study 45 male adult Wistar rats at range of 200 ± 20 were used. They were cannulated after anesthesia and Naloxone 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 µg/rat has been injected intrahippocampally after recovery and post training by <b>shuttle</b> <b>box.</b> Then after 90 minute short –term memory and after 24 hours long- term memory were measured posttrainingly. Results:results showed that naloxone 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 µg/rat didn’t affected short – term memory on the other hand according to results of long-term memory showed that Naloxone 0. 5 µg/rat didn’t affected memory and Naloxone 1 and 1. 5 µg/rat improved memory and Naloxone 2 µg/rat impaired memory. Conclusion:Considering to obtained results it seems that Naloxone affected learning and memory in a dose dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of dose-dependent of iron supplementation on short-term and long-term memory in adult male rats in a <b>shuttle</b> <b>box.</b> Iron imbalance in the brain, including excess accumulation and deficiency are associated with neurological disease and dysfunction; yet, their origins are poorly understood. So, in this study were investigated the effects of iron on the behavior of adult wistar rats. Rats were treated with different doses of iron (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, 120, 150 mg kg - 1) by gavage for 3 consecutive days and the effects of iron supplementation on passive avoidance memory were studied by <b>shuttle</b> <b>box.</b> The results showed that iron supplementation (20, 30 mg kg - 1) significantly (p - 1 significantly (p - 1 impairment (p< 0. 05) short term memory. Thus, we can assume that the organism, particularly the adults, can compensate for a small dose of iron supplementation and there exists a mechanism that certainly protects the brain against iron overload until a certain point but cannot compensate for when the load exceeds this limit...|$|E
40|$|During early fasting, {{increases}} in skeletal muscle proteolysis liberate {{free amino acids}} for hepatic gluconeogenesis in response to pancreatic glucagon. Hepatic glucose output diminishes during the late protein-sparing phase of fasting, when ketone body production by the liver supplies compensatory fuel for glucose-dependent tissues 1 – 4. Glucagon stimulates the gluconeogenic program by triggering the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC 2; also known as TORC 2), while parallel decreases in insulin signaling augment gluconeogenic gene expression through the de-phosphorylation and nuclear <b>shuttling</b> of Forkhead <b>Box</b> O 1 (FOXO 1) 5 – 7. Here we show that a fasting-inducible switch, consisting of the histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) P 300 and the nutrient-sensing deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1), maintains energy balance through the sequential induction of CRTC 2 and FOXO 1. Following glucagon induction, CRTC 2 stimulated gluconeogenic gene expression through an association with P 300, which we show here is also activated by de-phosphorylation at Ser 89 during fasting. In turn, P 300 increased hepatic CRTC 2 activity by acetylating it at Lys 628, a site that also targets CRTC 2 for degradation following its ubiquitination by the E 3 ligas...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the mental disorders in mice with thioacetamide (TAA) -induced acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE). MethodsThirty male Kunming mice were equally and randomly {{divided into two}} groups (treatment group and control group). Mice in the treatment group received an intraperitoneal injection of TAA (200 mg·kg- 1 ·d- 1 for 3 days, up to 600 mg·kg- 1), as compared with the same volume of physiological saline in the control group. Neurological function score, light/dark box, open field, and elevated plus-maze test were used to determine behavioral parameters at 24 h after the model was established. Serum ammonia, aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (TBil) were measured at 24 h post determination of behavioral parameters. Comparison between two groups was made by independent-samples t test. ResultsIn the light/dark box test, the treatment group had significantly reduced residence time in the light box and number of <b>shuttles</b> between two <b>boxes</b> (t=- 4. 006, P＜ 0. 01; t=- 2  656, P＜ 0. 05); in the open field test, the treatment group had significantly reduced central distance, central time, and number of vertical movements (t=- 3. 639, P＜ 0. 05; t=- 2. 294, P＜ 0. 05; t=- 2. 282, P＜ 0. 05), as well as increased grooming time (t= 5. 992, P＜ 0. 01); meanwhile, the number of open-arm entries and residence time in the open arm for the treatment group were also reduced in the elevated plus-maze test, as compared with the control group (t=- 3. 584, P＜ 0. 05; t=- 3. 992, P＜ 0. 05). However, the total distance in the open field test showed {{no significant difference between the}} two groups (t=- 0. 96, P＞ 0. 05). Moreover, compared with the control group, the treatment group had significantly higher levels of serum ammonia (t=- 3. 168, P＜ 0. 05), ALT (t= 4. 316, P＜ 0. 05), AST (t=- 2. 581, P＜ 0. 05), and TBil (t=- 9. 127, P＜ 0. 01). ConclusionMice with AHE induced by an intraperitoneal injection of low-dose TAA have anxiety-related behaviors; the anxiety-related behaviors are not associated with reduced locomotor activities...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To see {{the dose}} {{dependent}} effects of zinc chloride on the short-term and long-term memory in a <b>shuttle</b> <b>box</b> (rats). Methodology: Six pair adult wistar rats were taken for this experiment. One group of pregnant rats received a daily oral dose of 20 mg/kg Zn as zinc chloride {{and the remaining}} groups received a daily oral dose of (30, 50, 70, 100 mg/kg) zinc chloride for two weeks by gavage. One month after birth, a <b>shuttle</b> <b>box</b> {{was used to test}} short-term and long-term memory. Two criteria were considered to behavioral test, including latency in entering dark chamber and time spent in the dark chamber. Result: This experiment showed that oral administration of ZnCl 2 with (20, 30, 50 mg/kg/day) doses after 2 weeks at the stage of pregnancy, can improve the working memory of their offspring (p< 0. 05). Where as ZnCl 2 with 30 mg/kg/day dose has been more effective than other doses (p< 0. 001). But rat which received ZnCl 2 with 100 mg/kg/day at the stage of pregnancy, has shown significant impairment in working (short-term) memory of their offspring (p< 0. 05) and {{there was no significant difference}} in reference (long-term) memory 3 for any of groups...|$|E
