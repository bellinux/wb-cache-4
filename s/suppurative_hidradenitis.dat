However, around the same time, the chair position in Hamburg became vacant and was offered to him as well. Stelzner accepted the latter position and was appointed as Professor and Chairman at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf in 1968. [...] Already two years later, Stelzner accepted the chair at the surgical department of the University of Frankfurt. Here he developed a close collaboration with the department chair for comparative anatomy, Dietrich Starck, with whom he identified the enveloping fascias of the rectum and of the neck. These serve as an important lead structures for the radical removal of malignant tumors. Further studies (again with Werner Lierse) described the morphological bases of appendicitis and diverticulitis. In 1976, Stelzner received simultaneous offers to chair the surgical departments of the universities of Vienna and Bonn and Stelzner decided to assume the department leadership in Bonn. A number of morphological studies from this period focus on the causes of pilonidal sinus disease and of tract-forming <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis</b> as well the embryology and function of the pelvic structures. In 1985, Stelzner became President of the German Society for Surgery.|$|E

40|$|Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic {{dermatosis}} usually manifesting as skin ulcers with undermined erythematous-violaceous borders. It may be isolated, {{associated with}} systemic conditions or {{occurring in the}} context of autoinflammatory syndromes such as PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, PG and acne), PASH (PG, acne and <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis)</b> or PAPASH (pyogenic arthritis, acne, PG and <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis).</b> From a physiopathological point of view, all these conditions share common mechanisms consisting of over-activation of the innate immune system leading to increased production of the interleukin (IL) - 1 family and "sterile" neutrophilich cutaneous inflammation. From a genetic point of view, a number of mutations affecting the proteins of the inflammasome complex (the molecular platform responsible for triggering autoinflammation) or the proteins that regulate inflammasome function have been described in these disorders. As these debilitating entities are all associated with the over-expression of IL- 1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a, biological drugs specifically targeting these cytokines are currently the most effective treatments but, given the emerging role of IL- 17 in the pathogenesis of these syndromes, IL- 17 antagonists may represent the future management of these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Aim: <b>Suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis</b> is {{a chronic}} {{relapsing}} inflammatory disease {{that affects the}} apocrine sweat glands, and is most often located in the perianal area. Perineal and perianal locations cover about 37 % of the total morbidity and it {{is more common in}} males. Materials and Methods: A prospective interventional study of 13 patients with suppurative fistulizing hidradenitis of perineum, treated in the Department of Coloproctological and purulent-septic surgery, University Hospital, Pleven for the period 2008 - 2013. Results: The period between the occurrences of diseaseand surgical treatment is very long – from 2 to 36 years (average - 9. 2 years). The average hospital stay was 13. 5 days. Operative wounds healed secondarily an average of about 30 days. Patients were followed for 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Two patients with relapses on the 6 th postoperative month, have re-hospitalization and surgery with good results. Conclusion: Treatment of <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis</b> of the perineum is complex, both in terms of local status and systematic violations resulting chronic infection. The advantages of deroofing are: minimal trauma to the patient, requires no special equipment, there is a lower rate of recurrence compared with other methods (in our study - 15. 38 %) and leads to the formation of aesthetically acceptable scar...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionChronic <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis</b> (CSH) is {{a benign}} {{condition}} {{that can affect}} the perineal region and often leads {{to the formation of}} abscesses and fistulas. It is rare for CSH to undergo malignant degeneration into mucinous adenocarcinoma. Presentation of caseWe report a case of a 55 -year-old male patient with perineal CSH who suffered worsening long-term pain despite multiple surgical procedures to alleviate his symptoms. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiloculated cystic lesion on the left side wall of the distal rectum with gluteal extension. Pathological examination revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection (APR) of the rectum with cutaneous muscle flap reconstruction. Although histopathological sections showed clear margins, the tumor recurred 6 months following surgery. DiscussionPerineal mucinous adenocarcinoma arising in a patient with CSH is an extremely rare condition. This diagnosis is often difficult, due to the paucity of signs of malignant degeneration as well as the rarity of the disease itself. Surgical resection of the lesions is a well-established approach. In this case, diagnosing the tumor at such a late stage likely compromised his outcome. ConclusionMalignant degeneration to mucinous adenocarcinoma must be suspected in patients with a history of long-term CSH. In such cases, local biopsies and a radiological examination, such as MRI can help in the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundHidradenitis is a {{disorder}} where abscesses appear after the {{infection of the}} apocrine sweat glands. It is located normally in the axillae, groin, perineal region, and the scalp. Clinical caseA 37 year old male was referred by his GP to the General Surgery Department with axillary hidradenitis which had evolved over the years. The physical examination shows signs of hidradenitis in both axillae, with a noticeable <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis</b> in the right armpit. En bloc extirpation was performed to remove the whole affected area. The pathological examination revealed a cutaneous leishmaniasis. Subsequently, fucidin was administered topically, {{as well as local}} infiltrations of one millilitre of Glucantime™. DiscussionHidradenitis normally appears in intertriginous areas and its manifestation is accompanied by recurrent subcutaneous nodules. The incidence rate in females is three times higher than in males. The isolated Hidradenitis caused by Leishmania is a rare condition presented only in endemic areas or in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-infected patients. Clinical manifestations can be different and the diagnosis can be confirmed through haematoxylin–eosin. The main pattern displays a disorganised granuloma without necrosis. Systemic or topical treatment can be applied. Immunotherapy treatment is the most common. ConclusionsHidradenitis caused by Leishmania in HIV-negative patients is a rare condition. Therefore it is important to perform a good histological diagnosis and to administer the right treatment...|$|E
40|$|Pyoderma gangrenosum {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} neutrophilic dermatosis manifesting {{as painful}} ulcers with violaceous, undermined borders on the lower extremities. It may occur {{in the context of}} classic syndromes like PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne) and SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis), as well as in a recently described entity named PASH (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne and <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis).</b> Pyoderma gangrenosum has recently been included within the spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases, which are characterized by recurrent episodes of sterile inflammation, without circulating autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells. In PAPA syndrome, different mutations involving the PSTPIP 1 gene, via an increased binding affinity to pyrin, induce the assembly of inflammasomes. These are molecular platforms involved in the activation of caspase 1, a protease that cleaves inactive prointerleukin (pro-IL) - 1 β to its active isoform IL- 1 β. The overproduction of IL- 1 β triggers the release of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are responsible for the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, leading to neutrophil-mediated inflammation. In SAPHO syndrome, the activation of the PSTPIP 2 inflammasome has been suggested {{to play a role in}} inducing the dysfunction of the innate immune system. Patients with PASH have recently been reported to present alterations of genes involved in well-known autoinflammatory diseases, such as PSTPIP 1, MEFV, NOD 2 and NLRP 3. Pyoderma gangrenosum and its syndromic forms can be regarded as a single clinicopathological spectrum in the context of autoinflammation...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and <b>suppurative</b> <b>hidradenitis</b> (PASH) {{has recently been}} described and suggested {{to be a new}} entity within the spectrum of autoinflammatory syndromes, which are characterized by recurrent episodes of sterile inflammation, without circulating autoantibodies and autoreactive T-cells. We conducted an observational study on 5 patients with PASH syndrome, analyzing their clinical features, genetic profile of 10 genes already known to be involved in autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs), and cytokine expression pattern both in lesional skin and serum. In tissue skin samples, the expressions of interleukin (IL) - 1 β and its receptors I and II were significantly higher in PASH (P = 0. 028, 0. 047, and 0. 050, respectively) than in controls. In PASH patients, chemokines such as IL- 8 (P = 0. 004), C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 1 / 2 / 3 (P = 0. 028), CXCL 16 (P = 0. 008), and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) (P = 0. 005) were overexpressed. Fas/Fas ligand and cluster of differentiation (CD) 40 /CD 40 ligand systems were also overexpressed (P = 0. 016 for Fas, P = 0. 006 for Fas ligand, P = 0. 005 for CD 40, and P = 0. 004 for CD 40 ligand), contributing to tissue damage and inflammation. In peripheral blood, serum levels of the main proinflammatory cytokines, that is, IL- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL- 17, were within the normal range, suggesting that in PASH syndrome, the inflammatory process is mainly localized into the skin. Four out of our 5 PASH patients presented genetic alterations typical of well-known AIDs, including inflammatory bowel diseases, and the only patient lacking genetic changes had clinically evident Crohn disease. In conclusion, overexpression of cytokines/chemokines and molecules amplifying the inflammatory network, along with the genetic changes, supports the view that PASH syndrome is autoinflammatory in origin...|$|E
40|$|Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a {{pathologic}} follicular disease, impacts patients' lives profoundly {{and usually}} occurs in isolation.     The diseases with the strongest association are obesity, depression, and pain.   HS {{is associated with}} many diseases including acne conglobata (AC), dissecting cellulitis, pilonidal cysts, and obesity.   Pyoderma fistulans sinifica (fox den disease) {{appears to be the}} same entity as Hurley Stage 2 of 3 HS. The rate of acne vulgaris in HS patients mirrors unaffected controls. The most common, albeit still uncommon, association is with seronegative, haplotype unlinked arthritis (most importantly B 27), in particular spondolyarthritis.   Crohn disease and HS occur together at a rate that varies from 0. 6 % to 38 % in retrospective cases series.   Ulcerative colitis occurred with HS in 14 % of patients in one series.   The next most common association is with pyoderma gangrenosum, but this association is likely under-reported.   Synovitis-Acne-Pustulosis Hyperostosis-Osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, which is rare, has more than 10 reports linking it to HS.   Nine case reports have linked Dowling-Degos disease (DDD) to HS and two reports related HS to Fox-Fordyce disease (FF), but because both occur in the axilla this might be a mere coincidence.    HS is rarely associated with ophthalmic pathology.   Specifically, more than 5 reports link it to Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome (KID); greater than 10 cases link it to interstitial keratitis and 2 cases are linked to Behçet’s disease. The presence of proteinuria and acute nephritis link HS to the kidney, especially since and reports have documented resolution of HS after renal transplant.  Florid steatocystoma multiplex, Sjogren Syndrome, and HS have been linked and their reports likely underestimate their coincidence because all these entities involve occlusion (albeit by different mechanisms).   Three reports link HS and amyloid, but both share some common genetic underpinnings and thus the coincidence of these diseases is likely underreported.   Pyoderma vegetans has been noted in 2 cases of HS and 4 cases of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and is likely a clue to the linkage of the pathology of IBD and HS.   Pityriasis rubra pilaris, in particular Type VI related to HIV, has a relationship more commonly with acne conglobata, but with HS also. Single case reports of diseases associated with HS include systemic lupus erythematosus, acromegaly, Down syndrome, Bazex–Dupre´–Christol, and prurtis ani, but these might be coincidences.   Pyogenic Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne  (PAPA Syndrome) and Pyoderma gangrenosum, Acne, and <b>Suppurative</b> <b>Hidradenitis</b> (PASH Syndrome) are pyodermic-arthritic syndromes that are associated with HS.   Erythema nodosum and granulomatous lobular mastitis have been reported with HS but the significance of these reports is uncertain.   Because of scarring, HS can result in lymphedema including scrotal elephantiasis and verrucous lymphedema.   HS is sometimes accompanied by obesity, hypertension, and anemia and can be considered a disease in the spectrum of metabolic syndrome, a skin disease with systemic consequences.  HS, like other types of chronic inflammation when long standing in the perianal and perineal areas, can result in squamous cell cancer.   A variety of drugs can induce HS. These include lithium, sirolimus, cyclosporine,  vemurafenib, and oral contraceptives.   Inverse psoriasis or psoriasis vulgaris as a side effect of infliximab therapy may be associated with HS. These associations aside, most cases of HS occur in isolation without coincident morbidity...|$|E
