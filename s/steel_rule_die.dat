50|$|Larry Holliday and Job Reynolds worked {{together}} at Holiday <b>Steel</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>Die</b> Corporation. Larry Holliday {{was the sole}} shareholder and president of Holiday Steel and Job Reynolds was a computer programmer for that company. <b>Steel</b> <b>rule</b> <b>die</b> is used {{in a number of}} applications including the creation of creases, perforations, slits, and to cut and score paper and cardboard to be folded into cartons or boxes. Lasercomb America, Inc. was a competitor of Holiday <b>Steel</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>Die</b> Corporation and manufactured <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> <b>die</b> for similar applications. The object of dispute was a software program developed solely by Lasercomb that eased the production of <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E

50|$|Lasercomb {{developed}} Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software {{known as}} Interact. The software allowed {{the user to}} design a template of a cardboard cutout for visualization on a computer screen. Interact effectively allowed a designer to create and coordinate the production of <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E
50|$|Die {{making is}} a subgenre of tool making {{that focuses on}} making and {{maintaining}} dies. This often includes making punches, <b>dies,</b> <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> <b>dies,</b> and die sets. Precision is key in die making; punches and dies must maintain proper clearance to produce parts accurately, and it is often necessary to have die sets machined with tolerances of less than one thousandth of an inch.|$|R

50|$|Steel-rule die, {{also known}} as cookie cutter dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer webs, such as plastics, wood, cork, felt, fabrics, and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of {{hardened}} steel strips, known as <b>steel</b> <b>rule.</b> These <b>steel</b> <b>rules</b> are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, {{they are not as}} robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{packaging}} and labeling industry, Gerber’s prepress technologies impacted the printing and structural aspects, as printed packaging and labels relied largely on printing plates and screens. The Gerber EDGE digital printer enabled short run durable printing and cutting of labels. [...] Additional products and technologies enabled cutting of specialty bags, {{and the production}} of coating blankets for spot UV coatings on cartons and for printing on aluminum beverage cans. [...] For the structural aspects of packaging such as folding cartons and corrugated boxes, the industry’s [...] "sample maker" [...] tables for prototyping and short run production, [...] and [...] "die vinyl plotters" [...] used to print layout guides, [...] and routers for making <b>steel</b> <b>rule</b> <b>die,</b> [...] are based in significant part on the technologies originally developed by Gerber in plotting, drafting, and other fields.|$|E

Since aluminium design rules for welded K-and N-joints in CHS truss girders were lacking the joints were checked using <b>steel</b> design <b>rules.</b> Calculations {{showed that the}} N-joints were governing for chord and brace sizes. Further numerical analysis on the N-joints using ANSYS 11. 0 was carried out. Full scale experimental research was successfully carried out for validation of the numerical calculations. It is concluded that <b>steel</b> design <b>rules</b> predict the failure behavior and failure mode of the considered aluminium N-joints well.

Born out of a need for industry self-regulation, ABS published its first technical standards, Rules for Survey and Classing Wooden Vessels, in 1870. When the era of wooden ships gave way to iron, ABS established standards for these structures, published as Rules for Survey and Classing of Iron Vessels. Similarly, when iron gave way to <b>steel,</b> ABS <b>Rules</b> for Building and Classing Steel Vessels were established and published in 1890. These <b>Steel</b> Vessel <b>Rules</b> continue to be revised and published annually.|$|R
