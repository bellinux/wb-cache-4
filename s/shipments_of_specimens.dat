5|$|Mengele used Auschwitz as an {{opportunity}} to continue his anthropological studies and research on heredity, using inmates for human experimentation. The experiments had no regard for the health, safety, or physical and emotional suffering of the victims. He was particularly interested in identical twins, people with heterochromia iridum (eyes of two different colours), dwarfs, and people with physical abnormalities. A grant was provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, applied for by von Verschuer, who received regular reports and <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> from Mengele. The grant was used to build a pathology laboratory attached to Crematorium II at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jewish pathologist who arrived in Auschwitz on 29 May 1944, performed dissections and prepared specimens for shipment in this laboratory. Mengele's twin research was in part intended to prove the supremacy of heredity over environment and thus bolster the Nazi premise of the superiority of the Aryan race. Nyiszli and others report that the twins studies may also have been motivated by a desire to improve the reproduction rate of the German race by improving the chances of racially desirable people having twins.|$|E

25|$|The DoDSR, {{along with}} its {{precursor}} repositories, were designated as the ultimate storage facility for all serologically negative HIV specimens obtained through military HIV testing programs. Growing initially through the routine screening of all civilian applicants, and then through the continued screening of retained military personnel (at approximate two year intervals), by 1990 the DoDSR inventory had grown to contain over six million serum specimens, and by 1996 over 17 million specimens. Standardized processes {{in place at the}} contracted military HIV testing laboratories ensured efficient management of the growing inventory, permitting the DoDSR to enforce standards in specimen labelling, configuration, and <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> which facilitated their physical integration into the DoDSR inventory.

40|$|Background: Diagnosis of {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis (CL) is often made based on clinical manifesta-tion. Correct diagnosis and {{identification of the}} parasite are crucial for choosing the effective treat-ment and for epidemiological studies. On the other hand, determination of Leishmania species is nec-essary for designing appropriate control programs. Diagnosis by PCR is becoming a 'gold standard'. For PCR preparation, storage and <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> are necessary. In this study, Whatman filter paper (FTA Card) was used to store and transfer samples for Leishmania identification using PCR. Methods: Among the patients who had CL lesion and referred to Parasitology Laboratory of Emam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, 44 consented cases with positive results in their direct smear were se-lected. An informed consent form and a questionnaire were completed and three different types of samples (direct smear, NNN culture, and spot on FTA card) were collected. DNA extraction and PCR were carried out on three different samples from each patient. Results: PCR results using Whatman paper samples revealed a significant difference (P< 0. 0001) compared to the culture method but no significant difference was seen between PCR results using samples stored on Whatman paper and direct smears...|$|E
40|$|Background: Every year, {{research}} specimens {{are shipped}} from one institution to another {{as well as}} across national boundaries. A significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> move from poor to rich countries. Concerns are always raised on the future usage <b>of</b> the stored <b>specimens</b> shipped to research insitutions from developing countries. Creating awareness of the processes is required in all sectors involved in biomedical research. To maintain fairness and respect in sharing biomedical specimens and reserch products requires safeguarding by Ethics Review Committees in both provider and recepient institutions. Training in basic ethical principles in research is required to all sectors involved in biomedical research so as to level up the research playing field. Discussion: By agreeing to provide specimens, individuals and communities from whom samples are collected would have placed their trust and all ensuing up-keep <b>of</b> the <b>specimens</b> to the researchers. In most collaborative set-up, laid down material transfer agreements are negotiated and signed before the <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens.</b> Researchers, research ethics committees (RECs) and institutions in the countries of origin are supposed to serve as overseers <b>of</b> the <b>specimens.</b> There is need to advocate for honesty in sample handling and sharing, and also need to oversee any written commitments by researchers, RECs and institutions at source {{as well as in}} recipient institution.

In this study, we {{examine the effect of}} stimulant, anticoagulant, cell separation, storage, and transportation on LPA results. LPA responses of whole blood and separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to different stimulants (cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, candida and tetanus toxoid antigens, and phytohemagglutinin) were measured using fresh specimens shipped overnight and frozen specimens collected in heparin, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), and citrate cell preparation tubes (CPT) from 12 HIV-infected patients and uninfected controls. Odds ratios for positive LPA responses were significantly higher in separated PBMC than in whole blood from ACD- and heparin-anticoagulated samples obtained from HIV-infected patients and from ACD-anticoagulated samples from uninfected controls. On separated PBMC, positive responses were significantly more frequent in fresh samples compared with overnight transportation for all antigens and compared with cryopreservation for the candida and tetanus antigens. In addition, viral antigen LPA responses were better preserved in frozen PBMC compared with specimens shipped overnight. CPT tubes yielded significantly more positive LPA results for all antigens, irrespective of the HIV patient status compared with ACD, but only for the candida and tetanus antigens and only in HIV-negative controls compared with heparin. Although HIV-infected patients had a significantly lower number of positive antigen-driven LPA responses compared with uninfected controls, most <b>of</b> the <b>specimen</b> processing variables had similar effects on HIV-positive and -negative samples. We conclude that LPA should be performed on site, whenever feasible, by using separated PBMC from fresh blood samples collected in either heparin or ACD.

Unlike Pen-Strep, gentamicin was stable at pH 2 to 10 for 15 days at 37 C in tissue culture medium, and its activity was unaffected by the presence of serum. Moreover, it was stable to autoclaving. Twenty cell types replicated normally at the suggested concentration of 50 μg/ml, and all cells were unaffected by 20 times this concentration. Evidence for its practical use in virus studies was demonstrated in that (i) it was not viricidal to ribonucleic acid or deoxyribonucleic acid viruses at 40 times the suggested concentration at 37 C, (ii) the size and number of plaques were not affected by 20 times the suggested concentration, (iii) interferon assays and production were unaffected by 20 times the suggested concentrations.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two thin-walled outer tubes showed that more extensive alpha working of the billet core stock results in more uniform cladding on the extruded tube. In {{an effort to}} eliminate breakthrough and to reduce eccentricity, shift, and bending of the mandrel, two experimental coppernickel billets with Zircaloy sleeves were extruded to check a modified billet design. lt was observed that the final grain size of the unalloyed uranium core of a thin- walled outer tube is insensitive to small variations in the cooling rate from the beta-treatment temperature. An axia' load of 3000 pounds applied to a thin- walled outer tube during autoclaving was ineffective in preventing bowing of the tube. Shipping experiments demonstrated that current packaging methods of thin- walled inner tubes do not prevent bowing during transit. The fabrication <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> for the capsule irradiation program was concluded with the <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> sixteen <b>specimens</b> and excess extruded tube stock to Savannah River Laboratory. The following core compositions were represented: U- 1 wt. % Si, unalloyed dingot uranium, U- 0. 3 wt. % Al- 0. 5 wt. % Si, and U- 0. 3 wt. % Cr- 0. 3 wt. % Mo. All irradiation specimens were supplied in the beta-treated condition. The mechanical behavior of Zircaloy- 4 -clad dingot uranium tube sections was evaluated {{as a function of}} the cooling rate from the beta treatment temperature. The results indicate that the mechanical behavior is approximately independent of the cooling rate and that, in testing to failure, fracture initiates within the core. Also, in a eimilar test of a transient-melted ingot uranium tube, the uranium core appeared to be the most brittle component. Five tubular stainless steel- Zircaloy joints were extruded for use in an experiment to determine if such joints can withstand 30 and 40 % cold reductions. (auth...|$|R
30|$|Results {{that fall}} within the average ± 2.8 SD range for the {{standardised}} conditions were regarded {{to be in the}} same range in the robustness study [3]. If this criterion is applied, and the results of the first experiments performed at BAM (without <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> test <b>specimens</b> and eluate samples, shortest period of storage after treatment) were regarded as reference values, some of the tebuconazole and copper concentrations of the eluate fractions from the ECN experiment just fit. The tebuconazole concentrations tend to be lower, whereas the copper concentrations tend to be higher for the ECN experiments compared to the results from the BAM experiment. Relatively high deviation of tebuconazole concentrations in the second fractions and copper concentrations in the fourth fractions were observed for the three parallel experiments at ECN Petten. This is probably not caused by uncertainty of the analytical methods or analytical outliers. Relative standard deviations of tebuconazole concentrations from three parallel injections were 1 % to 2 % for all samples. Tebuconazole concentrations in two samples of eluate fraction 2 were considerably lower than the data from the experiment at BAM, whereas the concentration of the third sample was similar to the data from the BAM experiment. Variation of copper concentrations was generally higher in the experiment at ECN than at BAM - perhaps due to the fact that a single test specimen per test assembly was used in the experiments at ECN whereas two test specimens were combined in the test assemblies at BAM (see Table 3).|$|R

In 2005, the Regional Committee expanded this commitment to include rubella and set a date {{for the elimination of}} both diseases by 2010. Although Member States did make progress, through the implementation of a strategic plan, the goal was not achieved. The WHO Regional Committee for Europe acknowledged at its sixtieth session (2010) that the regional goal of eliminating measles and rubella is achievable, and set a new target date of 2015. In the document Eliminating measles and rubella and preventing congenital rubella infection, WHO European Region strategic plan 2005 - 2010, key strategies are identified to meet the targets for interrupting transmission of indigenous measles and rubella and preventing congenital rubella infection. Strengthening surveillance systems by vigorous case investigation, including laboratory confirmation, is one of these key strategies. In line with the elimination goal, Surveillance guidelines for measles, rubella and congenitalrubella syndrome in the WHO European Region are intended to provide technical advice on the design and implementation of surveillance programmes. Surveillance indicators defined in these guidelines will be critical for assessing whether Member States have achieved the level of disease surveillance necessary for documenting elimination of indigenous measles and rubella transmission, and verifying that the Region's elimination objectives have been reached.
