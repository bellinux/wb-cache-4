5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of patent misuse is thus {{grounded in the}} policy-based desire to [...] "prevent a patentee from using the patent to obtain market benefit beyond that which inheres in the statutory patent right." [...] It follows that the key inquiry under the patent misuse doctrine is whether, by imposing the condition in question, the patentee has impermissibly broadened the physical or temporal <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the patent <b>grant</b> and has done so {{in a manner that}} has anticompetitive effects. Where the patentee has not leveraged its patent beyond the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> rights <b>granted</b> by the Patent Act, misuse has not been found.|$|R

40|$|Under the {{equitable}} {{doctrine of}} 2 ̆ 2 unclean hands, 2 ̆ 2 courts will deny an otherwise meritorious claim where the claimant has acted so improperly {{that the need}} to punish the claimant’s wrongful behavior outweighs the need to punish the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct. The principle underlying the doctrine is that equity presumes harm when an unclean plaintiff obtains relief; consequently, one who desires justice must come into court with a “clean slate. ” The theory of intellectual property misuse, which stems from the “unclean hands” doctrine, prevents a plaintiff from enforcing an intellectual property right if that plaintiff is guilty of misconduct with respect to that right. 	For years the courts have failed to distinguish misuse from the anti-trust law. These legal concepts are, however, clearly distinguishable from one another. The misuse defense is viable in copyright infringement actins and should prevent a copyright owner from enforcing his copyright if he has impermissibly extended it beyond the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the copyright <b>grant.</b> This Note advocates use <b>of</b> the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grant</b> approach to provide a workable standard for determining whether a copyright owner is guilty of copyright misuse...|$|R

40|$|Published online : 15 December 2013 The {{demand for}} more safe and durable roads, {{combined}} {{with the need to}} preserve the environment, led to the production and application of asphalt–rubber (AR) on roads. Nevertheless, this complex material needs further study in order to better distinguish among the phenomena that take place during AR production, as they impact on the final product characteristics. Here, we effectively quantify the rheological changes related to bitumen aging due to diffusion of small molecules of bitumen into the rubber particles and to the release of fillers from rubber into the bitumen during AR production. “A sphere AR production simulator” was developed to assess AR aging independently. The comparison of the characteristic relaxation times of both AR and simulated AR shows that the aging alone cannot explain the rheological changes during AR production. The extent of the changes related to the combined effects of aging and filler release increases as the bitumen used to produce AR is softer.

The rule of law requires that individual executive branch actors not be given sufficient authority to restrict {{the rights of others}} to achieve personal aims, including idiosyncratic conceptions of the public interest. To satisfy the rule of law, modern governments granting discretion to executive branch actors constrain this authority by both limiting the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> authority <b>granted</b> and requiring external oversight of decisions.
