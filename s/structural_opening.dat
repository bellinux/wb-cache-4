The setting is {{characterized}} of downtown commercial activities and remains faithful to late 19th and early 20th century streetscapes. The theatre-office building measures 100 ft on the north (Ninth Street) by 115 ft along the west (Broadway). The building uses a steel framed with reinforced concrete walls. The Ninth Street and Broadway facades are white, glazed terra cotta in a matt finish. The Commerce Street façade is yellowish-toned brick.The Ninth Street facade of the Theater is divided horizontally into three major sections, and vertically into five bays. The lower level of the facade, which conforms to the steep Ninth Street grade, has received a minimum of elaboration - typical of a Renaissance, palazzo base. The central level of this elevation, equivalent to three stories in height, features a triple-arched blind arcade set within the three central bays. Each individual archway: is punctuated by a pedimented, <b>structural</b> <b>opening</b> with a large ornamental cartouche above. These central bays are each framed by imposing, pseudo-Corinthian pilasters and half pilasters, full three stories, in height. The blind arcade is solidly flanked by sparsely-decorated outermost bays. Structural openings on the same level as those of the central bays are capped with segmental-arched pediments. Five bracketed balconettes underline these openings, creating a strong horizontal course, which firmly ties the variant bays together. A heavily proportioned entablature repeats the-horizontal movement across the full five bays on this facade. The entablature has a simple architrave, festooned frieze, and cornice with a boldly projecting dentil course. A substantial parapet above the cornice is simply ornamented with raised terra cotta rosettes, and rectangles[...]|$|E

A single -DNA molecule was suspended between two micron-sized beads, one held by a micropipette and the other in an optical trap. The constrained DNA molecule was incubated with Xenopus laevis egg extract in order to reconstitute a single chromatin fibre. An eight-fold compaction of the DNA molecule was observed in real-time. The compaction kinetics were found to be strongly dependent upon the tension applied to the DNA molecule. We incorporated the analysis of Brownian motion to accurately determine the tension throughout the compaction process. At forces exceeding 10 pN complete inhibition of compaction was observed for the time scale of the experiment. We have previously shown that stretching of a reconstituted chromatin fibre results in discrete and quantized <b>structural</b> <b>opening</b> events that we can attribute to the unravelling of single nucleosomes.

We tested the effects of the new ordinance on the occurrence of crime surrounding abandoned buildings from January 2011 to April 2013 using a difference-in-differences approach.

Building remediations were significantly associated with citywide reductions in overall crimes, total assaults, gun assaults and nuisance crimes (p < 0. 001).

Rubredoxin from Desulfovibrio gigas was selected as a model protein and the effect of diglycerol phosphate on its dynamic behaviour was studied. The presence of 100 mM diglycerol phosphate induces a fourfold increase in the half-life for thermal denaturation of D. gigas rubredoxin [Lamosa, P., Burke, A., Peist, R., Huber, R., Liu, M. Y., Silva, G., Rodrigues-Pousada, C., LeGall, J., Maycock, C. & Santos, H. (2000) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66, 1974 - 1979]. A model-free analysis of the protein backbone relaxation parameters shows an average increase of generalized order parameters of 0. 015 reflecting a small overall reduction in mobility of fast-scale motions. Hydrogen exchange data acquired over a temperature span of 20 degreesC yielded thermodynamic parameters for the <b>structural</b> <b>opening</b> reactions that allow for the exchange. This shows that the closed form of the protein is stabilized by an additional 1. 6 kJ. mol(- 1) in the presence of the solute. The results seem to indicate that the stabilizing effect is due mainly to a reduction in mobility of the slower, larger-scale motions within the protein structure with an associated increase in the enthalpy of interactions...|$|E
40|$|All {{proteins}} undergo local structural fluctuations (LSFs) or breathing motions. These motions {{are likely}} to be important for function but are poorly understood. LSFs were initially defined by amide hydrogen exchange (HX) experiments as opening events, which expose a small number of backbone amides to (1) H/(2) H exchange, but whose exchange rates are independent of denaturant concentration. Here, we use size-dependent thiol-disulfide exchange (SX) to characterize LSFs in single cysteine-containing variants of myoglobin (Mb). SX complements HX by providing information on motions that disrupt side chain packing interactions. Most importantly, probe reagents of different sizes and chemical properties can be used to characterize the size of <b>structural</b> <b>opening</b> events and the properties of the open state. We use thiosulfonate reagents (126 - 274 Da) to survey access to Cys residues, which are buried at specific helical packing interfaces in Mb. In each case, the free energy of opening increases linearly with the radius of gyration of the probe reagent. The slope and the intercept are interpreted to yield information {{on the size of the}} opening events that expose the buried thiol groups. The slope parameter varies by over 10 -fold among Cys positions tested, suggesting that the sizes of breathing motions vary substantially throughout the protein.

Based on 1859 NOE restraints and 262 angular restraints, 17 structures were generated with a rmsd of 0. 87 angstrom from the mean structure. The solution structure, which is highly similar to the structure obtained by X-ray crystallography, includes two open EF-hand domains, which are in close contact through their hydrophobic surfaces. The internal dynamics of the protein backbone were determined by studying amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates and N- 15 nuclear relaxation. The two methods revealed a highly compact and rigid structure, with greatly restricted mobility at the two termini. For most of the amide protons, the free energy of exchange-compatible <b>structural</b> <b>opening</b> {{is similar to the}} free energy of structural stability, suggesting that isotope exchange of these protons takes place through global unfolding of the protein. Enhanced conformational flexibility was noted in the unoccupied Ca 2 +-binding site II, as well as the neighbouring helices.

Exchange of peptide NH protons (2 H- 1 H) {{is used to}} monitor <b>structural</b> <b>opening</b> of individual hydrogen bonds during unfolding, and kinetic models are developed for hydrogen exchange {{during the process of}} protein unfolding. The analysis indicates that the kinetic process of unfolding can be monitored by EX 1 exchange (limited by the rate of opening) for ribonuclease A in these conditions. Of the 49 protons whose unfolding/exchange kinetics was measured, 47 have known hydrogen bond acceptor groups. To test whether exchange during unfolding follows the EX 2 (base-catalyzed) or the EX 1 (uncatalyzed) mechanism, unfolding/exchange was measured both at pH 8. 0 and at pH 9. 0. A few faster-exchanging protons were found that undergo exchange by both EX 1 and EX 2 processes, but the 43 slower-exchanging protons at pH 8 undergo exchange only by the EX 1 mechanism, and they have closely similar rates. Thus, it is likely that all 49 protons undergo EX 1 exchange at the same rate. The results indicate that a single rate-limiting step in unfolding breaks the entire network of peptide hydrogen bonds and causes the overall unfolding of ribonuclease A. The additional exchange observed for some protons that follows the EX 2 mechanism probably results from equilibrium unfolding intermediates and will be discussed elsewhere...|$|E

Poverty and very few economic opportunities in the Philippines explain a significant portion of this outflow. The labor export policy thus creates a <b>structural</b> <b>opening</b> for many to seek livelihood outside the Philippines. The government fosters this policy so that temporary migrant workers and immigrants settlers send remittances back to the Philippines, bolstering the national economy. Since the 1980 s, Filipino migration globally exhibits significant gender differences in job recruitment and social network ties.

It finds that forced returned migration is becoming an emerging gendered pattern for Filipinos transnationally since the late 1990 s.

40|$|Regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are {{essential}} for bacteria to thrive in diverse environments and they also {{play a key role}} in virulence [11]. Trans-sRNAs affect the stability and/or translation of their target mRNAs through complementary base-pairing. The base-pairing interaction is not perfect and requires the action of an RNA binding protein, Hfq. Hfq facilitates these RNA-RNA interactions by stabilizing duplex formation, aiding in structural rearrangements, increasing the rate of <b>structural</b> <b>opening,</b> and/or by increasing the rate of annealing [18 - 21]. Hfq has two well characterized binding surfaces: the proximal surface, which binds AU rich stretches typical of sRNAs, and the distal surface, which binds (ARN) x motifs typically found in target mRNAs [30, 33, 36]. Studies on Hfq-RNA interactions have focused largely on sRNAs until the more recent discovery of an (ARN) x motif within the 52 ̆ 7 UTR of target mRNAs[36, 37]. The importance of this motif in facilitating Hfq-mRNA binding and its requirement for regulation of a couple well known target mRNAs led us to further characterize the motif in the work described in this thesis. We performed bioinformatic and in vitro analyses to investigate the prevalence, location, structural contexts, and Hfq-binding of (ARN) x motifs in known target mRNAs. We found that the known targets contain single stranded (ARN) x sequences in their 52 ̆ 7 UTRs that bind to Hfq. Two predominant structural contexts of the single stranded (ARN) x motifs became clear: they were either flanked by stem loop structures or within a loop of an internal bulge, multi-branch junction or hairpin. The key features of the motifs were then used as a bioinformatic tool on a genome wide scale to identify mRNAs that might bind to Hfq. We found that 21...|$|E

We constructed large-scale anatomical networks derived from white matter fiber tractography and evaluated the topological reorganization using graph theoretical analysis. We also assessed the relationship between topological reorganization with improvements in depressive symptoms. Results. Our investigation revealed three main findings: (1) the small-worldness was persistent after ECT series; (2) anatomical connections changes were found in limbic structure, temporal and frontal lobes, in which the connection changes between amygdala and parahippocampus correlate with depressive symptom reduction; (3) significant nodal strength changes were found in right paralimbic network. Conclusions. ECT elicits neuroplastic processes associated with improvements in depressive symptoms that act to specific local ventral frontolimbic circuits, but not small-world property. Overall, ECT induced topological reorganization in large-scale brain <b>structural</b> network, <b>opening</b> up new avenues to better understand the mode of ECT action in MDD...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{process in}} {{mechanically}} loaded steel fiber reinforced high-strength (SFRHSC) concrete {{is characterized by}} fibers bridging the crack providing resistance to its <b>opening.</b> <b>Structural</b> SFRHSC fracture model was created; material fracture process was modeled, based on single fiber pull-out laws, which were determined experimentally (for straight fibers, fibers with end hooks (Dramix), and corrugated fibers (Tabix)) as well as obtained numerically (using FEM simulations). For this purpose experimental program was realized and pull-out force versus pull-out fiber length was obtained (for fibers embedded into concrete at different depth and under different angle). Model predictions were validated by 15 x 15 x 60 cm prisms 4 point bending tests. Fracture surfaces analysis was realized for broken prisms with the goal to improve elaborated model assumptions. Optimal SFRHSC structures were recognized...|$|R
40|$|The ATP {{hydrolysis}} and protein-binding {{and release}} {{cycle of the}} molecular chaperone DnaK is regulated by the accessory proteins GrpE and DnaJ. Here we describe {{a study of the}} formation of complexes between the molecular chaperone DnaK, its nucleotide exchange factor GrpE, and the fluorescent ADP analog N 8 -[4 -[(N'-methylanthraniloyl) amino]butyl]- 8 -aminoadenosine 5 '-diphosphate (MABA-ADP) by equilibrium and stopped flow kinetic experiments. The catalytic cycle of the GrpE-stimulated nucleotide exchange involves a ternary DnaK x GrpE x ADP complex as well as the binary DnaK x GrpE and DnaK x ADP complexes. The equilibrium data of the interaction of GrpE with DnaK x ADP and the nucleotide-free DnaK can be described by a simple equilibrium system where GrpE reduces the affinity of ADP for DnaK 200 -fold. However, transient kinetic studies revealed that the functional cycle of GrpE in addition includes at least two distinct ternary DnaK x GrpE x ADP complexes. Our data indicate that the initial weak binding of GrpE to DnaK x ADP is followed by an isomerization of the ternary complex which leads to weakening of nucleotide binding and finally to its rapid dissociation. The maximal stimulation for nucleotide exchange brought about by GrpE was found to be 5000 -fold. We propose that this kinetically observed isomerization represents a <b>structural</b> change (<b>opening)</b> of the nucleotide binding pocket of DnaK that allows for fast nucleotide exchange...|$|R
