30|$|The {{previous}} mathematical equations {{support the}} granularity of access control. Our proposed MDSBA {{is a complete}} framework that can control both ends of federation service and service providers. Security assertion markup language (SAML) v 2 is used to map user’s access level between both ends. The framework consists of three primary services; Core, Initializer, and Anonymizer. The Core service embeds XML files as assertions to transmit the user’s authentication results parallel with the user’s ID, and access level. The access level is determined by delegated roles, while roles are mapped to Q-ID groups. The Initializer service provides initial documents to prepare data for anonymization. The initializer also generates the Pig script line by line, by referring to the provided XML files. Eventually, the Anonymizer service executes the anonymization script remotely. The Initializer operates in the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> <b>gateway,</b> {{which is not a}} member of Hadoop domain. Complete details about the MDSBA framework are further explained in this paper [18].|$|E
50|$|Gateways {{are widely}} used today in order to enable the legacy PSTN phones to {{interconnect}} with the large, international H.323 networks that are presently deployed by <b>services</b> <b>providers.</b> <b>Gateways</b> are also used within the enterprise in order to enable enterprise IP phones to communicate through the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> to users on the PSTN.|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} malware {{that can}} spread through local wireless networks among mobile devices {{has so far}} received less attention than computer worms in the Internet. The local wireless links provide an alternative propagation path that circumvents intrusion detection at the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> <b>gateways.</b> On the mobile nodes, conventional intrusion detection and intrusion response techniques such as address blacklisting and content filtering {{are more difficult to}} deploy {{due to the lack of}} central entities and the resource constraints of mobile nodes. We propose a new architecture for an intrusion response system that takes advantage of an infrastructure network (e. g., cell phone network) to manage security of the mobile nodes. Infection patterns in ad hoc networks are highly correlated with geographic proximity. Thus an ecologically inspired diffusion-reaction and advection models can provide estimates for the current spread of the worm. These estimates allow the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> to precisely target a containment response. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{environment}} of high performance IP network and growing consumer demand for Internet bandwidth has levied unprecedented load on today’s Internet <b>Service</b> <b>Provider</b> (ISP). <b>Gateways</b> or Routers as {{they have come to}} be known, play an essential role in modern Internet infrastructure. Their design has seen tremendous advancements during the last decades in order to sustain the high bandwidth requirements at the core. In this paper we identify important trends in design and some design issues facing the fourth generation of IP routers. This area encompasses vast topics and issues but {{it is not possible to}} cover them all. Therefore we restrict our survey to architectures of high-end backbone routers from hardware viewpoint. ...|$|R
5000|$|Some IP phone {{services}} (ITSPs, or Internet Telephony <b>Service</b> <b>Providers)</b> support PSTN <b>gateway</b> installations {{throughout the}} world. These gateways egress {{calls to the}} local calling area, thus avoiding long distance toll charges. ITSPs also allow a local user to have a number located in a [...] "foreign" [...] exchange; the New York caller could have a Los Angeles number, for example. When that user places a call, the calling line ID would be that of a Los Angeles number, although they are actually located in New York. This allows a call return without having to incur long distance calling charges.|$|R
50|$|SMS <b>gateway</b> <b>providers</b> {{facilitate}} the SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers, being mainly responsible for carrying mission-critical messages, SMS for enterprises, content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS, e.g., TV voting. Considering SMS messaging performance and cost, {{as well as}} the level of text messaging <b>services,</b> SMS <b>gateway</b> <b>providers</b> can be classified as resellers of the text messaging capability of another provider's SMSC or offering the text messaging capability as an operator of their own SMSC with SS7. SMS messaging <b>gateway</b> <b>providers</b> can provide gateway-to-mobile (Mobile Terminated-MT) services. Some suppliers can also supply mobile-to-gateway (text-in or Mobile Originated/MO services). Many operate text-in services on shortcodes or mobile number ranges, whereas others use lower-cost geographic text-in numbers.|$|R
40|$|Internet <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> {{are today}} largely immune from {{liability}} for {{their role in}} the creation and propagation of worms, viruses, and other forms of malicious computer code. In this Essay, we question that state of affairs. Our purpose is not to weigh in on the details—for example, whether liability should sound in negligence or strict liability, or whether liability is in this instance best implemented by statute or via gradual common law development. Rather, our aim is to challenge the recent trend in the courts and Congress away from liability and toward complete immunity for Internet <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> In our view, such immunity is difficult to defend on policy grounds, and sharply inconsistent with conventional tort law principles. Internet <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> control the <b>gateway</b> through which Internet pests enter and reenter the public computer system. They should therefore bear some responsibility for stopping these pests before they spread and for helping to identify individuals who originate malicious code in the first place...|$|R
40|$|The Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) {{specification}} {{defines a}} service-oriented framework {{for use in}} residential gateways. In this context, the OSGi framework acts as a gateway from the Internet to consumer devices attached to the residence's home-area network. <b>Service</b> <b>providers</b> use the <b>gateway</b> to deliver products and services to end-users, such as home security or health care monitoring. As more powerful consumer devices are introduced, the devices themselves become mechanisms for delivering services to the framework. This level of sophistication results in complex applications {{and the need for}} sophisticated mechanisms to simplify creating them. This paper introduces Beanome, a lightweight layer implemented on top of the OSGi framework, that implements a simple component model and framework for creating OSGi applications. Beanome is not a component model for consumer devices per se, but is a component model for the OSGi framework, which itself is used to create applications that access and provide user-level and management-level interfaces to consumer devices...|$|R
40|$|The IPv 4 {{addresses}} exhaustion {{demands a}} protocol transition from IPv 4 to IPv 6. The original transition technique, the dual stack, is not widely deployed yet and it demanded {{the creation of}} new transition techniques to extend the transition period. This work makes an experimental comparison of techniques that use dual stack with a limited IPv 4 address. This limited address might be a RFC 1918 address with a NAT at the Internet <b>Service</b> <b>Provider</b> (ISP) <b>gateway,</b> also known as Carrier Grade NAT (CGN), or an Address Plus Port (A+P) shared IPv 4 address. The chosen techniques also consider an IPv 6 only ISP network. The transport of the IPv 4 packets through the IPv 6 only networks may use IPv 4 packets encapsulated on IPv 6 packets or a double translation, by making one IPv 4 to IPv 6 translation to enter the IPv 6 only network and one IPv 6 to IPv 4 translation to return to the IPv 4 network. The chosen techniques were DS-Lite, 464 XLAT, MAP-E and MAP-T. The first part of the test is to check some of the most common usages of the Internet by a home user and the impacts of the transition techniques on the user experience. The second part is a measured comparison considering bandwidth, jitter and latency introduced by the techniques and processor usage on the network equipment. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|TeraGrid is a national, comprehensive, {{distributed}} infrastructure integrating {{multiple resources}} at nine resource provider facilities. In late spring 2007, the NSF awarded {{a grant to}} the University of Michigan’s School of Information (UM-SI) to facilitate a community-driven, participatory planning process {{for the future of}} TeraGrid. This report describes the results of the first workshop, which focused on the needs of those developing TeraGrid Science Gateways and the needs of Gateway users. Early in its history, TeraGrid conceived the idea for what has become the TeraGrid ScienceGateway program. Recognizing that many disciplinary communities were building elements of their own cyberinfrastrucuture, TeraGrid set out to form partnerships that would provide TeraGrid resources and services to user communities through tools and environments they were already using. Essentially, the gateway concept recognizes that many of today’s scientists use desktop computing applications and web browsers to conduct their work. TeraGrid’s role is as a back-end <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> with the <b>gateways</b> serving as the front end to the user. At the time of the workshop, there were 21 projects with an allocation on the TeraGrid, which is the criterion used to designate a project as a TeraGrid Science Gateway.
