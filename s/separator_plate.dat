At present, thanks to the efforts of the leading countries that develop fuel cell technologies power plants on the basis of molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are really close to commercialization. One of the problems that are to be solved for practical implementation of MCFC and SOFC is a problem of corrosion of metal components of stacks that are assembled of a number of fuel cells. One of the major components of MCFC and SOFC stacks is a bipolar <b>separator</b> <b>plate</b> (BSP) that performs several functions - it is separation of reactant gas flows sealing of the joints between fuel cells, and current collection from the surface of electrodes. The goal of Task 1 of the project is to develop new cost-effective nickel coatings for the Russian 20 X 23 H 18 steel for an MCFC bipolar <b>separator</b> <b>plate</b> using technological processes usually implemented to apply corrosion stable coatings onto the metal parts for products in the defense.

A feasibility study on the cost of the Russian material for a BSP is to be done on Tasks 1, 2 in case the annual order makes up 400, 000 sheets.

The current Shuttle alkaline fuel cells are procured from UTC Fuel Cells, a United Technologies Company. The alkaline fuel cells are very reliable but the operating life is limited to 2600 hours due to voltage degradation of the individual cells. The main limiting factor {{in the life of}} the cells is corrosion of the cell's fiberglass/epoxy frame by the aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. To reduce operating costs, the orbiter program office approved the Long Life Alkaline Fuel Cell (LLAFC) program as a shuttle upgrade in 1999 to increase the operating life of the fuel cell powerplant to 5000 hours. The LLAFC program incorporates improving the cell by extending the length of the corrosion path, which reduces the cell frame corrosion. UTCFC performed analysis to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive the cell frame corrosion. The analysis indicated that the corrosion path started along the bond line between the cathode and the cell frame. Analysis also showed that the oxygen available at the cathode, the catalyst on the electrode, and the electrode substrate all supported or intensified the corrosion. The new cell design essentially doubled the corrosion path to mitigate the problem.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were: (a) to develop and demonstrate a new polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system that operates up to 160 C temperatures and at ambient pressures for stationary power applications, and (b) {{to determine if the}} GTI-molded composite graphite bipolar <b>separator</b> <b>plate</b> could provide long term operational stability at 160 C or higher. There are many reasons that fuel cell research has been receiving much attention. Fuel cells represent environmentally friendly and efficient sources of electrical power generation that could use a variety of fuel sources. The Gas Technology Institute (GTI), formerly Institute of Gas Technology (IGT), is focused on distributed energy stationary power generation systems. Currently the preferred method for hydrogen production for stationary power systems is conversion of natural gas, which has a vast distribution system in place. However, in the conversion of natural gas into a hydrogen-rich fuel, traces of carbon monoxide are produced. Carbon monoxide present in the fuel gas will in time cumulatively poison, or passivate the active platinum catalysts used in the anodes of PEMFC's operating at temperatures of 60 to 80 C. Various fuel processors have incorporated systems to reduce the carbon monoxide to levels below 10 ppm, but these require additional catalytic section(s) with sensors and controls for effective carbon monoxide control. These CO cleanup systems must also function especially well during transient load operation where CO can spike 300 % or more. One way to circumvent the carbon monoxide problem is to operate the fuel cell at a higher temperature where carbon monoxide cannot easily adsorb onto the catalyst and poison it. Commercially available polymer membranes such as Nafion{trademark} are not capable of operation at temperatures sufficiently high to prevent this. Hence this project investigated a new polymer membrane alternative to Nafion{trademark} that is capable of operation at temperatures up to 160 C...|$|E

The present study investigated the thermal performance of a heat pipe heat exchanger in transferring sensible heat from high-temperature natural air streams. In order to ensure the system's sustainable operation, water was used as the working fluid and heat is transferred using its indirect evaporation phenomenon. The physical domain comprised of 19 cylindrical copper heat pipes measuring 800 mm in length and 15. 9 mm in internal diameter, assembled in a systematic arrangement at an angle of 90 ° with respect to ground. The heat pipes were divided by a <b>separator</b> <b>plate</b> to segregate the evaporator and condenser ends from each other. Hot air at 41 °C was delivered to the evaporator end while a temperature of 15 °C was maintained in control volume at the condenser end. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used in order to analyze the heat pipe model at fixed inlet velocities of 1 m/s and 2. 3 m/s. The results showed a maximum temperature reduction of 3. 8 °C at an external air velocity of 1 m/s, delivering an internal air temperature of 37. 2 °C. A cooling load of 976 W was achieved indicating a heat pipe effectiveness of 6. 4 % when the velocity was increased to 2. 3 m/s. The numerical values predicted at the measurement locations were compared against experimental results for the purpose of validation. Good correlation was observed between the two techniques with error variations of 10 % for air velocity and 28 % for air temperature.
