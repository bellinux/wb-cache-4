5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group {{can be described as}} a <b>set</b> <b>that</b> is closed under subtraction.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 2008, another Christopher Reeve Superman film {{collection}} was released, entitled Superman: 4 Film Favorites, containing all four films, but with far less bonus material than previous sets.

50|$|Every {{subcover}} {{is also a}} refinement, but {{the opposite}} is not always true. A subcover is made from the <b>sets</b> <b>that</b> are in the cover, but omitting some of them; whereas a refinement is made from any <b>sets</b> <b>that</b> are subsets of the sets in the cover.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Ordinal Register Machine (ORM) is one {{of several}} {{different}} machine models for infinitary computability.

Further, we show <b>that</b> the hyperarithmetical <b>sets</b> are exactly those <b>sets</b> <b>that</b> can be decided by an ORM in time uniformly less than ω CK 1 Key words: Ordinal, ordinal computation, infinite time computation...|$|R

Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage.

Seven of the top-ten highest-attended games occurred in 2017. The park's season and average attendance records were also <b>set</b> <b>that</b> season. There have been 55sellout games at the stadium.

5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the <b>set,</b> <b>that</b> is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly posted that The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{deserved}} to be released on DVD. Gord Lacey, {{the creator of the}} website TVShowsonDVD.com, told the New York Daily News that Brisco was among the five most requested shows on the site. Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get Brisco released on DVD. This led to correspondence with Cuse, who also wanted to get a DVD set produced. On July 18, 2006, Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD <b>set</b> <b>that</b> contains all 27 episodes of the series. The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse; an interactive menu of Brisco's signature references narrated by Campbell; The History of Brisco County, Jr., documentary; a feature called A Reading from the Book of Bruce; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show.|$|E

Together, they found the money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey.

The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song <b>set</b> <b>that</b> impressed Creation founder Alan McGee.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the <b>set</b> <b>that</b> is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
