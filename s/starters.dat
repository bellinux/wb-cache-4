50|$|The {{ignition}} system {{is used to}} ignite the fuel-air mixture in the engine. The <b>starter</b> system is the {{ignition system}}, plus the battery, and <b>starter</b> switch, <b>starter</b> solenoid and electric <b>starter</b> motor.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard <b>starter,</b> a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of <b>starter</b> eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate <b>starter</b> relay. This <b>starter</b> operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the <b>starter</b> switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated <b>starter</b> relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the <b>starter</b> motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the <b>starter</b> drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the <b>starter</b> drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} <b>starter</b> motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the <b>starter</b> switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the <b>starter</b> drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|R

50|$|A <b>starter</b> ring gear, {{sometimes}} called a <b>starter</b> ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the <b>starter</b> ring are driven by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the <b>starter</b> motor. The primary function of the <b>starter</b> ring is to transfer torque from the <b>starter</b> motor pinion to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|R
5|$|With many {{of their}} <b>starters</b> returning, a highly ranked {{recruiting}} class, and a number one ranking before the season, the team had high expectations of repeating as national champions as they had nearly all of their offensive <b>starters</b> returning, although they had only two returning defensive <b>starters</b> from the previous year. The team went undefeated {{in the regular season}} with nine of their twelve wins by 17points or more and were compared with the greatest teams in the history of college football. Once again ranked first in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings, they were invited to the national championship bowl game at the Rose Bowl, where they lost to the Texas Longhorns. With a final record of 12–1, they finished the season ranked second in the nation in both the Associated Press (AP) and Coaches' Polls.|$|E

50|$|It is not {{necessary}} to wait the canonical ten days before using one cup of starter: a cup of <b>starter</b> {{can be used as a}} yeast substitute at any point. However, using <b>starter</b> on earlier days will result in a smaller quantity of <b>starter</b> at the end of the cycle. To avoid running out of <b>starter,</b> it is normal to feed the <b>starter</b> (add milk, sugar, and flour) before removing a cup for use, and most recipes assume that <b>starter</b> is always fed immediately before being removed. A five-day baking cycle feeds the <b>starter</b> every fifth day and uses the resulting mixture on that day to bake one or two loaves of bread (one cup per loaf). The remaining <b>starter</b> is reserved to begin the next five-day fermentation cycle.|$|R

40|$|Permutation array are {{of recent}} {{interest}} {{because of their}} application to data transmission over power lines. A new permutation technique based on distinct <b>starter</b> sets by employing circular and reversing operations. The crucial task is to generate the distinct <b>starter</b> sets by eliminating the equivalence <b>starter</b> sets. Meanwhile a new strategy for <b>starter</b> sets generation without generating its equivalence <b>starter</b> sets were developed and more efficient in terms of computation time compared to old method. However all these algorithms have limitations in terms of fixing element to construct the first set (<b>starter</b> set) to begin with. It {{would be interesting to}} derive new strategy by fixing an element in any position. A new method is developed for <b>starter</b> sets generation namely STARSET 2 based on exchange where any element can be selected randomly to be fixed.
