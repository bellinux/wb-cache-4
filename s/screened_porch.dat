In 1921, Hackett purchased the residence of former Territorial Governor Joseph Kibbey which was located next door to his house at 1342 E. Jefferson St.. In 1922, he established the Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital a private medical in that residence. The hospital didn't have many beds at first and each bed was situated in the <b>screened</b> <b>porch</b> of the house. Hackett purchased three adjoining lots and was, therefore, able to expand the hospital. He also had six cottages built for tuberculosis patients. He charged his patients $12.50 to $35.00 per week for a hospital stay. Hackett opened a pharmacy nearby and recruited Southern African-American nurses with college nursing degrees to join his staff. One of the benefits which the African-American doctors and nurses gained from joining him was the opportunity to gain valuable experience in their chosen field.|$|E

Additional remodeling occurred from 1976–78 when additional bedrooms were created by enclosing the <b>screened</b> <b>porch</b> {{on the north side}} of the building, as well as remodeling of the existing bedrooms and bathroom. The rooms upstairs were also remodeled at this time, as well as the switching of the locations of the dining room and kitchen, which were also updated. A statue of St. Francis, was installed in a small alcove next to the front door in 1980, brought in from the church in Lukachukai. Also in 1980, a mudroom by the rear entrance was also added. [...] A ﬁreplace was added to the south wall of the Friary’s living room on December 1, 1981, with a triple walled chimney pipe.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Screened</b> <b>porches</b> can be {{built in}} a manner similar to that of pole barns, with the screens added after the {{structure}} of the walls and the roof is completed. While <b>screen</b> <b>porches</b> are often attached to houses, they are sometimes built separately in order to simplify the construction process. In order to ensure that the porch be impervious to insects and other intrusions, a screen door is typically added to facilitate entry. Because screens can reduce the amount of light that enters the <b>porch's</b> interior, some <b>screened</b> <b>porches</b> are built so that the screens can be removed at times when insects and sunlight are less of a problem to the resident. [...] Some homeowners fill their porches with furniture and amenities typically found indoors, such as tables, chairs, and couches, ceiling fans, imitation hardwood floors, electrical outlets, painted elements, and even built-in furniture and plumbing.|$|R

50|$|The design also {{included}} light and air-filled areas for play and rest. Each ward had a glass-enclosed sun or play room. Sliding glass doors fronted each ward and originally led to <b>screened</b> <b>porches.</b> Bedridden {{children could be}} wheeled onto these porches or even onto paved terraces in front, to rest or play in the open air. When new medicines that became available to treat childhood diseases in the 1940s {{the importance of the}} <b>screened</b> <b>porches</b> was reduced. Steel casement windows have enclosed these porches since that time. Two other main buildings were added later. A service annex, built prior to World War II is a one-storied addition attached to {{the north side of the}} administration building. Nurses quarters were built following World War II to the east of the hospital in a separate building.|$|R

At the same time, screened porches {{can be used to}} permit an outdoors experience while being sheltered from direct sunlight and flying insects; some builders even include skylights in their designs when a porch would otherwise be excessively dark.

The only significant change to its construction was the closing-in of the rear <b>screen</b> <b>porch</b> in 1974.
