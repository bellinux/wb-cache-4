5000|$|Arturo Gatti {{needed a}} decent {{comeback}} opponent {{to determine whether}} he still had anything in the tank after a tough <b>stoppage</b> <b>loss</b> to Carlos Baldomir a year earlier. HBO gave the Gatti team a list of acceptable opponents and the Gatti team picked Gomez for Gatti to come back against, as Gomez was regarded by the Gatti team as a crude brawler type, a light puncher, and slow. The fight was also {{meant to be a}} setup fight for Gatti vs Julio César Chávez, Jr.. Instead, Gómez defeated the favored Arturo Gatti on July 14, 2007 via 7th round TKO in a dominant effort, landing right hands repeatedly over Gatti's jab and generally getting off first with his own jab and short combinations to Gatti's head and body. [...] Gatti retired following this match.|$|R

This fight generated much controversy: Romero was hurt badly {{at the end of}} round 2, and received extra time to recover between rounds. UFC color commentator Joe Rogan mistakenly blamed this on Romero's cornermen for failing to leave the Octagon on time, when the blame was actually on a UFC Cutman who apllied too much Vaseline to a cut and referee John McCarthy for allowing Romero to stay sitting while trying to get the cutman to return to the octagon to wipe the excess off. Later it was also noticed that Kennedy was illegally holding Romero's glove while striking him at end of round 2. [...] The win earned Romero his second Fight of the Night bonus award.|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on February 28, 1989, stopping Octavio Guardado in two rounds.

Jennings bounced back nicely in the second before again being hurt in the third, and then came back nicely again in the fourth. But from there, Ortiz seemed to take the fight over, then finished him off in round seven with a vicious left uppercut that sent Jennings face down on the canvas.
