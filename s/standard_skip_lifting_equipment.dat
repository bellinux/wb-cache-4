Underground mining less profitable, however, it is more environmentally friendly. In addition, this method is essentially inevitable {{due to the fact that}} the major mineral reserves are at greater depths and in the future will need to solve the problems of development of mineral deposits deep mines. The development of the mining sector and the deepening of mining operations require a new type of transport, justified and developed in the works of Bogatyrev M. D., Kiselev V. I., Kartaviy N.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is an integral}} concept for achieving quality of limits, interdependence, fundamentals and equity. Virtual reality means existing or resulting in essence or effect though not in actual fact, form, or name. Machine design is always interesting for most people, it is also {{becoming more and more}} popular now a days. Showing the performance of a machine design during the design phase is possible to do using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. Car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> is a device to lift a car for several workshop purposes as replace oil, fix car&# 65533;s break, overhaul engine, periodical maintenance and many others. Conventional car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> design needs a lot of cost, time, and materials because it needs doing the real test to understand the performance of the car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> design. The primary target of this research is to search and decide which mechanism is the most suitable for this machine and also the virtual reality to show its performance during the design phase. In this research, sustainable product development using virtual reality with 3 D Max and ANSYS software is used rather than conventional design. The goal of this research is to show the performance of the machine during the design phase using 3 D Max and ANSYS software. Finally, car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> has been designed in this research using 3 D Max and ANSYS software as a solution of sustainable product development. Designing car <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> using 3 D Max and ANSYS virtual reality software can reduce materials, cost and time of product development.

Muscle use was measured during all forms of exercise and exercise using conventional weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment</b> was compared to exercise during Pilates with and without a resistive device called the “Zone Pilates Sculpter ” (Savvier LP, Santa Fe Springs, Calif). The ability of the Pilates device to restrict movement in adverse directions and thereby, reduce potential injuries during exercise was also assessed. The results of the experiments showed that Pilates, while good for endurance training, resulted in only minimal muscle activity in core muscles (abdominal and paraspinal muscles) compared to exercise on commercial weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, the addition of the resistive device to Pilates exercise, increased the workload substantially, such that exercise during Pilates was equivalent to a medium intensity workout on commercial weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, unlike commercial exercise equipment, Pilates and the resistive device exercised multiple muscle groups simultaneously and thereby provided a more efficient workout than commercial weight <b>lifting</b> <b>equipment.</b> The resistive device also restricted adverse movement at the joints during exercise making exercise smoother and safer...|$|R
