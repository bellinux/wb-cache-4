5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of <b>social</b> <b>identity,</b> with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of <b>social</b> <b>identity.</b> Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

The starting point must be to regard mortuary practice as neither a mirror nor mirage of past <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> and <b>social</b> structures. Instead, graves need to be viewed as ‘halls of mirrors’ through which the archaeologist can explore past societies, their perceived pasts, future aspirations and <b>social</b> <b>identities...</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors {{propose that}} when people become fused with a group, their {{personal}} and <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> become functionally equivalent. Two hypotheses follow from this proposition. First, activating either personal or <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> of fused persons should increase their willingness to endorse extreme behaviors {{on behalf of the}} group. Second, because personal as well as <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> support group-related behaviors of fused persons, the 2 forms of identity may combine synergistically, fostering exceptionally high levels of extreme behavior. Support for these hypotheses came from 5 preliminary studies and 3 experiments. In particular, fused persons were more willing to fight or die for the group than nonfused persons, especially when their personal or <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> had been activated. The authors conclude that among fused persons, both the personal and social self may energize and direct group-related behavior. Implications for related theoretical approaches and for conceptualizing the relationship between personal <b>identities,</b> <b>social</b> <b>identities,</b> and group processes are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{theory was}} {{developed}} by John Turner and colleagues, and along with <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> theory it is a constituent part of the <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> approach.

25|$|The {{identity}} fusion construct builds upon {{earlier work}} by emphasizing {{aspects of the}} relationship of people to groups that were de-emphasized within the <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> perspective (i.e., <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> theory and self-categorization theory). Like <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> theory, identity fusion theory rests on the distinction between the personal and social identities. However, the <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> approach assumes that there is a hydraulic relationship between personal and social identities. That is, the increases in the salience and influence of one identity diminishes the salience and influence of the other. One important implication of this assumption is that as the group identity becomes salient and apt to guide behavior, the personal identity becomes less salient and less likely to guide behavior. In contrast, the theory of identity fusion theory proposes that both the personal and social identities of a person can be salient and influential simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|Groups are {{important}} {{not only because they}} offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their <b>social</b> <b>identity.</b> The shared <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the <b>social</b> <b>identity</b> of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group. On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society. Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDespite {{the boom}} in {{research}} on identity in economics, {{the question of how}} to depict personal identity in a fashion that combines potentially conflicting <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> has so far been largely ignored. This paper introduces a framework that relies on the structure of the social realm that is exogenous to the individual in order to depict investment decisions as per <b>social</b> <b>identities.</b> The structure of the environment is identified using organizational boundaries and identity production functions are used to combine <b>social</b> <b>identities.</b> The inclusion of the various social spaces that are relevant to personal identity strategies enables one to simultaneously study identification strategies and individuation strategies. It also allows the depiction of <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> that may be conflicting, due to different social commitments and/or norm valuations. This externalist conception of identity helps discuss the limitations of internalist conceptions of identity and accounts for the heterogeneity of identity strategies across individuals...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{how young}} {{children}} perform their <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> {{in relation to}} social class, gender and ethnicity in primary school. In doing so, this study contributes to {{a growing body of}} literature that recognises the complexity and intersecting nature of children’s <b>social</b> <b>identities,</b> and views children as actively performing their <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> within discursively shaped contexts. The study operationalizes intersectionality as a sensitising concept for understanding the particular ways in which social class, gender and ethnicity are performed differently in different contexts, and for conceptualising the categories of social class, gender and ethnicity as constitutive of and irreducible to each other. An eight-month long ethnography was conducted in an urban Scottish primary school with young children (aged five to seven). Data were generated mainly from participant observation in the classroom, lunch hall, playground and other spaces of the school, interviews with children and staff, and from gathering a range of texts and documents (e. g. legislation and school displays). The findings of the study show that social class, gender and ethnicity intersect in the complex ways in which children perform their <b>social</b> <b>identities.</b> Particular identities are foregrounded in specific moments and situations (Valentine, 2007), yet the performing of <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> is not reducible to either social class or gender or ethnicity alone. In addition, age, sexuality and interpersonal relationships (e. g. dynamics of ‘best friends’, conflicts between dyadic and triadic groups, family relationships) all intersect within children’s <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> in particular moments. Thus, <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> need to be understood as deeply contextual, relational, and mutually constitutive. Emotions play a significant role for how <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> are invested with meanings and values and produce complex dynamics of belonging and being different. The study highlights the importance of the educational setting, the policy and legislation context and wider social inequalities for shaping the discourses within which children perform their <b>social</b> <b>identities.</b> Tensions and ambiguities – e. g. between ‘diversity’ and ‘inequality’ – in the relevant policies and legislations fail to address the different underlying dimensions of social justice in relation to social class, gender and ethnicity, and these tensions are reflected in staff’s discourses and practices, resulting in the foregrounding of certain aspects of diversity and the silencing of others. This study also highlights how through performing <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> in certain ways, wider social inequalities become manifest. Children are aware of and contribute to powerful discourses of social stereotypes and inequalities. Children also engage in the ‘politics of belonging’ (Yuval-Davis, 2011) by constructing dynamics of ‘us’ and ‘them’, engaging in processes of ‘othering’, and drawing boundaries around certain forms of belonging. The findings of this study emphasise the need for both a reflective practice in educational settings, as well as for policies and legislations to acknowledge and address the complex, intersecting nature of children’s <b>social</b> <b>identities</b> and the multiple dimensions of social justice...|$|R
