5|$|Talks between Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs over renewal {{terms for}} the highly lucrative Pixar-Disney {{distribution}} deal {{broke down in}} January 2004. Jobs in particular disagreed with Eisner's insistence that sequels such as the then in-development Toy Story 3 (2010) would not count against the number of films required in the studio's new deal. To that end, Disney announced the launching of Circle 7 Animation, a division of Feature Animation which would have produced sequels to the Pixar films, while Pixar began <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new distribution deal.|$|E

5|$|Blaine had briefly {{joined the}} Cheerios {{when it looked}} like New Directions would be {{disbanding}} after their Sectionals loss, and cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) blackmails Blaine into rejoining; Blaine and Sam hatch up a plan to bring Sue down from the inside. Blaine eventually confesses to Sam that he has feelings for him, to which Sam assures him that he is somewhat flattered by Blaine's honesty and attraction, and that it would not change the fact that Blaine is still Sam's best friend. Blaine still loves Kurt and asks Burt for his permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're too young to marry, and advises him to wait. Blaine remains determined, however, and while <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for over thirty years. Jan offers to be a mentor to him, and Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of gay people. New Directions wins at Regionals, and Will and Emma get married immediately afterward, with the glee club, plus some graduates including Kurt, in attendance. Blaine is shown, after the ceremony is over, holding a jewelry box behind his back.|$|E

Desmond tries to predict more events but they do not happen and his friend assures him time travel is impossible.

Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and take a picture, where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her.
