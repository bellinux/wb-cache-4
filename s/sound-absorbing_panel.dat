40|$|Sound {{absorption}} {{and optical}} transparency {{are among the}} most useful properties of noise barriers. While the latter is required to reduce visual impact and for aesthetical reasons, the former is required whenever conditions of multiple reflections and presence of close, high receivers occur. The technical feasibility of a transparent, <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>panel</b> for outdoor antinoise devices is investigated in this paper. An analysis of acoustical performance of multiple perforated plates is performed employing an existing theory for microperforated absorbers under normal incidence and diffused sound field. An optimization of the geometrical parameters is carried out {{on the basis of the}} European classification criteria of noise barriers for roadways. An optimized three-layer configuration can achieve sound-absorption properties similar to nontransparent products with only a limited loss of visual transparency and appropriate mechanical strength. Experimental data obtained with an impedance tube on small test samples made of transparent polycarbonate and in a reverberation room on full-scale prototypes are reported, showing a rather good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The optical performance of a multilayered configuration is evaluated also...|$|E

40|$|Porous {{materials}} were prepared by agglomerating the expandedclay with an epoxyresin {{with the aim}} to produce sound absorbers which combine good noise damping performances, excellent mechanical strength and low costs. The use of a polymeric binder, instead of the concrete typically employed in present commercial products, allows obtaining light <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>panels.</b> In our research the acoustic and mechanicalproperties of samples of consolidatedexpandedclay with different thicknesses were experimentally tested. Particularly, the sound absorption properties were measured in a vertical Kundt tube by applying the standing wave ratio method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} acoustical design {{and the results of}} a survey in music rooms in an Italian public school (Liceo Statale “Alfano I” in Salerno, Italy). The locations selected are devoted to orchestral performances and to recording. The purpose of correcting or insulating the spaces was to obtain a good acoustics in locations used at a reasonable cost. The acoustic correction was achieved by using <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>panels</b> made from low-density polyethylene foam with a closed calibrated cell structure, placed on the walls and on the ceiling, and sound-insulation panels made of geometrically spherical composites. The optimal distribution of the sound absorbing panels was made using commercial software for simulating a scattering of sound pressure levels in a room. Reverberation time was measured at various frequencies with a class A phonometer, using an Integrated Impulse Response, in accordance with the international standard ISO 3382. For each measurement position variations of reverberation time in terms of time and frequency are measured. The results show a substantial accordance with the simulation in the design phase, allowing the authors to conclude that the proposed development is characterized by good performance in terms of cost-benefit...|$|R

A definitive version was subsequently published in Composite Structures, Vol 120, 2015, DOI: 10. 1016 /j. compstruct. 2014. 10. 001 This work is focused on analysis of mechanical behaviour of aircraft engine's <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>panels</b> (SAPs) exposed to in-service damage. Its aim is to suggest techniques of local repair of damaged SAPs and estimation of their post-repair residual strength. Fibreglass laminate panels with tubular core and perforated elements were studied for this purpose. A mechanical behaviour of structural elements of the panels was modelled with the finite-element (FE) analysis, with through rupture considered as an in-service defect. A technique of defect repair without dismantling parts from the structure is introduced using a novel vacuumless technology. This procedure was implemented on specially produced samples and simulated with FE. Residual strength of repaired samples was compared with that of standard and ruptured ones in tension experiments and FE analysis. Conclusions about applicability limits of the presented method are provided...|$|R

Recently, research on new mufflers lined with sound-absorbing material has been {{addressed in the}} industrial field. On {{the basis of the}} transfer matrix method and the stiffness matrix method, most researchers have explored noise reduction effects. Yet, the maximum noise reduction of a compact silencer equipped with sound-absorbing splitters within a constrained space, which often occurs in modern industries, has been ignored. Therefore, the optimum design of mufflers becomes essential. In this paper, a one-chamber muffler equipped with multiple <b>sound-absorbing</b> <b>panels</b> within a fixed length is assessed. In order to facilitate the assessment of optimal mufflers having multiple sound-absorbing splitters, an approximated simplified objective function (OBJ) is established in advance by linking the boundary element model (BEM) with a polynomial neural network fitted with a series of real data, input design data (muffler dimensions) and output data obtained by BEM simulation. To assess the optimal mufflers, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied. Before the GA operation can be carried out, the accuracy of the mathematical models must be checked using the experimental data. On the basis of the fixed total thickness of the splitters, the open area of the flowing channel can be assured. Therefore, not only the influence of the backpressure can be minimized, but also the cost of the sound absorbing splitters can be economically saved. Optimal results reveal that the maximum value of the sound transmission loss (STL) can be improved at the targeted frequencies. Consequently, the optimum algorithm proposed in this study provides an efficient way to find a better silencer for industry...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{theory of}} microperforated <b>panel</b> <b>sound-absorbing</b> constructions has been {{introduced}} by D. -Y. Maa in 1975. Since then many variations of micro-perforated sound absorbing devices and materials have been introduced. Materials {{that have been used}} to be micro-perforated have been metal, wood, plastics and many others. In 2001 a nearly invisible micro-perforation {{has been introduced}} to the stretched material making it highly sound absorptive. Over the last ten years different set-ups made of micro-perforated layers, porous materials as well as plate resonators have been investigated. In this contribution measured sound absorption coefficients of various set-ups with micro-perforated stretched foils and different other acoustic materials will be presented. For these assemblies no closed calculation model exists so far. Theoretical approaches towards layered sound absorbers with micro-perforated components will be suggested. Future developments in the field of micro-perforation in room acoustics will be discussed. Finally applications will be presented...|$|R
