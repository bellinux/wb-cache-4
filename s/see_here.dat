5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll <b>see</b> <b>here,</b> the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

25|$|Oxycodone is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and its {{clearance}} {{therefore can}} be altered by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes. (For lists of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and inducers, <b>see</b> <b>here</b> and here, respectively.) Natural genetic variation in these enzymes can also influence the clearance of oxycodone, which {{may be related to}} the wide inter-individual variability in its half-life and potency.|$|E

25|$|We {{recall that}} for a (unital, associative) ring R, we denote by V(R) the (conical, commutative) monoid of {{isomorphism}} classes of finitely generated projective right R-modules, <b>see</b> <b>here</b> for more details. Recall that if R is von Neumann regular, then V(R) is a refinement monoid. Denote by Idc R the (∨,0)-semilattice of finitely generated two-sided ideals of R. We denote by L(R) the lattice of all principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring R. It {{is well known that}} L(R) is a complemented modular lattice.|$|E
