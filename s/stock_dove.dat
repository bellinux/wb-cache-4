500|$|A mated pair usually {{constructs}} a nest {{by improving}} a crevice by dropping sticks into it; {{it is then}} built {{on top of the}} platform formed. This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces, sometimes with birds still on them. Nest platforms can attain a great size. John Mason Neale notes that a [...] "Clerk was allowed by the Churchwarden to have for his own use all that the caddows had brought into the Tower: and he took home, at one time, two cart-loads of good firewood, besides a great quantity of rubbish which he threw away." [...] In his The Natural History of Selborne, Gilbert White notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the lintels of Stonehenge, and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting. The species has been recorded outcompeting the tawny owl (Strix aluco) for nest sites in the Netherlands. They can take over old nest sites of the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) and <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (Columba oenas). Breeding colonies may also edge out those of the red-billed chough, but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as the carrion crow, rook or magpie.|$|E
50|$|The three western European Columba pigeons, though superficially alike, {{have very}} {{distinctive}} characteristics. The wood pigeon may be readily distinguished {{by the white}} on its neck (in adults) and wings. The rock pigeon and <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> are more alike in size and plumage, but wild specimens of the former have a white rump and two well-marked dark bars on the wing, while the rump of the <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> is grey and its wing bars incomplete. The feral pigeon (the same species as rock pigeon) is highly variable, and indistinctly marked grey specimens with the white rump missing can sometimes resemble the <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> quite closely.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (Columba oenas) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Columbidae, the doves and pigeons.|$|E
50|$|The hedge flora are {{dominated}} by cow parsley, and the ditches have wetland flowers including water figwort and wild angelica. A small adjacent woodland, which is probably ancient, has nesting birds, including sparrowhawks, willow warblers and <b>stock</b> <b>doves.</b> Muntjac deer are often seen there.|$|R
5|$|The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and <b>stock</b> <b>doves,</b> common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, {{rock pipit}} and– in 2007 – Britain's {{first and only}} Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|R
50|$|The area {{is known}} for a diverse forging and prey species, {{including}} rabbit, wolf, wild boar, fox and badger; migratory and endemic birds, such as bee-eaters, tit, owl, cuckoo, lark, Eurasian jay, common blackbird, lesser kestrel, red-legged partridge, European goldfinch, <b>stock</b> <b>doves,</b> hoopoe, dove (Streptopelia), typical warbler and nightingale; while the rivers are stocked with eel, carp and trout.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{a special}} breed of rock pigeon is used called a Zurito (Columba Oenas) (see <b>Stock</b> <b>dove).</b> They are small, gray, and {{exceptionally}} fast.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> is sociable {{as well as}} gregarious, often consorting {{with wood}} pigeons, though doubtless it is the {{presence}} of food which brings them together.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> is {{generally}} open country. Even though it nests in trees {{it does not}} prefer densely wooded areas. It is also common on coasts where the cliffs provide holes.|$|E
5|$|Rare vagrant species {{spotted in}} the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard's pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and <b>stock</b> <b>doves,</b> whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and rock pipit. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{an ancient}} woodland, {{dominated}} by pedunculate oak, hornbeam and ash. A shrub layer includes hawthorns, field maples and wild service trees, and among the ground flora are bluebells and wood anemones. Breeding birds include tawny owls, nuthatches, tree creepers and <b>stock</b> <b>doves.</b> A small stream flows through the wood to join Pymme's Brook, {{which is also a}} Site of Importance for Nature Conservation, in the neighbouring Oak Hill Park.|$|R
50|$|Homerton {{has more}} green space around its {{buildings}} {{than many other}} Cambridge colleges. In its grounds are several rare examples of wild orchids and over 150 species of plants, which act as a rich habitat for various forms of wildlife - including grey squirrels, carrion crows, woodpeckers, <b>stock</b> <b>doves,</b> rabbits, the 'College fox', and in the summer a small colony of swifts, which nest under the eaves of {{the roof of the}} Cavendish building after their return from Africa. There is also a large orchard, where students relax in warm weather.|$|R
5000|$|Mixed {{woodlands}} of oak, birch {{and sweet}} chestnut, often with Scots pine: <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (Columba oenas), marsh tit (Parus palustris), tawny owl (Strix aluco), bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus); {{in the summer}} common firecrest (Regulus ignicapillus); common buzzard (Buteo buteo) (occasional visitor).|$|E
50|$|Less {{commonly}} imitated are {{the great}} tit (Anton Bruckner's Fourth Symphony), the goldfinch (Vivaldi), linnet (Couperin, Haydn and Rachmaninov), robin (Peter Warlock), swallow (Dvorak and Tchaikovsky), wagtail (Benjamin Britten), and magpie (in a Mussorgsky song). Dvorak celebrated many {{other kinds of}} bird, including the <b>stock</b> <b>dove,</b> skylark, and house sparrow.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of a patchwork of fields, intersected by overgrown hedgerows, narrow strips of woodland and small streams. There {{are a number of}} magnificent old oaks, and breeding birds include sparrowhawk, <b>stock</b> <b>dove,</b> bullfinch, willow warbler and chaffinch. There are also a number of common butterflies and the uncommon chimney sweeper moth.|$|E
50|$|Habibi Neccar Dağı Nature Reserve {{is famous}} for its {{cultural}} as well as natural value, especially for St Pierre Church, which was carved into the rocks. The Charon monument, 200m north of the church, is huge sculpture of Haron, known as Boatman of Hell in mythology, carved into the rocks. The main species of tree are cluster pine, oaks and sandalwood. The mountain is also home to foxes, rabbits, partridges and <b>stock</b> <b>doves.</b> Nature reserve is 10 km east of Antakya and can be accessible by public transport.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{its food}} is plant material; young shoots and {{seedlings}} are favoured, {{and it will}} take grain as well as insects and snails. In some areas it feeds mostly on acorns and pine seeds. Its diet can include a variety of foods: berries such as bay and hawthorn, figs, cereal grains, beans, peas, and small invertebrates that are obtained while walking on the ground. During autumn migration in October, <b>stock</b> <b>doves</b> stop over at places with an abundance of acorns, supplementing the diet with shoots and leaves.|$|R
50|$|New England is {{situated}} in a wooded valley making it a good site for wildlife such as insects, and birds.In 2010, 44 of 53 nestboxes put up at the site were used, resulting in the successful raising of 352 young fledglings, an improvement {{from the previous year}} of 306 young raised.The young birds raised included a pair of <b>stock</b> <b>doves</b> which nested in one of the three owl boxes put up. Sightings of Mandarin ducks on the stream meant that three new large nestboxes suitable for them have been put up, but no nesting attempt was made in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Most manuscripts {{describe}} Halphas as a hoarse-voiced <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (though Weyer and Colin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal {{describe him}} as a stork), who supplies weapons and ammunition for towers (Weyer and de Plancy have [...] "towns" [...] or [...] "villes" [...] instead), sends men to war, and commands 26 legions of spirits.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{birds in}} 2004 were the herring gull, lesser black-backed gull, common gull, common tern, Arctic tern, Sandwich tern and little tern, {{as well as}} the magpie, carrion crow and swallow. While the numbers of terns amount to more than 2,000 pairs, only a few pairs of the little tern were noted. Shelduck and <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> have bred in the rabbit holes.|$|E
50|$|The nest {{is usually}} in a hole in an old tree. Before deforestation, the <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> was the most {{frequent}} pigeon, nesting mostly in oak or pine wood, but as it usually nests in cavities in trees it was normally only found in old forests. In plantations there are not as many holes to nest in, so it is scarcer. In addition, as the <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> is double-brooded, requiring two holes for its broods. It has been observed nesting in rabbit burrows, ruins, old poplar hedges, cracks in crags or cliff faces, in ivy, and in the thick growth around the boles of lime trees. It will also use nest boxes. The cavity should be about 75 centimetres deep and the hole should be big enough to admit a fist. Though nesting material is seldom used, the squabs leave the hole very oily. Stock doves prefer to nest close together. Outside of the breeding season, stock doves may also roost in cavities.|$|E
40|$|Trichomonas gallinae is an {{emerging}} pathogen in wild birds, linked to recent declines in finch (Fringillidae) populations across Europe. Globally, the main hosts for this parasite are species of Columbidae (doves and pigeons); here {{we carry out}} the first investigation into the presence and incidence of Trichomonas in four species of Columbidae in the UK, through live sampling of wild-caught birds and subsequent PCR. We report the first known UK cases of Trichomonas infection in 86 % of European Turtle Doves Streptopelia turtur sampled, along with 86 % of Eurasian Collared Doves Streptopelia decaocto, 47 % of Woodpigeons Columba palumbus and 40 % of <b>Stock</b> <b>Doves</b> Columba oenas. Birds {{were more likely to be}} infected if the farm provided supplementary food for gamebirds. We found three strains of T. gallinae and one strain clustering within the Trichomonas tenax clade, not previously associated with avian hosts in the UK. One T. gallinae strain was identical at the ITS/ 5. 8 S/ITS 2 ribosomal region to that responsible for the finch trichomonosis epizootic. We highlight the importance of increasing our knowledge of the diversity and ecological implications of Trichomonas parasites in order further to understand the sub-clinical impacts of parasite infection...|$|R
50|$|Birdlife is {{abundant}} around the village, with common blackbirds, European robins, dunnocks, Eurasian wrens {{and both the}} song and mistle thrush. Eurasian curlews nest in boggy patches and northern lapwings {{can be seen in}} the fields. European greenfinches, linnets, whitethroats, common chaffinches and willow warblers all nest in the gorse bushes that flank the sheep pastures, along with European stonechat and the whinchat. Barn swallows, house martins and common swifts nest in the farm buildings, alongside house sparrows and white wagtails, while the woodlands are the haunt of the Eurasian nuthatch, common treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker and European green woodpecker. common wood pigeons, <b>stock</b> <b>doves</b> and Eurasian collared doves also breed in the woods, along with the Eurasian woodcock. The long-tailed tit nests in dense thickets of blackthorn and gorse, while the reed bunting, common moorhen and common snipe raise their young in the marshes. Three species of owl nest around the village, and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, merlin and common buzzard can all be seen hunting. On the coastal cliffs, peregrine falcons and red-billed chough are found, with rock pipits inhabiting the rocks above the tide line. Great cormorants and European shags, common guillemots, razorbills and European herring gulls all nest on these cliffs, as does the northern fulmar.|$|R
30|$|There {{are a few}} {{exceptions}} to the general responses of migratory and non-migratory bird species. Among the European non-migratory forest specialists, Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos minor) declined from a very high population in the 1980 s, when they benefited from the widespread death of trees from acid rain (Flousek 1989). Bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) have also declined, {{for reasons that are}} unknown (Siriwardena et al. 2001; Marquiss 2007), and have remained at a low level in parts of Europe. However, populations of both species appear to have stabilized over the past 5 to 10 [*]years. There are also regionally migrating species that show increasing abundance, such as <b>Stock</b> <b>Doves</b> (Columba oenas), which might profit not only from the increasing abundance of Black Woodpeckers (Drycopus martius), because they use old nesting holes made by woodpecker (Kosiński et al. 2011) but also from increasing maize cultivation in agriculture, and Common Chiffchaffs (Phylloscopus collybita), which profit from an increase in the area of mixed forests (Gregory et al. 2007). Among the continentally migrating species, there is one species that has increased (Common Redstart, Phoenicurus phoenicurus; Fig.  2 b). Common Redstarts breed in parks, gardens, sport fields, and other habitats where trees do not form a continuous canopy (Sedláček et al. 2004) and rely on areas with sparse vegetation for foraging (Martinez et al. 2010). Thus, the apparent increase may reflect a recovery from low numbers in the late twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|The {{avifauna}} includes most of {{the species}} typical of broad-leaved woodland in southern England, such as sparrowhawk (Accipter nisus), <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (Columba oenas), tawny owl (Strix aluco), European green woodpecker (Picus viridis), great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), garden warbler (Sylvia borin), blackcap (S. atricapilla), chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), spotted flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), marsh tit (Parus palustris), nuthatch (Sitta europaea), treecreeper Certhia familiaris and jay (Garrulus glandarius).|$|E
50|$|The <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> is {{the rarest}} {{of the wild}} European pigeons. In part of its European and western Asiatic range it is a migrant. There has been {{a sharp decline in}} France (−57% in 1976). Although the species is not {{considered}} threatened in Europe, it is classified in Schedule 2 of the Birds Directive and Annex III the Berne Convention. 100,000 to 200,000 individuals winter in France.|$|E
50|$|Woodland birds include {{wood warbler}} (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (Columba oenas), European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus) and {{northern}} goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). Common buzzard (Buteo buteo) {{is very common}} and common raven (Corvus corax) is spreading. Birds seen more rarely include red kite (Milvus milvus), wintering great grey shrike (Lanius exubitor) and hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) and migrating ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus) and wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe).|$|E
50|$|The Somali pigeon or Somali <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (Columba oliviae) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to {{northern}} Somalia. Because there has hardly been any research on the species, {{the health of the}} population is uncertain. However, {{it has been suggested that}} the species is relatively rare. The IUCN Redlist identified a possible threat to the species from the speckled pigeon (Columba guinea).|$|E
50|$|The genus Columba is {{the largest}} within the pigeon family, and has the widest distribution. Its members are {{typically}} pale grey or brown, often with white head or neck markings or iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves, but these are absent in this species. The <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> is less grey in plumage than other pigeons in Europe.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} endemic {{subspecies}} of birds, {{of which the}} bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus), mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus), <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> (Columba oenas), Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), woodlark (Lullula arborea), mute swan (Cygnus olor), common quail (Coturnix coturnix), Caspian titmouse (Poecile hyrcanus) subspecies of the titmouse; the Caucasus pheasant (Phasianus colchicus colchicus) subspecies of the common pheasant are common.|$|E
50|$|The {{total number}} of bird species is 159. Of them 91, or 57%, are passerine. Three species are relict — boreal owl, white-backed {{woodpecker}} and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. The park's rarest residents are lesser spotted eagle with a single nesting pair, booted eagle, golden eagle with 2 to 5 pairs, short-toed snake eagle with two pairs, saker falcon, peregrine falcon with three pairs, western capercaillie, hazel grouse, rock partridge, corn crake, Eurasian woodcock and <b>stock</b> <b>dove.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{breeding}} {{colonies of}} note include black guillemot, water rail and <b>stock</b> <b>dove.</b> The latter species {{has suffered a}} dramatic decline in Northern Ireland, but numbers have increased on Copeland with some 100 pairs now breeding. Breeding waders such as lapwing and snipe may be found further inland. Here the taller vegetation, interspersed with open areas, provides an ideal breeding habitat. Birds of prey favour the islands when the breeding season is over. Hen harrier, sparrowhawk, buzzard, kestrel, merlin and peregrine falcon are all seen regularly.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many parts}} of the Southern England Chalk Formation, the natural chalk and downland {{countryside}} around Chain Hill provides a habitat for many types of butterflies and wildflowers including cowslip, orchid, thistle and daisy. The mixed farmland on the hills around supports a wide variety of birdlife including yellowhammer, corn bunting, linnet, wheatear, whinchat, yellow wagtail, lapwing, red kite, sparrowhawk, barn owl, pheasant, grey partridge, <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> and skylark. Roe deer, muntjac and fox are regular visitors and have been sighted all along the hill in their natural habitat.|$|E
50|$|Among National Red Book {{species of}} {{vertebrates}} in the park, there are: European green lizard, smooth snake, short-toed snake eagle, greater spotted eagle, <b>stock</b> <b>dove,</b> white-backed woodpecker, Miller's water shrew, serotine bat, Nathusius' pipistrelle, Kuhl's pipistrelle, common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, common noctule, Leisler's bat, brown long-eared bat, rearmouse, Daubenton's bat, stoat, European polecat and otter.Among National Red Book species of invertebrates, there are: forest caterpillar hunter, stag beetle, musk beetle, hermit beetle, Neopristilophus depressus (lat.), swallowtail, southern festoon, clouded Apollo, Duke of Burgundy, poplar admiral, blue underwing, Janus femoratus(lat.), Megarhyssa superba(lat.), carpenter bee and mammoth wasp.|$|E
50|$|The three Western European Columba pigeons, common wood pigeon, <b>stock</b> <b>dove,</b> {{and rock}} pigeon, though superficially alike, have very {{distinctive}} characteristics; the common wood pigeon may be identified at once by its larger size at 38 - 44.5 cm and 300 - 615 g, {{and the white}} on its neck and wing. It is otherwise a basically grey bird, with a pinkish breast. The wingspan can range from 68 to 80 cm and the wing chord measures 24 to 25.4 cm. The tail measures 13.8 to 15 cm, the bill is 1.9 to 2.2 cm and the tarsus is 2.5 to 2.8 cm. Adult birds bear a series of green and white patches on their necks, and a pink patch on their chest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{common name}} <b>stock</b> <b>dove</b> has caused some {{confusion}} {{about the origins of}} this bird. The modern usage of the word [...] "stock" [...] might imply that the bird has been tamed and kept as stock for food and merchandise, leading to the belief that this bird is a hybrid breed with its origins in human aviaries; however, this is not the case. The word [...] "stock" [...] in the common name of this species refers not to the stock of trade, but comes from the Old English [...] "stocc" [...] meaning [...] "stump, post, stake, tree trunk, log,". Therefore, [...] "stock dove" [...] means roughly [...] "a dove which lives in hollow trees". Such hollow trees near human settlements would often be taken and used as wood stock for firewood, hence the name.|$|E
