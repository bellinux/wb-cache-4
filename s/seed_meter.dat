40|$|A punch planter was {{designed}} for no-till conditions. Initially, the penetration forces acting on two different punches were evaluated in laboratory tests with two different soils and varying soil moisture contents and bulk densities. A standard cone penetrometer {{was used as a}} reference. Soil samples were prepared using PVC molds with a procedure based on the Proctor test. Bulk density was the factor that resulted in the biggest changes in penetration force. Good correlations were observed between the cone penetrometer data and punch penetration forces. A prototype punch planter for corn {{was designed}} and built using a commercial vacuum <b>seed</b> <b>meter.</b> The <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> was evaluated in the laboratory, vertically and inclined. The prototype planter with the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> attached was also evaluated in the laboratory. The results were not significantly affected by the working position of the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> nor by speeds between 1. 0 and 3. 0 m/s for the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> and planter prototype. Field tests were conducted at several residue covers at 2. 0 m/s and no significant differences in plant spacings were observed. The prototype was modified to be able to plant different population rates. Seed spacings of 136, 165 and 210 mm were obtained by constructing three punch wheels with different punch lengths. Laboratory and field tests were run at speeds of 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 m/s. The field tests were run in three different residue covers (corn, grain sorghum and soybean). Despite problems with synchronization between the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> and punch wheels in some combinations, the length of the punches seemed to cause no significant problems at the speeds tested. A soil cleaning device was designed to reduce the soil disturbance. The volume of soil displaced by the smallest punch wheel was less than half of that displaced by a commercial no-till planter. Planting depth regularity was evaluated, showing good uniformity. Though the results are promising, recommendations for further improvement are proposed, especially related to the synchronization between the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> and punch wheel. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> {{unit was}} designed and mounted on a common grain drill for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> shaft driver, (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental ground wheel (SGW) and <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> shaft and (c) a control box to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop control system, the designed control box regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> unit (FSMU). The dynamic tests were conducted to compare the performance of installed FSMU on the grain drill and equipped grain drill with common <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> unit (CSMU) at three forward speeds of 4, 6 and 8 (Km/h) for DSW. Results of the FSMU assessment demonstrated that an increase in forward speed of grain drill (FSGD) and stubble coverage did not significantly affect the seeding rate in the grain drill for DSW. Using the FSMU reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) by approximately 50 %. Consequently, applying the FSMU on the common grain drill led to a desirable seeding rate at different forward speeds of the grain drill and stubble existence...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringAjay ShardaIn recent years, the {{technology}} employed on precision row-crop planters has rapidly advanced. These new technologies include automatic downforce control systems and electronic drive singulation seed meters. These new technologies offer producers higher productivity through high speed planting and increased yield potentials through accurate seed spacing and placement. To {{begin to understand}} the benefits and performance of these new technologies, research must be conducted that specifically targets these new systems. With this research, producers would be able to better select equipment for their operation and have a deeper understanding of proper system operation and settings. A test stand, of a scissor-lift type design, was developed to evaluate row crop planter automatic downforce systems. Evaluation of a planter’s automatic downforce system is important for understanding the planter’s capability of maintaining target seeding depth throughout varying field conditions. The test stand consists of a horizontal platform that can raise and lower to simulate terrain changes as well as a mechanism to load the planter row unit’s opening discs to simulate varying soil texture. The vertical height of the test stand and the disc load can be varied in real-time based on utilizing real-world scenarios under simulated conditions to evaluate downforce system response. The stand incorporated several sensors to obtain the overall applied downforce, applied disc load, applied gauge wheel load, and hydraulic pressure. The test stand’s capabilities were evaluated and found to be satisfactory for planter downforce system testing. The test stand was then used to evaluate a commercial automatic downforce system when operating under simulated field conditions. Field data was used to create simulations representing soil type changes, planter operating speed changes, and extreme conditions such as a hard, packed clay or rocky soil type. It was found that the evaluated downforce system was able to maintain target gauge wheel load to within ± 223 N for at least 94 % of the time during all simulations. This would suggest that the planter would be able to maintain target seeding depth for at least 94 % of field operations. Another key aspect for precision agricultural planters is to achieve accurate seed spacing at varying speeds. An electronic drive singulation seed metering system was evaluated to gather the meter’s effectiveness for high speed planting during straight and contour farming mode using simulated field conditions. The simulated conditions were used to gather the meter’s response when encountering high planting speeds, accelerations, decelerations, point-rows, and contours. These meters were found to be highly accurate, with less than 1. 5 % error in target <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> speed during all simulated conditions. The meters were also found to have a response time that was always 0. 34 seconds or less for all simulated conditions...|$|E

An experiment was conducted at the Kabootarabad Research Station of Isfahan Research Center to compare the performance parameters of planting equipment in a clay loam soil. Four planting equipment treatments using Bazrsazan and John Deere planters and Nordsten drill along with three crust breaking methods, including rolling cultivator, rolling-type crust breaker and no crust breaking, were {{laid out in a}} factorial experiment within a randomized complete block design with three replications. Planters’ performance was evaluated by measuring the number of plants and plant spacings in each treatment, and estimation of the mean and standard deviation, multiples index, miss index, quality of feed index, precision, and hill-dropping index. Although the plant spacings, and not the seed spacings, were measured in this experiment, the indices used in this research showed the planters’ performance to be very satisfactory. The suggested hill-dropping index showed the multiple seeds dropping characteristics of the seeders to be better than those of the multiples index regardless of the crust breaking methods. In the non-crust breaking method, the multiple seeds dropping tendency of Bazrsazan planter brought about a reduction in the mean and standard deviation of plant spacings. Crost breaking caused a reduction in plant spacings for all seeders, especially for the drill whose multiple seeds dropping tendency was negligible.

The present {{work was}} accomplished {{to develop a}} punch planter to sow corn seeds in no-tillage system, and also to evaluate the performance of its <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> and delivery systems. First of all, a requirement list was established, that the machine would have to attend. Next, the conceptual and the embodiment designs of the machine was made. Then, the detailed design of all machine parts was made and a prototype was constructed. In a testing bench {{the performance of the}} <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> unit and its seed delivery system was assessed in relation to the punch wheel speed and the quantity of punches on the wheel. The statistical design was in random blocks arranged in sub-divided plots with the main plot made of 6, 9 and 12 punches and the sub-plot made of four rotational speeds of the punch wheel, corresponding to the travel speeds of 4, 6, 8 and 10 km h- 1. Generally, the increase in velocity and {{the increase in the number}} of punches in the punch wheel decreased the number of doubles and increased the number of missing seeds; however the decrease in number of doubles was not significant compared to the increase in the number of errors. The punch planter had a satisfactory performance, with a global mean of 91 % for normal seed selection and delivery...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} planters {{equipped with}} different attachments were tested during field evaluations for continuous production of corn (Zea may L.) : Buffalo Till-planter, John Deere MaxEmerge planter, MaxEmerge Conservation planter, and rotary-tiller slot planter. The attachments tested on the MaxEmerge planter included: free-rolling coulter, powered coulter and trash-whipper. The functional {{performance of a}} planter (including population control, spacing control, depth control, and seedbed preparation) was evaluated;Buffalo Till-planter made a cleanly tilled seedbed with strips of residue windrowed between the rows. But the slippage of gauge wheel which powers the metering system may change with different soil and residue conditions. No trouble was encountered when operating the MaxEmerge planter in a no-till ridge field. A lower emergence rate, however, was found when compared with MaxEmerge planter with an attachment. The trash may affect the function of power coulter, when the field is under wet and heavy residue conditions. The rotary-tiller slot planter was a trouble-free planter under heavy trash conditions, but the planter needs to be redesigned for a better <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> system;The effect of residue quantity on planter function, corn growth and yield was not significant in 1983 season. There are larger average corn grain yield differences between years than between planter treatments. This shows the overriding importance of temperature and rainfall on corn production...|$|R

The main part of the thesis is publishing a 2 -years-old results of the year 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15, which have been obtained from the small-plot experiments realized on the experimental land of the Faculty of Agriculture of The University of South Bohemia. Three kinds of varieties in a reduced and optimal seed quantity were included in these experiments: line (Remmy), hybrid (H 906699) and variety PX 104. The optimal seed quantity was 50 <b>seeds</b> per square <b>meter</b> for a hybrid and PX 104 varieties and 60 <b>seeds</b> per square <b>meter</b> for a line variety. Reduced seed quantity was 33 <b>seeds</b> per square <b>meter</b> for the hybrid and PX 104 varieties and 40 <b>seeds</b> per square <b>meter</b> for the line variety. Three types of applications of the azole preparations were tested for each variety and seed quantity: the first control, the second - treatment in the autumn, the third option - treatments in the autumn and spring. All variants were realized in four repetitions. During the experiments it was observed the influence on the yield of seeds, weight of thousand seeds, percentage of oil, number of plants per square meter and content of the nitrogen compounds in the rapeseed meal. The highest increase of the yield (amounting to 0, 94 t/ha) was recorded in 2014 in the variant of a hybrid variety with a density of 33 plants per square meter with autumn and spring application of growth regulators (control 6, 82 t/ha, autumn + spring treatment by plant growth regulators - 7, 76 t/ha). Similar results were achieved in 2015. In conclusion, it may be said that azole preparations achieve the best results in sparse stands of winter rapeseed...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of a seeding machine {{is to put}} seeds at a desired depth and spacing within the row. Seed spacing uniformity {{is one of the}} most important criteria in evaluating planter performance. Therefore, the objective of this research work was to develop an opt-electronic monitoring system for assessment of a mechanical planter <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> unit performance. The developed system was used to monitor seed flow and to measure seed spacing from the metering system of the row crop planter. The developed system comprised of an optoelectronic sensor for seeds detection, a rotary encoder for forward speed and seed position measurement, amplifiers for adjusting sensors signals, a microcontroller for synchronizing sensors signals, and a PC for operating the program and displaying process. The developed system has been successfully tested on chickpeas seeds at two operating speeds (1. 3 m/s and 1. 9 m/s). Both numbers and locations of the dropped seeds were assessed. The results indicated that the developed system can be accurately used to detect seeds flow from the metering system with overall system errors of ± 4 % and ± 10 % for speeds of 1. 3 m/s and 1. 9 m/s, respectively, compared to manual measurements. Further extensive testing on different crops under actual field conditions are highly recommended to ensure reliability of the developed system...|$|R
5000|$|Explosive {{dehiscence}} is a ballistic form of dispersal that flings seeds or spores {{far from}} the parent plant. This rapid plant movement can achieve limited dispersal without the assistance of animals. A notable example is the sandbox tree (Hura crepitans), which can fling <b>seeds</b> 100 <b>meters</b> (300 ft) and {{has been called the}} [...] "Dynamite tree" [...] due to the loud sound of its explosive dehiscence. Another example is Impatiens, whose explosive dehiscence is triggered by being touched, leading it to be called the [...] "touch-me-not."

The dynamic characteristics among the population collision process for the vibration process of the seeder were analyzed by tracing the microcosmic motion of each seed. The following conclusions were concluded, including the relationship between population velocity, phase angle as well as coefficient of restitution and the vibration intensity, {{the relationship between the}} center-of-gravity position as well as volume expansion coefficient of the population after collision and the vibration period, the relationship between the center-of-gravity position as well as volume expansion coefficient of the population after collision and the vibration frequency. This provides basis for determining the vibration work parameters of the precise vibration seeder. Based on agricultural machinery design experience and air-suction vibration principles, a new test bench for precise vibration air-suction tray <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> device was researched by electromechanical integration technology. Performance test was carried out with oilseed rape seeds as the research object. The test results show that when the vibration frequency is 10. 5 Hz, the vibration amplitude is 4 mm, the vacuum negative pressure value is 3 kPa, the rotating velocity of the discharge plate is near 15 r/min, the pass index of the seeder will exceed 96 %, which provides basis for the structural adjustment and work parameter optimization of the seeder...|$|R

50|$|Drilling is {{the term}} used for the {{mechanised}} sowing of an agricultural crop. Traditionally, a seed drill used to consist of a hopper filled with seeds arranged above a series of tubes that can be set at selected distances from each other to allow optimum growth of the resulting plants. Seeds are spaced out using fluted paddles which rotate using a geared drive {{from one of the}} drill's land wheels—seed rate is altered by changing gear ratios. Most modern drills use air to convey seed in plastic tubes from the seed hopper to the coulters—it is an arrangement which allows seed drills to be much wider than the seed hopper—as much as 12 m wide in some cases. The <b>seed</b> is <b>metered</b> mechanically into an air stream created by a hydraulically powered on-board fan and conveyed initially to a distribution head which sub-divides the seed into the pipes taking the seed to the individual coulters.|$|R
