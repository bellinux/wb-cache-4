5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to limited animation, studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker <b>similarly</b> <b>explained</b> that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E
5|$|The Via Panisperna boys {{also noticed}} some unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to work}} better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, {{so he decided to}} try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood <b>similarly</b> <b>explained</b> the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{explored}} top–down modulation {{of spatial}} frequency (SF) processing. When auditory pre-cueing directed observers’ attention {{to one of}} two 4 -octaves (SF) apart plaid components observers tended to perceive the cued component, suggesting selective attention to the SF channel they expected to carry task relevant information. In agreement, pre-cueing had no effect with components often processed by the same channel (0. 5 -octaves apart). Further, effects of expectancy were greater than of uncertainty and were SF tuned. Combined our findings suggest top–down modulation of early, cortical, SF processing. We argue this could <b>similarly</b> <b>explain</b> the previously reported influences of categorisation on SF processing...|$|R

Although Darwin himself observed that inbred features of fancy pigeons were inherited in accordance with Mendel's laws (although Darwin didn't actually know about Mendel's ideas when he made the observation), it was not obvious that these features selected by fancy pigeon breeders can <b>similarly</b> <b>explain</b> quantitative variation in nature.|$|R

2500|$|Observed {{patterns}} of diversity can be <b>similarly</b> <b>explained</b> by MTE. [...] It {{has long been}} observed {{that there are more}} small species than large species. [...] In addition, there are more species in the tropics than at higher latitudes. [...] Classically, the latitudinal gradient in species diversity has been explained by factors such as higher productivity or reduced seasonality. [...] In contrast, MTE explains this pattern as being driven by the kinetic constraints imposed by temperature on metabolism. [...] The rate of molecular evolution scales with metabolic rate, such that organisms with higher metabolic rates show a higher rate of change at the molecular level. [...] If a higher rate of molecular evolution causes increased speciation rates, then adaptation and ultimately speciation may occur more quickly in warm environments and in small bodied species, ultimately explaining observed {{patterns of}} diversity across body size and latitude.|$|E

60|$|Butterflies present {{us with a}} {{wonderful}} amount of sexual difference of colour, in many cases so remarkable that the two sexes {{of the same species}} remained for many years under different names and were thought to be quite distinct species. We find, however, every gradation from perfect identity to complete diversity, and in some cases we are able to see a reason for this difference. Beginning with the most extraordinary cases of diversity--as in Diadema misippus, where the male is black, ornamented with a large white spot on each wing margined with rich changeable blue, while the female is orange-brown with black spots and stripes--we find the explanation {{in the fact that the}} female mimics an uneatable Danais, and thus gains protection while laying its eggs on low plants in company with that insect. In the allied species, Diadema bolina, the females are also very different from the males, but are of dusky brown tints, evidently protective and very variable, some specimens having a general resemblance to the uneatable Euplaeas; so that we see here some of the earlier stages of both forms of protection. The remarkable differences in some South American Pieridae are <b>similarly</b> <b>explained.</b> The males of Pieris pyrrha, P. lorena, and several others, are white with a few black bands and marginal spots like so many of their allies, while the females are gaily coloured with yellow and brown, and exactly resemble some species of the uneatable Heliconidae of the same district. Similarly, in the Malay Archipelago, the female of Diadema anomala is glossy metallic blue, while the male is brown; the reason for this reversal of the usual rule being, that the female exactly mimics the brilliant colouring of the common and uneatable Euplaea midamus, and thus secures protection. In the fine Adolias dirtea, the male is black with a few specks of ochre-yellow and a broad marginal band of rich metallic greenish-blue, while the female is brownish-black entirely covered with rows of ochre-yellow spots. This latter coloration does not appear to be protective when the insect is seen in the cabinet, but it really is so. I have observed the female of this butterfly in Sumatra, where it settles on the ground in the forest, and its yellow spots so harmonise with the flickering gleams of sunlight on the dead leaves that it can only be detected with the greatest difficulty.|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{production}} in anoxic wetland rice soils {{is a major}} source of atmospheric CH 4, the most important non-CO 2 greenhouse gas. Much higher CH 4 emissions from well managed irrigated rice fields in the wet than in the dry season could not be explained by seasonal differences in temperature. We hypothesized that high CH 4 emissions in the wet season are caused by low grain to biomass ratios. In a screenhouse experiment, removing spikelets to reduce the plants' capacity to store photosynthetically fixed C in grains increased CH 4 emissions, presumably via extra C inputs to the soil. Unfavorable conditions for spikelet formation in the wet season may <b>similarly</b> <b>explain</b> high methane emissions. The observed relationship between reduced grain filling and CH 4 emission provides opportunities to mitigate CH 4 emissions by optimizing rice productivity...|$|R

40|$|People {{differ in}} their ability to {{perceive}} second language (L 2) sounds.

40|$|A venerable idea in {{the history}} of moral {{philosophy}} is that central among the normative notions is the notion of goodness or value. This idea, which can be found at least as early as 1903 in G. E. Moore’s Principia Ethica, claims that goodness is central in that all other normative notions can be explained in terms of it. Moore’s approach and the dominant approach to the project of explaining the normative notions of rightness and what we have reason to do is the consequentialist program. While the most famous element of this program is the consequentialist moral theory that says an act is right (i. e., permissible) just in case the outcome of that act is at least as good as the outcome of any alternative act, the consequentialist program in general hopes to <b>similarly</b> <b>explain</b> the notion of a reason in terms of goodness.

40|$|Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a client-centered, {{directive}} {{approach for}} behavior change.

MI and SDT somewhat <b>similarly</b> <b>explain</b> what most importantly determines client motivation for change in-session. However, SDT mainly focus on psychological needs such as fostering client autonomy, and MI focus on the therapeutic alliance and on generating client change talk in-session.

40|$|Most {{regions of}} the tropics are poorly sampled by {{conventional}} meteorological measurements. Thus, direct inferences of the mesoscale climatology of many tropical locations is difficult, especially those in mountainous areas. <b>Similarly,</b> <b>explaining</b> the atmospheric dynamics associated with the observed mesoclimatology is likewise not simple. One such region with a poorly understood mesoclimatology is the altiplano region of South America.

40|$|Three {{features}} of avian sex chromosomes - female heterogamety (ZZ male, ZW female), the apparently inactive {{state of the}} W chromosome, and dose-dependent expression of Z-linked genes - are examined in regard to their possible relation to sex determination. It is proposed that the W chromosome is facultatively heterochromatic and that the Z and W chromosomes carry one or more homologous sex-determination genes. The absence of dosage compensation in ZZ embryos, and W inactivation in ZW embryos, would then bring about a 2 n(ZZ) -n(ZW) inequality in the effective copy number of such genes. The absence of dosage compensation of Z-linked genes in ZZ embryos {{is viewed as a}} means by which two copies of Z-W homologous sex determination genes are kept active to meet the requirements of testis determination. W inactivation may promote ovarian development by reducing the effective copy number of these genes from 2 n to n.
