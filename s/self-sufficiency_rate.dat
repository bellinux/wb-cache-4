30|$|All {{the grain}} product <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> {{are lower than}} 90 % in the BAU 2050 scenario, while rice, wheat, and the other grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> are {{expected}} to improve to 100, 104, and 98 %, respectively for a grain tariff increase in 2050. The <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> for all the grain products {{are likely to be}} above government targets under the grain tariff increased scenario by 2050. Generally speaking, a grain tariff reduction does not have significant effects on <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates,</b> while a grain tariff increase raises China’s grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> considerably. On its own, self-sufficiency is not a perfect food security indictor. To fully access a country’s food security status, the government also needs to take private consumption levels and food prices into consideration.|$|R
30|$|The {{rice and}} wheat <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> have been {{improved}} to target {{levels in the}} CAM 2030 scenario (Table  5). The <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> for rice and wheat are expected to reach 95.10 and 95.51 % in 2030, respectively. Other grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> are likely to increase from 92.09 % in the BAU 2030 scenario to 93.93 % in the CAM 2030 scenario. For 2050, the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> for rice, wheat, and other grains are expected to reach 90.34, 93.58, and 87.67 %, respectively. As expected, meat import expansion is helpful to free more natural resources to rice and wheat sectors from feed grain production. Compared to the BAU 2030 scenario, Korea’s free trade in meat does not change China’s grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> in both 2030 and 2050. This results because Korea accounts for a relatively small share of China’s meat export share in 2030; therefore, its trade policy impacts on China’s grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> are negligible.|$|R
30|$|For 2050, the {{positive}} effects of the meat tariff reduction policy are more obvious. The <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> for rice and wheat in the BAU 2050 scenario are much lower than government food security targets, while in the MTR 2050 scenario, both of the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> are above 90 %. In general, a meat tariff reduction is likely to enhance the grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> in all projection periods.|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} that China’s {{government}} agencies are particularly interested in certain variables, such as arable land requirements in 2050 under 95 and 90 % <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates,</b> and grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> for the same year. Thus these are the key food security variables {{from the perspective of}} China’s government.

For the other model variables, the projections are made to 2030.|$|R

30|$|Agricultural {{and trade}} policy {{impacts on the}} Chinese economy were {{estimated}} for this study. The MTR (meat tariff reduction) {{seems to have a}} greater impact on China’s food security than the GTR (grain tariff reduction). With respect to the MTR, outputs of rice and wheat are expected to increase substantially, thus the grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> are expected to improve by 2030 and to be above 90 % in 2050. The GTR scenario produces few positive effects on grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> and agricultural trade values, while there is a marginal negative impact on society welfare. Compared with the GTR, a GTI (grain tariff increase) is expected to raise the grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> considerably for both 2030 and 2050. In 2030, with the GTI policy, the rice and wheat <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> are expected to increase to 98.8 and 97.2 % in 2030, respectively. All the grain product <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> are estimated to be over 95 % in 2050. However, national food prices are expected to increase and private food consumption is expected to decline. The poor food buyers will be mostly affected, since the food is unaffordable, possibly resulting in an increase in the incidence of malnourishment. In this study, we have captured the impact of two recent free trade agreements signed by China. The CAM (China–Australia meat free trade agreement) results in greater positive effects on China’s food security than the CKM (China–Korea meat free trade agreement). CAM results indicate an increase in private consumption and a decrease in food prices, while the CKM appears to present the opposite results. In the case of a mandated rate of growth for rice (MRG) and a mandated rate of growth for wheat (MWG), it appears that these are effective in encouraging an improvement in the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> of the grain target policy. These policies also reveal a substantial increment in output levels. Wages of unskilled labor and national welfare under both policies are likely to increase. These impacts will also help to reduce food prices and stimulate food consumption. Factor returns to unskilled labor are also expected to increase considerably.|$|R

30|$|The {{results show}} that a grain tariff {{reduction}} does not have significant effects on grain self-sufficiency rates. However, for a grain tariff increase, the self-sufficiency rates for all grain commodities appear to indicate a considerable increase in 2030 and 2050. For instance, the rice <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> {{is expected to increase}} from 95.05 to 98.81 % in 2030. Wheat has similar results. In 2030, the wheat <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> is 93.82 % for the BAU in 2030, while it is expected to increase to 97.26 % for the grain tariff increase in 2030. The other grain product <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> is expected to be higher {{than it is in the}} BAU scenario as well. In 2030, compared with the BAU, the other grain’s <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> is expected to increase by about 3.75 % if the grain tariff increases by 50 %.|$|E
30|$|The {{gap between}} {{production}} and consumption for corn will grow gradually; therefore, the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> of other grain is likely to fall at the fastest rate. Since feed uses and industry uses are expected to grow at a rapid rate, corn’s domestic demand will increase much faster than its domestic supply. In the year 2050, all grain products are expected to fall below the government targets. Rice self-sufficiency will be only 82.25 % and wheat <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> will be just 84.97 %, whereas corn self-sufficiency will be less than 80 %.|$|E
40|$|Being {{a member}} of the EU, today the Czech Republic is not entirely {{dependent}} on domestic production of food and farming commodities.

30|$|According to {{projected}} {{results from}} this study, a meat import tariff reduction scenario is likely to improve grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> along with domestic food consumption which could possibly culminate in a decrease in food prices. Even though China’s welfare is expected to decrease under the MTR scenario, meat tariff reduction still helps China’s government to achieve its grain security target and enhance domestic food consumption. Lowering food prices in the MTR 2030 scenario lead to food being more accessible to the poorer sections. Grain tariff adjustments {{are expected to have}} little effect on China’s welfare. Grain tariff reductions are helpful in improving food accessibility, but they are not helpful in improving grain’s <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates.</b> On the other hand, an increasing grain tariff policy is expected to meet the government’s grain self-sufficiency targets, but the domestic food consumption will decrease and food prices will subsequently rise. Therefore, if the government aims to safeguard grain self-sufficiency by increasing grain import tariffs, it appears harmful to the goal of e national food security. Unlike the free trade meat agreement with Korea (CKM), a reduced meat import tariff for Australia is expected to bring more benefits to China’s food security. China is expected to increase the majority of its agricultural commodities’ output levels, improve grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates,</b> gain welfare, decrease food prices and increase private food consumption levels with the CAM scenario. In addition, the CAM scenario is helpful for poverty alleviation in China. Conversely, the China–Korea free trade meat agreement is not expected to benefit China’s food security, even though China’s meat exports will be stimulated. Mandated grain growth rates could be expected to have significant positive impact on important food security indicators. In addition, the policies appear to be beneficial for national welfare for both MRG and MWG scenarios.|$|R

30|$|Wheat was an {{important}} crop that grew in many counties of Taiwan in 1960 s. Due {{to the impact of}} world trade, wheat production and plantation areas have shrunk dramatically over the years. There were only limited areas in central Taiwan growing wheat for malt production in the past 40  years. In recent years, the acreages of wheat were gradually increased from central Taiwan to southern and northern Taiwan because of the advocacy of eating locally grown crops and a governmental policy of raising food <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates.</b> In an informal survey, Fusarium head blight (FHB) was found to be prevalent in many counties after the anthesis stage of wheat (Kuo et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} of this study indicates that to attain China’s grain security target in 2030 and 2050, the country must preserve and even increase its grain production areas through restrictions on the conversion of arable land for other purposes. This is because the simple preservation of existing arable land, through policies such as the “Red Line” policy, seems incapable of maintaining grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> at the target level by 2030 and 2050. The government should also encourage the reclamation of abandoned residential areas so that the land can once again be used for food production. Rural governments should strictly define and enforce land use rights. Well-defined land use rights will result in a sound land market, as well as promoting a rational allocation of land resources.|$|R
30|$|China’s food {{production}} capacity is {{constrained by the}} limited availability of land and water resources (Zhou 2010), and its agricultural productivity is 46 % of the average world productivity value. However, rapid income growth and a large population base {{have led to a}} substantial domestic demand for agricultural commodities. As a result, China’s agricultural trade deficit has been rising for some years now. This is particularly true for grain products, as China became a net importer of grain in 2010, and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Thus it puts pressure on China’s food security target of 95 % for rice and wheat <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates.</b> Given China’s large and growing population, the attainment of food security appears to be a national and global issue. In this backdrop, the current study objective is to investigate China’s food security situation in 2030 and investigate the impacts of alternative policies on food security.|$|R
30|$|The {{results from}} this study suggest that China is {{expected}} to achieve a grain self-sufficiency level of a little above 90 % by the year 2030, but less than 90 % by the year 2050. Without any policy intervention in the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> for rice is expected to be 82.25 % and for wheat the rate will be 84.97 % by 2050. The total value of agricultural imports and exports are expected to increase substantially. In addition, the current “Red Line” arable land protection policy (1800 million mu) is determined to be insufficient to allow for the production of enough grain by the year 2030 to meet the desired 95 % <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate.</b> Moreover, {{it is not enough to}} meet 90 % (2727.495 million mu) and 95 % (2879.022 million mu) self-sufficiency rates by the year 2050. Study results indicate that arable land should be strictly protected for food production against pressure from industrialization and urbanization. However, it is only part of the food security solution. Therefore, policy interventions are crucial to ensure that China’s food security targets are met.|$|E
30|$|According to the BAU results analyses, {{without any}} {{agricultural}} productivity advancement, China {{is unable to}} achieve its grain self-sufficiency targets in 2030 and 2050. In addition, the current “Red Line” policy {{is not enough to}} produce sufficient grain to meet the 95 % grain <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, the arable land conservation policy should be strengthened, but it is just partial solution. Meanwhile, other agricultural policy alternatives, such as agricultural trade policy and agricultural support policy, should be attempted to improve food security.|$|E
30|$|If the {{government}} sets a mandated growth {{rate for the}} wheat sector, the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rate</b> for wheat is likely to improve by 29.18 % for 2030 and 37.99 % for 2050, which are above {{the government}}’s wheat security target. However, the opposite results are shown {{for the rest of}} the grain sectors. The self-sufficiency rates for rice and other grains are likely to decrease by 1.01 and 1.92 % for 2030, respectively. For 2050, the self-sufficiency rates for both rice and other grain products are expected to decline by 1.03 % in the MWG 2050 scenario.|$|E
30|$|From 2020 to 2030, rice’s {{output is}} {{expected}} to increase by 42 %, and its consumption is estimated to rise by 47 %; therefore, the rice deficit is projected to increase substantially from 2.88 million tons in 2020 to 15.118 million tons in 2030. The rice deficit is estimated to be even larger in 2050. Similarly, the wheat demand (124.28 million tons) in 2013 {{is expected to}} increase to 246.7 million tons (98 %) in 2030 and 359.876 million tons (190 %) in 2050, respectively. Demand is expected to grow faster than supply, so the wheat deficit will keep increasing throughout the projection years. The deficit is likely to be 15.12 million tons, and 54.08 million tons in 2030 and 2050 respectively. The current study shows the corn deficit 10 to be about 11.057 million tons, 37.536 million tons, and 310.664 million tons in 2020, 2030, and 2050, respectively. The results indicate that corn accounts for the majority of grain imports in the future. Corn is not a dominant staple food for China, but it is major feed crop. As income grows, demand for meat and livestock products bring substantial pressure on corn demand. <b>Self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> for oil seeds, vegetable oils, and fats are expected to decrease over the projection periods. The results are also consistent with other studies’ results.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the legal forms adopted by microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their performance within three scopes: financial performance, social performance, and efficiency in resource allocation. The MFIs studied are classified into four groups: banks, non-governmental organizations, cooperatives, and a fourth group formed of for-profit institutions not characterized as banks, made up of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and rural banks. The data used are annual and cover the six years from 2007 to 2012. The quantitative regression model with panel data was used together with dummy variables to compare between the four groups of legal forms, except for the group made up of NBFIs and rural banks, which was not represented by any dummy variable. 304 MFIs from 59 countries made up the sample. In the study it was observed that larger MFIs have higher profits, higher returns, and higher operational <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>rates</b> than smaller MFIs, indicating that MFI growth could enable consolidation in the microfinance market. The results also indicate that for smaller MFIs the way to consolidate and improve the indicators could be through assimilating or merging with other MFIs. It was also noted that non-bank financial institutions and rural banks are able to serve more customers and that cooperatives provide smaller loans, causing a bigger social impact, and that they obtain higher returns and profits. The results indicate that these legal forms may be the most appropriate for the microfinance market...|$|R
