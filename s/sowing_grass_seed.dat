Restoring savannas from woodlands can involve tree thinning, but often the herbaceous understory is non-existent and potential seed sources may be distant. In a blackjack oak - post oak savanna restoration in the Cross Timbers ecosystem of southeast Kansas, I examined whether 1) seed addition enhances native grass establishment and 2) spatial heterogeneity created by oak canopies modifies {{the relationship between}} <b>seed</b> addition and <b>grass</b> establishment. In March 2009 after tree thinning earlier that winter, I <b>sowed</b> Indian <b>grass</b> (Sorghastrum nutans) and Switch <b>grass</b> (Panicum virgatum) <b>seeds</b> at four densities (0, 50, 250 and 1000 seeds) in 0. 5 m X 0. 5 m plots at oak canopy edges and between canopies. Results/Conclusions In the third growing season after sowing (2011), the proportion of plots with S. nutans present was significantly greater under all levels of seed addition than without seed addition. For P. virgatum, addition of 250 seeds and 1000 seeds / 0. 5 m X 0. 5 m plot resulted in a significantly higher proportion of plots with P. virgatum present than did no seed addition. Nevertheless, cover and tiller densities of both grasses remained low (mean values < 5. 5 % cover and < 16 tillers / 0. 5 m 2 for 1000 seeds added). For Indian <b>grass,</b> <b>sowing</b> 1000 <b>seeds</b> increased cover and tiller density over no seed addition controls. For Switch <b>grass,</b> <b>sowing</b> 1000 <b>seeds</b> increased cover, but not tiller density. Lower sowing densities did not significantly increase cover or tiller density.

While seed addition was effective in overcoming seed limitation of native grass establishment, any large differences in cover of the added native <b>grasses</b> between <b>seed</b> <b>sowing</b> densities are likely to develop gradually because clones of these grass species expand slowly.

60|$|A {{piece of}} waste, swampy land was enclosed, drained, ploughed, harrowed and thickly {{covered in the}} year 1822 with burnt marl and cinders. It was <b>sowed</b> with <b>grass</b> <b>seeds,</b> and now {{supports}} a tolerably good but coarse pasture. Holes were dug in this field in 1837, or 15 years after its reclamation, and {{we see in the}} accompanying diagram (Fig. 5), reduced to half of the natural scale, that the turf was 1 inch thick, beneath which there was a layer of vegetable mould 2.5 inches thick. This layer did not contain fragments of any kind; but beneath it there was a layer of mould, 1.5 inch in thickness, full of fragments of burnt marl, conspicuous from their red colour, one of which near the bottom was an inch in length; and other fragments of coal-cinders together with a few white quartz pebbles. Beneath this layer and at a depth of 4.5 inches from the surface, the original black, peaty, sandy soil with a few quartz pebbles was encountered. Here therefore the fragments of burnt marl and cinders had been covered in the course of 15 years by a layer of fine vegetable mould, only 2.5 inches in thickness, excluding the turf. Six and a half years subsequently this field was re-examined, and the fragments were now found at from 4 to 5 inches beneath the surface. So that in this interval of 6.5 years, about 1.5 inch of mould had been added to the superficial layer. I am surprised that a greater quantity had not been brought up during the whole 21.5 years, for in the closely underlying black, peaty soil there were many worms. It is, however, probable that formerly, whilst the land remained poor, worms were scanty; and the mould would then have accumulated slowly. The average annual increase of thickness for the whole period is 0.19 of an inch.|$|R

Second, we evaluated the economic loss of gross margin when replacing crop by grass. Third, we evaluated the weed risk using flora surveys in <b>sown</b> <b>grass</b> strips.

30|$|The average {{farm size}} under fodder {{production}} {{in the study area}} varied between the fodder producer groups and the individual producers. Five acres (2 ha) and 16 acres (6.4 ha) were the minimum and maximum land sizes under fodder production for the groups, respectively, while half an acre (0.2 ha) and 17 acres (6.8 ha) were the minimum and maximum land sizes under fodder production for the individual fodder producers, respectively. The main fodder production practices in the study area were broadcasting as the main method of <b>sowing</b> <b>grass.</b> The farmers never irrigate nor do they apply fertilizer on the pastures. Weeding was done at four to six weeks after planting. The <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> were harvested using the stripping method after flowering when the seeds’ colour changed from green to light brown. This method of harvesting is common among the fodder farmers in the semi-arid rangelands of Kenya (Mnene 2006). Individual fodder producers used both family and hired labour in their production, while the groups collectively provided labour and only hired labour when the amount of work was overwhelming and needed to be accomplished quickly. Hired labour was mainly used in weed control and <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> harvesting and cost Kshs. 100  (USD 1.12) per day per individual, while the wage for harvesting <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> ranged between Kshs. 50  (USD 0.56) and Kshs. 150  (USD 1.69) per day.

Where this technique has been used, degraded land has been brought back into production and where existing fields have benefitted from the bunds, yields of sorghum have increased by about 40 per cent. Under the Machobane system in Lesotho, a mixture of crops are grown and relay planting spreads the crops throughout the year. This helps to minimize losses in times of drought.
