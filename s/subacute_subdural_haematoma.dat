40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-traumatic acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> enable {{study of}} the {{morbidity}} and mortality due to the haematoma without the effect of trauma. Whereas {{it is known that}} coagulation disorders worsen the outcome of spontaneous intracerebral haematomas, this has not been studied in non-traumatic acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas.</b> METHODS: In a series of 13 non-traumatic acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> admitted to our department between January 1995 and March 2002, we had 9 coagulopathy associated haematomas and 3 haematomas corresponding to the syndrome of 'spontaneous acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma</b> of arterial origin'. Both groups were compared. FINDINGS: Age and gender distribution were comparable. The bleeding source was a cortical artery in 2 of the 2 non-coagulopathy related haematomas operated on, but also in 2 of the 4 coagulopathy associated haematomas that underwent surgery. The average haematoma thickness was higher in the coagulopathy related haematomas. The mean Glasgow Coma Score on admission was 7. 7 and the mortality rate was 55. 6 % in the coagulopathy related group. In the non-coagulopathy related haematomas the mean Glasgow Coma Score was 12. 0 and the mortality rate 33. 3 %. The latter mortality rate corresponds well to that of a historical group of 'spontaneous acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> of arterial origin' collected from the literature. INTERPRETATION: The outcome was worse in the non-traumatic acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> that were associated with a coagulation deficiency. While in all non-traumatic acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> the interval to surgery should be minimized, early recognition and urgent correction of coagulation deficiencies is certainly indicated. status: publishe...|$|R

There was a history of loss of consciousness and headache. However, on an initial examination, the patient was alert. A multi-detector CT (MDCT) examination of the head was performed. A reconstructed coronal view of an MDCT scan demonstrated the presence of a small acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma</b> in the right high fronto-parietal convexity (figure 1). A coronal view not only facilitates visualisation of a <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma</b> but also is useful for the evaluation of other high-convexity lesions such as parasagittal meningiomas and mass lesions adjacent to the tentorium and the base of the skull. 1 Based on previous CTexaminations, difficulty in the detection of <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> with conventional transaxial view images has been noted. 1 Recently, MDCT has been utilised to reconstruct coronal view images without additional cost or time and without a limitation of scanning position.

40|$|From January 1981 to June 1986 116 {{patients}} with anticoagulation-related intracranial haemorrhage {{were referred to}} hospital. Seventy six of these haemorrhages were extracerebral, 69 were in the subdural and seven in the subarachnoid space. No epidural haemorrhages were identified. Compared with non-anticoagulation-related haematomas, the risk of haemorrhage was calculated to be increased fourfold in men and thirteenfold in women. An acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma,</b> mostly due to contusion, was more frequently accompanied by an additional intracerebral haematoma than a chronic <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma.</b> Trauma was a more important factor in acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> than in chronic.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{epidural}} and <b>subdural</b> <b>haematomas</b> remain {{among the}} most common causes of mortality and disability resulting from traumatic brain injury. In {{the last three decades}} improvements in rescue, neuromonitoring and intensive care have led to better outcomes.

METHODS: A total of 76 consecutive patients who underwent emergency craniotomy for acute traumatic epidural and <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma</b> at University Hospital Bern between January 2000 and December 2003 were included in this study. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients presented with an epidural haematoma and 46 with a <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma.</b> In seven patients both haematomas could be documented. The median age was 54 years (IQR 28). The median initial GCS score was 7 (IQR 6). The median time from primary injury to surgery was 3 hours (IQR 2. 5 hours). The median stay in the ICU was 3 days (IQR: 3 days). The outcome was favourable (GOS 4 and 5) in 43 patients (57 %). Thirteen patients (17 %) remained severely or moderately disabled (GOS 3). Finally, a total of 21 patients (28 %) died or remained in a persistent vegetative state (GOS 1 and 2). Mortality was 41 % for acute <b>subdural</b> <b>haematoma</b> (19 / 46) and 3 % (1 / 37) for patients with epidural haematoma.
