5|$|Ashlawn, {{named for}} the ash trees that once <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the house, {{is also known as}} the Joshua Perkins House, after its first owner.|$|E
25|$|Later exchanges {{consisted}} {{of one to}} several hundred plug boards staffed by switchboard operators. Each operator <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a vertical panel containing banks of ¼-inch tip-ring-sleeve (3-conductor) jacks, each {{of which was the}} local termination of a subscriber's telephone line. In front of the jack panel lay a horizontal panel containing two rows of patch cords, each pair connected to a cord circuit.|$|E
25|$|Sebastiana Godoy Agostini {{traveled}} to New York with her husband, but sadly {{died of cancer}} the year after her arrival. Her sister, Carmela Godoy Agostini, had accompanied the couple to New York {{to take care of}} Sebastiana Godoy Agostini during her long illness. In 1922, two years after Sebastiana Godoy Agostini's untimely death, Alomía Robles wed Carmela Godoy Agostini, going on to sire two more children, Armando and Mario, bringing his total to twelve. Marcela Robles writes that her grandmother Carmela Godoy Agostini supported the family during the Depression in New York City by selling paper flowers while Alomía Robles <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his piano pursuing his music indifferent to his surroundings.|$|E
60|$|Winston {{dismissed}} {{the man and}} <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Courthorne.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it, {{and gave}} it the {{thoughtful}} once-over.|$|R
60|$|So, down she sat {{upon the}} ground, and Harry <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her.|$|R
25|$|The Do 32 was {{structurally}} very simple, with {{a square}} section, tapering fuselage behind the pilot. The BMW 6012L turbine and compressor {{were placed on}} top of the fuselage, immediately behind the rotor pylon. Its exhaust impinged upon a large rectangular rudder, built to resist thermal stresses, for yaw control. The horizontal tailplane was swept. The pilot <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the rotor pylon, on a simple seat, carried on the lower longerons. He controlled the plane of the two-bladed rotor directly with a long curved hanging arm, and its pitch with a conventional collective pitch lever by his left side. The rudder pedals were almost straight {{out in front of him}} on a strut that also carried, beyond his feet, some simple instruments. This member also formed part of the simple three-legged undercarriage, each strut ending with an unsprung foot.|$|E
25|$|The hull was a two-step design {{using the}} Linton Hope {{construction}} method. This used {{a system of}} circular formers separated by stringers {{and covered with a}} double layer of 0.125in (3.2mm) mahogany strips, the second at right angles to the first. This allowed the construction of smooth curved surfaces. The Pellet was a single-bay biplane without stagger and was often described as a sesquiplane because the lower wing was not only of smaller span but also of smaller chord. The lower wing was mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage and carried wingtip floats mounted directly below the N-type interplane struts. There was another pair of these struts between the fuselage and upper wing supporting the engine, which was mounted tractorwise above the upper wing surface in a streamlined nacelle. The engine, a 450hp (340kW) Napier Lion was cooled with radiators fitted flush in the lower surface of the upper wing. The pilot <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the propeller. At the rear of the aircraft, the braced tailplane was mounted about halfway up the single fin.|$|E
500|$|On December 12, the Doors {{played the}} Warehouse in New Orleans for {{what turned out}} to be their last live {{performance}} with Morrison. Midway through the set, a drunk Morrison began slurring the lyrics to [...] "Light My Fire", interrupted with speeches and jokes. He <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the drum platform in between Krieger and Manzarek's solos, but did not stand up to finish the song. After prompting by Densmore, he tried to sing, before bashing the mic stand into the stage until its wood splintered. The Doors agreed to stop touring and focus on completing L.A. Woman.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her. She <b>sat</b> staring <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her, making {{no attempt to}} cope with disaster.|$|R
60|$|Presently he {{came and}} <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> us, while I set out the case to him.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> staring <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> {{her at the}} {{gathering}} night. She spoke again in an even tone.|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Call the Shots" [...] {{was directed by}} Sean de Sparengo, and filmed in October 2007 in Malibu, California, while Girls Aloud were filming The Passions of Girls Aloud. The video features the girls in purple dresses performing on Malibu Beach at night with flames and white fabric surrounding them. The girls are also shown in different locations with individual story lines. Cole is simply seen looking out of a sunny window. Walsh is <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a mirror, putting on make-up; her fictional boyfriend comes to get her and they hug, though she appears to be sad. Coyle is seated on a couch, flipping through photographs featuring her and a man. She takes a lighter to the photos and sets them alight. Roberts is lying down by a swimming pool, running her fingers through the water. A young man walks up to her with {{a bouquet of flowers}} and tosses them into the water. Harding watches her boyfriend in the shower and goes through his phone. The video premiered on 17 October 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Who {{were the}} judges {{in the court}} {{described}} in [...] The Mishnah taught that the High Priest {{could serve as a}} judge.. But the King could not.. When a vacancy arose, a new judge was appointed from the first row of scholars who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the judges..|$|E
2500|$|At her 2010 MoMa retrospective, Abramović {{performed}} The Artist Is Present, {{in which}} she shared a period of silence with each stranger who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her. Although [...] "they met and talked {{the morning of the}} opening," [...] Abramović had a deeply emotional reaction to Ulay when he arrived at her performance, reaching out to him across the table between them; the video of the event went viral.|$|E
60|$|They <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a log {{fire and}} Isabel {{looked at him}} with calm grave eyes.|$|R
60|$|His wife <b>sat</b> {{straight}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, {{with her}} hands folded, and shook her head, {{and looked at him}} with an anxious air.|$|R
60|$|Presently he {{drew out}} his pipe, filled it, and <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> {{the fire to}} smoke. As he did this, a slight noise outside the cabin {{attracted}} his attention.|$|R
2500|$|Envelopes {{with the}} names Rod Serling and Victoria West {{could be found in}} both {{libraries}} at California Adventure, near the sliding wall, a reference to the episode [...] "A World of His Own". In Library 1, it stuck out of the top of the green books. In Library 2, it <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the books. The green books contained titles of selected Twilight Zone episodes. Other books in the libraries were in various languages from around the world, including German and Danish.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Forum Romanum, the Comitium was {{the first}} {{designated}} spot for all political and judicial activity and the earliest place of public assembly in the city. [...] A succession of earlier shrines and altars is mentioned in early Roman writings as the first suggestum. It consisted of a shrine to the god Volcan, that had two separate altars built at different periods. This early Etruscan mundus altar originally <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a temple that would later be converted into the Curia Hostilia.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} the writ was dropped, the Liberals stood at 50% support in the polls. Peterson's {{personal}} popularity rating based on his Meech Lake record was 54%. [...] However, his luck turned immediately upon calling the election. One of the seminal moments in the campaign was {{at a press conference}} called to announce the forthcoming election. It was soon interrupted by Greenpeace activist Gord Perks, who arrived with a briefcase handcuffed to his arm, with a tape recorder inside playing a pre-recorded list of broken Liberal environmental promises. [...] David Peterson <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the room full of reporters, awkwardly silent and clearly uncomfortable.|$|E
60|$|His voice died away. There was a silence. Mike <b>sat</b> staring miserably <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{they heard a}} car come up the drive, a servant knocked at the door, and Hallam was shown <b>in.</b> He <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the table where Osborn told him, and glanced at Kit.|$|R
60|$|Turning out at last, he <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> {{the little}} iron stove that served to cook food {{as well as}} to warm the cabin, and, gazing into the embers, began to meditate on his strangely uncomfortable sensations.|$|R
2500|$|While {{members of}} the family varied in detail, they shared the same basic design, and parts were {{interchangeable}} between them. The design featured a typical primary glider layout with a conventional empennage carried {{at the end of a}} long boom in place of a conventional fuselage. The boom could be folded sideways for storage. The monoplane wing was carried high on a pylon above this [...] "keel" [...] and was further braced to it with two struts on either side. The pilot <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the wing, and was enclosed in a simple U-shaped wooden fairing that was removed by sliding it forward to allow him or her to enter and leave the aircraft. The undercarriage consisted of a single skid underneath the [...] "keel", but this could also be fitted with small wooden wheels.|$|E
2500|$|In 1854, Bean courted a young woman, who was {{subsequently}} kidnapped {{and forced to}} marry a Mexican officer. Bean challenged the groom to a duel and killed him. Six of the dead man's friends put Bean on a horse and tied a noose around his neck, then left him to hang. The horse did not bolt, and after the men left, the bride, who had been hiding behind a tree, cut the rope. Bean was left with a permanent rope burn on his neck and a permanent stiff neck. Shortly after that, Bean chose to leave California and migrated to New Mexico to live with Sam. The latter had been elected the first sheriff of Doña Ana County. [...] In 1861 Samuel G. and Roy Bean operated a store and saloon on Main Street in Pinos Altos (just north of Silver City) in present-day Grant County, New Mexico. It advertised liquor and [...] "a fine billiard table." [...] A cannon belonging to Roy Bean <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the store for show. It was used to repel an Apache assault on the town.|$|E
60|$|By nightfall all grew anxious, and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> {{the house}} to discuss the situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I can't {{go on in}} the dark," [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Brinkley. [...] "You can't {{think in}} the dark, much less talk! Can you, Mrs. Pasmer?" [...] Mrs. Pasmer, with Alice next to her, <b>sat</b> just <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Mrs. Brinkley.|$|R
60|$|My {{friend and}} I now <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a {{comfortable}} fire, fed with logs {{from the roof}} of a neighbouring hut, but we had not chatted long before he asked me the object of my visit to headquarters.|$|R
50|$|A large bronze {{sculpture}} called Praying Hands <b>sat</b> directly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> {{the lobby}} {{with a series}} of fountains and streams headed towards the street until the summer of 1991 when it was moved to the nearby campus entrance of Oral Roberts University.|$|R
60|$|John Gayther nodded approvingly. The {{story of}} a girl was exactly what {{he would like to}} hear, {{provided}} it was told by the young lady who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{certainly}} a Christmas to remember," [...] said Shep, as they <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the fire that evening. [...] "I should {{like to know what}} the folks are doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you wish}} to see me, Rover? Very well, come right in and sit down," [...] said Captain Putnam, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his desk, making up some of his {{accounts}} for the month just past.|$|E
2500|$|According to The Seattle Times, [...] "Smith, who {{witnessed}} Sunday's incident, said it began when Corrie <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the bulldozer. He said the operator scooped {{her up with}} a pile of earth, dumped her on the ground and ran over her twice." ...|$|R
60|$|Though he {{said this}} with {{a vast amount of}} {{consideration}} for Mr Pinch's comfort, he dragged one of the great leather-bottomed chairs to the very centre of the hearth, notwithstanding; and <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the fire, with a foot on each hob.|$|R
50|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the {{television}} {{only to see}} a recording of himself in his car, pausing at the abandoned frontier buildings as he wondered what to do, and then accelerating on across as the western television company's bus passed by in the other direction.|$|R
