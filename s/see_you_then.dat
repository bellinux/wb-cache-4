"Then {{you shall}} do it to-morrow morning, good father, for I {{will come and}} <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>then.</b> But indeed I did not do more at Waverley than you would have done yourself.

She {{will be with us}} to-morrow evening; and we shall be very happy to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>then,</b> if you care to come. At nine o'clock, Herr Abendgasse, a celebrated German art critic and a great friend of mine, will read us a paper on 'The True in Art'; but I will not pay you the compliment of pretending to believe that that interests you, so you may come at ten or half-past, by which hour all the serious business of the evening will be over." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} forced to {{disappoint}} not only you, but Dr. Beddoes, on an affair of some importance. Last night I was induced by strong and joint solicitation, to go to a cardclub to which Mr. Morgan belongs, and, after the playing was over, to sup, and spend the remainder of the night: having made a previous compact, that I should not drink; however just on the verge of twelve, I was desired to drink only one wine glass of punch, in honour of the departing year; and, after twelve, one other in honour of the new year. Though the glasses were very small, yet such was the effect produced during my sleep, that I awoke unwell, and in about twenty minutes after had a relapse of my bilious complaint. I am just now recovered, and with care, I doubt not, shall be as well as ever to-morrow. If I do not <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>then,</b> it will be from some relapse, which I have no reason, thank heaven, to anticipate.|$|E
