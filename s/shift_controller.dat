Keeping low to the ground in order to trick the automatic security scanners into believing he’s a stray dog, Keefer plants incendiary pellets in the ground and then begins firing at the scanners. Within seconds, the grounds are shrouded with smoke and the overloaded scanners conclude that there is a high probability of a terrorist attack. The <b>Shift</b> <b>Controller</b> sends out three teams, but as they enter the area, the explosive pellets go off, causing further confusion. The panic-stricken Controller orders his teams to withdraw and sends in a fourth team led by security operative Sita Benovides with orders to strafe the entire area and kill whoever’s there. In the smoke and confusion, however, Keefer overpowers one of the lone guards, knocks him out and takes his uniform. When the guards are recalled to base, Keefer slips away from them and enters the spaceport terminal, unnoticed. There, he cycles tickets and refunds through the IDs and credit cards of the thugs who were sent to kill him earlier, ends up with a Class A ticket in the name of Norbert Lung, and bluffs a counter girl into letting him aboard the first flight to the Hakai Orbital Transfer Station without first checking his picture ID.|$|E

This proposed model uses a two-stage back-propagation approach including both linear and nonlinear components of calculations along with iterative training processes and a learning <b>shift</b> <b>controller.</b> The iterative training processes allow the model to gradually {{increase the number of}} hidden neurons and input data size, reusing each of the iteratively final weights as new initial weights for the next iterative training stage. A learning rate is accordingly adjusted by the learning <b>shift</b> <b>controller.</b> This training approach ensures that even the local minima of the model have low enough sumsquared errors. The average testing diagnosis accuracy of our model is 98 % for benign and malignant breast cancer. Therefore, our research results indicate that the proposed model can provide consistently high accuracy in the diagnosis and classification of benign and malignant breast cancer.

40|$|In South Africa, where 75 % of {{the worlds}} {{platinum}} is produced, electricity tariffs have increased significantly over recent years. This introduces challenges to the energy intensive mineral processing industry. Within the mineral processing chain, run-of-mine ore milling circuits are the most energy-intensive unit processes. Opportunities to reduce the operating costs associated with power consumption through process control are explored in this work. In order to reduce operating costs, demand side management was implemented on a milling circuit using load shifting. Time-of-use tariffs were exploited by shifting power consumption of the milling circuit from more expensive to cheaper tariff periods {{in order to reduce}} overall costs associated with electricity consumption. Reduced throughput during high tariff periods was recovered during low tariff periods in order to maintain milling circuit throughput over a week long horizon. In order to implement and evaluate demand side management through process control, a load <b>shifting</b> <b>controller</b> was developed for the non-linear Hulbert model. Implementation of the load <b>shifting</b> <b>controller</b> was achieved through a multi-layered control approach. A regulatory linear MPC controller was developed to address technical control requirements such as milling circuit stability. A supervisory real-time optimizer was developed to meet economic control requirements such as reducing electricity costs while maintaining throughput. Scenarios, designed to evaluate the sensitivities of the load <b>shifting</b> <b>controller,</b> showed interesting results. Mill power set-point optimization was found to be proportionally related to the mineral price. Set-points were not sensitive to absolute electricity costs but rather to the relationships between peak, standard, and off-peak electricity costs. The load <b>shifting</b> <b>controller</b> was most effective at controlling the milling circuit where weekly throughput was between approximately 90 % and 100 % of the maximum throughput capacity. From an economic point of view, it is shown that for milling circuits that are not throughput constrained, load shifting can reduce operating costs associated with electricity consumption. Simulations performed indicate that realizable cost savings are between R 16. 51 and R 20. 78 per gram of unrefined platinum processed by the milling circuit. This amounts to a potential annual cost saving of up to R 1. 89 m for a milling circuit that processes 90 t/h at a head grade of 3 g/t. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

30|$|The {{process of}} {{identifying}} and dynamically adjusting the clock phase initiates after the PLL lock. After this step, the transmitter signals the receiver that the dynamic adjustment process has started by asserting high level to i_sync_start signal and starts sending a steady pattern of alternating 0 ’s and 1 ’s on the 32 -bit data bus. The hexadecimal representation of this pattern corresponds to “ 0 xAAAAAAAA 55555555 ”. Initially, the clock phase {{is set to}} 0 °. The receiver compares the received data on the bus with the expected pattern. While the phase <b>shift</b> <b>controller</b> does not recognize the expected pattern, its program phase shift increments through the PLL interface. The phasestep signal {{is responsible for the}} phase increment and decrement. The phaseupdown signal determines the phase shift direction. When phaseupdown is 0, phasestep generates an increment to the clock phase, otherwise a decrement. When the PLL has adjusted each generated pulse phase of the phasestep signal, it signals the end of this operation through the phasedone signal. When the pattern is recognized, the controller starts to count the number of increments given to the clock phase and keeps incrementing until the pattern stops to be recognized again. This counting allows the controller to get the exact size in degrees of the valid data window. The last step consists in performing decrements to the clock phase corresponding to half the number of increments performed before. This process ensures that data will be captured at exactly half of the valid data window. When this process ends, the receiver signals to the transmitter that the synchronization process has been completed through the o_sync_ready signal and begins the normal operation. If the data bus presents a configurable number of invalid transmissions, the dynamic adjustment of the clock phase runs again.|$|E

Here we have made use of the 5 x 10 (RC) matrix where 41 symbols have been mapped in it. This matrix will use the expressive feature eye blinking as its left-to-right <b>shift</b> focus <b>controller</b> and left smirk as its top-to-bottom focus controller. As this technology is very new for the most of people w...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to introduce, in detail, a novel {{approach}} for tuning of anisochronic singleinput single-output controllers for infinite-dimensional feedback control systems. A class of Linear Time- Invariant Time Delay Systems (LTI TDSs) is taken as a typical representative of infinite-dimensional systems. Control design to obtain the eventual controller structure is made in the special ring of quasipolynomial meromorphic functions (RMS). The use of this algebraic approach with a simple feedback loop for unstable or integrating systems leads to infinite-dimensional (delayed) controllers as well as the whole feedback loop. A natural task is to set tunable controller parameters in order to form the crucial area of the infinite closed-loop spectrum. It is worth noting that not only poles yet also zeros are taken into account. The prescribed positions of the right-most reference-to-output poles and zeros are given on the basis of the desired overshoot for a simple finite-dimensional matching model the detailed analysis of which is provided. The dominant poles and zeros are shifted to the prescribed positions using the Quasi-Continuous Shifting Algorithm (QCSA) followed by the use of an advanced optimization algorithm. The whole methodology is called the Pole-Placement <b>Shifting</b> based <b>controller</b> tuning Algorithm (PPSA). The PPSA is demonstrated on the setting of parameters of delayed controller for an unstable time delay plant of a skater on the controlled swaying bow. This example, however, shows a treachery of the algorithm and a natural feature of an infinite-dimensional system - namely, that its spectrum or even its dominant part can not be placed arbitrarily. Advantages and drawback as well as possible modification of the algorithm are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{frequency}} {{regulation of}} power systems by using both automatic generation control (AGC) and load-side control. A switched distributed controller {{is designed for}} each load bus in a transmission network. The targets of the designed controller are twofold. First, it makes controllable loads work together with generators to restore the system frequency quickly after a real power mismatch occurs in the grid. Second, it restores controllable loads to their nominal working conditions. To achieve the first target, a consensus-based distributed load-side controller is designed. Peer-to-peer communication between loads is used to achieve an average consensus according to which controllable load reacts to the frequency deviation. To achieve the second target, the load-side <b>controller</b> <b>shifts</b> its duties to AGC slowly after the frequency goes back into an ideal region, and hence, controllable loads will restore to their nominal conditions gradually. A switching signal is designed to detect time instants when the load-side controller should work {{in the mode of}} frequency restoration or in the mode of load restoration...|$|R
