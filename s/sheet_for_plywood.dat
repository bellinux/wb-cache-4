40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} customer demand <b>for</b> <b>plywood</b> flooring in Korea. The raw material and production costs have increased because of the changed environment of the industry.

The effect of fumigation by ammonium hydroxide on formaldehyde emission of plywood and particleboard are higly significant. The longer the fumigation by ammonium hydroxide, the lower the formaldehyde emission of plywod and particleboard.
