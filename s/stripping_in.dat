40|$|The {{structure}} {{and development of}} endodermal Caspar-ian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> Pinus bungeana needles and roots were stud-ied by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Primary pit fields (PFs) frequently occurred in radial walls of Casparian strips isolated from needles, whereas PFs were never detected <b>in</b> Casparian <b>strips</b> from roots. Formation of Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> needles as well as roots started at the outer parts of the radial walls and they finally occupied the entire radial walls of the endodermis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of Caspar-ian strips isolated from roots revealed significant absorp-tion bands characteristic for suberin. However, <b>in</b> Casparian <b>strips</b> of needles, evidence for suberin was rarely detected by FTIR spectroscopy. The apoplastic permeability of Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> needles and roots was probed by the apoplastic tracers calcofluor and berberine. Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> roots efficiently blocked the apoplastic transport (AT) of calcofluor and berberine. Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> nee-dles blocked the AT of calcofluor, but diffusion of berber-ine was not inhibited and berberine thiocyanate crystals were detectable in the vascular tissue of the needles. From the data presented, it must be concluded that Casparian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> needles, which are characterized {{by the absence of}} suberin, are more solute permeable compared with Caspar-ian <b>strips</b> <b>in</b> roots...|$|R

In order to avoid being stopped by security forces as they walk from rural areas to urban centers they wear better clothing on the trip.

As {{a result of this}} greater tolerance, Takembeng women provide some key support to the opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). In 1998, Takembeng women provided a protective caravan for John Fru Ndi, SDF Chairman, to leave the country and make a political trip to France and the United States. Although they are related closely with the SDF, the members of the Takembeng are clear in interviews that they are not a branch or tool of the party; instead, they support the ideals of the party {{and as long as the}} SDF holds to those values, their protests will overlap.

2500|$|Strippers can {{sometimes}} be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Strippers with ready access to the Internet away from work have also adopted social media and networks as a less intrusive way of maintaining direct connections with customers.

Online erotic content is pervasive and generally classified as pornography. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they provide during private parties. Aside from advertising for striptease services outside of the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the sex industry. [...] This can include erotic and nude modeling, pornography, escorting, and in some cases prostitution. [...] Outside of the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex-for-hire is much more common and <b>stripping</b> <b>in</b> those settings is viewed as advertising for sexually oriented services that will be performed in either private areas of the club or off-premises.|$|E
