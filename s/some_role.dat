5|$|The strong {{taste of}} the fruit body may have <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in insects {{avoiding}} it. The small fly species Megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of T.felleus in North America, though it seems to prefer other boletes in Europe. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mould Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E
5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In March 1916 Mexican forces {{loyal to}} Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The {{violence}} in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. Chagrined {{to discover that}} his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, {{hearing of}} the turmoil, headed for Moscow and Beijing in order to demand that the patrons of PAVN and the Viet Cong exert {{more control over their}} clients. On 18 March 1970, Lon Nol {{requested}} that the National Assembly vote {{on the future of the}} prince's leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 92–0. Heng Cheng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted emergency powers. Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional and it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} BAS forms which an organisation can complete. The form which a business receives depends on what taxation liabilities an organisation has (these are referred to as roles). Statements are usually issued quarterly, <b>some</b> <b>roles</b> can be reported at different frequencies depending on business structure and income. <b>Some</b> <b>roles</b> such as GST can be reported annually, subject to eligibility criteria being met.|$|R
5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less {{likely it is that}} any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|Despite the game's {{expanded}} memory resources, reviewers {{felt that the}} game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for contemporary games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play <b>some</b> <b>role</b> in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E
