5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread {{that there was an}} alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|After <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor {{is blown}} {{off his feet}} by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the {{disturbance}} {{to the second floor}} of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|While nine innings {{has been}} the {{standard}} {{since the beginning of}} professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took {{an hour and a half}} to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.|$|E

25|$|In another tale, Amaterasu retreats from {{conflict}} {{with her brother}} Susa No O into a cave, depriving the Earth of sunlight and life. In order to coax Amaterasu from the cave, the deity of humour and dance, Ame No Uzume, performs a bawdy sexual dance that involved exposing her breast and vulva, and inviting Amaterasu to admire them. On Amaterasu's <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cave, the transgender kami Ishi Kori Dome held up a magical mirror, and {{the combination of the}} dance and her reflection fascinate Amaterasu so much that she does not notice other spirits closing the cave entrance behind her.|$|E
25|$|In September 2013, Burton {{announced}} that he would be <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> No. 31 {{at the end of the}} season due to a lack of additional sponsorship. On September 9, it was {{announced that}} Ryan Newman will drive the No. 31 beginning in 2014, bringing sponsor Quicken Loans with him from Stewart-Haas Racing for 12 races. Kevin Harvick had transferred to Stewart-Haas Racing, Newman's previous team, essentially meaning the two drivers were switching teams, although they did not end up in the same rides. In spite of not winning a race, Newman made it to the final round of the new chase format, finishing second in points to Harvick, losing by just one point.|$|E
25|$|At 7:18p.m. ADT, {{the first}} 9-1-1 call {{was made to}} police about an armed man walking down a {{sidewalk}} on Pioneer Avenue and towards the woods west of the street. Twelve RCMP officers responded to the scene {{and set up a}} perimeter around the woods and the surrounding neighbourhood. Bourque was first seen by Cst. Mathieu Daigle <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest, crossing a street, and entering another wooded area that bordered the backyards of several houses. Daigle sent out a radio transmission describing Bourque, but some radio static was heard, which made the description difficult to understand. Daigle was then joined by Csts. Fabrice Gevaudan and Rob Nickerson as they trailed Bourque, who was headed toward a house on Bromfield Court, where five other officers were positioned. All of the officers were intending on maintaining visual contact on him while waiting for the arrival of Police Dog Services, who were scheduled to arrive in a few minutes.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey at a photoshoot {{in a private}} room at the Plaza Hotel, {{speaking}} the line, [...] "And I was like, {{why are you so}} obsessed with me?" [...] Next, a Rolls-Royce Phantom is shown pulling up to the hotel, with Carey <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. As she gets out of the car, Carey dressed as a bellhop, assists her to the ramp where she is walking and greeting fans. The next scene finds Carey walking into the hotel, and waving to everyone, with the camera zooming to the bellhops face to reveal him intently staring at her. As the first verse begins, Carey is shown at the photo-shoot in the hotel, with a cameo by Patrick Demarchelier as the photographer. The bellhop, now dressed in a gray hoodie and sweatpants, is shown holding a hair-blower at Carey, apparently assisting with the shoot. As the shoot continues, scenes of the bellhop are shown in his room, where he has dolls of Carey on the wall, as well as quilts with the cover of her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi.|$|E
500|$|Panjaa {{received}} largely {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The movie was criticised for {{its lack of}} story and weak screenplay, though it was praised for its stylish presentation. Rediff gave a two stars, said [...] "Panjaa is let down by a weak script. Panjaa also reminds one of Pawan Kalyan's own earlier movie, Balu. The {{second half of the}} film lags a bit. There doesn't seem to be much originality in the story telling. On the whole, Panjaa is nothing extraordinary and even a bit disappointing". [...] rated two stars, noted [...] "The main drop down in the film is Pawan's character design. His getup and being a yesman to a gangster aren't in kilter with his nursery business. First half is morose and second half is emotion overdose. On a whole, Panjaa hits badly on the expectations of audience". Deccan Chronicle gave two stars says [...] "The much-hyped action thriller lacks the adrenaline of a tight and creative script and one feels let down when <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theatre". A gangster film with mafia backdrop, It got mixed reviews but its title song, Panjaa, was the song of the year.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jackson family shadow, Control established Jackson {{as one of}} the preeminent female artists of popular music, rivaling fellow pop star Madonna, as critics began to acknowledge their influence on the record industry and younger artists. Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America (2012) documents that both women redefined house music, repackaging it [...] "as part of a global metropolitan pop aesthetic." [...] With regard to marketing singles, Paul Grein of Billboard reported: [...] "10 or 20 years ago you would have had two singles from an album at the most. Now we're in an era where Madonna is on her fifth single from the album True Blue and Janet Jackson is on her sixth from the LP Control." [...] Jackson subsequently became the first female artist to produce six top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from a single album. Los Angeles Times writer Paul Grein wrote a segment titled [...] "The influence of Madonna and Janet Jackson", reporting Debbie Gibson's manager Doug Breitbart claimed [...] "Madonna has brought back a really strong, melodic component to pop music", while Teen Beat editor Maggie Murphy remarked [...] "Janet Jackson may have started this more than anyone else." [...] Anthony DeCurtis, author of Present Tense: Rock & Roll and Culture (1992) wrote that [...] "Madonna and Janet Jackson have produced videos that explore the female gaze," [...] and described Jackson's music video for [...] "Nasty" [...] as feminist theory on film that deconstructs the objectification of women. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) documented that within two years of the release of Control, [...] "a new crop of female singers (such as Paula Abdul and Karyn White) were charged with imitating Janet." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone remarked: [...] "Control—with its quintuple-platinum sales and string of hit singles—established" [...] a then-twenty-year-old Jackson [...] "{{as one of the}} most popular recording artists in the world." [...] The Guardian described the album's release as one of the 50 key events in the history of R and hip hop.|$|E
