2500|$|In May 2015, {{a man was}} arrested, {{detained}} from 2–4 May for {{in excess}} of 48 hours and wrongfully accused of murder. The man was autistic, and the police failure to handle such a case sparked controversy. According to the police, the suspect made a written confession of an assault that contradicted severely with statements obtained whilst interviewed with family members. A nursing home later offered the suspect an alibi, corroborated with video evidence, that the man {{could not have been}} at the alleged crime scene. Civil rights activists condemned the incident which traumatised a vulnerable individual, and criticised the police procedures including not proposing legal representation, lengthy detention, an methods for obtaining a bogus confession. The police chief expressed [...] "regret" [...] but refused to make an apology. Also in May 2015, police procedures for conducting identity parades attracted controversy when suspects in an assault case on television reporters were allowed to wear <b>shower</b> <b>caps</b> and face masks during an identity parade, ostensibly to cover distinctive features, leading to the police abandoning the case due to insufficient evidence. The police stance was confirmed by the new Chief Commissioner.|$|E
50|$|Many {{designs are}} {{produced}} by joining two layers of fabric together {{in order to make}} the shower cap not only waterproof but decorative. However, simpler designs are made from one layer of a waterproof material. Designs invariably contain an elastic edging to keep them in place. <b>Shower</b> <b>caps</b> are used In hair mask treatments or hair dyes. They trap in the heat so that the treatment or color sets in. Often Plastic bags are used as <b>shower</b> <b>caps.</b> They are important beauty tools in spas. Also <b>shower</b> <b>caps</b> are worn when somebody is getting a facial mask in a spa.|$|E

50|$|A {{shower cap}} (also {{known as a}} bath cap) is a hat worn while {{showering}} or bathing to protect hair from becoming wet. Alternatively, <b>shower</b> <b>caps</b> for children can be crowns with wide brims that prevent water and shampoo from getting in the eyes while allowing the hair to be washed.|$|E
50|$|Hairnets {{are used}} to prevent loose hair from contaminating food or work areas. A snood is a net or fabric bag pinned or tied on {{at the back of}} a woman's head for holding the hair.

5000|$|... 3/5 is {{the first}} album by Les Savy Fav. It was {{released}} in 1997 by Self-Starter Foundation. [...] The LP release came in a pack of <b>shower</b> <b>caps</b> [...] and is fairly difficult to find, sometimes fetching high prices on eBay. Coincidentally, only three-fifths of the line-up on this album, the band's first, remain in the present day line-up, as drummer Patrick Mahoney was replaced by Harrison Haynes before the group's second album, The Cat and the Cobra, and guitarist Gibb Slife left before the recording of the Emor: Rome Upside Down EP.|$|E
50|$|Tyree’s {{clothes are}} a {{peculiar}} {{mix of the}} practical and the bizarre. At various times he wears a bright orange rain poncho (to keep from being hit on the highway while scooping up roadkills), a bright flowered <b>shower</b> <b>cap,</b> dungarees, military boots, a Rolling Stones t-shirt, and at one time a kilt made from a checkered racing flag.|$|R

50|$|Taking a bath at {{a public}} sentō {{requires}} at a bare minimum a small towel and some soap/shampoo. Attendants usually sell these items for 100-200 yen. Many people bring two towels; a handtowel for drying and a handtowel or washcloth for washing. A nylon scrubbing cloth or scrub brush with liquid soap is normally used for washing. Other body hygiene products may include a pumice stone, toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving equipment, combs, <b>shower</b> <b>caps,</b> pomade, make up products, powder, creams, etc. Some regular customers store their bucket of bathing equipment on open shelves in the dressing room.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{personal}} items are provided complimentary {{for use by}} guests. These may include irons and ironing boards, hair dryers, soap, shampoo, mouthwash, or <b>shower</b> <b>caps.</b> A current trend in {{personal items}} in the United States {{is to focus on}} American-made toiletries, such as those made by William Roam, given a perception by guests that foreign-made amenities are not as desirable. For example, in 2007 hotel amenity provider Gilchrist & Soames, conducted a voluntary worldwide recall, in cooperation with the FDA of its 18-milliliter or 0.65-ounce tubes of complementary toothpaste with the company name on it. Gilchrist & Soames immediately quarantined its toothpaste, made in China, after the FDA issued its warning that the toothpaste possibly contained diethylene glycol. [...] The FDA stated at the time that it was not aware of any U.S. reports of any harmful effects from the toothpaste containing diethylene glycol. Not all items are provided by all hotels; for example, some hotels do not provide toothpaste.|$|E
5000|$|In 1891, Dunker's father Johan founded Helsingsborgs Gummifabrik AB. The rubber {{footwear}} {{produced by}} the factory was of poor quality, so the younger Dunker travelled to Russia {{to learn how to}} produce better rubber. During a visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia, he did not find any new material, but in Riga, Latvia he met chemist Julius von Gerkan, who agreed to help him improve the rubber formula. His company was known for creating a rubber that was soft when cold but not sticky when the weather improved.In 1894, Dunker took over control of the factory and, after some time, expanded the factory. In 1905, Dunker, along with Johan Kock, changed the Velox factory in Trelleborg into the Trelleborgs gummifabrik. [...] Through a network of sales offices not only in Sweden but also in Copenhagen, Berlin and Vienna, Dunker gained better control over the distribution chain. With time, the rubber products produced by his company expanded to include tennis balls, <b>shower</b> <b>caps</b> and tires. In 1912, Dunker created a cartel with the purpose of increasing its competitive power abroad. Prices for the rubber increased in Sweden but were lowered abroad.|$|E

50|$|Tea tree oil {{has been}} {{promoted}} {{as a treatment for}} head lice; however, there is no clear evidence of its effectiveness. A 2012 review of head lice treatment recommended against the use of tea tree oil for children because it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, because of contraindications, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge about the oil's safety and effectiveness. Other home remedies, such as putting vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, or melted butter under a <b>shower</b> <b>cap,</b> have been disproven. The CDC states that swimming has no effect on lice, and can decrease the effectiveness of some treatments.|$|R

40|$|Students {{struggle}} with the volume and complexity of physiology terminology. We compared first-year undergraduate psychology students’ learning of physiological terms using two teaching methods: one verbal (control group; n = 16) and one spatial and multisensory (experimental group; n = 19). The experimental group used clear plastic <b>shower</b> <b>caps</b> to mark brain regions and affix labels to another participant’s head. The control group learned the material verbally through a game. When tested verbally, both the control and experimental groups recalled more of the 10 terms immediately after the activity (+ 106 % and + 83 %, respectively) and 2 wk later (+ 53 % and + 31 %, respectively) than at the pretest (P less than 0. 0005). When participants’ knowledge was tested spatially (labeling a brain diagram), the experimental group recalled more terms at the posttest (+ 76 %) and followup (+ 73 %) than at the pretest (P less than 0. 0005), but the control group who showed no improvement at either time point (+ 12 % and + 14 %, respectively).

Free lay flat on the motorcycle wearing only a bathing suit, a <b>shower</b> <b>cap,</b> {{and a pair of}} borrowed sneakers - inspired by friend Ed Kretz.

5000|$|Wingate {{was known}} for various eccentricities. For instance, he often wore an alarm clock around his wrist, which would go off at times, and had raw onions and garlic on a string around his neck, which he would {{occasionally}} bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were used to having him {{come out of the}} shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a <b>shower</b> <b>cap,</b> and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Lord Moran, Winston Churchill's personal physician, wrote in his diaries that [...] "Wingate seemed to me hardly sane—in medical jargon a borderline case".

5000|$|Davis had no {{experience}} in adaptive rowing, and Zimbabwe had no program either. With only {{two months before the}} Paralympic qualifying camp in Italy, Davis sent out a call on social media for people with disabilities who would be interested in rowing at the Paralympics. Eighteen people responded to her call, meeting at St. George's College, Harare where Davis taught. None had any rowing experience and most could not swim. The candidates had little understanding of competitive rowing, and one sixty year-old applicant arrived in her Sunday best, wearing a <b>shower</b> <b>cap</b> to protect her hair. Overwhelmed by the response, as Davis was expecting only a handful of responders, she decided to assemble a team rather than enter single scull events.

50|$|The Water-Tank Challenge: In {{the annual}} tradition, the contestants {{must go through}} an {{obstacle}} course with a roof-mounted water tank filled with 200 litres of water. If the contestants do not brake smoothly, {{the contents of the}} water tank will drain though a series of tubes leading to the occupants inside the car. This year's twist, however, is {{that at the end of}} the obstacle course, is a high-speed portion: the drivers must slowly accelerate up to 30 km/h and slowly brake. Only Jason is prepared for the challenge (himself and Adrian having worn a <b>shower</b> <b>cap),</b> largely because he has to repeat the accelerationportion five times - either because of not keeping up speed or hitting a side barrier while accelerating. Shelby loses the least amount of water (20 litres), but makes the serious mistake of leaving the car in drive while he exits the car to remove an obstacle that had lodged itself under the car. Billie-Jean's run causes her make-up to run, while Jennifer - wearing waterproof mascara - regretted her choice of clothes (a set of white pants that had gone translucent when wet). Ed's run had Elizabeth screaming repeatedly whenever he got wet, but again he maintained composure and lost only 25 litres of water.|$|R
40|$|Imagine {{that you}} are {{recruited}} to participate in market research for a new product. You are presented {{with a sample of}} the product and told either that it has recently been launched in the marketplace or that it will be launched in the near future. Will your evaluation of the product be affected by whether the launch is cast in the past versus the future? While intuitively it would seem that temporal perspective should not influence product evaluation if the product itself is held constant, a recent experience by the Clorox Company suggests otherwise. Clorox had conducted market research on a new product that it was considering launching under the Glad brand name. The product was an elasticized plastic cover resembling a disposable <b>shower</b> <b>cap,</b> which could be used to cover open food containers quickly and conveniently. When consumers were asked about their willingness to purchase if the product were to be launched in the future, their response was resoundingly negative. As a result, the company scrapped its plans to launch the product. Shortly thereafter, S. C. Johnson, launched a nearly identical product under the name of Saran Quick Covers. The product was an instant success, bringing Saran to number one in the category of plastic food coverings. Puzzled by the apparent invalidity of their research results an...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on how dogs use visual {{information}} about human faces, but their ability to recognize the faces of familiar people is not yet understood. We tested 30 dogs on their ability to recognize their owners by using face information alone. In a series of two-choice tasks, dogs had to choose between their owner and a stranger, who wore identical clothes and stood behind an apparatus that allowed dogs to only see the people’s legs and heads. In the TEST condition heads were not frontally oriented towards the dog and were illuminated by a spotlight, while a <b>shower</b> <b>cap</b> covered the people’s hair. In the BASE condition, heads faced the dog, there was no spotlight and no cap. In the ODOR condition, only legs were visible. A choice was recorded when the dog overstepped the apparatus where one of the two people stood. Only in BASE condition the dogs choose the owner above chance (N = 22, P = 0. 008, one-tailed Binomial). Condition had a significant effect on choices (Q = 6. 7, P = 0. 03), as dogs chose the owner more often in BASE than TEST (N = 14, Q = 5. 3, P 0. 02) and ODOR (N = 15, Q = 5. 4, P 0. 02), whereas no difference was found between the latter two (Q = 0. 07, P = 0. 7).

The “Suffolk Puff”, a small rosette of {{gathered}} fabric, {{is this year}} making a comeback in the catalogue of British queen of retro kitsch, Cath Kidston. While most people can manage a cushion cover in Suffolk puffs, Marjorie in her heyday could turn out an entire bedspread. In her autobiography, she recalls: “Early March [1978] I started a quilt that took me 2 ½ months, or 228 hours. First, I cut out 1, 368 rounds of different scrap material using a saucer as a guide, felled the edges, then gathered into a small rosette resembling a miniature <b>shower</b> <b>cap.</b> I then sewed {{one to the other}} – four joins on one rosette. ”(Danielle Wood) “Marjorie Bligh is Tasmania’s queen of the household scene. Often referred to as “Australia’s Mrs Beeton” or “Tasmania’s Mrs Beeton”, she was born Marjorie Pearsall, in 1917, in the Tasmanian midlands township of Ross. In her self-styled career as a housewife superstar, she married three times and produced six books on cooking, home economics, craft, history and gardening. She published her signature household manual under all three of her married names: Marjorie Blackwell, Marjorie Cooper and Marjorie Bligh. A pioneer recycler, Marjorie has for several decades been renowned for her spirited campaign against useful resources being poured into landfill. Famous for never wasting a thing, she has converted thousands of used pantyhose and plastic shopping bags into reusable items.

The Angels offence got to Marco Estrada early and often in the second game of the series, tagging him for a season-high ten hits and six runs and {{defeating}} the Jays 8-2. In the rubber match, the Angels handed J. A. Happ his first loss since June, taking the game and the series, 6-3. Hoping to bounce back from a disappointing series against one last-place team, Toronto then took on another last-place team in the Minnesota Twins.

The Blue Jays trailed the Twins 5-1 in the next match of the series, before working their way back into the game. Down 7-6 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Melvin Upton Jr. hit a triple and came in to score on an error by Max Kepler on the play, giving Toronto an 8-7 lead that they would successfully hold.
