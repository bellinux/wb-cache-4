25|$|A Slide Away Bed {{is a type}} of {{sofa bed}} that slides to the wall to form a sofa. The {{mattress}} is hinged to form a <b>seating</b> <b>surface</b> and back support. The bed frame support is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform to recess below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of Cincinnati, Ohio. U.S. patent #4,204,287 was filed on September 5, 1978 and issued on May 27, 1980.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose Because it is {{debatable}} whether <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> inclination improves motor function {{in children with}} cerebral palsy (CP), the effect of <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> tilting on postural control and quality of reaching was studied. Subjects The subjects were 58 children with CP aged 2 to 11 years (34 with unilateral spastic CP, 24 with bilateral spastic Cl?). Methods During the task of reaching movements, surface electromyographic and kinematic data were recorded for posture and reaching with the dominant arm in 3 sitting conditions: horizontal <b>seat</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> tilted forward 15 degrees, and <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> tilted back-ward 15 degrees. Results In the children with unilateral spastic CP, forward tilting improved postural efficiency and quality of reaching. In the children with bilateral spastic CP, both forward and backward tilting of the <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> was associated with more postural instability and {{did not affect the}} quality of reaching. Discussion and Conclusion The results suggest that, in terms of postural control and quality of reaching, children with unilateral spastic CP benefit from a forward-tilted position and children with bilateral spastic CP benefit from a horizontal sitting position...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the influence of the flexibility of the <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> of a chair on the speed and time expended by students with spastic cerebral palsy during the performance of a task involving the manipulation an object while in a seated position. Eleven students of both genders participated in the study; all were diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy, and all had some control of trunk and upper limbs. The quantification of the kinematics analysis was done through two experimental situations: 1) performance of an academic task involving fitting blocks into matching holes, with the individual seated in an adapted seat with canvas seat surface; 2) performance of an academic task involving fitting blocks into matching holes, with the participant seated in an adapted seat with wooden <b>seat</b> <b>surface.</b> The data collected was submitted to descriptive analysis and non-parametric statistics using the Wilcoxon test. The results indicated that: 1) the average speed of performance of the tasks was not influenced by the type of <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> 2) performance time for the task was influenced by the type of <b>seat</b> <b>surface.</b> The use of the canvas <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> increased the accomplishment time for the task. This study concluded that the <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> of school furniture for students with spastic cerebral palsy should not to be made from very flexible materials. This type of <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> does not offer the necessary stability, and will be detrimental to the student's performance during activities involving the upper limbs...|$|R

40|$|Twelve male {{subjects}} {{have been}} exposed to whole-body vertical random vibration so as to investigate the effect of <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> angle, vibration magnitude and contact with a backrest on the ‘vertical apparent mass’ (calculated from forces normal to the <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> and vertical acceleration) and ‘fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass’ (calculated from forces parallel to the <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> and vertical acceleration). At each of four <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> angles (0 °, 5 °, 10 °, and 15 °), the subjects were exposed to four vibration magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 625, and 1. 25 m s? 2 rms) in the frequency range 0. 25 – 15 Hz. The ‘vertical apparent mass’ and ‘fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass’ on the <b>seat</b> <b>surface</b> suggested resonances in the vicinity of 5 and 4 Hz, respectively. At all seat angles, both with and without a backrest, the resonance frequency in the ‘vertical apparent mass’ was greater than the resonance frequency in the ‘fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass’. Within subjects, the two resonance frequencies were not correlated in any condition. Seat angles up to 15 ° had a negligible effect on the ‘vertical apparent mass’ but a considerable effect on the ‘fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass’ on the <b>seat</b> <b>surface,</b> where ‘cross-axis apparent mass’ increased with increasing seat angle. At all seat angles, increasing the vibration magnitude decreased the resonance frequency in both directions. The least significant decrease in resonance frequency with increasing vibration magnitude occurred in the ‘fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass’ at the maximum seat angle of 15 °. At low frequencies, the backrest reduced the forces in both directions, with the reduction greatest in the ‘fore-and-aft’ direction. The ‘fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass’ at resonance was correlated with subject mass and subject stature...|$|R

Seat may also be threaded and screwed into a thread cut in the same area of the body. However this method makes removal of the seat ring during maintenance difficult if not impossible.

50|$|JIC fittings, {{defined by}} the SAE J514 and MIL-F-18866 standards, are a type of flare fitting {{machined}} with a 37-degree flare <b>seating</b> <b>surface.</b> JIC (Joint Industry Council) fittings are widely used in fuel delivery and fluid power applications, especially where high pressure (up to 10,000 psi) is involved. The SAE J514 standard replaces the MS16142 military specification, although some tooling is still listed under MS16142. JIC fittings are dimensionally identical to AN (Army-Navy) fittings, but are produced to less exacting tolerances and are generally less costly. SAE 45-degree flare fittings are similar in appearance, but are not interchangeable, though dash sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 16 share the same thread size. Some couplings may have dual machined seats for both 37-degree and 45-degree flare seats.Komatsu and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) fittings have flare ends similar to JIC fittings. Komatsu and JIS both use a 30-degree flare <b>seating</b> <b>surface.</b> The only difference is Komatsu uses milimeter thread sizes while JIS use a BSP (British Standard Pipe) thread. JIC fitting systems have three components that make a tubing assembly: fitting, flare nut, and sleeve. As with other flared connection systems, the seal is achieved through metal-to-metal contact between the finished surface of the fitting nose and the inside diameter of the flared tubing. The sleeve is used to evenly distribute the compressive forces of the flare nut to the flared end of the tube. Materials commonly used to fabricate JIC fittings include forged carbon steel, forged stainless steel, forged brass, machined brass, Monel and nickel-copper alloys.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the study}} for the {{dimensioning}} {{as well as the}} selection of the individual materials constituting a railway track, the ballast and the substructure present residual deformations, directly related to the deterioration of the geometry of the track. The slighter the residual deformations and the slower their alteration over time is, the better the quality of the track. The actions acting on the track panel are almost proportionally dependent on the total track stiffness that is also influenced seriously by the fastening's and total track's stiffness. This implies that the average stress on ballast underneath the sleepers’ <b>seating</b> <b>surface</b> is also influenced by the stiffness. It is imperative to reduce as much as possible the average stresses at the sleepers’ <b>seating</b> <b>surface,</b> by increasing track's stiffness. In the Greek network since the late 1980 's up to 2000 an extended research program was performed due to cracks on twin-block concrete sleepers (over 60 % on the total number laid on track). In the frame of this investigation, a new approach for the actions on sleepers and the ballast has been developed, by taking into account the real conditions of the line (maintenance etc.) which led to the increase of the demands in the specifications for the use of very resilient fastenings...|$|E
