40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first part}} of a state of the art review on the No Fault Found (NFF) phenomenon. The aim has been to compile a systematic reference point for burgeoning NFF literature, and to provide a comprehensive overview for gaining an understanding of NFF knowledge and concepts. Increasing systems complexities have seen a {{rise in the number of}} unknown failures that are being reported during operational service. Units tagged as ‘NFF’ are evidence that a <b>serviceable</b> <b>component</b> was removed, and attempts to troubleshoot the root cause have been unsuccessful. There are many reasons on how these failures manifest themselves and these papers describe the prominent issues that have persisted across a variety of industrial applications and processes for decades. This article, in particular, deals with the impact of NFF from an organizational culture and human factors point of view. It also highlights recent developments in NFF standards, its financial implications and safety concerns...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSurface {{treatment}} of engineering materials has recently become important for <b>serviceable</b> engineering <b>components.</b> Many {{techniques such as}} thermal and thermo chemical surface treatments {{have been used to}} develop surface characteristics of materials. Hardness is the most important property, which influences considerably service life characteristics of coatings. In this investigation, alumina coatings were deposited by atmospheric plasma spray technique under different levels of power, stand-off distances and powder feed rates. Empirical relationship was developed to predict the micro hardness of alumina coatings by incorporating the plasma spray process parameters. The input power and the stand-off distance appeared to be the most significant two parameters affecting the hardness of the coating among the three investigated process parameters. Further, correlating the spray parameters with coating properties enables the identification of characteristics regime to achieve desired quality of coatings...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{backbones}} {{in electronic}} manufacturing industry is the {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). The recent rapid growth in electronics devices, results escalating in the production number of the PCBs. For electronic equipment and appliances which are PCB based, new generations of PCB's are produced to suit the requirements of new products. This development can lead to waste and inefficiency when perfectly <b>serviceable</b> electronic <b>components</b> and appliances have to be scrapped because of the unavailability of spare PCB's from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or are already obsolete. This paper proposed a novel framework for reverse engineering of obsolete single layer PCB. Equivalent PCB's {{which can be used}} as spares will be reproduced utilizing this new framework. This framework involves several steps, such as data acquisition, image processing, CAD editing, PCB fabrication and circuitry testing and analysis. Each stage of the framework and the functionality evaluation of the reproduced PCB will be discussed in detail in following sections...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{backbones}} {{in electronic}} manufacturing industry is the {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). However, with the recent rapid growth in electronics devices, the production number of the PCBs is also rapidly escalating. For electronic equipment and appliances {{which are based on}} PCB, new generations of PCB’s are being produced to suit the requirements of new products. This development can lead to waste and inefficiency when perfectly <b>serviceable</b> electronic <b>components</b> and appliances have to be scrapped because the spare PCBs are no longer available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or are already obsolete. This research proposes a new method for reverse engineering of an obsolete PCB. An equivalent PCB can be produce using this new methods utilizing using image processing technique. This methods involves several steps, such as Data Acquisition, PCB Scanning, Image Processing, Vectorization and CAD Editing, PCB Fabrication, and Circuitry testing and Analysis. The MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox was used in the image processing stage and AutoCAD software is used for vectorization stage. Each of these stages will be discussed in detail and newly fabricated PCB will be evaluated in terms of functionality {{at the end of the}} research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSurface {{treatments}} of engineering materials have recently become important for <b>serviceable</b> engineering <b>components.</b> Many {{techniques such as}} thermal and thermo-chemical surface treatments {{have been used to}} develop surface characteristics of materials. Presently, high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spray is considered as the best method of producing a high-quality hard metal coating due to its moderate process temperatures and high gas velocities. Hardness is the most important property, which influences considerably service life characteristics of coatings. HVOF spray parameters, namely oxygen flow rate, LPG flow rate, powder feed rate, spray distance playsa major role in determining the hardness of coating. In this study, WC- 10 Co- 4 Cr coatings were deposited on naval brass substrates by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spray process. The aim of this work is to develop an empirical relationship to predict the hardness of WC- 10 Co- 4 Cr coatings incorporating HVOF spray parameters using statistical tools such as design of experiments, analysis of variance and regression analysis. Statistical calculations showed that the effects of the four variables on the hardness were different. Moreover, {{the results of this study}} may help to control the spray parameters of HVOF process to achieve higher coating hardness...|$|R
5000|$|The Il-62 {{was said}} to be well {{regarded}} by pilots and passengers alike, especially for its strong directional stability in high turbulence (although landings are sometimes bouncy), smooth cruising ability and very quiet interior in cruise mode due partly to engine placement [...] Although the original IL-62 was rated for a service life of 23 years and was criticised for heavy fuel consumption, upgraded M versions are sometimes rated for 50 years and have greatly improved operational economics. One of the drawbacks of the original Il-62 design was the lack of a cargo bay roller transfer system, which necessitated manual loading of pre-packaged baggage and cargo thus making preparation of the aircraft rather slow (a cargo/baggage conveyance system is standard on the Il-62M). Conversely, there is relatively easy access to all <b>serviceable</b> mechanical <b>components</b> including the engines [...] whilst the plane's thrust reversal capabilities allows reverse taxiing without the need for tow-vehicles. Powerplant overhaul intervals varied between specifications and maintenance procedures and between the thrust reverse-capable outer engines and the inner ones. Czech Airlines operated an early Il-62 on a proving basis up to 3000 hrs between overhauls, which was well beyond the recommended (and their usual) intervals which were nearer 2000 hrs [...] although Interflug were able to designate up to 5000 hrs with their service facilities. Subsequent upgrades to some Il-62Ms provided for 6000 hr overhaul intervals (with total engine life of 18,000-20,000 hrs). Later examples of the Il-62M remain in regular commercial service (as of 2016), and the type also sees continued use as a VIP/head of state transport.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} rear {{suspension}} system to support the frame of an Electrathon Vehicle. The vehicle is designed to compete in the Electrathon America competition on behalf of the Central Washington University Electric Vehicle Club. The suspension system was designed to use readily available parts sourced from manufacturers to keep the <b>components</b> <b>serviceable.</b> Using dynamic and static engineering analysis (spring equations, equations of equilibrium, stress calculations), the necessary custom components were designed. Space restrictions and limitations of the preexisting frame necessitated modifications, such as the straightness of the frame and the positioning of existing bars. Once the parts were sourced, received, inspected, and assembled to the existing vehicle frame, minor modifications were made to better accommodate use of the automotive “dune buggy” coil-over spring and shock absorber assembly. The system is over-sprung to take advantage of future weight changes to the currently-incomplete vehicle. With respect to ethical engineering standards, safety is paramount. By anticipating weight additions and designing the assembly with a factor of safety, the suspension system will remain intact and safe for future students that have the opportunity to work on the vehicle. The result of the project is that the coil-over assemblies mounted to the frame as intended. They articulate through the range of motion as dictated by the calculated parameters and design requirements. Overall, the project was a success in that the system is easily serviceable, reliable, safe, and functions as designed...|$|R
