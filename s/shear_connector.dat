In the {{construction}} of composite bridge structures, various types of shear connectors are usually used to provide an efficient load transfer and the composite action {{of two or more}} different materials. In the previous work conducted by authors, a new type of the <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was introduced, which is the perforated <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> with flange heads (T-shaped perforated <b>shear</b> <b>connector),</b> and the structural behavior of the <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was discussed {{based on the results of}} push-out tests.

The existing Y-type perfobond rib <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are designed for girder slabs of composite bridges.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 142 - 148). Concrete composites {{consisting of}} precast pre-stressed standardized beams and a cast in-situ deck slab {{have been used}} for the construction of short to medium span bridges for the past four decades in South Africa and worldwide. The pre-cast beams and cast in-situ slab are commonly connected using <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Failure of these connectors would compromise the composite action of the structure, thus reducing the load carrying capacity and hence its efficiency. This study seeks to assess the integrity of such <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> using dynamic testing and Finite Element (FE) analysis. The main objective of the work is to assess the practicality of vibration-based techniques to detect damaged <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> using experimental and analytical modal data. A scaled bridge model was constructed and 10 mm bolts connected the beams and slab to simulate <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in the prototype bridge. Different damage scenarios were introduced by loosening some of the connectors and vibration testing was done to detect the artificial damage. An FE model of the system was also developed. The <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were modelled as non-linear spring elements capable of simulating the composite action between the slab and beams. Damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> was simulated by reducing the spring stiffness. The updating of the FE model was done manually by adjusting appropriate spring stiffnesses. The experimental and analytical results show that the natural frequencies are sensitive to this damage. The frequencies dropped from undamaged to severe damaged structure. Very little information was deduced from the damping ratios, modal assurance criteria (MAC) and coordinate modal assurance criteria (COMAC) values. The experimental and analytical first bending, torsion and transverse modes were sensitive to the damaged <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> 65 % of damaged connectors were located using these modes. Using experimental modal data, the mode curvatures and flexibility changes were able to locate the damaged region when more than 35 % of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were loosened. However, using numerical data, the mode curvatures and flexibility changes were able to localize the damaged region for 6 % damage introduced. 75 % of the loosened connectors were identified. The stiffness change technique could only identify less than 10 % of damaged <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> using experimental modal data. The same technique was applied on analytical data and over 75 % of damaged <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were located. The FE modelling of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> used in this work was applied on an existing bridge. Van der Kloof bridge (South Africa) was constructed using precast pre-stressed beams and a cast in-situ slab.

In this paper, the shear connection mechanism was proposed using high strength bolted <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> to provide composite action between concrete and the steel section. The conventional headed stud <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was eliminated since Cold-formed steel (CFS) was used and welding was not practically possible due to thinness nature of the CFS section.

Damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> will result in shear slippage between slab and girder, which significantly reduces the load-carrying capacity of the bridge. Routine visual inspection {{is not able to}} detect conditions of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> because they are buried inside the structure. This paper proposes a dynamic damage detection approach based on wavelet packet energy of cross-correlation functions from ambient vibration measurements to identify the damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in slab-on-girder bridges. Measured acceleration responses on the slab and corresponding girder locations under ambient vibrations are used to compute the cross-correlation functions. Wavelet packet decompositions of cross-correlation functions from the undamaged and damaged structures are performed and the percentage of wavelet packet energy in selected frequency bandwidths to the total wavelet packet energy is used to calculate the damage index. Numerical and experimental studies on a composite bridge with a concrete slab supported by two steel girders are conducted to validate the proposed approach and investigate its performance and robustness with noisy measured responses. It is demonstrated that the introduced damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> can be identified accurately and efficiently...|$|R
