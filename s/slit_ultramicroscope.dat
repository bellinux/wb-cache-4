50|$|Zsigmondy left Schott Glass in 1900, but {{remained}} in Jena as private lecturer to conduct his research. Together with the optical instrument manufacturer Zeiss, {{he developed the}} <b>slit</b> <b>ultramicroscope.</b> His scientific career continued in 1908 at the University of Göttingen, where he stayed {{for the rest of}} his professional career as professor of inorganic chemistry. In 1925, Zsigmondy received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on colloids and the methods he used, such as the ultramicroscope.|$|E
50|$|Before Zsigmondy {{finished}} his PhD thesis in organic chemistry, he published research on colouring glass with silver salts and dissolved silver particles, which he recovered by dissolving {{the glass in}} hydrofluoric acid. During his stay in Graz, Zsigmondy accomplished his most notable research work, on the chemistry of colloids. The exact mechanism which yields the red colour of the Cranberry or Ruby glass {{was a result of}} his studies of colloids.In later years he worked on gold hydrosols and used them to characterize protein solutions. While in Jena he developed the <b>slit</b> <b>ultramicroscope</b> together with Henry Siedentopf. After moving to Göttingen, Zsigmondy improved his optical equipment for the observation of finest nanoparticles suspended in liquid solution. As a result, he introduced the immersion ultramicroscope in 1912.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} confirmed, that the {{classical}} method for counting hydrophobic particles {{by means of}} a <b>slit</b> <b>ultramicroscope,</b> was inaccurate. However if the apparent particle concentration is determined for different slit‐apertures, correct results can be obtained, by extrapolating to infinite aperture. This procedure is extremely tedious and time consuming. This lead us to propose a new method of counting, which is both more accurate and more rapid than the classical one. It does not need any statistical treatment of the experimental data. In fact every particle contained in a given volume is counted. The volume is so large that there are practically no concentration fluctuations. The particles are forced to pass one by one under the microscope. Results obtained by this technique, by extrapolation to infinite aperture and by electron microscopy, agree within 5 %. Copyright © 1954 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
