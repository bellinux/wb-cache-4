40|$|Three mutants of Drosophila melanogaster {{have been}} {{isolated}} {{in which the}} free-running period of the circadian eclosion rhythm and the adult locomotor activity rhythm is affected. One mutant is arrhythmic, another has {{a short period of}} 19 hours, and the third has a long period of 28 hours. The mutants retain their phenotypes over the temperature range 18 ° to 25 ° C. All three mutants map near the tip of the X chromosome (distal to the centromere). By deficiency mapping, the short-period mutation has been localized to the 3 B 1 - 2 region. Complementation tests show that all three mutations affect the same functional gene. Analysis of activity rhythms of individual mosaic flies indicates that the site of action of the short-period mutation is probably located in the head of the fly. A few activity patterns of <b>split-head</b> and mixed-head mosaics appear to possess both mutant and heterozygous components, suggesting that the fly head may contain two complete clocks capable of maintaining their periodicities independently. The short-period mutation affects both the duration of the light-insensitive part of the oscillation {{and the degree to which}} the clock can be reset during the light-sensitive part of the oscillation. Both the short-period and long-period mutant eclosion rhythms can be entrained to a period of 24 hours by a 12 : 12 light-dark cycle having a light intensity at least two orders of magnitude greater than that required to entrain the normal rhythm. The arrhythmic mutant does not entrain under these conditions. In the presence of a temperature cycle, however, the arrhythmic mutant does entrain, but its rhythm damps out when the temperature cycle is removed. Evidence is presented that Pittendrigh's two-oscillator model for the clock in D. pseudoobscura applies to D. melanogaster as well. The three clock mutations primarily affect the light- sensitive driving oscillator. The arrhythmic mutation appears to have eliminated the driving oscillator while leaving the temperature-sensitive driven oscillator relatively intact. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMore {{complicated}} parts having gear teeth, cylindrical grooves, or long branches {{are manufactured}} in cold forging. Nowadays, more precise dimensions {{are required for}} these parts. Reduction in forming load is a key factor to obtain more precise parts in cold forging, because high load causes the elastically large deformation of tools and machines. Furthermore, this reduction in forming load contributes to longer tool life. In this paper, the loads of split-forging including split-backward extrusion and <b>split-heading</b> to produce the branched parts are estimated under different conditions such as punch sizes, punch geometries, and lubricants...|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Sperry and {{his staff}} {{discovered}} a new principle for detecting transverse fissures in 1928, called the [...] "induction method." [...] It also found <b>split-heads</b> and other invisible defects. It did not function properly {{at the end of}} each rail where angle bars and bolts held two succeeding rails together. It also did not function properly where two rails converged such as at switch points. These rail parts had to be examined individually by a hand-held ultrasonic scanner. The induction system was used until 1960 when mobile semi-automated ultrasonic inspection equipment was introduced to the Sperry fleet. Ultrasonic rail testing was introduced in 1949.|$|R
