5|$|The storm {{produced}} widespread rainfall in the Southeastern United States, {{accompanied by}} gale-force winds along the coast, and ships reported severe conditions at sea. High tides occurred around St. Augustine, Florida, washing over the South Street Causeway. Winds {{from the storm}} dispersed large amounts of dead grass from marshes in the area.

5|$|Washington and the American {{command in}} Saigon {{considered}} the operation a great success, {{both as a}} test of the new American policy of Vietnamization and in <b>setting</b> <b>back</b> any communist offensives planned against the Saigon area during the next year. The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds. The incursion was, however, limited in its scale and scope. Nixon had limited the depth of penetration by U.S. forces to 35 kilometers and placed a 30 June deadline for the withdrawal of American troops to South Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the reproducibility of an operation plan by comparing the jaw position of STO with the postoperative mandibular <b>set</b> <b>back</b> measurement in sagittal split ramus osteotomy. Methods: Thirty patients with class III dental and skeletal malocclusion and who were treated with BSSRO were reviewed. Three plain radiographs such as the panoramic view, the lateral cephalogram and the submentovertex view were taken before and after operation. Also, paper surgery for STO and model surgery were {{used to evaluate the}} amount of mandibular <b>set</b> <b>back.</b> Results: On the panoramic view, the amount of mandibular <b>set</b> <b>back</b> in STO was similar to the postoperative results of model surgery, but the amount of mandibular <b>set</b> <b>back</b> on the lateral cephalogram was smaller than the postoperative result of model surgery and then the amount of <b>set</b> <b>back</b> on submentovertex view was similar to the postoperative result of model surgery.

25|$|The estuary is shallow {{because of}} this {{constant}} deposition. Isostatic recoil is, however, causing the area to sink {{at the rate of}} 3mm annually and global warming is making the sea level rise. The combined effects of these processes mean that the sea in the estuary may be half a metre higher by the year 2050. A large area around the estuary consists of land which lies below the present high-water mark. Flood defences offer only a short-term and local answer and may actually increase the long-term risks. Managed realignment of the coast by <b>setting</b> <b>back</b> the coastal defences will provide new intertidal habitats and harness natural equalising processes and is the preferred long term solution.|$|E

In June 1936 Murray was sent back to the UK to work in the Admiralty Operations Division, and in December 1936 he started his final tour with the Royal Navy serving as Executive Officer aboard the former battleship , where he participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review.

Due to an unspecified [...] "series of unfortunate problems in Washington D.C."

Originally, {{it was decided that}} 20 boats were to be built, but due to the 1991 START I agreement between the U.S. and Soviet Union, the U.S. agreed {{to reduce the number of}} nuclear warheads it could deploy, and thus rationalized its order to 18 boats. The last boat of the class, USS Louisiana, was commissioned in September 1997, nearly 16 years after the class entered operational service. Originally designed for 30-year service lives, it was later decided that Ohio-class submarines would each serve for 42 years, comprising two periods of 20 years of operations and a two-year mid-life nuclear refueling.|$|E
500|$|The infighting exasperated Taylor, the US Ambassador to South Vietnam {{and former}} Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who felt the {{disputes}} between the junta's senior officers were derailing the war effort. Only {{a few days}} earlier, General William Westmoreland—the commander of US forces in Vietnam—had invited him and the Vietnamese generals home to a dinner. There Taylor asked {{for an end to}} the persistent changes in leadership, and Khánh and his men assured him of stability. Westmoreland warned that persistent instability would turn the American political class and public against Saigon, as they would deem it useless to support such a regime. Taylor initially cabled the State Department back in the US to state a [...] "naked military fist" [...] had [...] "crumpled [...] carefully woven fabric of civilian government", and that the arrest of the civilians would be [...] "immediately and understandably interpreted by all the world as another military coup, <b>setting</b> <b>back</b> all that had been accomplished" [...] since the formation of the HNC and the creation of a veneer of civilian rule. He went on to say that an [...] "inescapable conclusion that if a group of military officers could issue decisions abolishing one of the three fundamental organs of the governmental structure...and carry out military arrests of civilians, that group of military officers has clearly set themselves above and beyond the structure of government in Vietnam." [...] Taylor bemoaned the fact that the generals had shown no second thoughts about ignoring US policy recommendations, particularly in disregarding his explicit advice to maintain stable civilian rule, at least at a nominal level. Taylor issued a thinly disguised threat to cut aid, releasing a public statement saying Washington might reconsider its military funding if [...] "the fabric of legal government" [...] was not reinstated.|$|E

2500|$|The Port Authority {{proposed}} {{extending the}} NWK-WTC line to Newark International Airport {{in the early}} 1970s. In 1973, the plan was amended so the line would be extended to Plainfield, New Jersey, with a stop in Elizabeth as well as another just outside the airport. At the Newark Airport stop, {{there would be a}} transfer to a people mover to the terminals themselves. Preliminary studies of the right-of-way, as well as a design contract, were conducted that year. This [...] extension was approved in 1975. However, the Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration was wary of the proposed extension's usefulness and was reluctant to give the $322 million in funds that the Port Authority had requested for the project, which represented about 80% of the projected cost at the time. Eventually, the administration agreed to back the PATH extension. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Port Authority's use of bonds to finance the extension was not permitted, significantly <b>setting</b> <b>back</b> the project. In June 1976, the extension, then estimated to cost $600 million, was canceled completely in favor of improved bus service in New Jersey.|$|E

The tempest of the night was owing to the simple fact, that a condensed and chilled column of the mountains had pressed upon the heated substratum of the lake, and the latter, after a long resistance, suddenly finding vent for its escape, had been obliged to let in the cataract from above.
