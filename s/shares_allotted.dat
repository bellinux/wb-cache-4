But Mr. Wharton had promised to pay for the shares, and when money was concerned his word would surely suffice. Mr. Hartlepod, backed by two of the Directors, said that if the thing was to go on at all, the money must really be paid at once.

5000|$|He {{said about}} the Khalka Mongols: [...] "The family was based on monogamous marriage. Polygyny occurred, but was very rare and countenanced only for reason of {{sterility}} in the first wife. ... Custom required {{that at least one}} of the man's sons should remain always with the parents to care for them in their old age and to inherit the core of the family's property; but other sons were generally given separate shares and their economic independence, plus the movable nature of the property itself, made it possible for them to leave their father's camp. ... The terms abaga and aca are used to express not only ascendant-descendant generational ranking, but also the relative seniority of two collateral lines. Where successive generations descend patrilineally from two brothers, the line from the elder brother is the senior line, and the line from the younger brother is the junior line. All successive generations in the senior line are senior to corresponding generations in the junior line, and are known collectively as the abagiin üye ("uncle" [...] generations); reciprocally, all generations in the junior line are known as the aciin üye ("nephew" [...] generations). Hence, persons in corresponding generations in two collateral lines refer to each other reciprocally as abaga aha/egci and aca hüu/hüuhen. Under these circumstances, relative age terms are not employed. That is, Ego cannot say abaga düu for an abaga cousin younger than himself, nor aca aha for an aca cousin older than himself. The reason for this is clear: the Khalka system distinguishes between paternal cousins solely on the basis of the relative seniority of the two brothers who head the collateral lines, and makes these distinctions by using generation terms (abaga, aca) instead of relative age terms (aha, düü). The relative age of two cousins is not considered in the reckoning. ... The terms üyeeld, hayaald, etc. are combined with the terms abaga and aca so that collateral kinsmen may be distinguished not only according to whether they are in ascendant or descendant generations, or of senior or junior rank, with respect to the speaker[...]. Where equality of age and generation tended to minimize reserve, seniority ranking tended to increase it - i.e. in the presence of one's age and generation equals, one was more reserved if they were of senior rank than if they were of equal rank. ... Younger siblings addressed elder siblings as aha or egci, and were in turn addressed by their personal names. If there were several elder siblings of same sex, the younger sibling generally addressed only the eldest as aha or egci, and the others by abgailana terms. ... Ordinarily, younger siblings did not call elder siblings by their personal names. ... An elder brother could punish a younger brother by striking him, and the younger brother was expected not to strike back if he was not of age. When he came of age, he could strike back with impunity. However, a family was criticized by outsiders if two brothers had a long-standing feud, and quarrels between siblings were considered worse than those between spouses. ... An elder brother couuld ask a younger brother to perform certain services for him - e.g. saddle his horse - but younger brothers did not expect the service to be reciprocated. ... When an elder brother assumed trusteeship of the family after the father's death, he did not merit from his brothers all the respect shown to the father by his sons. In such cases, younger brothers often fought with elder brothers over <b>shares</b> <b>allotted</b> to them at the time the property was finally divided; this is one of the reasons why fathers liked to divide property before their death".|$|E
40|$|Political and {{economic}} factors usually determine the harvest sharesallotted to heterogeneous fisher groups harvesting upon the same fishstock. Given that the fishers harvest upon different segments of a fishstock with, for instance, cannibalistic tendencies, the shares allottedmay have considerable effect upon {{the well-being of the}} stock and theeconomics of the fishery. This paper analyses an existing allocationrule defining harvest <b>shares</b> <b>allotted</b> to two vessel groups (trawlers andcoastal vessels) in the Norwegian cod fishery. We apply a model with twointeracting age groups within a single fish stock, where the interactionhas both biological {{and economic}} implications. Requiring a first bestapproach to an optimal stock size results in no harvest in the firstyears studied. In order to ensure harvest amounts close to the historicharvest, we design a second best model giving optimal biological sharesin the build-up phase of the stock, and bioeconomic optimal shares atthe optimum fish stock level. The second best model recommends that foran increasing stock size the trawlers should obtain decreasing shares. We find that the actual allocation rule functions in a manner oppositeto the second best model, since this rule allocates an increasing shareto the trawlers for an increasing stock size.

40|$|Prior Hong Kong-based {{studies have}} dealt {{predominantly}} with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) configured in a single-tranche offer form (see McGuinness (1992); Cheng et al. (2004); Fung et al. (2004); Vong (2006) {{for the main}} board; and Vong and Zhao (2008) for the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)). This study revisits the issue by examining a recent set of IPOs utlizing a dual-tranche offer form, in which a local retail offer {{is accompanied by a}} book-built placing. This mechanism utilizes a number of features ('claw-backs', adjustable offer prices and over-allotment options) which allow for important supply and demand adjustments during the offer period. The absence of such features within the single-tranche offer form, which prevailed right up {{to the end of the}} 1990 s, suggests radically different pricing characteristics across single- and dual-tranche regimes. Assessment is first made of ex-ante type variables, constructed using publicly available data prior to the close in retail applications. Average retail subscription rates on issues immediately prior to a given offering, the clustering of IPOs and the performance of the overall Hong Kong secondary market in the period surrounding the retail application window all serve as significant factors in explaining both IPO returns and excess subscription demand. Mainland PRC-incorporation (H-share issuers), advising sponsorship quality, an issuer's propensity to disclose a forecast of earnings and price-to-earnings levels also appear significant. In terms of ex-post variables, both IPO underpricing and subscription demand were positively related to over-allotment option exercise and the SD of post-listing returns. Significantly, there is no evidence to support the notion that the incidence and/or size of subsequent seasoned equity issues helps to promote IPO underpricing. This is investigated by examining equity capital-raising activities over a 36 -month post-listing period. Given the mixed evidence to date (across markets and studies) on this issue, the results documented in this study provide an additional important data point to suggest that seasoned equity issuance is of second-order importance in relation to IPO underpricing. Finally, a measurement form for excess demand was also developed to reflect the idiosyncratic nature of the dual-tranche allotment mechanism. Subscription numbers were evaluated in relation to retail tranche supply adjustments, arising from 'claw-backs' and employee share allotments. Consistent with Vong's (2006) earlier work on simple IPO subscription rates, after-market volatility appeared much more strongly tied to excess demand than to initial return levels. A number of analogues of excess demand, notably over-allotment option exercise and the proportion of <b>shares</b> <b>allotted</b> to retail applicants subscribing at the minimum order level, were significant in explaining initial returns. Finally, and consistent with Hanley (1993), higher initial return levels were apparent in issues priced towards the upper end of the offer price range. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} features of the Finnish Companies Act 21. 7. 2006 / 624 (hereinafter the FCA) is the system of so-called true non-par value shares. The Finnish true non-par value system offers companies the opportunity to allot shares completely free of charge even in a directed share issue, i. e. when the pre-emptive rights of the existing shareholders are derogated. This opportunity could be risky, especially {{from the viewpoint of}} the minority shareholders, if the required majority of shareholders could in a shareholders meeting freely adopt a resolution about that kind of share issue. In practice, this would mean that a part of the share of the assets and of the power in the company of the old shareholders could be transferred to the new shareholders. However, the use of the directed share issue without payment is restricted by certain material grounds defined in the FCA. Pursuant to chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA, a directed share issue without payment is allowed only if there is an especially weighty reason both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company. The aim of this research is to formulate a meaningful interpretation of the wording of chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA, which {{could be used as a}} test when it must be judged, is there an especially weighty reason for the same both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company. My main thesis proposes that besides the formal or judicial principle of equality between shareholders, the principle of equality in its entirety, as it is known in Finnish company law, also has an economic dimension, which can be referred to as the principle of economic equality between shareholders. As such, a directed share issue without payment always means a breach against the equality of shareholders in the formal sense. However, if the company acquires enough substantial economic benefits through that kind of share issue, the real financial position and value of shareholdings of even those shareholders, who are not entitled to the <b>shares</b> <b>allotted</b> without charge, might remain untouched or even improve. The economic equality of shareholders could then be the core of the material grounds of the directed share issue without consideration. This thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 describes the objects and hypotheses of the research, its methods, the most important sources and its structure. Chapters 2 and 3 are the theoretical or general part of the research. The former contains discussion about historical and modern corporate law theories, the concept of a share in a company limited by shares and the relevance of the investment made to a company s capital against the shares. The latter deals with the principle of equality between shareholders and the different dimensions of that principle. Chapters 4 and 5 constitute the practical part of the research. The former provides detailed presentation of the directed share issue without payment as a process. The latter focuses to the interpretation of the especially weighty reason for the same both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company and provides examples about acceptable grounds to the directed share issue without payment. Finally, chapter 6 summarizes the theses and conclusions of the research. The main conclusions of this research are that Finnish company law contains a principle of the economic equality of shareholders as a mandatory rule, and this rule is based on the economic purpose of business companies and the material objectives of the equality principle in company law. The residual position of shareholders in a business company is still based on a contribution to the company. However, even an indirect improvement of the financial position of the company as a result of a directed share issue without payment can be considered as the equivalent of a contribution, i. e. the directed share issue without payment should not be, in effect, a share issue without payment as it would be understood in everyday language. The principle of economic equality also gives a meaningful bedrock to the interpretation of chapter 9 section 4 subsection 1 of the FCA. This principle can then be considered a distinctive feature between the material grounds of the normal directed share issue against payment and the directed share issue without payment. In the former type of directed share issue, the adequate issue price plays a central role and fulfils the objective of economic equality. In the directed share issue without payment other kinds of benefits to the company and the evaluation of economic equality against those benefits will have an independent role. A directed share issue without payment must always be in the interests of the company, the benefit it provides to the company must be substantial and of an economic nature, and it must be defendable when compared to the interests of all shareholders of the company. This latter part of the material grounds of the directed share issue without payment must be interpreted as an example of the mandatory principle of economic equality between shareholders. The essential meaning of that principle in the directed share issue without payment is that the dilution of formal shareholder rights of old shareholders must be compensated in economic sense through the enhanced financial position of the company as a whole. The evaluation of such an expected compensation must, however, be made at the time of the share issue resolution, not retrospectively. Tutkimuksen aiheena on suunnattu maksuton osakeanti ja sen aineellisen perusteen osakeyhtiölain (624 / 2006) 9 luvun 4 §:n 1 momentissa tarkoitettu yhtiön kannalta ja sen kaikkien osakkeenomistajien etu huomioon ottaen erityisen painava taloudellinen syy tulkinta. Suunnatun maksuttoman osakeannin mekanismina mahdollistaa osakeyhtiölaissa omaksuttu nimellisarvoton osakeyhtiön pääomajärjestelmä, jossa osakkeiden antaminen ei edellytä osakepääoman korottamista. Sellaisenaan suunnattu maksuton anti näyttää osakkeenomistajien yhdenvertaisuuden kannalta ongelmalliselta menettelyltä: annin ulkopuolelle jäävien osakkeenomistajien suhteellinen osuus yhtiössä supistuu, eikä yhtiöön välittömästi tule uusia varoja. Keskeisenä väitteenä tutkimuksessa on, että yhdenvertaisuudella osakeyhtiössä on taloudellinen ulottuvuus, jonka turvaaminen on myös osa suunnatun maksuttoman annin aineellista perustetta. Osakkeenomistajien taloudellinen yhdenvertaisuus toteutuu, kun annista seuraavan yhtiön taloudellisen aseman parantumisen voidaan perustellusti odottaa korvaavan annin ulkopuolelle jäävien osakkeenomistajien suhteellisen yhtiöosuuden laimenemisen. Vaatimus yhtiön taloudellisen aseman paranemisesta tai kääntäen yhtiön taloudellisen aseman heikkenemisen torjumisesta merkitsee, että annin maksuttomuuden on oltava näennäistä. Taloudellinen yhdenvertaisuus periaatteena antaa mielekkään sisällön suunnatun maksuttoman annin perusteeseen sisältyvälle kaikkien osakkeenomistajien edun huomioon ottamisen vaatimukselle. Suunnatun maksuttoman annin perusteen tulkinta taustoitetaan tutkimuksessa käsittelemällä osakeyhtiötä koskevia teorioita viimeisen sadan vuoden ajalta, osakeyhtiön oikeushenkilöyttä, osakkeen käsitesisältöä, osakkeen maksullisuuden ja nimellisarvon merkitystä, osakeyhtiöoikeudellisen yhdenvertaisuusperiaatteen eri ulottuvuuksia sekä yhtiön edun sisältöä ja merkitystä. Suunnatun maksuttoman annin aineellisesta perusteesta hahmotetaan testi, jota vasten menettelyn sallittavuutta eri käytännön tilanteissa voidaan arvioida.
