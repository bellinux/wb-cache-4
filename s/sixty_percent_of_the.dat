Ragnar Lyng replaced Adeserø {{as chairman and}} Johan H. Gedde-Dahl was hired as managing director. Original plans were to start operations on 24 October 1987, but {{this had to be}} postponed due to late delivery of the aircraft. Revenue flights commenced in February 1988, after delivery of the airline's first 148-passenger Boeing 737-300, City of Trondheim. The airline's second 737-300, City of Stavanger, was delivered the same month, but was leased to Monarch Airlines.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, BLM {{said it would}} reduce the herd from its {{existing}} 195 adults to 120. The stated goal was to temporarily remove horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. <b>Sixty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's conformity to type using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg, and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed.|$|E

25|$|San Jose's {{position}} in Silicon Valley triggered further economic and population growth. Results from the 1990 U.S. Census indicated that San Jose surpassed San Francisco {{as the most}} populous city in the Bay Area for the first time. This growth led to the highest housing-cost increase in the nation, 936% between 1976 and 2001. Efforts to increase density continued into the 1990s when an update of the 1974 urban plan kept the urban growth boundaries intact and voters rejected a ballot measure to ease development restrictions in the foothills. <b>Sixty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing built in San Jose since 1980 and over three-quarters of the housing built since 2000 have been multifamily structures, reflecting a political propensity toward Smart Growth planning principles.|$|E
25|$|The state’s history {{during the}} most of the 19th century was tumultuous, {{along with the rest of}} the country. From Independence until the 1860s, Liberal and Conservative {{elements}} occupied the capital at one time or another, until Liberal leader Jesús González Ortega seized control of the state permanently in 1859. This leader’s decrees against Conservative sympathizers drove many Catholic priests out of the state. In 1861, French troops occupied Zacatecas but only for two years before being driven out. For the rest of the century, the state was mostly controlled by local strongmen, such as González Ortega, Trinidad García de la Cadena and Genero Codina.

25|$|Brown {{decided to}} run for another term as {{governor}} in 2010, and was able to do so due to a grandfather clause in a term-limit law passed in 1990 for California state office. The law limited a governor to two terms; however, the four living governors when the law was passed (which consisted of himself, Brown's father Pat, his predecessor Ronald Reagan, and his successor George Deukmejian, who was in office when the law was enacted) remained eligible. Brown defeated Meg Whitman in 2010 to become the 39th California Governor in 2011; on October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving governor in California history, surpassing Earl Warren. Brown was re-elected in 2014, with <b>sixty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote.

25|$|Other major {{problems}} facing the canal system is the damage by introduced species and disease destroying native ones. Water lilies {{were introduced to the}} canals from Brazil in the 1940s. Since then, they have become a serious problem as their overgrowth depletes minerals and oxygen from the water. Up to 400 tons of the plant has been extracted from the canals monthly. In 2006, a Brazilian insect (Anthonomus grandis) was introduced to the canals to help control the plant. However, some need to be maintained because the axolotls are using them for reproduction purposes. Introduced species include carp and tilapia, which were introduced in the 1960s. However, these have been very detrimental to the native ecosystem, especially the axolotl, whose eggs they eat. Despite tons of the fish being caught in the canals, they are still a serious problem. Another major problem is the loss of trees, especially junipers in the ecological zone. Over <b>sixty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area is considered to be serious deforested and eighty percent of the junipers have the parasitic plant mistletoe.|$|E

According to Jared Bybee, BLM wild horse and burro specialist, grass cover on the range was at just 18 percent of its historic average. <b>Sixty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth.
