40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to analyze and {{optimize}} the stand-by component of power in digital circuits designed for portable and battery-powered applications. Since these circuits remain in <b>stand-by</b> (or sleep) <b>mode</b> significantly longer than in active <b>mode,</b> their <b>stand-by</b> current, and not their active switching current, determines their battery life. Hence, stringent specifications are being placed on the stand-by (or leakage) current drawn by such devices. As the power supply voltage is reduced, the threshold voltage of transistors is scaled down to maintain a constant switching speed. Since reducing the threshold voltage increases the leakage of a device exponentially, leakage current has become a dominant factor {{in the design of}} VLSI circuits. In this paper, we describe a method that uses simultaneous dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB) to reduce the total power consumption of a processor under dynamic computational workloads. Analytical models of the leakage current, dynamic power, and frequency as a function of supply voltage and body bias are derived and verified with SPICE simulation. Given these models, we show how to derive an analytical expression for the optimal trade-off between supply voltage and body bias, given a required clock frequency and duration of operation. The proposed method is then applied to a processor and is compared with DVS alone for workloads obtained using real-time monitoring of processor utilization for four typical applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} {{of the remaining}} service life for a conveyor chain is still an important requirement of customers {{which has not been}} solved satisfactorily up to now. The life time sensor developed through the research project “Intelligent Conveyor Chain” constitutes a new approach for long term data logging of chain loads. Fatigue assessment requires the determination of the curve for standing loads and the actual load range. As part of the accumulated damage assessment the damage arising during each individual load cycle is added up. When the total value reaches 1, this indicates a technical crack which will lead to a failure of the structural element of the chain. Determination of the remaining lifetime is based on the recording time of the associated load range data. The longer the recording time during operation the more representative is the load range data and as a result, the fatigue assessment is more reliable. Whereas the Wöhler curves have been determined experimentally {{for a wide range of}} different materials they can alternatively be estimated empirically by taking static strength values. In this case the load range has to be determined based on the original load time function of the structural element, independently from the method of fatigue assessment being used. The automotive and aircraft building industries for example have accumulated a huge amount of reliable load range data based on countless prototype tests. Non-standard manufactured products can not be tested to such a level of complexity. For these types of products the design process is limited to the use of estimated load range data. In the field of Condition Monitoring the customer increasingly demands a fatigue assessment indicating the potential service life of parts. The current market provides many different monitoring systems for measuring the load on parts. Most of these systems have to be connected by wire to the measuring point and as a result they are not appropriate for moving parts. Therefore telemetry systems which use wireless communication between the measuring point and the recording device can be used as an alternative. However the time of recording is mostly restricted by the capacity of the battery due to the high power consumption of these devices. Furthermore the space required for the batteries as well for the antennae is considerable. Such conventional telemetry systems are not suitable for installation directly into a conveyor chain. The newly developed “life time sensor” uses a novel concept which enables, for the first time, the long term data logging of chain loads for a service life of up to 3 years. The extension of service life compared to conventional telemetry has been achieved by miniaturisation of the system and the application of energy efficient components. In addition, by employing a measuring frequency matched to the operating conditions, combined with defined power saving, <b>stand-by</b> <b>modes,</b> the service life of these devices is greatly increased. With an outer diameter of about 25 mm and a length of less than 30 mm, these devices can be fitted directly into a chain conveyor link. Another advantage is the pre-processing of measurement data. Within the “life time sensor” the measured data is classified into matrix form to reduce the memory requirements. The advantage of matrix evaluated data compared to cyclic pitch data based on Rainflow counting or cycle counting Algorithms, is the consideration of the shift in the mean stress. Successful testing of the data logging, measurement data pre-processing and wireless communication has been carried out on various test installations at the company Thiele GmbH. The modified Markov matrix counting and the fatigue assessment of the conveyor chain have been verified on a test stand called “Hydropulser”. When a comparison was made between the chain link damage on the basis of the predetermined load variation and the results based on the measured load variation of the “life time sensor” they were found to match. There is a mismatch between the theoretical and the determined remaining life time due to the type of testing carried out, so that chain damage occurred at a calculated value of 0. 46. A reliable adjustment of the fatigue assessment using the relative form is feasible at a first field test in an underground longwall and not at a test stand in a predefined environment. The results of the research and development carried out in this project, have demonstrated that long term data logging combined with measurement data pre processing is possible. Determination of the actual chain load range and thus the remaining chain life is now available. The “life time sensor” offers a reliable basis for condition monitoring of chain conveyors. Further Research and development will demonstrate the possible use of these devices in other fields of application...|$|R
40|$|This era would {{probably}} be recognized as the information age, hence as a paramount milestone in the progress of mankind, by the future historians. One {{of the most significant}} achievements of this age is, making it possible to transmit and receive information effectively and reliably via wireless radio technology. The demand of wireless communication is increasing in a never-resting pace, imposing bigger challenge not only on service providers but also on innovators and researches to innovate out-of-the-box technologies. These challenges include faster data communication over seamless, reliable and cost effective wireless networks, utilizing the limited physical radio resources as well as considering the environmental impact caused by the increasing energy consumption. The ever-expanding wireless communication infrastructure is withdrawing higher energy than ever, raising the need for finding more efficient systems. The challenge of developing efficient wireless systems can be addressed on several levels, starting from device electronics, up to the network-level architecture and protocols. The anticipated gains of achieving such efficiency is the key feature of extending mobile devices&# 039; battery life and reducing environmental and economic impacts of wireless communication infrastructure. Therefore energy efficient designs are urgently needed from both environmental and economic aspects of wireless networks. In this research, we explore the field of energy efficiency in MAC and Physical layers of wireless networks in order to enhance the performance and reliability of future wireless networks as well as to reduce its environmental footprint. In {{the first part of this}} research, we analyse the energy efficiency of two mostly used modulation techniques, namely MQAM and MFSK, for short range wireless transmissions, up to a few 100 s of meters, and propose optimum rate adaptation to minimize the energy dissipation during transmissions. Energy consumed for transmitting the data over a distance to maintain a prescribed error probability together with the circuit energy have been considered in our work. We provide novel results for optimal rate adaptation for improved energy efficiency. Our results indicate that the energy efficiency can be significantly improved by performing optimal rate adaptation given the radio and channel parameters, and furthermore we identify the maximum distance where optimal rate adaptation can be performed beyond which the optimum rate then becomes the same as the minimum data rate. In the second part of this research, we propose energy efficient algorithm for cellular base stations. In cellular networks, the base stations are the most energy consuming parts, which consume approximately 60 - 80 % of the total energy. Hence control and optimization of energy consumption at base stations should be at the heart of any green radio engineering scheme. Sleep mode implementation in base stations has proven to be a very good approach for the energy efficiency of cellular BSs. Therefore, we have proposed a novel strategy for improving energy efficiency on ternary state transceivers for cellular BSs. We consider transceivers that are capable of switching between sleep, <b>stand-by</b> and active <b>modes</b> whenever required. We have modelled these ternary state transceivers as a three-state Markov model and have presented an algorithm based on Markov model to intelligently switch among the states of the transceivers based on the offered traffic whilst maintaining a prescribed minimum rate per user. We consider a typical macro BS with state changeable transceivers and our results show that it is possible to improve the energy efficiency of the BS by approximately 40 % using the proposed MDP based algorithm. In the third part of this research, we propose energy efficient algorithm for aerial base stations. Recently aerial base stations are investigated to provide wireless coverage to terrestrial radio terminals. The advantages of using aerial platforms in providing wireless coverage are many including larger coverage in remote areas, better line-of-sight conditions etc. Energy is a scarce resource for aerial base stations, hence the wise management of energy is quite beneficial for the aerial network. In this context, we study the means of reducing the total energy consumption by designing and implementing an energy efficient aerial base station. Sleep mode implementation in base stations (BSs) has proven to be a very good approach for improving the energy efficiency; therefore we propose a novel strategy for further improving energy efficiency by considering ternary state transceivers of aerial base stations. Using the three state model we propose a Markovian Decision process (MDP) based algorithm to switch between the states for improving the energy efficiency of the aerial base station. The MDP based approach intelligently switches between the states of the transceivers based on the offered traffic whilst maintaining a prescribed minimum channel rate per user. Our simulation results show that there is a around 40 % gain in the energy efficiency when using our proposed MDP algorithm together with the three-state transceiver model for the base station compared to the always active mode. We have also shown the energy-delay trade-off in order to design an efficient aerial base station. In the final part of our work, we propose a novel energy efficient handover algorithm, based on Markov decision process (MDP) for the two-tier LTE network, towards reducing power transmissions at the mobile terminal side. The proposed policy is LTE backward-compatible, as it can be employed by suitably adapting a prescribed SNR target and standard LTE measurements. Simulation results reveal that compared to the widely adopted policy based on strongest cell and another energy efficient policy, our proposed policy can greatly reduce the power consumption at the LTE mobile terminals. Most of our works presented in this dissertation has been published in conference proceeding and some of them are currently undergoing a review process for journals. These publications will be highlighted and identified at the end of the first chapter of this dissertation...|$|R
