40|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>self-balancing</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{in modern times}} is rising {{as the price of}} consumer electronics is on a steady decline. Consumers have more access to smarter electronics and mechatronics devices. <b>Self-Balancing</b> <b>vehicles</b> have become an exciting new method of human transport that have the potential to redefine the way we traverse our cities. This document will outline the research, design, construction, implementation and analysis that has been undertaken to develop from the ground up, a scaled down version of a self-balancing vehicle. The two wheeled self-balancing robot discussed in this project will take advantage of National Instruments myRIO- 1900 embedded hardware device and will utilize the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) embedded hardware along with PID feedback control loops to achieve stabilization in this inherently unstable system. The final section of this document details the techniques used to achieve this objective and suggests future works for the project that would enable future students {{to take advantage of this}} new student engineering asset...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a self-balancing {{personal}} mobility vehicle with a hybrid driving mechanism, called as Wi-PMP, and discuss its features from {{the perspectives of}} its power-assist driving performance and a rider's evaluation. The mobility vehicle consists of a wheeled inverted pendulum type mobile platform, and a hybrid driving mechanism that can use human and motor power together for driving. By performing a bump driving, a slope driving, and a outdoor driving experiment, we confirm that the proposed hybrid mechanism is valid for the integration of human and motor power, and is effective to increase the driving power and reduce electrical load on motors and batteries. We conducted several experiments to investigate the rider's evaluation on a sit-riding method compared to a stand-riding one. The questionnaire results showed that a rider felt more comfortable {{in the case of the}} sit-riding method when getting on and off, and when driving the mobility vehicle. This implies that riding-type <b>self-balancing</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as Wi-PMP have the potential to become familiar personal mobility vehicles in daily life...|$|E

30|$|Poor user {{experience}} {{is caused by}} the current unstable operation of the two-wheel <b>self-balancing</b> <b>vehicle</b> control system, the high failure rate, and the poor accuracy and sensitivity of the control system (prone to deviation). Therefore, the work studied the two-wheel <b>self-balancing</b> <b>vehicle</b> system with the visual recognition of vehicle attitude. Kalman filtering and PID control algorithm were adopted to reduce the high frequency interference of the accelerometer and the low frequency error of the gyroscope, improve the response speed and control precision of motor to error, and ensure vertical control. The road images were acquired by a charge-coupled device vision sensor with the edge information extracted by the Laplacian operator, which ensures autonomous navigation control of a balance car. Based on the calculation of the distance between road axis and the existence detection of forward obstacles, the early warning mechanism was established through the calculation of the group agent to improve the safety performance of a balance vehicle. Experiments showed the improved control system has good stability, fast walking speed, strong anti-interference, and high security.|$|R

30|$|The {{control system}} of {{existing}} balance vehicles has unstable operating conditions, high failure rate, and low accuracy and sensitivity during handling (prone to deviation), {{which results in}} poor user experience [1 – 3]. The work studied the two-wheel <b>self-balancing</b> <b>vehicle</b> system with the visual recognition of vehicle attitude, which solves accurate vertical control, visual autonomous navigation, and early warning mechanism. Kalman filtering and process identifier (PID) control algorithm are used to reduce the high frequency interference of the accelerometer and the low frequency error of the gyroscope, improve the response speed and control precision of the motor to error, and ensure good vertical control. Road images were obtained by the charge-coupled device (CCD) vision sensor of the balancing vehicle, performing grayscale equalization enhancement, median filtering, binarization, and the extraction of Laplacian operator edge information. It ensured autonomous navigation of balancing vehicle. Existence detection was performed by the calculation of distance between road edgy and axis and the frontal obstacles with gray feature. The early warning mechanism of the system was established by group agent calculation, which improved the safety of balance vehicle. It is expected that the market acceptance will be improved. Experiments showed the improved control system can stably control the balance vehicle, with fast traveling speed, strong anti-interference, and high safety.|$|R

40|$|To {{provide a}} long-time {{reliable}} orientation, sensor fusion technologies {{are widely used}} to integrate available inertial sensors for the low-cost orientation estimation. In this paper, a novel dual-linear Kalman filter was designed for a multi-sensor system integrating MEMS gyros, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. The proposed filter precludes the impacts of magnetic disturbances on the pitch and roll which the heading is subjected to. The filter can achieve robust orientation estimation for different statistical models of the sensors. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the estimated attitude angles are reduced by 30. 6 % under magnetic disturbances. Owing to the reduction of system complexity achieved by smaller matrix operations, the mean total time consumption is reduced by 23. 8 %. Meanwhile, the separated filter offers greater flexibility for the system configuration, as {{it is possible to}} switch on or off the second stage filter to include or exclude the magnetometer compensation for the heading. Online experiments were performed on the homemade miniature orientation determination system (MODS) with the turntable. The average RMSE of estimated orientation are less than 0. 4 ° and 1 ° during the static and low-dynamic tests, respectively. More realistic tests on two-wheel <b>self-balancing</b> <b>vehicle</b> driving and indoor pedestrian walking were carried out to evaluate the performance of the designed MODS when high accelerations and angular rates were introduced. Test results demonstrate that the MODS is applicable for the orientation estimation under various dynamic conditions.
