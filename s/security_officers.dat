5|$|United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>officers</b> are {{generally}} responsible for security within the UN Headquarters.

The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers.

5|$|Hilary Minc, {{the third}} in command in Bolesław Bierut's {{political}} triumvirate of Stalinist leaders, became the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Industry, Industry and Commerce, and the Economic Affairs.

5|$|The boy Jones was an {{intruder}} who gained {{entry to the}} palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran {{out of the room and}} no conversation took place.

5000|$|The <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> is {{abruptly}} teleported to help {{hold back}} boarding parties while Durandal teleports all remaining Human and S'pht crew to a stronghold on the planet's surface. The <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> is mostly successful, but matters are complicated when Durandal tells the <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> {{that they are}} being personally targeted by Tycho. Durandal, not wanting to [...] "end up like Leela," [...] has the <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> destroy his core logic centers to avoid capture by the Pfhor. Once the <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> destroys Durandal, nothing is left to keep him from being teleported by the Pfhor and he is captured by Tycho.|$|R
50|$|The game moves ahead several weeks. The <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> {{has been}} in Pfhor captivity, but a group of the {{remaining}} humans launch a surprise attack on the prison and free the <b>security</b> <b>officer.</b> The <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> is contacted by Robert Blake, {{the leader of the}} human group. Blake informs the player that Durandal was looking for an ancient S'pht AI known as Thoth and sends him to reactivate it. As the <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> does this, Blake and the remaining humans continue to lose their struggle against the Pfhor. After being transported to the final activation site, the <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> loses contact with the human remnants, but is successful in activating Thoth.|$|R

5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite <b>security</b> <b>officers.</b>|$|E

Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued.
