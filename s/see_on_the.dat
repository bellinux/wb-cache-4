5|$|Sucker Punch began {{planning}} {{the game as}} early as 2010, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the Infamous series onto {{a new generation of}} hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions they would like to <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E

He was then captured by the Germans and became a Prisoner of War.|$|E

25|$|The {{tour was}} officially {{announced}} on On Air with Ryan Seacrest during an interview, {{where it was}} mentioned the groups recording a single to be later released. To promote the tour further, the groups conducted a live Q session on Ustream. The groups also performed at the 38th Annual American Music Awards to give the public {{a taste of what}} they would <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour. For an interview on Entertainment Tonight, Donnie Wahlberg held a picture of the proposed staging, which featured a standard concert stage with an extended catwalk leading to a circular platform.|$|E
25|$|The Penny Black lasted {{less than}} a year. A red {{cancellation}} was hard to <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> black design and the red ink was easy to remove; both {{made it possible to}} re-use cancelled stamps. In February 1841, the Treasury switched to the Penny Red and began using black ink for cancellations instead, which was more effective and harder to remove. However, people still reused stamps by combining the uncancelled parts of two stamps to form an unused whole, so in 1864 as a further safeguard the top corner stars on the Penny Red were replaced by the lower corner check letters in reverse order.|$|E
25|$|A Diocesan Bishop {{may have}} bishops who assist in his ministry. The Coadjutor Bishop of a see {{has the right}} of {{succession}} on the death or resignation of the Diocesan Bishop, and, if the see is an archdiocese, holds the title of Archbishop. Similarly, a retired Diocesan Bishop keeps his connection with the see {{to which he was}} appointed, and is known as Bishop (or Archbishop) Emeritus of that <b>see.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, an Auxiliary Bishop, who may also hold posts such as vicar general or episcopal vicar, is appointed bishop of a titular see, a see that in the course of history has ceased to exist as an actual jurisdictional unit.|$|E

25|$|The Indus civilisation's economy {{appears to}} have {{depended}} significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The IVC {{may have been the}} first civilisation to use wheeled transport. These advances may have included bullock carts that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indus River today; however, there is secondary evidence of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and what they regard as a docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal in western India (Gujarat state). An extensive canal network, used for irrigation, has however also been discovered by H.-P. Francfort.|$|E
25|$|Hatra in contrast, had {{numerous}} stone statues representing deities or local rulers {{and their family}} members. The local upper class donated the statues of the temples to the city, where they were found by the excavations. Many of these works are precisely dated by inscriptions of the donor and provide a good chronological framework. There is also sometimes even the mention of a sculptor's name, such as Aba or Schabaz. In addition to works in the classical Greco-Hellenistic tradition (especially of classical deities) they show the people sitting or standing, facing front and dressed in Parthian fashion with rich regalia. The men wear shoes, pants and a tunic over it. Over the tunic some men wear a kind of jacket. Often you can <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side a dagger, a sword on his right hip. Kings wear a tiara with a diadem or tiara {{with the image of}} an eagle. The right hand is usually raised in a gesture of adoration to the top, the left hand holds a sword or a palm branch. Other statues carry in both hands a statue of God. There is striking attention to detail. The patterns of the substances, weapons and jewelry are reproduced exactly.|$|E
25|$|The main mode for Rock Band 4 is a Band Tour career mode which IGN {{described}} as a role-playing game. Within the narrative of the Band Tour, the players' band starts off as a small town group {{with a handful of}} fans. En route to becoming more popular and successful, the players are tasked with the option of what types of gigs they want their band to play, with various risks and rewards that influence: how many fans the group attains per geographic region; what future gigs they will have available; and how much in-game money they earn (which can be spent customizing their band's clothes and instruments). While {{there are a number of}} possible sets that the band can select from with more unlocked as the players progresses in the game, the primary means of advancing the band's narrative is through multi-part Tours which consist of 3 to 6 different shows to be played in order. At the start of each of these Tours, the players will have two options that will affect what type of song sets they will <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour and the benefits of completing each set and the overall Tour. For example, players are able to have their band take a corporate-sponsored gig, which will earn the band a large amount of in-game money, but may impact their band's reputation and limit future venues, while taking on smaller shows will not produce as much money, but increase the band's renown and open more possible gigs. Subsequent Tours may require the players to earn more stars from other, single Sets that are available, before that tour is available.|$|E

500|$|The {{score was}} {{composed}} by Inon Zur, who doesn't consider {{himself as the}} only person responsible for the musical work on Fallout 3. Zur cited [...] game director Todd Howard and the sound designer Mark Lambert, for helping him to manage the in-game sound implementation, claiming his own merit for only 50%. Zur also admitted that he conceived the soundtrack {{based on what the}} player would perceive on psychological level, rather than on what the player would <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, so placing the listener musically ahead over the environment in which he moves. Apart from a few exceptions, Inon Zur said that the soundtrack of the game was mainly composed using a sampler.|$|E
