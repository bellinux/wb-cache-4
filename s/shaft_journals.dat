40|$|A {{rotating}} machine usually {{consists of a}} rotor and bearings that supports it. The nonidealities in these components may excite vibration of the rotating system. The uncontrolled vibrations may lead to excessive wearing {{of the components of}} the {{rotating machine}} or reduce the process quality. Vibrations may be harmful even when amplitudes are seemingly low, as is usually the case in superharmonic vibration that takes place below the first critical speed of the rotating machine. Superharmonic vibration is excited when the rotational velocity of the machine is a fraction of the natural frequency of the system. In such a situation, a part of the machine’s rotational energy is transformed into vibration energy. The amount of vibration energy should be minimised in the design of rotating machines. The superharmonic vibration phenomena can be studied by analysing the coupled rotor-bearing system employing a multibody simulation approach. This research is focused on the modelling of hydrodynamic journal bearings and rotorbearing systems supported by journal bearings. In particular, the non-idealities affecting the rotor-bearing system and their effect on the superharmonic vibration of the rotating system are analysed. A comparison of computationally efficient journal bearing models is carried out in order to validate one model for further development. The selected bearing model is improved in order to take the waviness of the <b>shaft</b> <b>journal</b> into account. The improved model is implemented and analyzed in a multibody simulation code. A rotor-bearing system that consists of a flexible tube roll, two journal bearings and a supporting structure is analysed employing the multibody simulation technique. The modelled non-idealities are the shell thickness variation in the tube roll and the waviness of the <b>shaft</b> <b>journal</b> in the bearing assembly. Both modelled non-idealities may cause subharmonic resonance in the system. In multibody simulation, the coupled effect of the non-idealities can be captured in the analysis. Additionally one non-ideality is presented that does not excite the vibrations itself but affects the response of the rotorbearing system, namely the waviness of the bearing bushing which is the non-rotating part of the bearing system. The modelled system is verified with measurements performed on a test rig. In the measurements the waviness of bearing bushing was not measured and therefore it’s affect on the response was not verified. In conclusion, the selected modelling approach is an appropriate method when analysing the response of the rotor-bearing system.

40|$|The most {{sensitive}} {{component in the}} propulsion shafting system is the aft stern tube bearing, which is exposed to heavy static and dynamic propeller loads exerted to the bearing surface by the propeller shaft. The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Zagreb, and the American Bureau of Shipping intend {{to work on the}} development of the theoretical model of the stern tube journal bearing behaviour, which is proposed to be done in several stages. The initial stage is to consider nonlinear fl uid structural interaction, and this is the theory shown in this article. Owing to the fact that the <b>shaft</b> <b>journal</b> in operation lies on a lubricating fl uid fi lm, which separates the journal in the bearing from the bearing liner, the theoretical nonlinear model of the journal bearing may provide more insight in the behaviour of the shaft inside the bearing and help us to determine a more realistic elastic line of the shafting. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) initiated a research project to measure actual interaction between the shaft and the stern tube bearing with the goal of applying obtained knowledge in development of an accurate analytical/numerical model for shaftbearing analysis. The initial focus of the investigation was to capture the transient operation of the shaft inside the bearing and to observe the shaft’s hydrodynamic lift during starting, stopping and reversing of the engine. Proximity probes were used to monitor the shaft bearing interaction with micron precision. The installed probes measure the distance between the shaft and the bearing at eight locations inside the aft stern bush and at four locations inside the forward stern bush, and utilize obtained data to defi ne the shaft orbit and dynamics as it revolves in the bearing. The results of presented measurements show that the shaft behaviour inside the stern bush is very different depending on the locati inside the bush. Therefore, an analytical approach, which uses a simplifi ed theory of shaft bearing interaction, provides no practical value since it neglects shaft dynamics and interaction between fl uid and the structure...|$|R

A justification on measures that meet the required limits has been presented in the paper.

These solutions can be achieved through close application of all repair sizes of work-pieces with revision of their values, uniform removal of the allowance while cutting the work-pieces at optimum locating, application of coating processes only in technically justified cases, application of straightening with thermal fixing of its results or all-around compression of deformable elements.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a compressor changes during its lifetime, depending on various parameters such as operating conditions, type of the compressor, working fluid and type of the oil being used. Most performance degradation of the compressor is due to wear on the moving mechanical parts inside the compression vessel. Wear develops on the contact point(s) or area(s) between the moving and fixed mechanical parts inside the compressor {{when there is a}} lack of lubrication. In a rolling piston rotary compressor, the most vulnerable regions are the vane and roller contact area, and the <b>shaft</b> and <b>journal</b> bearing area. As the amount of wear increases, leakage through the clearances inside the compression compartment increases as well.

The objectives of this study are to predict the life span of rolling piston rotary-type compressors through the measurement of wear on the roller under accelerated test conditions, and predict the effect of wear on the degradation of compressor performance. In order to be able to estimate the amount of wear under different operating pressures, a correlation between operating pressures, amount of wear, and degradation of performance was developed. Then the change in compressor performance was estimated using a computer simulation program which takes into account the effect of leakage through the clearances inside the compression vessel based on the operating conditions provided. One unit of rolling piston rotary type compressor was tested under accelerated operating conditions.

The feasibility of measuring the mechanical impedance of bearing supports in order to assess the severity of vibration generated by a machine has been investigated.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} a {{lumped parameter model}} able to simulate the vibrational behavior {{of a wide range}} of variable displacement vane pumps. The vibration analysis of the rotating parts is carried out through a planar model with three degrees of freedom. It takes into account the variability of the pressure loads acting on the rotor <b>shaft,</b> the hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> bearing reactions, the friction due to viscous actions and contact forces, the rotor shaft stiffness and damping, the variation of the pump geometry with respect to working condition and all the inertia actions. In particular, the computation of pressure forces and torques is allowed by the preliminary evaluation of the variable pressure field acting inside the pump, obtained through a model based on an Euler’s approach with 26 control volumes. Thus, the present model makes it possible to define the pressure field acting inside the pump, and calculate the rotor shaft accelerations, as well as the journal bearing reaction forces and the motor drive torque absorbed by the pump in working condition. The test campaign and the validation method are then described: an original assessment technique based on the comparison of pump casing accelerations is proposed. Finally, some important simulation results are reported as an example of application. The main original contribution of this work concerns the development of a nonlinear model of variable displacement vane pumps including all the important dynamic effects in the same model, with the aim at taking into account their iterations. This can be important in order to foresee the influence of working conditions and design modifications on the pump vibrational behavior. In this sense the developed lumped parameter model could be a very useful tool in prototype design, in order to identify the origin of unwanted dynamic effects...|$|R
