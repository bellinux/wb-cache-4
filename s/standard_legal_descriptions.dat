40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{association}} between accounting <b>standards,</b> <b>legal</b> framework and the quality of financial reporting by the Ministry of Water and Environment in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach – The study used a self?administered questionnaire to survey 120 staff and stakeholders of the Ministry of the Water and Environment. Correlation analysis was employed to determine the association between accounting <b>standards,</b> <b>legal</b> framework and the quality of financial reporting. Findings – Results indicate that accounting <b>standards</b> and <b>legal</b> framework are all positively and significantly associated with the quality of financial reporting, providing evidence of the effect of accounting <b>standards</b> and <b>legal</b> framework on the quality of financial reporting in Uganda Research limitations/implications – Scarce literature using African data means that it is not possible to compare the findings to previous research. Practical implications – The finding of an association between accounting <b>standards,</b> the <b>legal</b> framework and quality of financial reporting implies that the government of Uganda needs to adopt a more robust approach in enforcing compliance to improve the quality of financial reports produced by the Ministry of Water and Environment. Originality/value – This study contributes to the dearth of evidence on government accounting literature in Africa by investigating for the first time, the association between accounting <b>standards,</b> <b>legal</b> framework and the quality of financial reporting by a government department. <br/...|$|R
