50|$|The Diamond Peak Wilderness {{is home to}} black-tailed deer, mule deer, and elk. In winter, {{the mule}} deer migrate eastward out of the {{wilderness}} to the sage desert, while black-tailed deer and elk drop down the west slope. Black bear and small mammals including marmots, <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbits,</b> squirrels, pine martens, foxes, and pikas inhabit the area all year long. The raven, Clark's nutcracker, Oregon jay, and water ouzel frequent the forest and streams year-round. Bufflehead and goldeneye ducks occasionally nest near the lakes.|$|R
60|$|He crawled over to {{his mate}} and tried to persuade her to get up. But she only snarled at him, and he walked out alone into the bright {{sunshine}} to find the snow-surface soft under foot and the travelling difficult. He went up the frozen bed of the stream, where the snow, shaded by the trees, was yet hard and crystalline. He was gone eight hours, {{and he came back}} through the darkness hungrier than when he had started. He had found game, but he had not caught it. He had broken through the melting snow crust, and wallowed, while the <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbits</b> had skimmed along on top lightly as ever.|$|R
40|$|The {{naturally}} occurring virus papillomas of western cottontail rabbits become malignant occasionally. The cancers {{derive from the}} papilloma cells, {{that is to say}} from elements already rendered neoplastic by the virus and still infected therewith. Papillomas produced with the virus in jack <b>rabbits</b> and <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbits</b> become cancerous in the same way but much more frequently, {{as is the case in}} domestic rabbits also. To all three species the virus is foreign. The character of the cancers of the wild rabbits is described and the relation of the virus to them discussed on the basis of experimental findings. The facts support the view that the cancers result from virus variation, this in many instances being but slight...|$|R
60|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbit,</b> blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team was in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest Police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed of which it held steadily. It ran lightly {{on the surface of the}} snow, while the dogs {{ploughed}} through by main strength. Buck led the pack, sixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay down low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap, like some pale frost wraith, the <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbit</b> flashed on ahead.|$|E
60|$|Smoke shot a snow-bird, {{and they}} divided it. Once, {{in a valley}} where willows budded {{standing}} in the snow, he shot a <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Another time he got a lean, white weasel. This much of meat they encountered, and no more, though, once, half-mile high and veering toward {{the west and the}} Yukon, they saw a wild-duck wedge drive by.|$|E
60|$|They {{were running}} along a narrow alley flanked {{on either side}} by a growth of young spruce. Through the trees {{the mouth of the}} alley could be seen, opening out on a moonlit glade. Old One Eye was rapidly {{overhauling}} the fleeing shape of white. Bound by bound he gained. Now he was upon it. One leap more and his teeth would be sinking into it. But that leap was never made. High in the air, and straight up, soared the shape of white, now a struggling <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbit</b> that leaped and bounded, executing a fantastic dance there above him in the air and never once returning to earth.|$|E
40|$|Carcinomas {{occasionally}} {{arise from}} the naturally occurring, cutaneous papillomas of cottontail rabbits (1), growths due to a virus discovered by Shope (2). This virus causes similar papillomas on inoculation into domestic, <b>snowshoe,</b> and jack <b>rabbits</b> (3), and in these foreign hosts its action results in malignancy far more often (4) than in cottontails. The cancers derive from the epidermal cells of the papillomas, whatever the host species (4), from elements {{that is to say}} which are proliferating as result of infection with the virus. These facts and others attest to the direct responsibility of the virus for the cancers, though whether it is their actuating principle is still uncertain. Domestic rabbits would seem best suited to experiments on the relation of the virus to the malignant growths, since these are rare in cottontails, and jack and <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbits</b> do badly in captivity. But the virus strains which engender vigorous papillomas in domestic rabbits, [...] and it is only from such growths that cancer is likely to arise, [...] cannot ordinarily b...|$|R

60|$|He {{found his}} hand {{resting on the}} pouch. With an inward smile at the curiosity that made him pull the draw-string, he opened it. Out poured a tiny flood of food. There was no {{particle}} of it {{that he did not}} recognize, all stolen by Labiskwee from Labiskwee--bread-fragments saved far back in the days ere McCan lost the flour; strips and strings of caribou-meat, partly gnawed; crumbles of suet; the hind-leg of the <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbit,</b> untouched; the hind-leg and part of the fore-leg of the white weasel; the wing dented still by her reluctant teeth, and the leg of the snow-bird--pitiful remnants, tragic renunciations, crucifixions of life, morsels stolen from her terrible hunger by her incredible love.|$|E
60|$|In a flash Buck knew it. The {{time had}} come. It {{was to the}} death. As they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the scene came to Buck {{with a sense of}} familiarity. He seemed to {{remember}} it all,--the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air--nothing moved, not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbit,</b> these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had always been, the wonted way of things.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{hard and}} simple life. Breakfast over, and they were at work by the first gray light; and when night descended, they did their cooking and camp-chores, smoked and yarned for a while, then rolled up in their sleeping-robes, and slept while the aurora borealis flamed {{overhead}} and the stars leaped and danced in the great cold. Their fare was monotonous: sour-dough bread, bacon, beans, and an occasional dish of rice cooked along {{with a handful of}} prunes. Fresh meat they failed to obtain. There was an unwonted absence of animal life. At rare intervals they chanced upon the trail of a <b>snowshoe</b> <b>rabbit</b> or an ermine; but in the main it seemed that all life had fled the land. It was a condition not unknown to them, for in all their experience, at one time or another, they had travelled one year through a region teeming with game, where, a year or two or three years later, no game at all would be found.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{animals and}} game species {{found in the}} forest include black bear, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, gray and fox squirrels, <b>rabbits,</b> <b>snowshoe</b> hare, woodcock, and grouse.

That is why you are often called a <b>Snowshoe</b> <b>Rabbit.</b> I gave you those big feet and make the hair grow out every winter because I know that you depend on your legs to get away from your enemies. You can run over the deep snow where your enemies break through. Peter, though he is small and lighter than you are, cannot go where you can. But Peter doesn't need to depend always on his legs to save his life. There is one thing more that I want you both to notice, and that is that you both have quite a lot of short hairs on the soles of you feet. That is where you differ from that cousin of yours down in the Sunny South. He has only a very few hairs on his feet. That is so he can swim better." ...|$|E
