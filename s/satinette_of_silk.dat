40|$|Abstract. A {{new concept}} of enzymatic {{coloration}} <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> fiber with tea polyphenols (TP) {{in the presence}} of Rhus vernicifera Laccase was proposed in this study. Three methods were investigated: the simultaneous enzymatic polymerization of TP and coloration <b>of</b> <b>silk,</b> the polymerization <b>of</b> TP with laccase followed by a further coloration <b>of</b> <b>silk,</b> and the adsorption <b>of</b> TP by <b>silk</b> followed by laccase treatment. All the methods, especially the first two methods can increase the color depth <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> and improve the color fastness. The color depth <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> increases with the dyeing time and the laccase concentration up to 4 U/mL at pH 5. 0 and 50 o C...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{influence}} of beating and refining {{as well as the}} fibre furnish on the properties <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> paper, such as air permeance, softness, pore size, tensile index and burst index. The results showed that the beating characteristic <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> fibre was similar to that of plant fibre, they all had the characteristic <b>of</b> fibrillation. <b>Silk</b> paper had excellent softness and air permeance when the beating degree <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> pulp was 20 °SR, 181. 3 µm/Pa·s and 2. 5 mN·m 2 /g respectively, which was superior to paper made from plant fibres of the same beating degree. The minimum average pore size <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> paper was 5. 11 µm at the beating degree of 20 °SR, and it decreased with the increase of beating degree, reached 0. 79 µm at the beating degree of 67 °SR. With the increase of beating degree, the tensile index <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> paper increased at first, and then decreased. The burst index <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> paper showed a upward trend, but the softness and air permeance of it constantly decreased.

The females digest the nuptial gifts, {{including}} the silk, during mating. Laboratory experiments {{were carried out}} to determine the amount <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> males <b>of</b> P. mirabilis invest in nuptial gifts, and its possible role in sexual reproduction. The amount <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> was always small, indicating that the <b>silk</b> <b>of</b> the nuptial gift has little nutritional value for females. Males that {{had more time to}} wrap up the prey produced a larger amount <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> Starved males required more time than satiated males to produce a given amount <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> A larger male body size had a positive effect on the amount <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> In general, the size of the prey used for nuptial gifts had no influence on the amount <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> However, due to handling problem, smaller males produced no silk for very large flies. Females took more time to digest a nuptial gift with a larger amount <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> than a nuptial gift with a smaller amount <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> A possible interpretation of the adaptive significance of wrapping is that males use silk to prolong the copulation time during mating. ...|$|R

The elastic properties <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> fibers were estimated using stress-strain curves.

Heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> fibers (at 100 °C) led to a decrease in σmax. Electron micrographs of the surface <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> fibers and their cross sections were obtained. Using the data of NMR relaxation study <b>of</b> natural <b>silk</b> fibers (free induction decay curves), the second moments of the shape of the NMR line were calculated.

40|$|Silks are {{a diverse}} family of natural {{material}} with extraordinary mechanical properties {{such as high}} tensile strength and extensibility, as well as reported biological compatibility. In recent years, the reported exceptional nature <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> lead to increased interest in silk for biomedical applications. The aim of this review is to assess the potential and compatibility <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> fibres and silk-based materials for biomedical purposes. It will do so by reviewing silk properties, structure and formation, with special focus on spider and mulberry silkworm silk fibres, {{as well as the}} application <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> in the biomedical field. The review will begin by introducing the general characteristics <b>of</b> <b>silk,</b> and a consideration of properties of particular relevance to the use <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> in biomedical applications: degradation and tensile properties. Subsequently, the formation <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> in vitro will be outlined, as well as the current understanding <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> structure. A comparison of the structural differences between spider and silkworm silks will follow. Some of the different types <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> produced by orb weaving spiders, their main functuins and structural features will be described. This will be followed by an introduction to 'supercontraction', a phenomenon that has only been observed in spider silks, and is considered {{to be one of the}} major obstacles to the use <b>of</b> native spider <b>silk</b> for medical applications. Finally, there will be an account of previous biomedical applications <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> It is the intention of this review to point out the wide range of excellent and valuable properties observed in different silk types, and to propose that silk's versatility is possibly its strongest advantage. However, in the context of biomedical research and development, there are still major limitations and difficulties with native silk fibres. It is suggested in this review that an artificially produced silk or silk-like material formed to possess specific desired properties will allow the overcoming of present limitations.
