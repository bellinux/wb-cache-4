A <b>stepped</b> <b>profile</b> when plotted on a graph would not show a smooth line showing decreasing height with distance from the source (this is a long profile). A <b>stepped</b> <b>profile</b> would show dramatic decreases in height - this may be caused by the type of underlying bedrock changing allowing the river to erode vertically,horizontally or diagonally ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a compressively strained adsorbed layer on a periodic substrate via a simple two-dimensional model that admits striped and hexagonal incommensurate phases. We show that the mass transport is superfast near the striped-hexagonal phase boundary and in the hexagonal phase. For an initial <b>step</b> <b>profile</b> separating a bare substrate region (or “hole”) {{from the rest of}} a striped incommensurate phase, the superfast domain wall dynamics leads to a bifurcation of the initial <b>step</b> <b>profile</b> into two interfaces or profiles propagating in opposite directions with a hexagonal phase in between. This yields a theoretical understanding of the recent experiments for the Pb/Si(111) system. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{changes during}} {{the growth of}} {{lamellar}} polymer crystals give rise to steps {{on the surface of}} the crystals. It has recently been suggested that these steps could provide important insights into the mechanism of polymer crystallization. In particular, a characterization of the <b>profiles</b> of these <b>steps</b> might reveal the fixed-point attractor that underlies a recently proposed crystallization mechanism. Here we examine this hypothesis by performing simulations of such temperature jumps using the Sadler-Gilmer model. We find that for this model the <b>step</b> <b>profiles</b> do reveal the fixed- point attractor. However, for temperature decreases they also reflect the rounding of the crystal edge that occurs in this model and for temperature increases they also reflect the fluctuations in the thickness present in the crystal. We discuss the implications of these results for the interpretation of experimental <b>step</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R

40|$|High-resolution {{electron}} energy-loss (HREEL) spectra {{have been}} analysed using local dielectric theory {{in a study}} of the depletion layer formed at the InSb(100) surface. Two-, three- and four-layer models were used to simulate a series of low-incidence-energy HREEL spectra (1. 25 - 10 eV). An abrupt charge profile (the two-layer model) provided good agreement with experimental data when spatial dispersion and wavevector-dependent plasmon damping were included in the local dielectric model. This was {{in spite of the fact}} that the two-layer model does not accurately reflect the charge distribution, which was calculated using the modified Thomas-Fermi approximation (MTFA). Smoothing of the <b>step</b> <b>profile</b> by the inclusion of an intermediate layer (the three layer model) introduced 'plasmaron' modes, unless the plasma damping in the middle layer was set to a very high level. These modes were not observed experimentally, indicating that the abrupt charge profile in fact produced more accurate simulations. A four-layer model more closely approximating the calculated charge profile produced superior fits to the experimental spectra, but only when the plasma damping in each layer was carefully controlled. The limitations of <b>step</b> <b>profile</b> approximations and the local dielectric theory approach in describing regions of highly non-uniform charge density are discussed. In particular, the spatial and wavevector dependence of the plasmon damping is considered...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we examine}} three data reduction techniques {{in the context}} of Template Attacks. The Template Attack is a powerful two-step side channel attack which models an almost omnipotent adversary in the <b>profiling</b> <b>step,</b> but restricts him to a single observation in the classification <b>step.</b> The <b>profiling</b> <b>step</b> requires data reduction due to computational complexity and vast amounts of data. Here we examine the inter class variance, the Spearman correlation coefficient, and principal component analysis. The classification step requires a distinguisher, which we implemented by linear discriminant analysis.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the time evolution of an initial <b>step</b> <b>profile</b> separating a bare substrate region {{from the rest}} of the compressively strained adsorbate layer near a commensurate to incommensurate transition. The rate of profile evolution as a function of the mismatch, coverage and the strength of the substrate potential are determined by Brownian molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the results are qualitatively similar to those observed for the Pb/Si(111) system. The anomalously fast time evolution and sharpness of the non-equilibrium profile can be understood through the domain wall creation at the boundary and its subsequent diffusion into the interior of the adsorbate layer.

5000|$|Owing to {{the lack}} of water sources on the island, roofs were and are still used for {{rainwater}} collection. Early water tanks were placed not underground, but in adjacent stone structures later likened by one American observer to a lean-to. These tanks were fed via a stone gutter from the roof. [...] Sunk six to eight feet down, they were typically rectangular and appeared barrel-vaulted above the surface. A distinctive style of Bermudian roof developed, with a <b>stepped</b> <b>profile</b> of limestone slabs, grouted to make it impermeable and to stay clean. Rain on such a roof is slowed by the steps, rather than sloping tiles, and is collected by the gutter. This dependence on harvester rain led to a culture of water conservation, even with today's desalination plants.|$|E

Utah Golden Travise marble covers the walls and Verde Antique marble forms the baseboard. The walls are topped with an elaborate cast-plaster crown molding that is an Art-Deco interpretation of the traditional egg-and-dart motif. A metallic silver glaze covers the molding. The cornices replicate the stepped pattern found throughout the building. Centrally placed silver foil appliques adorn the ceilings. The central staircase, which is accessed from the lobby through an arched opening with stepped, rectilinear forms, is clad in the same marble found in the lobby and has wood handrails with octagonal cross sections. Similar arched openings lead from the lobby {{to the east and}} west corridors.

50|$|Pico de Orizaba {{is one of}} {{only three}} volcanoes in México that {{continue}} to support glaciers and is home to the largest glacier in Mexico, Gran Glaciar Norte. Orizaba has nine known glaciers: Gran Glaciar Norte, Lengua del Chichimeco, Jamapa, Toro, Glaciar de la Barba, Noroccidental, Occidental, Suroccidental, and Oriental. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is not known for Orizaba. Snow on the south and southeast sides of the volcano melts quickly because of solar radiation, but lower temperatures on the northwest and north sides allow for glaciers. The insolation angle and wind redeposition on the northwest and north sides allow for constant accumulation of snow providing a source for the outlet glaciers. On the north side of Orizaba, the Gran Glaciar Norte fills the elongated highland basin and is the source for seven outlet glaciers. The main glacier extends 3.5 km north of the crater rim, has a surface area of about 9.08 km2 descending from 5650 m to about 5000 m. It has a slightly irregular and <b>stepped</b> <b>profile</b> that is caused in part by the configuration of the bedrock. Most crevasses show an ice thickness of approximately 50 m.|$|E
