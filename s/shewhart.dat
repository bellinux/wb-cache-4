25|$|In 1927, Deming was {{introduced}} to Walter A. <b>Shewhart</b> of the Bell Telephone Laboratories by C.H. Kunsman of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming found great inspiration {{in the work of}} <b>Shewhart,</b> the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical tool of the control chart, as Deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management. Deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes, but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed. This key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after 1950.|$|E

50|$|In 1924 or 1925, <b>Shewhart's</b> {{innovation}} came to {{the attention}} of W. Edwards Deming, then working at the Hawthorne facility. Deming later worked at the United States Department of Agriculture and became the mathematical advisor to the United States Census Bureau. Over the next half a century, Deming became the foremost champion and proponent of <b>Shewhart's</b> work. After the defeat of Japan at the close of World War II, Deming served as statistical consultant to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. His ensuing involvement in Japanese life, and long career as an industrial consultant there, spread <b>Shewhart's</b> thinking, and the use of the control chart, widely in Japanese manufacturing industry throughout the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{definition}} of quality History remembers is from <b>Shewhart</b> {{in the beginning}} of 20th century: There are two common aspects of quality: one of them {{has to do with the}} consideration of the quality of a thing as an objective reality independent of the existence of man. The other has to do with what we think, feel or sense as a result of the objective reality. In other words, there is a subjective side of quality. (<b>Shewhart)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} myth to credit Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) to Deming. Deming {{referred}} to the PDCA cycle as a [...] "corruption." [...] Deming worked from the <b>Shewhart</b> cycle and over time eventually developed the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, which has the idea of deductive and inductive learning built into the learning and improvement cycle. [...] Deming finally published the PDSA cycle in 1993, in The New Economics on p.132. Deming has added to the myth that he taught the Japanese the PDSA cycle with this quote on p.247, [...] "The PDSA Cycle originated in my teaching in Japan in 1950. It appeared in the booklet Elementary Principles of the Statistical Control of Quality (JUSE, 1950: out of print).|$|E
30|$|This study {{investigates the}} ability of the control chart {{methodology}} to predict manic or depressive episodes in patients with bipolar disorder by applying <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules to weekly self-reported scores from mania and depression self-measurement questionnaires. The main analysis considers control charts based on mean and standard deviation across all patients’ episode-free run-in periods. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules for predicting manic or depressive episodes within the next 4  weeks are reported. Secondary analyses using a longer episode-free run-in period, different control chart types, different time frames to evaluate diagnostic accuracy parameters, lower thresholds defining episodes of either type, and missing data methods were also performed.|$|R
30|$|Manic episodes {{appeared}} to be occurring less frequently than depressive episodes; thus, we performed a post hoc analysis evaluating the sensitivity and PPV of <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules to detect a manic episode within the next 8  weeks for all scenarios considered in this study.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, the British Standards Institution, {{under the}} {{influence}} of Egon Pearson and against <b>Shewhart's</b> spirit, adopted control charts, replacing 3-sigma limits with limits based on percentiles of the normal distribution.

2500|$|In his book, The New Economics for Industry, Government, and Education, Deming {{championed the}} work of Walter <b>Shewhart,</b> {{including}} statistical process control, operational definitions, and what Deming called the [...] "Shewhart Cycle" [...] which had evolved into PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act).

That work began in August 1950 at the Hakone Convention Center in Tokyo when Deming delivered a speech on what he called [...] "Statistical Product Quality Administration". Many in Japan credit Deming as one of the inspirations for what has become known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle of 1950 to 1960, when Japan rose from the ashes of war on the road to becoming the second largest economy in the world through processes partially influenced by the ideas Deming taught: ...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{process control}} (SPC) is an {{important}} application of statistics in which the outputs of production processes are monitored. Control charts are an important tool of SPC. A very popular category is the <b>Shewhart's</b> x-chart used to monitor the mean of a process characteristic. Two alternatives to the <b>Shewhart's</b> x-chart are the cumulative sum and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts which are designed to detect moderate and small shifts in the process mean. Targeting on small and moderate shifts in the process mean, we propose an EWMA-type control chart which utilizes a single auxiliary variable. The regression estimation technique for the mean is used in defining the control structure of the proposed chart.

40|$|Background Recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood {{instability}} cause substantial disability {{in patients}} with bipolar disorder. Early identification of mood episodes enabling timely mood stabilisation is an important clinical goal. This study investigates the ability of control chart methodology to predict manic and/or depressive episodes by applying <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules to weekly self-reported scores from mania and depression questionnaires. Methods <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules were applied to weekly self-reported scores from the Altman Self Rating Mania Scale (ASRM) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology –Self Report (QIDS) collected from 2001 - 2012 {{as part of the}} OXTEXT programme. Manic and depressive episodes were defined as an ASRM score≥ 10 or a QIDS score≥ 15, respectively. An episode-free run-in period of eight consecutive weeks without an episode of either type was used to calibrate control charts. <b>Shewhart’s</b> rules were then applied to follow-up data. Their sensitivity and positive predictive value for predicting manic or depressive episodes within the next 4 weeks were calculated focusing on the first episode. Secondary analyses varying control chart type, length of episode-free run-in period, time frames to evaluate diagnostic accuracy, thresholds defining either manic or depressive episodes, and missing data methods were performed. Results Data from 146 participants (37 % men) were included. The mean age was 43. 4 (SD= 13. 3) years. The median follow-up was 10 (IQR= 5 to 40) weeks for mania and 10 (IQR= 5 to 23) weeks for depression. A total of 53 (36 %) participants had a manic episode and 67 (46 %) had a depressive episode. For manic episodes, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules were 30 % (95 %CI= 19 to 45 %) and 7 % (95 %CI= 5 to 9 %), and for depressive episodes, 33 % (95 %CI= 22 to 46 %) and 9 % (95 %CI= 6 to 12 %), respectively. Results from secondary analyses were similar to these. Conclusions Tele-monitoring with control rules has the potential to predict about one third of manic or depressive episodes before they occur, at the cost of a high false positive rate.

30|$|A further {{question}} {{is the possibility of}} defining a single control chart that combines the manic and depressive scores. We have analysed the performance of <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules applied independently to depressive and manic scores. However, given the nature of bipolar disorder, there is an apparent negative interaction between these and in mixed affective states patients can experience both manic and depressive symptoms concurrently.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Shewhart</b> {{framed the}} problem in terms of assignable-cause and chance-cause {{variation}} and introduced the control chart {{as a tool for}} distinguishing between the two. <b>Shewhart</b> stressed that bringing a production process into a state of statistical control, where there is only chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically. Dr. <b>Shewhart</b> created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. <b>Shewhart</b> drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood data from physical processes never produce a [...] "normal distribution curve" [...] (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly called a [...] "bell curve"). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (Brownian motion of particles). Dr. <b>Shewhart</b> concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{expected}} cost {{model for a}} process whose mean is controlled by an Xc̅hart and whose variance is controlled by an R chart. The expected cost comprises the fixed and variable costs of sampling, the cost of investigating and correcting the process when at least one control chart indicates that the process parameters have shifted, {{and the cost of}} producing defective units. We use a search procedure to determine the sample size, interval between samples and control limits for both charts that minimize the expected cost. Optimal solutions to numerical examples are presented. A sensitivity analysis of the model is performed. In addition, we find the optimal interval between samples and the expected cost for several examples with large shifts in the mean and variance where <b>Shewhart's</b> heuristic design is used in place of the optimal design. Comparison of the expected cost of the optimal design to the expected cost of <b>Shewhart's</b> design shows an increase in expected cost of only 0. 4 to 8. 2 percent for the latter design.

30|$|Increasing {{the time}} to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of <b>Shewhart’s</b> control rules to predict manic episodes from 4 to 8  weeks (see Additional file 7), varying the type of chart or the length of episode-free period returned similar results to those from the main analysis. Imputing the last observed value improved the sensitivity of <b>Shewhart’s</b> rules, but not their PPV. The differences were non-significant, {{as indicated by the}} corresponding 95 % CI is in Table  4. Reducing the cutoff to define episodes of either type {{had an impact on the}} sample size, and total number of episodes, for both cohorts. After applying the data extraction procedure described in Fig.  1, the number of patients in the short episode-free run-in period cohort changed from 146 (53 episodes) to 99 (48 episodes) in the ASRM dataset, and from 146 (67 episodes) to 96 (57 episodes) in the QIDS dataset. In the long episode-free run-in period cohort, the number of patients changed from 100 (25 episodes) to 65 (28 episodes) in the ASRM dataset, and from 100 (32 episodes) to 68 (37 episodes) in the QIDS dataset. The sensitivity of any rule when using universal control charts was slightly improved under this scenario, but not their PPV. This was true for both scales (see Additional file 8).|$|R
