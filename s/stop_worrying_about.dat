25|$|That {{evening at}} the ball, {{everyone}} makes their grand entrances and the couples dance. Henry has developed a crush on a girl named Violet and, after encouragement from David, introduces himself and shares his iPod Nano with Violet. Leroy is able to convince Belle to <b>stop</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> Rumpelstiltskin and gets her to join the dance. However, the event is about to end early when Percival reveals that he had witnessed Regina slaughter his entire family as a child. He also reveals that knows {{that she is the}} Evil Queen and not the Savior, a fact he confirmed earlier by observing her through the enchanted necklace, and that he kept all of this from Arthur because he would have prevented him from killing Regina. Percival tries to kill Regina, but Robin steps in and fights him, only to be stabbed in the process before David kills Percival. Regina is desperate to save Robin, but her magic does not work due to an enchantment spell placed on Percival's sword. This prompts Regina to ask Emma to help save Robin by using her magic, but Hook does not want Emma to trigger her dark side. Meanwhile, King Arthur does not blame them for Percival's death, saying that his action was inexcusable, and admits that he suspected Regina's identity, but says that Camelot is a place of second chances. He later confesses to Guinevere that he thinks that there is something suspicious about the new arrivals, but he has to trust them, as they are his only hope of freeing Merlin and finding the missing piece of Excalibur. Emma eventually decides to help Regina despite the risk, but the magic triggers her vision of Rumpelstiltskin, who warns her that a price has to be paid if she saves Robin's life. Emma ignores the manifestation and uses her magic to save Robin, but in the process it triggers the darkness in her, as forewarned by Hook, with Emma's hand beginning to resemble that of a Dark One's.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums, Subterranean Jungle {{shifted the}} band's sound output focus towards {{getting back to}} their punk rock roots, {{rather than trying to}} expand fan-base by releasing more pop-oriented songs. This change is due to guitarist Johnny Ramone obtaining more priority over the style choice. Johnny felt as though the band needed to [...] "be focused and <b>stop</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> getting played [...] and just make a good record." [...] Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, the album lacks the sense of pop-influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.|$|E

There George reveals to his friend Dennis that he has turned down his next commission.

40|$|Objective: Numerous {{correlational}} {{studies have}} examined whether perceptions of vulnerability or worry are better predictors of health-related behavior. The aim of this experimental {{study was to explore}} some of the potential causal relationships involved: Are the effects of a brief smoking cessation intervention (for women attending for cervical smear tests) on intention to stop smoking mediated by perceived vulnerability or <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> cervical cancer? Design: A mediation analysis of an experimental study. Main outcome measures: Perceived vulnerability to and <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> cervical cancer, and intention to stop smoking in the next month. Results: Questionnaires were completed by 172 (71 %) women at 2 -week follow-up. Compared with women in the control group, those in the intervention group had higher perceptions of vulnerability, worry, and intention to stop smoking. Personal vulnerability (p <. 01) and comparative vulnerability (p <. 05) were significant mediators of the relationship between study group and intention to <b>stop</b> smoking. <b>Worry</b> <b>about</b> cervical cancer was not related to intention. Conclusion: Worry may be a less important construct in relation to disease prevention behaviors such as smoking cessation. More experimental studies comparing different behaviors are needed to determine the causal relationship between worry and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Th is {{issue will}} reach you late. Part {{of the reason}} is the recent illness of Dr. John Gorham, who is a regular {{contributor}} to it, but the responsibility is mine, and I’m sorry. I am pleased to report that Dr. Gorham appears to be recovering nicely. Sometimes I feel we’re living in an aging society. Th is has been the case in agriculture for many years, as young people leave the hard work of farms and ranches to seek more lucrative employment in urban communities. So I was concerned when a young friend of mine, wh owned a mink ranch, said he’d decided to do something else. “Do you have anything in mind?” I asked. “Yes, ” he said, “I’m going to sell bottled water.

When they travel to the mysterious planet of D'vouran, they are pulled out of hyperspace, seemingly too soon, by the planet's gravity and crash land at the spaceport. Though Tash feels bad things about the planet, the Enzeen, the alien race {{who live on the}} planet, are more than happy to help out with anything they need while on the planet. D'vouran has become a tourist destination and the Enzeen hope to bring more people to live on the planet. When Chood, the Enzeen who personally helps the family, brings them to an inn to find help in repairing the engine, they are attacked and the children taken captive by the forces of Shada the Hutt, who demands Hoole's service.
