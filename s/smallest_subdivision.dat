50|$|Under the Muchow Plan, the Party's local {{organisation}} {{consisted of}} a series of subdivisions, in a manner influenced by the cell structure of the Communist Party.

50|$|Tables hold ordered sets of identically {{structured}} information. The common unit of {{data in a}} {{table is}} an item. Items may be subdivided into fields, the <b>smallest</b> <b>subdivision</b> of a table.

50|$|The ZEUS Calorimeter was a uranium {{scintillator}} based sampling calorimeter {{and divided}} into 3 main sections: the BCAL (Barrel CALorimeter), FCAL (Forward CALorimeter), and RCAL (Rear CALorimeter). Each section was subdivided transversely into towers, and longitudinally into EMC (Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter) or HAC (HAdronic Calorimeter). The <b>smallest</b> <b>subdivision</b> in the calorimeter {{was called a}} cell. Each cell was read-out by two photomultiplier tubes (PMT), which helped ensure {{that there were no}} holes in the coverage if one of the two PMTs failed.|$|E

50|$|A {{point in}} tennis is the <b>smallest</b> <b>subdivision</b> of the match, the {{completion}} of which changes the score. A point can consist of a double fault by the server, in which case it is won by the receiver; otherwise, {{it begins with a}} legal serve by one side's server to the receiver on the other, and continues until one side fails to make a legal return to the other, losing the point. Four points win a game, counted as 15 (1 point), 30 (2 points), 40 (3 points). A game must be won by at least two points.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{consists}} of eight ricercate, forty-five passaggi {{with up to}} eight diminuiti each, eight basic cadentie (cadences), with up to ten diminutions each, and concludes with two different ornamented versions of the upper voice of Signor mio caro by Cipriano de Rore, from his First Book of Madrigals for four voices (1550). The collection is written in a late phase of mensural notation with most notes resembling the whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and thirty-second notes of modern notation. The <b>smallest</b> <b>subdivision</b> is the thirty-second note (bissicroma), a symbol that Bassano takes pains to explain in his preface [...] "Ai lettori" [...] (to the readers): [...] "intenderete in questa mia opera quadruplicata cioè trentadue al valor de una Semibreve" [...] ("meant represent in this, my work, a quadruplicata, {{which is to say}} thirty-two to the value of one whole note"), but most modern interpretations of the piece play the eighth notes faster depending on how many are written into a measure. Usually the more eighth notes in a measure the faster they are played.|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} Stokes imaging spectropolarimeter {{has been}} developed based {{on the principles of}} computed-tomography, spectrometry and polarimetry. The Computed-Tomography Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CTISP) is a polarization extension to the Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) ¹. Imaging spectrometers estimate the object cube (x,y, λ), whose <b>smallest</b> <b>subdivision</b> is a voxel, while Stokes imaging spectrometers estimate four Stokes object cubes (x,y, Sp(λ); p = 0, 1, 2, 3), one for each Stokes parameter. CTISP uses a two-dimensional disperser to diffract the image in the field stop into a 5 -by- 5 array of diffraction orders. As in computed tomography, each focal plane array (FPA) pixel effectively integrates a different path through the object cube, and when all pixels are recorded, {{a significant portion of the}} object cube's information is obtained. The frequency space representation of the object cube, however, indicates that two conical regions of information are not recorded, thereby limiting the reconstruction accuracy. CTISP scans only in the polarization domain (not spectral or spatial domains), acquiring four FPA frames, one behind each of the four polarization analyzers. Currently, CTISP's resolution is 33 by 33 spatially over a 3. 5 degrees full angle field of view with 16 spectral bands of 20 nm width covering 440 nm- 740 nm. CTISP acquisition is modeled using the linear imaging equation gₐ=Hₐfₐ+ξₐ, which is inverted using the iterative expectation-maximization algorithm to solve for fₐ, the object cube as seen through analyzer a. The recorded diffraction images gₐ and the empirically determined calibration matrices Hₐ, are each acquired using analyzer a. The nth voxel reconstruction result is extracted from each of the four fₐ vectors to form a four element vector f(n) which is then multiplied by the inverse of the voxel characteristic matrix W(n) to obtain the estimate of the Stokes vector S(n). W(n) is derived from the four Hₐ matrices. A fully computer-controlled calibration facility and a suite of programs are used to calibrate CTISP. CTISP was validated using synthetically generated and real objects. Spectral agreement is consistent with CTIS, while Stokes parameter polarization errors were typically 0. 04 - 0. 07 for this instrument. Errors are most significant at the spectral limits of CTISP. An object dependent correction reduces these errors to below one percent...|$|E
