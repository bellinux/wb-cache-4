Standard weight (Ws) {{equations}} {{were developed}} and relative weight (Wr) indices calculated for both shallow-water (Merluccius capensis) and deep-water (M. paradoxus) Cape hake. The {{aim was to}} provide fixed baselines and Wr indices to aid understanding of temporal and spatial variability in fish condition. Baselines were calculated using the empirical percentiles (EmP) method applied to length (L) – weight (W) data collected by research surveys on the South African west and south coasts, from 1983 to 2013. Four quadratic Ws equations for each species were generated, based on the following weight statistics for each size class j : first quartile, median, third quartile and mean. Median Ws equations were chosen for the baseline for <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> (log&# 8321;&# 8320; Ws=- 2. 491 + 3. 33 8 *(log&# 8321;&# 8320; L) - 0. 065 *(log&# 8321;&# 8320; Lj) ²) and deep-water hake (log&# 8321;&# 8320; Ws =- 2. 161 + 2. 930 *(log&# 8321;&# 8320; L) + 0. 0456 *(log 10 Lj) ²). <b>Shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> {{was found to be}} the heavier of the two species at the same length. Wr indices display good condition values (> 100 %) for both species throughout all analyses. Fish condition for both species was best between 1988 - 2009, ranging from 50 - 1 65 % for individual fish and 100 – 109 % for annual averages. Monthly mean Wr indices peaked in June and October for <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> and July and October for deep-water hake. Mean Wr values were different for <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> on the south (105 %) and west (103 %) coasts. Deep-water hake showed no spatial variability in mean Wr values. There were no differences between mean Wr values of males and females between, and within, species. Future hake data may be compared to these Ws equation baselines and Wr indices to show changes in body condition for this commercially important stock...|$|E

Life history {{traits and}} tactics of commercially {{important}} Namibian <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake,</b> Merluccius capensis, were investigated {{in relation to}} their environment. A time series of length-frequency distributions (LFDs) from otoliths collected from fur seal scat samples was used to identify cohorts and calculate the approximate hatchdates and growth rates of young M. capensis from 1994 to 2009. Monthly otolith samples of five of these cohorts (1996, 1998, 2002, 2005 and 2006) were used to evaluate the translucent zone periodicity over the first 21 months of their life. Additionally, LFDs from research surveys and commercial samples were used to calculate growth rates for M. capensis up to 65 cm total length (TL), and to further validate the translucent zone formation of three of the five cohorts (1996, 1998 and 2002) on fish up to 3. 5 years old...|$|E
40|$|Three Heaviside’s {{dolphins}} Cephalorhynchus heavisidii were {{fitted with}} satellite depth recorders off {{the west coast}} of South Africa during February–April 1997 and monitored for 51, 73 and 130 days, respectively. In total, 345 locations were received from the three animals, but only 27 from one male. Using -local convex hull and minimum convex polygon methods, respectively, the home range for the remaining male was estimated at 1 520 and 2 347 km 2, with corresponding core-area estimates (50 % of locations) of 134 and 123 km 2. For the female, the home range estimates were 672 and 1 027 km 2, and those for the core area were 71 and 230 km 2. The female’s home range was the smallest yet described for this species, and the animal was resighted nearly three years later within 13 km of the tagging site. Binned dive data were received at 6 -hourly intervals. From comparison of maximum dive depth and time-at-depth data, we concluded that dives < 4 m deep were associated with surfacing bouts. Dives to below 4 m occurred throughout 24 h but were shallower during the day and deepest either at dusk or at night. This pattern was consistent with earlier descriptions of offshore movement during the day and {{may be related to the}} diel vertical migration of its principal prey, <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius capensis.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 162 - 178. The {{two species}} of Cape hake, Merluccius capensis (<b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake)</b> and M paradoxus (deepwater hake), fomi the {{mainstay}} of the bottom trawl industry off South Africa and constitute the country's most valuable fishery. It is therefore important that the status of this resource be assessed regularly to ensure that exploitation is at a sustainable level. The two Cape hake species are morphologically similar and no distinction is made between them in commercial catch statistics. Consequently, for assessment purposes, the Cape hakes are treated as a single species. It is assumed that two stocks of Cape hake exist, one off the West Coast and another off the South Coast of South Africa. Central to the assessments of these stocks are the catch per unit effort (CPUE) data because it assumed that CPUE is proportional to abundance. The nominal CPUE (hake catch divided by actual time trawled) for both the West and South Coast stocks has shown a steady growth over the period 1978 - 1994, increasing {{at a rate of}} 3. 8 % per annum on the West Coast and 4. 2 % per annum on the South Coast. The bulk of this thesis is concerned with determining whether these increases in CPUE are the result of an increasing biomass, or are rather, in part, the result of improved vessel efficiency due to technological advancement or of changes in fishing strategy. The existing CPUE time series had previously been standardised by means of applying power factors which were crudely estimated in the early 1970 s and which are likely inappropriate for the current fishing fleets. These CPUE series have therefore been re-standardised by applying the internationally accepted approach of General Linear Modelling (GLM) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{predominantly}} trawl fishery for hake {{contributes about}} half the landed value of all of South Africa's commercial fisheries, and is approaching the largest contributor to Namibia's gross domestic product (GDP). Two hake species are taken by these fisheries: <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius capensis Castelnau, 1861 and deep-water hake Merluccius paradoxus Franca, 1960. The present management framework separates the resources into three areas: Namibia and the South African West and South Coasts. Some 30 yrs ago, particularly {{as a result of}} rapidly increasing foreign fishing effort over the preceding decade, all of these hake stocks had been severely depleted. We address the question of how successfully sustainable utilization and resource recovery has been achieved since that time. Although there has indeed been some recovery —to a greater extent for the stocks off South Africa—the historical record indicates over-optimistic appraisals of likely recovery rates and sustainable yield levels over this period, and some of the reasons for this are discussed. Certain key assessment questions remain: why is recruitment variability estimated to be so low, natural mortality so high, and why do estimates of stock-recruitment steepness, survey selectivity-at-age and bias in swept-area survey estimates differ so greatly between the stocks? For the most part, total allowable catch (TAC) for these fisheries over the past decade have been set using Operational Management Procedures (OMPs), pre-set rules applied to pre-specified resource monitoring data, where the selection of the procedure to be used is based upon simulation testing to ensure adequate robustness to uncertainties in data and model-structure, in the spirit of a precautionary approach. We discuss the ability in practice of this approach to achieve the necessary adaptive framework for management and summarize planned future initiatives towards refining this OMP approach. These include changing from the present species-aggregated to separate procedures for M. capensis and M. paradoxus. This is necessitated particularly by an increasing longline component in the South African hake fishery, which focuses on M. capensis and takes mainly 6 + aged fish, compared to the mainly 3 + by the trawlers...|$|E
40|$|The Agulhas Bank {{supports}} a speciose fish community, {{many of which}} are commercially important. Despite substantial research being conducted on aspects of their biology spatial aspects of their distribution and abundance in relation to environment parameters has been ignored. This study, therefore, addressed aspects related to the distribution and abundance of representative species on the Agulhas Bank within a Geographic Information System (GIS). Four candidate species were chosen due to their importance either in numbers or unit mass to the South African demersal trawl fishery. The species also shared morphological and taxonomic similarities. The candidate species chosen were the two Cape hake species, <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> Meluccius capensis, and deep-water hake Merluccius paradoxus, and the two pleuronectiform species being Agulhas sole Austroglossus pectoralis and redspotted tonguesole Cynoglossus zanzibarensis. The use of a GIS was appropriate and allowed for hidden spatial patterns be exposed and illustrated visually, while also facilitating the quantification of the relationships between distribution/abundance and certain environmental predictors using statistical methods The Department of Marine and Coastal Management, Cape Town, supplied biological data in the form of length frequency and biomass information from spring (AprillMay) and autumn (September/October) cruises conducted between 1986 and 1993 on the R. V. Africana. The Council for National Geoscience, Cape Town, supplied sediment data for the entire southern African coastline. Initial exploratory data analysis highlighted potential relationships between environmental variables and abundance for each specie's life-history stanzas. Variations in spatial distribution were found to be significantly different between each life-history stanzas within species. Fish density {{as a function of the}} additive effects of the various environmental parameters, including temperature, depth and sediment type, was assessed using a Poisson Generalized Additive Model (GAM), while distribution was analysed with a logistic GAM. A predictive logistic model was then created, taking into consideration the importance of the predictor variables for each species, allowing for predictive estimates to be made for each species by inputting environmental information within the study area. The importance of certain environmental variables influencing distribution and abundance were noted. General patterns indicated that sediment was the most important to both the distribution and abundance of the two pleuronectiform species and juvenile life-history stanzas, while the adult gadoids' distribution and abundance appeared to be depth dependent...|$|E

40|$|The commercially {{valuable}} hake fishery off South Africa {{consists of}} two morphologically similar species, the <b>shallow-water</b> Cape <b>hake</b> Merluccius capensis and the deep-water Cape hake M. paradoxus. Because catch-and effort statistics collected from the fishery are not species-disaggregated, previous published quantitative assessment methods have treated the two hake species as one. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that (although treated as two separate populations in past assessments) the South and West coasts components of each species form a single stock. This paper describes {{the development of the}} first fully species-disaggregated coast-wide baseline assessment of the South African hake resource. M. paradoxus is estimated to be currently at < 10 % of its pre-exploitation level whereas M. capensis is estimated to be well above its maximum sustainable yield level.

40|$|The Cape {{fur seal}} Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus colony at the Robberg Peninsula, Plettenberg Bay, on the {{south-east}} coast of South Africa, {{was driven to}} extirpation by indiscriminate harvesting by the late 1800 s and seals only began to recolonise this site in the 1990 s. This study describes the recolonisation process from 2000 to 2009, exploring within- and between-year variation {{in the number of}} seals using the site. Numbers increased over the study period from less than 300 animals to over 3 100. Year and month were important in explaining variability in seal counts, whereas sea condition, time of day and lunar phase had minimal explanatory power. Within-year variation in seal counts decreased during the study period, which may indicate an increasing proportion of resident (as opposed to transient) seals in the colony. However, the colony is currently still in a transition phase with a low ratio of breeding to non-breeding animals and low numbers of pups born on the colony (currently still < 100 per year). The influx of seals to the Robberg area may be associated with an increase in prey availability in the area. The relative protection afforded by the Nature Reserve status of the Robberg Peninsula and the existence of a Marine Protected Area adjacent to it are likely to contribute to the growth of this colony. However, human interference associated with fishing and/or ecotourism on the Peninsula may prevent the colony from developing into a breeding colony. Faecal (scat) sampling was employed to study the diet of this increasing seal population at Robberg. Species composition and size of prey were determined, temporal variation in the diet was explored, and the potential for competition between seals and the fisheries around Plettenberg Bay was investigated. Of the 445 scats collected, 90 % contained hard prey remains. These comprised of 3 127 identified otoliths representing 15 teleost prey species, 25 cephalopod beaks representing three 6 species and three feathers representing two bird species. The seals' most important prey species in terms of numerical abundance and frequency of occurrence in the diet were anchovy, sardine, horse mackerel, sand tongue-fish and <b>shallow-water</b> <b>hake</b> (in decreasing order of importance). The proportion of anchovy in the diet increased during the study period, while sardine decreased. Sardine was the only species that increased significantly in the diet during the upwelling season. Little evidence was found of direct competition between seals and linefisheries in Plettenberg Bay, both in terms of prey species composition and quantities consumed. Scat sampling in seals holds promise as a method to track long-term changes in prey species availability. The conservation and management of this colony are discussed in light of the research findings...|$|E
40|$|The two Cape hake {{species of}} the {{southern}} Benguela ecosystem, the <b>shallow-water</b> and deep-water <b>hakes</b> Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, are economically the most important marine resources in South Africa. Recruitment is a key process in the dynamics of marine organisms, yet very {{little is known about}} the early life history of Cape hakes, especially the location of spawning grounds and transport of eggs and larvae. For each species, ichthyoplankton dispersal off South Africa is simulated by coupling oceanographic simulations to an individual-based model in order to track virtual individuals. Results indicate that the most favorable spawning areas for transport to nursery areas are located off the south-western coast and the eastern Agulhas Bank, and highlight partly different drift routes followed by the two ichthyoplankton species off Cape Columbine. Transport from spawning to nursery areas is the highest in austral winter for a spawning depth ranging between 0 and 100 m. These modeling results are in broad agreement with avail-able knowledge on the ecology of Cape hakes. The present work on Cape hakes complements previous modeling studies on anchovy and sardine in the same area...|$|R
