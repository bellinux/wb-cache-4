We show not just that coverage by DB pension plans is greater {{in the public sector}} but that median pension accruals as a percentage of salary are more than 6 % higher among DB-covered public sector workers than covered private sector workers. This is largely driven by earlier normal pension (retirement) ages but also by differences in earnings profiles across the sectors. Copyright � The Author(s).
