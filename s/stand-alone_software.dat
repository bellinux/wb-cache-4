30|$|Continuous {{measurements}} on pass-through SRMs, however, {{are subjected to}} smoothing and distortion due to the convolution of sensor responses, controlled by the geometry of pick-up coils and superconducting shield, with the magnetization of paleomagnetic sample (e.g., Shibuya and Michikawa 2000; Oda and Xuan 2014). Deconvolution is needed to reconstruct higher-resolution magnetization time series with less distortion (e.g., Dodson et al. 1974; Constable and Parker 1991; Oda and Shibuya 1996; Guyodo et al. 2002; Jackson et al. 2010). Oda and Xuan (2014) recently developed an improved deconvolution algorithm based on ABIC minimization method considering realistic errors in sample length and measurement position. Based on the algorithm, <b>stand-alone</b> graphical <b>software</b> UDECON was developed to directly read pass-through measurement data and perform fast and reliable deconvolution optimization (Xuan and Oda 2015).|$|R

To depend upon this web applications information transformation {{can be easily}} upgraded, thru certain networking environment depending upon software and hardware can be used. The aim of web application is the customer satisfaction; due to this factor such applications can be majorly dependent on reliability fact. The reliability of web application is more complex compare with <b>stand-alone</b> applications. <b>Software</b> Prediction or Estimation to improve the reliability models about evolution of software applications. Visualize the reliability will help improving the overall performance of application. The data on failures of the model is typically obtained during the last stages of testing. In this paper, we propose software prediction model based on software reliability, to improve the failure data. A Non-Homogeneous based Exponential Distribution is considered, applied on dataset. The failure data is acceptable for software reliability and failure parameters are estimate using Least Square Estimation (LSE) method, to find the reliability of various Software Reliability Growth models...|$|R

40|$|Technology-mediated {{instruction}} {{is changing the}} educational environment by adding another dimension to teaching and learning. Despite the advances in technology {{and the way we}} use technology, little attention has been given to providing technology solutions that help create, conduct, and manage the central task of assessment. Software to manage and conduct assessment presents many challenges. This article examines a <b>stand-alone,</b> flexible <b>software</b> environment designed to provide all the tools required to view, mark, store, and deliver results efficiently while improving the feedback to the students. A description of the software and its functions, the techniques and methods developed to overcome the limitations that software presents when used to conduct assessment is examined. Case studies are presented that describe: (a) the types of assessment the software has been used to conduct and manage; (b) the types of problems that were encountered; and (c) the solutions and techniques that were discovered and used to overcome the problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the pedagogical issues concerning Open and Distance Learning (ODL) systems through a critical review of the relevant published work. The review categorized articles into three categories, namely theoretical approaches, technological approaches and evaluation studies. The review showed that open and distance learning is mainly technology driven. Researchers exploit the technological features of Information and Communication Technologies for the design and development of ODL environments, without paying much attention to and applying theoretical models, pedagogical principles and instructional goals. They rather seem to follow the conventional, general instructional design guidelines concerning <b>stand-alone</b> educational <b>software</b> applications, mostly based on hypermedia systems. The main theoretical approach implied by the majority of the published work is constructivism together with collaborative learning, without referring to or applying social constructivism. Our proposal for effective open and distance learning environments is the exploitation of the tools Information and Communication Technologies offer in a constructivist environment involving specific didactic goals and learning outcomes...|$|R
