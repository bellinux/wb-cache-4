40|$|In many {{applications}} for high-power diode lasers, {{the production of}} beam-shaping and homogenizing optical systems experience rising volumes and dynamical market demands. The automation of assembly processes on flexible and reconfigurable machines can contribute to a more responsive and scalable production. The paper presents a flexible mounting device designed for the challenging assembly of side-tab based optical systems. It provides design elements for precisely referencing and fixating two optical elements in a well-defined geometric relation. Side tabs are presented to the machine allowing the application of glue and a rotating mechanism allows the attachment to the optical elements. The device can be adjusted to fit different form factors {{and it can be}} used in high-volume assembly machines. The paper shows the utilization of the device for a collimation module consisting of a fast-axis and a slow-axis collimation lens. Results regarding the repeatability and process capability of bonding <b>side</b> <b>tab</b> assemblies as well as estimates from 3 D simulation for overall performance indicators achieved such as cycle time and throughput will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} vortex {{generators}} {{in the form}} of tabs on the penetration and spreading of a jet in a cross-flow has been studied experimentally. It is found that the tab has very little effect when placed on the leeward side, i. e., on the downstream edge of the jet nozzle relative to the free-stream flow. A study of the static pressure distribution reveals significantly lower pressures on the leeward side. Thus, when placed on that <b>side</b> the <b>tab</b> does not produce a "pressure hill" of sufficient magnitude that is the primary source of streamwise vorticity in the flow field over the tab. This qualitatively explains the ineffectiveness. In comparison, there is a significant effect on the flow field when the tab is placed on the windward side, The sense of vorticity generated by the tab in the latter configuration is opposite to that of the bound vortex pair that otherwise characterizes the flow. Thus, the strength of the bound vortex pair is diminished and the jet penetration is reduced...|$|R

50|$|With the {{continued}} {{growth of the}} company Alexander Simpson began to take more control of the business, and in 1935 DAKS gained further fame for the S Simpson brand as an innovation in the tailoring world of the first self-supporting trouser. He went about to invent a way to support his trousers that wouldn’t need braces as these interrupted his swing whilst playing golf and caused his shirt to become untucked. The DAKS trouser was invented - it had a channel within the waistband at the back wherein an elasticated strip was attached at the <b>sides</b> with <b>tabs</b> attached {{to one of two}} buttons for adjustment. On the inside of the waistband were sewn-on rubber pads that gripped the shirt and stopped it from becoming loose. This happened in a world where to buy a pair of trousers of high quality one would have to have a bespoke pair made by a tailor, and thus this new design allowed the ease of ready-to-wear trousers. Simpson was so sure of his new design that he had 100,000 pairs made before being introduced to the public at a high price of 30 shillings in a time when a whole bespoke suit would cost 50 shillings. The trousers were available in many colours and fabrics that weren’t generally associated with menswear. They became so popular that the trousers were incorporated into suits and soon after a DAKS womenswear line was released, using the patented waistband for skirting.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} vortex generators, {{in the form}} of small tabs {{projecting}} normally into the flow at the nozzle exit, on the characteristics of an axisymmetric jet is investigated experimentally over the jet Mach number range of 0. 3 - 1. 81. The tabs eliminate screech noise from supersonic jets and alter the shock structure drastically. They distort the jet cross section and increase the jet spread rate significantly. The distortion produced is essentially the same at subsonic and underexpanded supersonic conditions. Thus, the underlying mechanism must be independent of compressibility effects. A tab with a height as small as 2 percent of the jet diameter, but larger than the efflux boundary-layer thickness, is found to produce a significant effect. Flow visualization reveals that each tab introduces an 'indentation' into the high speed side of the shear layer via the action of streamwise vortices. These vortices are inferred to be of the 'trailing vortex' type rather than of the 'necklace vortex' type. It is apparent that a substantial pressure differential must exist between the upstream and the downstream <b>sides</b> of the <b>tab</b> to effectively produce these trailing vortices. This explains why the tabs are ineffective in the overexpanded flow, as in that case an adverse pressure gradient exists near the nozzle exit which reduces the pressure differential produced by the tab...|$|R

The antenna is a low profile structure composed of an etched circuit board measuring 1. 6 by 10. 0 by 0. 010 inches mounted inside a 0. 17 inch deep cavity formed {{in the back of the}} AMRAAM harness cover. There is a metallic cover over the cavity which connects to the metalized harness cover constituting a ground plane for the antenna. The antenna is easily tuned through use of two metallic slugs in close proximity to the ends of the antenna elements. The active circuit of the antenna is composed of a 3 -element folded dipole photoetched from copper clad Duroid. The center element is driven through a microstrip matching transformer which is printed on the opposite side of the antenna elements. A quarter wave open circuited stub is also printed opposite the elements to provide a virtual short such that no physical contacts are necessary between the transformer and the driven element. The matching transformer connects to the 50 ohm source at the center of the antenna through a <b>side</b> projecting microstrip <b>tab</b> which in turn is connected to a semi-rigid coaxial line. The antenna exhibits improved bandwidth and excellent pattern coverage, particularly in the critical roll plane. All of the antenna parameters will be presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{triangular}} tabs, {{placed at the}} nozzle exit, {{on the evolution of}} free jets is investigated. The effect, a large distortion of the jet cross section and a resultant increase in mixing downstream, has been inferred before to be due to a pair of streamwise vortices originating from each tab. In this paper, the generation mechanism of the stream wise vorticity (omega sub x) is considered first. Two sources are postulated. One is the upstream 'pressure hill', produced by the tab, which appears to be the dominant source. Another is due to vortex filaments shed from the <b>sides</b> of the <b>tab</b> and reoriented downstream by the mean shear of the mixing layer. In the case of a 'delta-tab', a triangular tab with its apex leaning downstream, vorticity from the two sources explain the stronger effect in that configuration. Data on the vorticity evolution for the effect of two delta-tabs are presented, up to twelve jet diameters from the exit, which show that the streamwise vortices persist even at the farthest measurement station. The magnitude of omega sub x-maximum decays continually with distance from the nozzle, its ratio to azimuthal vorticity maximum is found to be about 1 / 5 everywhere. The relative effect of a delta-tab on jets from an axisymmetric nozzle and a 8 : 1 rectangular nozzle is also studied. The mixing layer distortion is found to be less pronounced in the rectangular case. The jet mixing, as manifested by the mass flux measured at a downstream station, is increased in the axisymmetric jet but it is decreased in the rectangular jet under consideration by the delta-tab...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the effect of}} vortex generators, in the form of small tabs at the nozzle exit on the evolution of a jet, are reported in this paper. Primarily tabs of triangular shape are considered, and the effect is studied up to a jet Mach number of 1. 8. Each tab is found to produce a dominant pair of counter-rotating streamwise vortices having a sense of rotation opposite to that expected from the wrapping of the boundary layer. This results in an inward indentation of the mixing layer into the core of the jet. A triangular-shaped tab with its apex leaning downstream, referred to as a delta tab, is found to be the most effective in producing such vortices, with a consequential large influence on the overall jet evolution. Two delta tabs, spaced 180 deg apart, completely bifurcate the jet. Four delta tabs stretch the mixing layer into four 'fingers,' resulting in {{a significant increase in the}} jet mixing downstream. For six delta tabs the mixing layer distortion settles back to a three finger configuration through an interaction of the streamwise vortices. The tabs are found to be equally effective in jets with turbulent or laminar initial boundary layers. Two sources of streamwise vorticity are postulated for the flow under consideration. One is the upstream 'pressure hill,' generated by the tab, which constitutes the main contributor of vorticity to the dominant pair. Another is due to vortex filaments shed from the <b>sides</b> of the <b>tab</b> and reoriented downstream by the mean shear of the mixing layer. Depending on the orientation of the tab, the latter source can produce a vortex pair having a sense of rotation opposite to that of the dominant pair. In the case of the delta tab, vorticity from the two sources add, explaining the strong effect in that configuration...|$|R

Think aloud protocols (using scenarios for users to work through) ? Heuristic evaluation (using recognised criteria) ? Prototype/scenario research using mock-ups to assess (mainly) navigation and functionality ? Card sorting exercises (to assess vocabulary problems) The main messages arising from the think aloud sessions are listed below.

MAIN POINTS: 1. Search engine box at the top should be removed or improved. The main problem arising is that users do not understand that it only searches on that particular page and does not carry out a general search across the site for their request.

Most people we saw did not know Medline was part of OVID and did not look under OVID in order to find Medline. It needs to be more prominent. 3. Tabs {{at the top of the}} page need to be larger. Most people ignored them and immediately went to use the left-hand <b>side</b> short-cuts. Again, <b>tabs</b> need to be more prominent.
