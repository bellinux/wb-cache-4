500|$|At {{his first}} {{departure}} from 10 Downing Street in 1868, Disraeli had had Victoria create Mary Anne Viscountess of Beaconsfield {{in her own}} right in lieu of a peerage for himself. Through 1872 the eighty-year-old peeress was suffering from stomach cancer. [...] She died on 15 December. [...] Urged by a clergyman to turn her thoughts to Jesus Christ in her final days, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not: [...] "You know Dizzy is my J.C." [...] After she died, Gladstone, who always had a liking for Mary Anne, sent her widower a letter of condolence.|$|E
500|$|In The Bling Ring (2013), Watson {{stars as}} Nicki. The film {{is based on}} the real-life Bling Ring robberies, with Watson playing a fictionalised version of Alexis Neiers, a {{television}} personality who was one of seven teenagers involved in the robberies. While the film mostly received mixed reviews, critics gave almost unanimous praise for Watson's portrayal. Watson also had a supporting role in the apocalyptic comedy This Is the End (2013), in which she, Seth Rogen, James Franco and many others played [...] "exaggerated versions of themselves" [...] and Watson memorably dropped the [...] "f-bomb". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not pass up the opportunity to make her first comedy and [...] "work with some of the best comedians ... in the world right now".|$|E
2500|$|Thomson and Vine had {{a two-month}} {{relationship}} and they married on 8 August 2001 in New York. The next day, Vine {{said she wanted}} a divorce; they had an intense row, their room in the hotel was [...] "trashed". She left him {{and they did not}} meet again till a week later. Thomson later said that he was unable to cope with Vine's vacillations, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not cope with his controlling behaviour. The marriage ended in 2001 after about two months. They were granted a divorce in October 2003.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Mas'r Davy,' he returned, {{drawing his}} hand thoughtfully down his face. 'I asked that too; {{but it was}} more (<b>she</b> <b>said)</b> than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> tell.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{made her}} turn very white; {{but now that}} <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> what <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> still hold up her head. [...] "Certainly you might have defied me, Herbert Dodd." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{father said}} that he might go, But his dear mother <b>she</b> <b>said</b> no, [...] "Oh! stay at home, dear Billy," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not turn his head.|$|R
2500|$|On January 12, 1957, Hughes married actress Jean Peters. The couple {{met in the}} 1940s, before Peters {{became a}} film actress. They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and {{there was talk of}} marriage, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not combine it with her career. Some later claimed that Peters was [...] "the only woman [...] ever loved," [...] and he {{reportedly}} had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship. Such reports were confirmed by actor Max Showalter, who became a close friend of Peters while shooting Niagara (1953). Showalter told in an interview that because he frequently met with Peters, Hughes' men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone.|$|E
2500|$|Sills's {{voice has}} been {{described}} {{at the same time}} [...] "rich, supple", [...] "silvery", [...] "precise, a little light", [...] "multicolored", [...] "robust and enveloping", with [...] "a cutting edge that can slice through the largest orchestra and chorus," [...] soaring easily above high C. Her technique and musicianship have been much praised. Conductor Thomas Schippers said in a 1971 interview with Time that she had [...] "the fastest voice alive." [...] The New York Times writes that [...] "she could dispatch coloratura roulades and embellishments, capped with radiant high Ds and E-flats, with seemingly effortless agility. She sang with scrupulous musicianship, rhythmic incisiveness and a vivid sense of text." [...] Soprano Leontyne Price was [...] "flabbergasted at how many millions of things she can do with a written scale." [...] Her vocal range, in performance, extended from F3 to F6, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sometimes hit a G6 in warm up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cannot you cross, mother?' said Jason; and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not, {{but must}} {{wait until the}} flood fell, for there was no bridge.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{would not}} {{submit to the}} rite {{when it came to}} the point. The water looked so cold and dark and fearful, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do it to save her life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no; no; {{it is not}} that," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> eagerly. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} saying it with eagerness. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not inflict the wound on his {{feelings}} which her silence would then have given.|$|R
60|$|He paused, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> no word. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not. After a space, he went wistfully on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear}} {{that you should}} be pained on your friend's wedding-day. I am much comforted to find that you {{appreciate}} the effort.' ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Bulstrode rose. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never {{thank them}} {{sufficiently}} {{for all their}} goodness to her. Miss Bulstrode seemed quite overcome. Her voice trembled with emotion.|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate, {{you know}} she refused to come, even for a visit. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not leave the farm. She may refuse to let her child come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all! No {{one less}} so!" [...] As <b>she</b> <b>said</b> this <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not hinder the colour from coming into her face. [...] "I was her friend,--Lady Glencora's; {{but with the}} death of my friend there was an end of all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} have not to me. Poor Mabel! Then {{they took me to}} Custins. That was worst of all. I cannot quite tell you what {{happened}} there." [...] Of course he asked her,--but, as <b>she</b> had <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not quite tell him about Lord Popplecourt.|$|R
6000|$|Then Wendy saw {{the shadow}} on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was frightfully sorry for Peter. 'How awful!' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not help smiling when she {{saw that he had}} been trying to stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, certainly, a most {{imperative}} duty; but so delicious at {{the same}} time. I spoke to Mrs Umbleby about it, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not leave the children." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. McGREGOR {{took hold}} of the sack and felt it. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel six, but they must be OLD rabbits, because they were so hard and all {{different}} shapes.|$|E
60|$|Athelstane {{burst into}} a loud laugh, when he heard it, at the last line, but Rowena {{would have had the}} fool whipped, had not the Thane interceded; and to him, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> refuse nothing.|$|E
60|$|Next {{moment he}} was gone. She went upstairs and found Cassandra on the landing. She held two or three books in her hand, and she was stooping to look at others in a little bookcase. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never tell which book she wanted to read in bed, poetry, biography, or metaphysics.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, let me cry, Silas! It'll help me. I {{shall be}} all right in a minute. Don't you mind." [...] She sobbed herself quiet. [...] "It does seem too hard," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak again, [...] "that {{you have to give}} up this chance when Providence had fairly raised it up for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almia now {{explained}} how {{she happened to}} appear upon the scene, and, addressing the wounded man, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> hoped <b>she</b> <b>could</b> soon find some way of conveying him to a hospital. 'Hospital!' he cried, springing to his feet under the revivifying influence of the brandy. 'No hospital for me! I can walk as well as anybody. And now, sir,' he said, speaking to his former opponent, 'am I to consider myself vanquished, and am I {{to go with you}} as your prisoner?' The other regarded him without answering, and for the moment Almia, too, was lost in reflection." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{found his}} mother busy; and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not {{go and get}} a basket for him; but she told him the chip-basket was {{probably}} in {{its place in the}} shed, and he might go and get that.|$|E
60|$|When she {{got home}} she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having thanked her, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{can use a}} chafing-dish,' he resumed, {{his voice}} {{vibrating}} with emotion. 'She told me so. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> fix chicken so that a man would leave home for it.' He paused, momentarily overcome. 'And Welsh rarebits,' he added reverently.|$|E
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} overweigh them; {{something}} more than the natural sadness of a parting which {{was not to be}} long; and he decided that instead of leaving in the daytime as he had intended, he would defer his departure till night, and go by the mail-train from Budmouth. This would give him time to look into his father's quarries, and enable her, if she chose, to walk with him along the beach as far as to Henry the Eighth's Castle above the sands, where they could linger and watch the moon rise over the sea. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> come.|$|R
60|$|This renewed all her fears. She was {{convinced}} now that both baby and I were doomed, {{and that she}} would be left a childless widow. I tried to treat the matter as a joke, and this only made her more wretched. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see I really felt as she did, and was only pretending to be light-hearted for her sake, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> would try and bear it bravely.|$|R
60|$|They spoke much {{during those}} {{days of the}} coming parting, and <b>she</b> always <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear it if she saw him go away more of a man than he had come.|$|R
6000|$|... "However, {{pretty soon}} they {{contrived}} to fasten up the curtain, {{and then they}} could see out a little over our shoulders. The girl sat directly behind me. I {{asked her if she}} could see, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> very well.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find nothing, {{but that}} she would seek further, and went back along the lion's path until {{she could see the}} mound again, but she could not bring herself to take the meat; she had the brute's {{instinct}} of a snare. She felt very miserable.|$|E
60|$|Though the girl's colour {{was coming}} back, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> walk quite well, both had such aching knees and such shaken limbs {{that they were}} glad to hold by {{each other as they}} mounted the sloping road, and half-way up Gillian came to a sudden stop.|$|E
50|$|Later that day, Ramos {{questions}} Dori at {{the police}} station about the attack on her and why Townsend, apparently not dead, kidnapped her. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not say positively why he was not dead but that both Yates and Townsend were possibly high on and drugs and that fooled her and cause the attack. Ramos, not believing but having no other explanation, lets Dori go.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} hurts," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "which do not admit of an {{absolute}} and perfect cure, unless after long years." [...] As <b>she</b> <b>said</b> so, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not but think {{how much better}} was his chance of such perfect cure than her own. With her,--so <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to herself,--such curing was all but impossible; whereas with him, it was as impossible that the injury should last.|$|R
6000|$|Marcia gasped, as if {{she felt}} the clutch in which her husband had her {{tightening}} on her heart. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only carry her point against him {{at the cost of}} disgraceful division before the Hallecks, for which he would not care in the least. She moved her head a little from side to side, like one that breathes a stifling air. [...] "Oh, let her come," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> quietly, at last.|$|R
