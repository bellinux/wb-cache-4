50|$|Poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) {{is a low}} {{bleeding}} {{material with}} {{a low level of}} impurities, and has a high thermal stability (up to 350 °C). Before use poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) should be thermally conditioned with a high purity gas at elevated temperatures to remove any residual components. During conditioning or thermal desorption the presence of oxygen should be avoided. Poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) reacts with oxidising agents such as chlorine, ozone, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides forming acetophenone, benzaldehyde and phenol. Therefore control of blanks is essential and storage time of samples on poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) is less than a month. Pre-filters based on <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> or Teflon may be appropriate to use. The breakthrough volumes are low for very volatile substances.

50|$|Microtox can {{be applied}} to a variety of {{matrices}} including drinking water, stormwater runoff, effluent, industrial discharges, soils and sediments. Most samples do not require special preparation before testing besides adjusting the salinity to 2%. However, samples that have certain characteristics, such as high turbidity levels, may require special preparation. If samples require a salinity adjustment to lower the salinity, this can be accomplished by adding an appropriate amount of Microtox Osmotic Adjusting Solution to dilute the sample. For example, adding 0.1 mL of MOAS to 1 mL of sample would result in a dilution of 90.9% of the original concentration. If a greater salinity is required, this can be accomplished by dissolving solid sodium chloride in the sample to achieve a final salinity of 2% for the protection of Allivibrio fischeri. Highly turbid samples that contain particulate matter will be required to settle before the test can be conducted. Particulate matter in the sample can interfere with bioluminescence by absorbing light and give misleading test results. Interference of luminescence can also occur with samples which are highly colored (particularly red, brown or black). It may be necessary to centrifuge samples to obtain an acceptable clarity for the test. If samples contain chlorine, this may alter the toxicity to Allivibrio fischeri and also give misleading results. The samples can be de-chlorinated using a <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> and deionized water solution that does not affect test results. Ideally, the pH of samples should not be modified since it is preferable to test each sample at the original pH level. However, if it is necessary to adjust the pH this should be done by adding either sodium hydroxide solution or hydrochloric acid to the sample.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} was {{therefore}} directed towards understanding the effect of different substrates/metabolic intermediates and reducing agents <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> and methyl viologen) on enhancing lipid productivity of this promising Chlorella sp. In the present investigation, comparative growth kinetics and lipid productivity {{in the presence of}} two reducing agents- <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> and methyl viologen provided interesting results. Growth studies revealed that tryptophan was most productive in the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulphate,</b> but with methyl viologen, fructose performed better. Lipid productivity was significantly higher in tryptophan supplemented cultures with both reducing agents. <b>Sodium</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> is known to play a dual role as a potent antioxidant and chelator of calcium and other toxic substances and is classified by the FDA as a direct food substance affirmed as generally recognized as safe. On the other hand, methyl viologen, undergoes redox cycling in vivo, being reduced by an electron donor such as NADPH, before being oxidized by an electron receptor such as dioxygen to produce superoxide, a major ROS (reactive oxygen species). It inhibits photosynthesis, besides being a groove-binding DNA ligand. In the present study, the low concentration used did not inhibit growth or lipid accumulation, but stringent monitoring may need to be employed for using methyl viologen, as compared to the safety of <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulphate</b> utilization.
