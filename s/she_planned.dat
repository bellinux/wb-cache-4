5|$|After {{her high}} school graduation, <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to attend Alcorn State University, which {{did not have a}} women's {{basketball}} team. However, she was asked by Melvin Hemphill, the recruiter for coach Margaret Wade, who was restarting a collegiate women's team, if she would attend Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. This was before Title IX, so there were no sports scholarships for women. She attended school on a combination of academic scholarships and work study funds.|$|E
5|$|Lehmann and David {{agreed that}} her next book {{should be about}} Italian food; at the time, little was known in Britain about Italian cuisine and {{interest}} in the country was on the rise.

After disagreements over the perceived colour of the dress in the photograph, the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some saw it as white with gold lace, while others saw it as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E
5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> {{to do at the}} Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E

5|$|David told Scott-James that <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> {{to publish}} the {{articles}} as a book, and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called A Book of Mediterranean Food; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of authenticity, and several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript {{to a series of}} publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he accepted it and agreed to an advance payment of £100. A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in June 1950.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{unfinished}} state, Catherine often {{visited the}} palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved {{to walk in}} the gardens. According to the French military leader Marshal Tavannes, it was in the Tuileries gardens that <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris. The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter Bernard Palissy. In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the Valois tapestries. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the crown of Poland to her son, the duke of Anjou, later Henry III of France. Henry IV later added to the Tuileries; but Louis XVI was to dismantle sections of the palace. The communards set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.|$|E

5|$|From {{the area}} of Daugavpils she entered Lithuania, where in April 1831 her unit is rumored to have seized the town of Zarasai, {{although}} the historians are not sure this event really occurred. <b>She</b> <b>planned</b> to take Daugavpils, but after a reconnaissance mission discovered {{that the city was}} defended by a strong garrison and was impregnable to attack by such a small force as her own unit, that plan was abandoned. She then returned to Samogitia and headed for Panevėžys, where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by Karol Załuski. On May 4, she fought at the battle of Prastavoniai; shortly afterwards, with Konstanty Parczewski, she fought at Maišiagala. On 5 May, she witnessed General Dezydery Chłapowski entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and colleagues {{that she was not}} looking forward to spending the weekend alone as it would be her first in the flat without Reardon; <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm. She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-licence, Bargain Booze.|$|E
5|$|Knopf {{decided to}} produce The Big Pond in New York and {{appointed}} Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired {{and replaced with}} Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too quickly to be comprehensible. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted {{the role of a}} schoolgirl in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. <b>She</b> <b>planned</b> to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.|$|E

5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Sanger {{returned}} to the United States in October 1915. <b>She</b> <b>planned</b> to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her.Kennedy, p. 77. Noted attorney Clarence Darrow offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916.Sanger, Autobiography, pp. 183–189.Engelman, p. 61–62: Sanger also gained sympathy from the public when her five-year-old daughter died immediately before the trial. No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into {{the leadership of the}} U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or turned their attention to other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E

5|$|The second {{controversy}} arose as {{a result}} of the renovation of the governor's mansion. Kentucky first lady Phyllis George Brown created the Save the Mansion Fund to help cover the costs of the renovation. When the renovation was complete, <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> a nine-day showcase of the mansion for the general public. Guests were charged $10 to take a tour of the mansion. Legislator Eugene P. Stuart objected to taxpayers being charged a fee to view a mansion their tax dollars supported. He asked Beshear to protest the charge, and Beshear requested an injunction against the Save the Mansion Fund. A Lexington judge refused to grant the injunction, and Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's decision. Beshear's actions caused a rift between him and Governor John Y. Brown, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Mercedes Barbudo, the Spanish {{authorities}} in Puerto Rico under Governor Miguel de la Torre, were {{suspicious of the}} correspondence {{between her and the}} rebel factions of Venezuela. Secret agents of the Spanish Government had retained some of her mail and delivered it to Governor de la Torre. He ordered an investigation and had her mail confiscated. The Government believed that the correspondence served as propaganda of the Bolivian ideals and that it would also serve to motivate Puerto Ricans to seek their independence. Governor Miguel de la Torre ordered her arrest on the charge that <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to overthrow the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. Since Puerto Rico did not have a women's prison she was held without bail at the Castillo San Cristóbal. Among the evidence which the Spanish authorities presented against her was Rojas letter. She was exiled to Cuba where she was able to escape and make her way to Venezuela where she spent her final days.|$|E

Later that month, Salzgeber removed herself from consideration for competition at the 2011 CHIO Aachen and European Dressage Championships. She {{announced that}} she had decided to take a break from competition and focus more on training and her personal life. In 2012, she {{announced that she}} would not be seeking a spot on the German team for the 2012 Summer Olympics, saying that her training duties had not given her time to properly prepare Herzruf's Erbe. She had ridden the horse at competitions during the 2011-2012 winter, and stated that <b>she</b> <b>planned</b> to compete at additional competitions during the winter of 2012-2013. However, in late 2012, the horse was put into a one-year rest period to help him recover from the injuries that had troubled him throughout his career. In October 2013, Salzgeber brought Herzruf's Erbe back into competition, winning a national show in Germany.
