5|$|The Bay Area {{is located}} in the {{relatively}} rare warm-summer Mediterranean climate zone (Köppen Csb) that is a characteristic of California's coast, with moist mild winters and dry summers. It is largely influenced by the cold California Current, which penetrates the natural mountainous barrier along the coast by traveling through various gaps. In terms of precipitation, this means that the Bay Area has pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season, which roughly runs between November and March, is the source of about 82% of annual precipitation in the area. In the South Bay and further inland, while the wet <b>season</b> <b>is</b> cool and mild, the summer dry <b>season</b> <b>is</b> characterized by warm sunny days, while in San Francisco and areas closer to the Golden Gate strait, the dry <b>season</b> <b>is</b> periodically affected by fog.|$|E

5|$|The wet <b>season</b> <b>is</b> {{the main}} period of {{vegetation}} growth within the Savanna climate regime. However, this {{also means that}} wet <b>season</b> <b>is</b> a time for food shortages before crops reach their full maturity.

5|$|The wet, or rainy, <b>season</b> <b>is</b> {{the time}} of year, {{covering}} one or more months, {{when most of the}} average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green <b>season</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet <b>season</b> <b>is</b> a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E
