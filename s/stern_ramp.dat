25|$|The LCMs can {{be loaded}} from either of Canterburys two 60 tonne cranes or via the <b>stern</b> <b>ramp.</b> To aid <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> loading, the MRV is fitted with Flippers {{to ensure that}} the LCM are aligned with the MRV. A {{ballasting}} system is fitted to allow for safe operations during loading. Once loaded, the LCM can conduct over-the-beach landings, with the boats mainly intended to be able to access beaches in the Pacific where no port facilities are available, for example during humanitarian missions.|$|E
25|$|Externally one of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} changes in addition to the <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> was lowering the lookout post in the bow to improve visibility from the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The first {{trawlers}} fished {{over the}} side, rather than over the stern. In 1947, the company Christian Salvesen, based in Leith, Scotland, refitted a surplus Algerine-class minesweeper (HMS Felicity) with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship <b>stern</b> <b>ramp,</b> {{to produce the}} first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.|$|E

50|$|She brought vastly {{improved}} standards of passenger comfort and became popular, with slightly reduced sailing times and, {{once she was}} able to use her bow and <b>stern</b> <b>ramps,</b> greatly reduced turn-round times.|$|R
25|$|Patrol Frigate 4501 is {{very similar}} to the NSC, the main {{differences}} being a modified <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> and a knuckleboom crane replacing the overhead crane. The crew is increased to 148, and it was offered to the US Navy as a replacement for the Littoral Combat Ship; the FY13 cost of an LCS was $446.3m compared to $735m for an NSC.|$|E
25|$|Otter {{trawlers}} {{usually have}} two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated {{by its own}} winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was also}} {{interesting}} {{in its use}} of ro-ro for the Trans Tasman route. The cargo did not necessarily just contain truck and trailer units, but was also cargo stacked in the decks using forklifts. This necessitated the vehicle decks of the ship being build to withstand the loading of up to 39t per axle that could be exerted by a heavy forklift. Union Rotorua was built with a large angled <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> that allowed her to unload her cargo at any wharf {{without the need for}} a specialist linkspan as required by most ro-ro ships. She also had a bow door which could be used if a linkspan was present in a port, thus allowing cargo to be worked both forward and aft speeding up turn around time.|$|E

50|$|Sound of Sanda had {{a single}} car deck with bow and <b>stern</b> <b>ramps.</b> The {{crossing}} was so short that many passengers stayed in their vehicles, but side viewing decks and passenger cabins were available.|$|R
5000|$|Eilean Dhiura {{is an open}} {{landing craft}} type ferry, with bow and <b>stern</b> <b>ramps.</b> Her slim bridge allows {{vehicles}} to drive through. A small enclosed cabin provides shelter for passengers as does a bus shelter forward of the wheelhouse.|$|R
500|$|A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, , links Rùm and the {{neighbouring}} Small Isles of Canna, Eigg and Muck, {{to the mainland}} port of Mallaig some [...] and 1½ hours sailing time away. The Lochnevis has a landing craft-style <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> allowing vehicles to be driven onto and off the vessel at a new slipway constructed in 2001. However, visitors are not normally permitted to bring vehicles to the Small Isles. During the summer months the islands are also served by Arisaig Marine's ferry MV Sheerwater from Arisaig, [...] south of Mallaig.|$|E
2500|$|The larger type were 11,910-ton, [...] diesel-engined ships {{fitted with}} <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> gates for {{launching}} twenty Daihatsu class landing craft stored in floodable holds. At the time, this launching method was unprecedented. Both were sunk by submarines with very heavy loss of life.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917 Thornycroft {{produced}} an enlarged [...] overall version. This allowed a heavier payload, and now two torpedoes could be carried. A mixed warload {{of a single}} torpedo and four depth charges could also be carried, the depth charges released from individual cradles over the sides, rather than a <b>stern</b> <b>ramp.</b>|$|E
50|$|She and {{her sister}} ships are {{equipped}} with a <b>stern</b> launching <b>ramp,</b> like some other cutters built to Damen designs. The <b>stern</b> launching <b>ramp</b> allows a water-jet-powered pursuit boat to be launched and retrieved without bringing the cutter to a halt.|$|R
5000|$|Finlaggan is of ro-ro {{design with}} bow and <b>stern</b> <b>ramps.</b> She {{is the first}} CalMac ship to have [...] "clam shell" [...] bow doors, that open sideways. The car deck is {{partially}} open at the stern and has a mezzanine deck capable of taking an additional 18 cars.|$|R

A mixed warload {{of a single}} torpedo and four depth charges could also be carried, the depth charges released from individual cradles over the sides, rather than a <b>stern</b> <b>ramp.</b> Speeds from [...] were possible, depending on the various petrol engines fitted. At least two unexplained losses due to fires in port {{are thought to have}} been caused by a build-up of petrol vapour igniting.|$|E
2500|$|The vessel {{now known}} as Cape Texas was laid down by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in Kiel, Germany. She is a {{conventional}} RO/RO (Vehicle Carrier) ship with the superstructure aft, followed by twin funnels, and a <b>stern</b> <b>ramp.</b> [...] She is [...] in overall length with a lightweight displacement of [...] and a fully loaded displacement of [...] For carrying US Army and Marine Corps combat vehicles, she has [...] of cargo capacity. She can carry 340 containers plus vehicles and her hull is ice strengthened.|$|E
2500|$|Baltic Ace {{was a car}} carrier, a roll-on/roll-off ship {{designed}} to transport vehicles in a large, fully enclosed garage-like superstructure running the entire length and width of the vessel. She had eight cargo decks with a minimum free height of [...] Two decks (3 and 5) could be hoisted up to increase the clearance of the decks below to [...] for large vehicles. Her car capacity, measured in RT43 units, was 2,132. For loading and unloading cargo, Baltic Ace had a <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> for normal ro-ro berths and a stern quarter ramp for harbours with no specialized cargo handling facilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} Coruisk is unique. As well as bow and <b>stern</b> <b>ramps,</b> {{allowing}} drive-through operation, {{she also has}} a port side ramp, allowing side-loading on the Clyde in winter months. The bow ramp is protected by an open visor, similar to those found on Orkney and Shetland inter-island ferries. Clearance on the car deck is 5.1m.|$|R

50|$|The {{catamaran}} has {{an overall}} length of 86.62 meters, {{a beam of}} 26.00 m and a draft of 3.62 m. Her gross tonnage amounts 4.995 GT. The machinery consists of four Ruston 20RK270 engines with a total output of 28320 kW (38,500 HP) allowing a maximum service speed of 42 kn. 800 passengers and 185 cars can be accommodated on board; the spacious car deck is accessed via two <b>stern</b> <b>ramps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|MV Pioneer {{resembled the}} three ferries, , [...] and , (commonly known as 'the three streakers') {{which had been}} {{introduced}} on the Clyde. The [...] passenger accommodation was forward and the open car deck aft. She sported two funnels amidships and her mainmast was a gantry right at the stern. She was fitted with twin controllable pitch propellers, twin rudders, stabilisers and bow thrusters. She was originally stern-loading only with a hydraulic <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> and two 3½ ton Hiab cargo cranes just abaft of the superstructure. To take over the Mallaig - Armadale (Skye) service, she was fitted with a hoist, allowing stern / side loading. The hoist was removed again in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight deck}} is 1.5 {{times the size}} of that of a {{standard}} surface ship, and uses a Trigon traversing system to move helicopters {{in and out of the}} hangar. The ship has two ways to launch and recover various mission packages: a <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> and a starboard side door near the waterline. The mission module bay has a 3-axis crane for positioning modules or cargo. The fore deck has a modular weapons zone which can be used for a 57mm gun turret or missile launcher. A Rolling Airframe Missile launcher is mounted above the hangar for short-range defense against aircraft and cruise missiles, and [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) gun mounts are provided topside.|$|E
50|$|The vessel is {{fitted with}} a large <b>stern</b> <b>ramp,</b> and two side midship ramps. The <b>stern</b> <b>ramp</b> is located on Number 7 car deck. The midship ramps are capable of being lifted up to reach number 6 car deck, and hence can service both - numbers 6 and 7 car decks.|$|E
