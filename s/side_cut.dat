25|$|Users of the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Loughborough Canal and the Erewash Canal next demanded major {{improvements}} to the river down to Gainsborough, including new cuts, locks, dredging and a towing path suitable for horses. The Dadfords, who were engineers on the Trent and Mersey Canal, estimated the cost at £20,000, but the proposal was opposed by landowners and merchants on the river, while the Navigator, published in 1788, estimated that around 500 men who were employed to bow-haul boats would have lost their jobs. Agreement could not be reached, and so William Jessop was asked to re-assess the situation. He suggested that dredging, deepening, and restricting {{the width of the}} channel could make significant {{improvements to the}} navigable depth, although cuts would be required at Wilford, Nottingham bridge and Holme. This proposal formed the basis for an Act of Parliament obtained in 1783, which also allowed a horse towing path to be built. The work was completed by September 1787, and dividends of 5 per cent were paid on the capital during 1786 and 1787, increasing to 7 per cent, the maximum allowed by the Act, after that. Jessop carried out a survey for a <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> and lock at Sawley in 1789, and it was built by 1793.|$|E

An actual plane, with one <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> open, was one of two planes used to depict the crashed aircraft. Patrizia Von Brandenstein was the film's production designer, marking her second collaboration with Raimi, after The Quick and the Dead (1995).

But when this is not so, and the base is narrowed so that the slope of side shall be nearly equal everywhere, she almost always obtains her varied curvature of the plume in another way, by merely turning the crest a little round as it descends.

As he had said, there was plenty on board, but none of the size or shape that he required, and he was about to quit in despair when he observed the flat iron plates, about five inches square and quarter of an inch thick, with a large hole in the centre of each, which formed the sockets that held the davits for suspending the ship's boats. A crowbar enabled him, after much trouble, to wrench off one of these. A handspike was, after some hours' labour, converted into a handle with one <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> flat. Laying the plate on this, he marked its exact size, and then cut away the wood until the iron sank its own thickness into it. There were plenty of nails in the wreck; with these he nailed the iron, through its own nail-holes, to the hard handspike, and, still further to secure it, he covered it with a little piece of flat wood, which he bound firmly on with some cordage made by his sister from cocoa-nut fibre. As the iron projected {{on both sides of the}} handle, it thus formed a double-edged axe of the most formidable appearance.

60|$|The {{second reason}} given is, that {{at certain times}} of the year the native grasses of the country, which are very sweet and good, turn as yellow as ripe corn; and the third arises from a {{tradition}} that the people were originally yellow skinned, but grew white after living for many generations upon these high lands. Zu-Vendis is a country about the size of France, is, roughly speaking, oval in shape; and on every <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> off from the surrounding territory by illimitable forests of impenetrable thorn, beyond which are said to be hundreds of miles of morasses, deserts, and great mountains. It is, in short, a huge, high tableland rising up in the centre of the dark continent, much as in southern Africa flat-topped mountains rise from the level of the surrounding veldt. Milosis itself lies, according to my aneroid, at a level of about nine thousand feet above the sea, but most of the land is even higher, the greatest elevation of the open country being, I believe, about eleven thousand feet. As a consequence the climate is, comparatively speaking, a cold one, being very similar to that of southern England, only brighter and not so rainy. The land is, however, exceedingly fertile, and grows all cereals and temperate fruits and timber to perfection; and in the lower-lying parts even produces a hardy variety of sugar-cane. Coal is found in great abundance, and in many places crops out from the surface; and so is pure marble, both black and white. The same may be said of almost every metal except silver, which is scarce, and only to be obtained from a range of mountains in the north.|$|E

60|$|But to be serious. I am obliged {{always to}} write the name of Goliah in full, to {{distinguish}} me from my brother, Gregory Gahagan, {{who was also a}} Major (in the King's service), and whom I killed in a duel, as the public most likely knows. Poor Greg! a very trivial dispute was the cause of our quarrel, which never would have originated but for the similarity of our names. The circumstance was this: I had been lucky enough to render the Nawaub of Lucknow some trifling service (in the notorious affair of Choprasjee Muckjee), and his Highness sent down a gold toothpick-case directed to Captain G. Gahagan, which I of course thought was for me: my brother madly claimed it; we fought, and the consequence was, that in about three minutes he received a slash in the right <b>side</b> (<b>cut</b> 6), which effectually did his business:- he was a good swordsman enough--I was THE BEST in the universe.

I can't conceive what madness prompted him to fight about such a paltry bauble; he had much better have yielded it at once, when he saw I was determined to have it. From this slight specimen of my adventures, the reader will perceive that my life has been one of no ordinary interest; and, in fact, I may say that I have led a more remarkable life than any man in the service--I have been at more pitched battles, led more forlorn hopes, had more success among the fair sex, drunk harder, read more, been a handsomer man than any officer now serving Her Majesty.|$|E

I hope you don't believe me jealous! But yet, methinks, I feel it true, And really yours is budding too-- Nay,--now I cannot stir my foot; It feels as if 'twere taking root." [...] Description would but tire my Muse, In short, they both were turn'd to yews. Old Goodman Dobson of the Green Remembers he the trees has seen; He'll talk of them from noon till night, And goes with folk to show the sight; On Sundays, after evening prayer, He gathers all the parish there; Points out the place of either yew, Here Baucis, there Philemon, grew: Till once a parson of our town, To mend his barn, cut Baucis down; At which, 'tis hard to be believ'd How much the other tree was griev'd, Grew scrubby, dy'd a-top, was stunted, So the next parson stubb'd and burnt it.|$|E

"The two-decked {{wooden ship}} which were turned into {{armoured}} frigates had their <b>sides</b> <b>cut</b> down considerably, {{and the main}} deck and its battery removed; while the armour, although about equal in weight to the parts removed, is not as high above water. the iron-clad is, therefore, less top-heavy than the wooden ship was previously to be converted; in other words the conversion {{has the effect of}} bringing down the centre of gravity of the ship." ...|$|R

Those on the upper flank are much the largest; and the loftiest of them terminates in a conical hill crowned with Boodhist flags, and its steep <b>sides</b> <b>cut</b> into horizontal roads or terraces, one of which is so broad and flat as to suggest the idea of its having been cleared by art.|$|R

50|$|The <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> {{is located}} at the {{intersection}} of the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of jack rafters. This corresponds to the <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> angle of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided with deep, rounded decking and slender overall to the rear. [...] The cockpits were in tandem, the pilots {{at the rear}} with <b>sides</b> <b>cut</b> {{to the bottom of}} the decking. He sat behind the trailing edge, with a cut-out in the upper wing to improve visibility. The observers cockpit was between the wings and less deep. The air-cooled 70 hp (52 kW) Renault engine was uncowled and drove a four-bladed propeller. The single-axle undercarriage was attached to two longitudinal members which ran forward to serve as anti-nose-over skids, fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of robust struts.|$|R
