500|$|Time {{contributor}} James Poniewozik was complimentary {{towards the}} casting of Jon Hamm as Tina Fey's love interest, but hoped that Hamm get [...] "fleshed {{out beyond the}} central-casting dreamboat" [...] in the series. Further in his review, Poniewozik said that he most enjoyed episodes in which Liz shows her [...] "evil side" [...] because the show [...] "does {{an excellent job of}} showing how much work it is for her to be assertive and slightly evil, how she's excited yet made nervous by the idea at the same time." [...] As with Poniewozik, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club complimented 30 Rock as they [...] "pulled it off with aplomb" [...] in regards to Liz's actions in this episode. He said that Liz and Drew [...] "are <b>so</b> <b>damned</b> delightful that it's hard not to root for them even if Liz's antics increasingly border on deranged and criminal." [...] Rabin said that the Rohypnol incident was funny [...] "but also sweet {{and more than a little}} romantic." [...] Sassone enjoyed Liz and Drew's scenes, writing that when Fey and Hamm work together they are quite good. Gold said that Liz's unsuccessful attempts of seduction were [...] "hilarious effects". Canning wrote that Liz's [...] "scam" [...] started weakly but that her storyline [...] "grew at a great pace." ...|$|E
500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] good you can't help {{wondering}} {{why no one}} thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation {{of what it takes}} to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is <b>so</b> <b>damned</b> sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E
500|$|The Battery {{was ordered}} into the Ypres salient. On October 12, {{shelling}} found their position killing Major Southam and Sergeant-Major Norm Harvie, making Smythe temporarily {{commander of the}} Battery. The Battery fought for nearly two months in the trenches near the Somme before being relieved. In February 1917, Smythe earned a Military Cross, when during an attack the Germans counter-attacked with grenades. Smythe ran into the fight and killed three Germans and helped several wounded Canadian soldiers back to safety On March 5, 1917, Smythe was awarded the Military Cross for [...] "dispersing an enemy party at a critical time. Himself accounted for three of the enemy with his revolver." [...] After an attack where several Canadians were killed because of what Smythe thought was poor planning by the Battery's Major, Smythe wanted out. Smythe transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in July 1917. One of his instructors was Billy Barker, who would later become {{the first president of}} the Toronto Maple Leafs. Smythe served as an airborne observer, directing artillery fire. Smythe was shot down by the Germans and captured on October 14, 1917. He was imprisoned by the Germans at Schweidnitz (Swidnica) in Upper Silesia. He made two failed escape attempts and ended up in solitary confinement as a result. He was a POW {{until the end of the}} war. Smythe would later make light of his fourteen months in captivity [...] "We played <b>so</b> <b>damned</b> much bridge that I never played the game again." ...|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} John D. Luerssen {{wrote that}} What to Do When You Are Dead [...] "ups the punk/emo ante" [...] with [...] "fabulously" [...] composed songs, {{as well as}} a [...] "desire to challenge the norms of a movement that has grown increasingly stale". He described Jorgensen as going [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "flirting with his inner Aaron Lewis". Luerssen called the band's choice of working with Machine as being [...] "a risk that paid off". Chart Attack called the album a [...] "surprisingly meaty sophomore record," [...] with the group's [...] "dynamic double-guitar attack" [...] benefiting from Machine's [...] "prog-metal predilections". Chart Attack concluded with: [...] "Songs about dead people have rarely sounded <b>so</b> <b>damned</b> full of life." [...] Raziq Rauf of Drowned in Sound wrote that the record had [...] "two great songs on here that fill the unashamed emo cynic with hope, only to be let down" [...] by the remainder of the album. He {{went on to say that}} a [...] "slight redemption can be made" [...] with the album's title, but aside from that, [...] "there's nothing else to say that you've not read before". LAS Magazine writer David Spain called the album [...] "an interesting notch along the battered branch of emo's legacy," [...] with the band giving [...] "its peers food for thought". Spain noted that the group [...] "didn't just set out to create another 40-minute schmaltz fest; they vested thought and idea into their work". Spain concluded by mentioning how the band [...] "succeed in creating a surprisingly original work in a drowning genre".|$|E
2500|$|The Atlanta {{acoustic}} {{music scene}} {{at the time was}} split between the Trackside and The Freight Room. [...] When The Freight Room closed in 1992, Conoscenti, Wilcox, and most of Atlanta's other notable musicians like The Indigo Girls, Shawn Mullins, Kristian Bush, and others moved to Eddie's Attic. His first record, Carved in Stone on the DB Records label was released that year, followed by Beneath Your Moon. In 1994, he met Ellis Paul at Eddie's, and the two have been close friends and collaborators since. Conoscenti frequently plays guitar at Paul's shows around the country, including accompanying Paul for many years at his traditional New Year's Eve shows at Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Conoscenti left Atlanta that year and toured the country almost continuously until 2004. [...] During that time he released Boxes of Bones, My Brilliant Masterpiece, One for the Road, Mysterious Light, Paradox of Grace, Extremely Live at Eddie's Attic, and Turn Here. Mysterious Light climbed into the top 20 albums played by folk and acoustic DJs worldwide. In his review of My Brilliant Masterpiece for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Shawn Linderman said: [...] "Weaving in and out of love from both directions, touching on friendships and loss, Don Conoscenti's latest solo acoustic work is cozy and warm. But don't be misled into thinking these tunes are slow and simple. Don can be blistering away on guitar, stretching his vocal range to its limits and interspersing wild wails and growls, and yet the song still comes across as comforting. Don't ask me how he does it-- that's what's <b>so</b> <b>damned</b> fascinating about his music!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic stated [...] " [...] it's {{a terrific}} little pop record [...] an unexpected gift, a slick, tuneful set of pure sugarcoated fun. Here, melody runs through both the verses and choruses, the hooks dig deeper, {{not just on}} the tracks helmed by Martin, but on the Orgliasso sisters' songs, too." [...] Laura Sinagra from Blender complimented their songs “4ever“, which she said sounded like [...] " [...] a remix of Kelly Clarkson's “Since U Been Gone” [...] " [...] and “When It All Falls Apart“ [...] which has [...] " [...] the marching, singalong wistfulness of great late-’80s arena pop." [...] But she called the ballads [...] " [...] copious [...] dull" [...] but complimented their cover of Tracy Bonham’s hit Mother Mother. E! Online gave the album a C grade complementing [...] "4ever" [...] as [...] " [...] an endearing pop take on the Donnas' slutty garage rock." [...] But then said the album [...] " [...] feels like it was designed by committee, with each track sounding like a second generation Xerox of the token girlie rocker hit on the last five Now! compilations" [...] Christian Hoard from Rolling Stone said that [...] "4ever" [...] was the only exceptional song on the album while the rest of it [...] " [...] is overrun with bland, airbrushed introspection like [...] "Mother Mother" [...] and [...] "Nobody Wins." [...] Slant Magazine called the album [...] " [...] <b>so</b> <b>damned</b> slick and irresistible There's a punky sassiness to most of the album" [...] Dan Raper of PopMatters compared their style of music to those of Avril Lavigne and Kelly Clarkson. He complimented their songs [...] "Revolution", [...] "Leave Me Alone", [...] "Mouth Shut" [...] and [...] "Heavily Broken" [...] stating that [...] "half the songs on the record fall into this mould of attractively packaged, unremarkable pop." [...] Craig Mathieson of The Age gave positive reviews for [...] "4ever" [...] and [...] "Revolution" [...] but criticised the rest of the album. The New York Times said the album had [...] "Sugar-sharp songs with a hint of intrigue", and Entertainment Weekly also complimented them stating [...] "Guilty pleasure or not, these girls won't be a Secret for long." ...|$|E
