5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve <b>skin</b> <b>moisture</b> by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.|$|E

50|$|Sericin {{has also}} been used in {{medicine}} and cosmetics. Due to its elasticity and tensile strength, along with a natural affinity for keratin, sericin is primarily used in medicine for wound suturing. It also has a natural infection resistance, and is used variably due to excellent biocompatibility, and thus is used commonly as a wound coagulant as well. When used in cosmetics, sericin {{has been found to}} improve skin elasticity and several anti-aging factors, including an anti-wrinkle property. This is done by minimizing water loss from the skin. To determine this, scientists ran several experimental procedures, including a hydroxyproline assay, impedance measurements, water loss from the epidermis and scanning electron microscopy to analyze the rigidity and dryness of the skin. The presence or sericin increases hydroxyproline in the stratum corneum, which in turn, decrease skin impedance, thus increasing <b>skin</b> <b>moisture.</b> Adding in pluronic and carbopol, two other factors that can be included in sericin gels, perform the action of repairing natural moisture factors (NMF), along with minimizing water loss, and in turn, improving <b>skin</b> <b>moisture.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background/Objective: Dryness is {{considered}} to be an early developmental mechanism of wrin-kles, and fine line formation is marked in atopic dermatitis (AD) accompanied by dry skin. To evaluate the efficacy of a skincare product with a moisturizing effect increased by lamellar formu-lation of pseudo-ceramide for fine lines and wrinkles, a use test was performed applying the product to non-lesional dry skin in patients with atopic dermatitis. Method: The test product was an essence containing pseudo-ceramide formulated in a lamellar structure. The study design was a nine-week single-center non-comparative study, and the evaluation items were the grade of wrinkles at the corners of the eyes judged by a dermatologist, replica analysis, and instrumental measurement (<b>skin</b> surface <b>moisture</b> and transepidermal water loss). Results: Nine-week conti-nuous use of the test product significantly improved the score of wrinkles at the corners of the eyes judged by a dermatologist and wrinkle area ratio on replica analysis of the corners of the eyes and cheeks, compared with those at study initiation. With this improvement, the losses of <b>skin</b> surface <b>moisture</b> and transepidermal water were also significantly improved. Conclusion: I...|$|R

5000|$|A medical {{use for a}} sauna suit is in the {{treatment}} of psoriasis, an inflammation of the skin causing itchiness and discomfort. The symptoms of psoriasis can be relieved by use of ointments and by keeping the skin moist.

50|$|As a basic {{component}} of skin, Hyaluronic Acid (HA) can lock the moisture {{of the skin}} and maintain its elasticity, but HA can hydrolyzed very quickly by hyaluronidase (HAase） of skin. Gamma PGA can increase and maintain the content of HA. Especially, gamma PGA (LM) can effectively inhibit the HAase in skin. The HA content is remarkably increased for the higher concentration of gamma PGA (LM). It shows that gamma PGA (LM) and HA can improve <b>skin</b> <b>moisture,</b> elasticity and skin appearance in a synergistic manner.|$|E

40|$|Sericin is {{the second}} main {{component}} in cocoons, which are removed in the silk reeling process of the raw silk industry and in the silk waste degumming of the spun silk industry. The main amino acid of sericin, serine, exhibits a <b>skin</b> <b>moisturing</b> and antiwrinkle action, which is interesting to use for film formation in this study. The extraction conditions of sericin from two silk wastes, pieced cocoon and inferior knubbs were studied to find the optimum extraction conditions. Boiling water extraction was considered based on the response surface methodology (RSM) {{in order to identify}} the important factors for the sericin extraction. The two factors considered were time and temperature. Both factors were needed to be independent parameters in the predicted equation in order to improve the model fit with R 2 = 0. 84. The components ofextracted sericin were 18. 24 % serine, 9. 83 % aspatate, and 5. 51 % glycine with a molecular weight of 132 kDa. Film formationfrom extracted sericin was carried out to find the optimum conditions. Extracted sericin could not form a stand-alonefilm. Therefore, polysaccharide polymers, such as glucomannan, were incorporated with glycerol to form a flexible film. Sericin-based films were characterized for its properties in terms of solubility and permeability before application. It wasfound that sericin-based films showed a film flexibility and solubility without an increasing film water vapor permeability...|$|R

40|$|Various {{assessment}} characteristics {{have been}} used to evaluate the physiological condition of the skin, including <b>skin</b> <b>moisture,</b> elasticity, oil, and color. This often requires specific pieces of equipment such as a microscope. Although everyday evaluations may be needed to maintain skin condition, a particular piece of equipment may not be suitable for daily use. In this paper, it was proposed that a method to estimate <b>skin</b> <b>moisture</b> and elasticity from a facial image shot by a typical camera. The facial image’s RGB, HSV, and YCrCb components were extracted as the explanatory variables for kernel ridge regression (KRR). In general processing, one color space is often adopted for a single purpose. In this research, some of the color components of various color spaces were selectively combined as explanatory variables for KRR. To select suitable explanatory variables, the sequential feature selection (SFS) method was applied. As a result, the correlation coefficient between the estimated and measured <b>skin</b> <b>moisture</b> values was 0. 35. These results showed that <b>skin</b> <b>moisture</b> estimation using the facial image was insufficient.

Aim of the research was to study the effect of the recommended differentiated therapy on the pathogenetic disorders in patients with acne and concomitant Candida infection. Methods and results. 120 patients with acne were examined. In 100 of them concomitant skin malasseziosis was set in the form of pityriasis rosea, kerosis, comedones, folliculitis, seborrhea, multicolored zoster, with some features, as well as candidiasis. Methods of the research – bacterioscopic, bacteriological, study of <b>skin</b> oiliness and <b>moisture,</b> <b>skin</b> pH, the level of Ca ++, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. In patients with acne significant shifts in the composition of water-lipid mantle, increased oiliness and decreased <b>moisture</b> of <b>skin,</b> pH changes with a shift to the alkaline side were revealed, the most pronounced – in acne patients with Candida infection. The content of Ca ++ in the organism, as well as parathyroid hormone and calcitonin was increased and also the most indicative it was in patients with acne and concomitant Candida infection. After the comparative analysis on the basis of different levels of clinical and laboratory violations two clinical-therapeutic groups were distinguished, in accordance with that the differentiated therapy offered by us was conducted. Increased oiliness and Рh of <b>skin,</b> decline of <b>moisture</b> before the treatment, especially in patients with III and IV stages of acne, complicated by Candida infection, were normalized after treatment, unlike in patients treated traditionally.
