25|$|The {{middle and}} upper classes live in Suburbs, or in {{the central part of}} the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like {{miniature}} fortresses, located behind walls embedded <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>spikes,</b> barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.|$|R
50|$|The last Pink Triangle {{turntable}} produced was the Tarantella.

50|$|The first {{ice skates}} {{were made from}} leg bones of horse, ox or deer, and were {{attached}} to feet with leather straps. These skates required a pole <b>with</b> a sharp <b>metal</b> <b>spike</b> that was used for pushing the skater forward, unlike modern bladed skates.|$|R
50|$|A peavey or peavey hook is a logging tool {{consisting}} of a handle, generally from 30 to 50 in long, <b>with</b> a <b>metal</b> <b>spike</b> protruding from the end. The spike is rammed into a log, then a hook (at {{the end of an}} arm attached to a pivot a short distance up the handle) grabs the log at a second location. Once engaged, the handle gives the operator leverage to roll or slide or float the log to a new position.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the tower, {{complete}} with battlements, turret, secret shafts, false doors and wells incorporates {{a great deal of}} architectural deception. Access to the top is only by means of a narrow twisty staircase barred by a heavy wooden door studded <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>spikes</b> to exhaust the enemy and impede their progress {{to the top of the}} tower. Those who did manage to run the gauntlet of hurdles risked being burnt by boiling oil or water that was poured through shafts which opened directly above each set of doors. Date syrup, a liquid that oozed from bags of dates stored in special date cellars, also came in handy as an alternative to oil and water. The fort was built above a subterranean stream that ensured a permanent supply of water when subjected to a prolonged siege. Several cisterns located within the fortified compound also ensured plentiful supplies. Underground cellars stockpiled food and munitions. Running all round the summit of the tower is a wall for use by 120 guards who kept watch over the surrounding countryside and were armed with muskets and flintlocks. Furthermore, 480 gun-ports allowed for a concentrated barrage of fire if the fort came under attack.|$|R

25|$|Athletic {{shoes are}} {{specifically}} designed to be worn for participating in various sports. Since friction between the foot and the ground is an important force in most sports, modern athletic shoes are designed to maximize this force, and materials, such as rubber, are used. Although, for some activities such as dancing or bowling, sliding is desirable, so shoes designed for these activities often have lower coefficients of friction. The earliest athletic shoes {{date back to the}} mid 19th century were track spikes— leather shoes <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> cleats on the soles to provide increased friction during running. They were developed by J.W. Foster & Sons, which later become known as Reebok. By the end of the 19th century, Spalding also manufactured these shoes as well. Adidas started selling shoes with track spikes in them for running and soccer in 1925. Spikes were eventually added to shoes for baseball and American football in the 20th century. Golfers also use shoes <b>with</b> small <b>metal</b> <b>spikes</b> on their soles to prevent slipping during their swing.|$|R
50|$|Two {{impressive}} {{examples of}} the military type are housed in the museums of Vienna, both from the sixteenth century. The first measures 2.35 m in length including the top spike which is 54 cm. The head is a separate wooden cylinder slipped {{over the top of}} the shaft and reinforced with steel bands, <b>with</b> five <b>metal</b> <b>spikes</b> in symmetrical arrangement. The second example has an all-steel head of complex craftsmanship with four V-shaped spikes mounted on a long shaft that measures slightly less than two metres in length. A twisted and braided steel bar joins the socket to the base of the top spike. There are also 183 surviving specimens in Graz, made in series and delivered to the arsenal in 1685. They are comparable in length to the previous examples and have three rows of spikes around the head. The wooden shafts of most morning stars of the military type are reinforced <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> langets extending down from the head. Still others can be found in the Swiss arsenals of Lucerne and Zurich.|$|R

Subsequently, it was decided to reassemble the pieces in front of the entrance to the Palmyra Museum. The task was undertaken by restorer Józef Gazy. In 2005, the statue underwent restoration to eliminate problems from assemblage. Ultimately, the statue was restored in imitation of its original intended appearance - a relief jumping out from a wall. During the Syrian Civil War the statue was <b>shielded</b> <b>with</b> a <b>metal</b> plate and sandbags to protect it from fighting.|$|R

5000|$|The railway {{was built}} to remove a [...] "bottleneck" [...] to Staffordshire potteries by {{building}} a line from Norden to Middlebere Tramway which was opened in 1806 to a [...] gauge for 3.4 miles long. The rails were cast iron, L-shaped 3 ft long and weighing 40 lb, the horse-drawn clay wagons had flangeless wheels, and the sleepers were simply stone blocks (60-70 lb) numbering well in excess of 10,000. (some of the sleepers remain in place today, complete with holes where the rails used to be fixed. Others {{have been used as}} paving stones at Langton Wallis Cottage.) The cast iron rails secured to stone blocks (<b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>spike</b> and oak dowel) set in the ground. In 1807 the line was extended south under the Wareham to Corfe road. The tunnel exists and is grade listed however it is blocked, [...] a second tunnel was built in 1825 east of the first tunnel but is now blocked and is not grade listed. In 1881 when the LSWR built the Swanage line the line was extended east parallel to the line and Eldons Sidings were built to transfer clay to the standard gauge network. In 1907 Middlebere plateway was abandoned but had been in continual use for 101 years, The quay at Middlebere creek has fallen into disrepair and almost vanished. Some of the stone sleepers remain in place today, complete with holes where the rails used to be fixed, whilst others have been reused as paving stones at various locations.

40|$|With this work, we {{introduce}} numeric three-dimensional {{simulation of}} <b>metal</b> <b>spiking</b> into highly boron-doped surfaces of n-type silicon solar cells, which is moreover performed with a simulation of the quasi-steady-state photoconductance technique. This setup {{serves as a}} virtual experiment to simulate the dark saturation current density j 0,met of metallized boron-doped emitters <b>with</b> respect to <b>metal</b> <b>spikes</b> originating from the silver–aluminum (Ag–Al) contact. With the results obtained from this simulation model we approach {{quality and quantity of}} increased j 0,met and give detailed insight to which degree a solar cell’s performance is possibly harmed by this effect. We show that <b>metal</b> <b>spikes</b> penetrating into boron-doped emitters are of harmless nature concerning j 0,met until their tips reach depths where boron doping concentration is lower than approximately 1018 cm− 3. Deeper spikes then lead to an exponential increase in j 0,met as more and more carriers from emitter and also the base are able to diffuse to its tip and recombine there. With the help of j 0 -results obtained experimentally in combination with the simulation results, we discuss the influence of spikes on emitter recombination, the benefits that can be achieved with deeper emitter doping profiles, and suggestions for the further development of pastes to contact boron-doped surfaces...|$|R
