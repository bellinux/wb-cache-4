An experiment involving 321 Canadian consumers indicates that consumers perceive better product quality and a more credible environmental information when there are both elaborated <b>self-declared</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and <b>environmental</b> labeling cues on product packaging. Surprisingly, we also found that, when there are less <b>self-declared</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and no <b>environmental</b> labeling cues, consumers perceive that the information is also relatively credible and {{is the product of}} better quality...|$|R

This research studies the outcomes of voluntary environmental labelling in autarky and upon trade integration {{in the presence of}} two types of heterogeneity, across countries and across producers. It investigates the impact of the two main types of eco-labels - multiple-criteria-based programmes (ISO Type I) and <b>self-declared</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> (ISO Type II), both of which are simultaneously introduced due to the environmental concerns of consumers. The model illustrates the polarisation of eco-labels when the least productive firms tend to avoid green strategies, lower-middle productive and the most efficient firms are incentivized to greenwash, and the upper-middle productive firms choose trustful programmes. It also shows that voluntary green restrictions lead to substantial productivity effects in the market upon opening to international trade, conditionally, {{depending on the type of}} the labelling and the relative degree of environmental awareness across trading countries.

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} how <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> type affects the communication effectiveness of <b>environmental</b> advertising <b>claims</b> among Chinese consumers, and how two individual difference variables—country disposition and ecocentric orientation—moderate the claim type-effectiveness relationship. The present findings reveal that <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> type, country disposition, and ecocentric orientation all exert significant influences on communication effectiveness. Specifically, it is shown that substantive <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> generate greater communication effectiveness than associative <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> for both high-involvement and low-involvement purchases. For {{both types of}} purchases, <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> also generate more positive responses from consumers exhibiting a strong ecocentric orientation than from those exhibiting a weak ecocentric orientation. In addition, when compared with those holding a negative country disposition toward the source country, consumers holding a positive country disposition express more favorable responses toward <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> in high-involvement purchases. Finally, the present study also reveals that country disposition and ecocentric orientation jointly exert significant moderating effects on the claim type-effectiveness relationship in high-involvement purchases. These results remind marketers {{of the importance of}} adopting a situational perspective by taking country disposition and ecocentric orientation into account when determining which types of <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> should be employed to appeal to their targeted Chinese consumers.

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how {{different}} types of <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> may affect the communication effectiveness of environmental advertising. Two two moderating variables include the perceived eco‐friendly image of the originating country and consumer involvement. Design/methodology/approach– The examination involves the analysis of the responses of 1, 200 subjects in Shanghai, China, to mock advertisements containing <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> using a 2 x 3 factorial design. Findings– <b>Environmental</b> <b>claims</b> enhance the communication effectiveness of advertisements for both high‐ and low‐involvement services. For high‐involvement services, substantive <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> generate more favorable attitudinal responses than do associative <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> Research limitations/implications– This research focused on a single Chinese city and on two service categories with contrasting degrees of involvement. While such a confinement can enhance the internal validity of the findings, their external validity has yet to be established. Practical implications– These findings suggest that marketers should adopt a situational perspective by taking into account <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> type, country disposition, the degree of environmental consciousness of their target consumers, and service type when designing their environmental advertising campaigns. Originality/value– Although a number of previous studies have focused on the application of <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> to advertise products, similar investigation into how these claims may help advertise services is virtually non‐existent. In this respect, the present study can be viewed as the first empirical work devoted to closing this research gap. Department of Management and Marketin...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> type {{may affect the}} communication effectiveness of environmental advertising, and how the source country's green image may moderate the claim type-effectiveness relationship.

This study also demonstrates that these two factors in combination exhibit a significant interaction effect on the effectiveness. These empirical findings remind marketers of the importance of adopting a situational perspective when designing their <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> When deciding which <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> type they should apply, marketers should, among others, also take into consideration how their target customers actually perceive the eco-friendliness of the relevant source country.

Summary and conclusion - the operation, province and limits of tort liability and the way forwardThe role of civil liability including tort law in addressing <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> in India had until recently been minimal. Tort law remedies with its limited scope had not been pursued or seriously considered for <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> until the Bhopal gas disaster in 1984 - 85. It is only after 1995 that tort law remedies have been explored to overcome inadequacies of the existing environmental liability regime based predominantly on public law liability tools in India.. Notwithstanding the difficulties in the use of tort law for addressing <b>environmental</b> <b>claims,</b> in recent years the Supreme Court, and most recently, the Parliament, have categorically re-engaged with tort law to utilise its functions and remedies to address <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> Although the Supreme Court of India has used the public law liability tools to address most <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> by recognising a constitutional environmental right, reiterating a constitutional duty and statutory liability it has simultaneously recognized an environmental constitutional tort within the same case. As research indicates, tort law remedies and functions have been increasingly adopted by the Supreme Court to vindicate <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> by allowing for compensatory and reparative award of damages. In addition, the National Green Tribunal Act 2010 [NGTA] recognizes civil liability for environmental damage arising from the violation of the seven specific laws enumerated under Act. It allows the victims to seek compensation for personal injury and damage to property arising from violation of the person’s environmental right and/or regulatory laws listed under the Act. This new liability regime for <b>environmental</b> <b>claims,</b> therefore, includes features of public law liability and private law liability for vindication of <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> The mixed liability approach adopted by the Supreme Court as discussed above indicates a reengagement with tort law. In this context, the question that this thesis addresses is the extent and ambit of civil liability and tort law to address <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and interests in India. The thesis proceeds to examine the role, function and nature of tort law within environmental context. It emphasises the inadequacies and gaps within the existing legal liability instruments and processes and highlights the potential advantages, limitations and connections that tort has in dealing with certain <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> It establishes that the manner in which tort functions of compensation and deterrence have become amalgamated with the objectives of environmental law, the boundaries between public and private law have blurred. It is argued that within the current environmental jurisprudence, civil liability instruments including tort can play a positive role to supplement the public law liability tools used to address <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> in India.

Examples of court action relating to the use of consumer protection laws for <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> in several countries are described.

Moreover the report acknowledges that several attempts have been made towards harmonisation across countries concerning environmental criteria, mainly concerning eco-labelling schemes and organic agriculture standards. There appear to be strong incentives for this type of cross-country certification, including reduced administrative costs and a potential for increased trade of environmentally-certified goods.

40|$|Environmental {{marketing}} {{issues have}} {{captured the attention of}} consumers, manufacturers, government regulators, package designers, and marketers. Many industries have rushed to bring to consumers' attention the environmental benefits of their products and packaging. As a result, consumers have been exposed to a variety of unfamiliar and often ambiguous terms. <b>Environmental</b> <b>claims</b> such as biodegradable, compostable, and environmentally safe are becoming relatively common in the marketplace, but are unfamiliar to most consumers. At best, many of these claims have no clear meaning and are subject to interpretation; at worst, they are deceptive or misleading. In an attempt {{to level the playing field}} for both marketers and consumers, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC, 1992) issued environmental marketing guidelines in 1992. This article will describe the FTC Guidelines and a research project designed to assess their impact on <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> found on selected packaged goods sold in supermarkets. Implications for educators will also be identified. Previous Research <b>Environmental</b> <b>claims</b> present several challenges to marketers and consumers. Marketers must decide whether an <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> will be as relevant to consumers as claims about a product's other attributes, such as value or nutrition. Since consumers continue to be skeptical about <b>environmental</b> <b>claims,</b> marketers must assess whether their claim will be credible. Another challenge for marketers is to craft a claim that will not draw the ire of various local, state, and federal regulators and environmental groups. Consumers also face challenges. <b>Environmental</b> <b>claims</b> often relate to product characteristics with which a consumer has little experience or knowledge.

The Gulf War of 1990 – 91, {{precipitated by}} Iraq’s invasion and occupation of Kuwait, resulted in massive environmental damage to neighbouring countries. After the Gulf War, the UN Security Council established the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) to process claims for war reparations, including <b>claims</b> for <b>environmental</b> damage. The <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> were unprecedented. This thesis explores (a) whether key actors influenced the rules and <b>environmental</b> <b>claims,</b> and if so, what means they used to achieve their goals, (b) how key actors used these means to influence the rules and <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and (c) {{the extent to which}} the <b>environmental</b> rule and <b>claims</b> might have been different if the UNCC had adopted more transparent, inclusive and accountable processes. The thesis argues that <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> and rules are as much the product of human interactions as they are of legal principles. Key actors influenced the UNCC rules and <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> by advocating for or against four principles. The principles they advocated or opposed were effective and expeditious justice for the victims of war, due process for Iraq, secrecy and transparency. They did so through the predominant mechanism or tool of modelling which they deployed through webs of dialogue and coercion. Key actors sometimes displaced political conflict on to procedural terrain. The thesis asserts that the UNCC was a transitional institution somewhere between a tribunal administering victor’s justice and an independent and impartial international judicial body.

In this study, we replicate a choice experiment by Remaud et al. (2008) in order to assess the extent to which Australian wine consumers’ preferences for organic and environmentally friendly claims have changed between 2007 and 2009. The replication of the same experiment also allows us to test the stability of latent preference segments over time. Between 2007 and 2009 we found Australian wine consumers generally increased their attention to region of origin and became less price sensitive when purchasing wine for a special occasion. This finding is also supported by AC Nielsen scanner data. While the <b>environmental</b> <b>claim</b> has the same importance (5 %) for choice over all consumers, its influence strongly increased for one environmental sensitive segment. Surprisingly, we can also identify a segment where consumers seem to be ‘eco-allergic’, with a considerable negative utility from <b>environmental</b> <b>claims.</b> The replication of the choice experiment drawing a sample from the same wine consumer population, generated a remarkable stable market segmentation that is derived from differences in consumer choices. The robustness of this choice segmentation is an indication of stable underlying preference segments that can be uncovered with scale extended latent class choice models. ...|$|R

"The ACCC has produced Green marketing and the Trade Practices Act in response to the increasing use of green claims in advertising by businesses seeking to differentiate themselves and their products from their competition by means of environmental claims," ACCC Chairman, Mr Graeme Samuel, said. "Businesses are aware that consumers are concerned about the environmental impact of the goods they purchase, and therefore look to promote the environmental benefits of their products. However, 2 ̆ 7 green 2 ̆ 7 and other <b>environmental</b> <b>claims</b> are often based on complex scientific principles, making it difficult for consumers to assess their accuracy or to compare one claim against another. " Green claims are now made about a larger product range than ever before, from small household items to major whitegoods and appliances. Environmental concerns, such as water or energy efficiency, are a major factor many consumers consider when evaluating products to purchase. It is essential that consumers have accurate information on which to base their decisions. Mr Samuel said the publication aims to educate businesses about their obligations under the Trade Practices Act 1974 and to assist manufacturers, suppliers, advertisers and others to assess the strength of any green claims they make. This will help to improve the accuracy and usefulness to consumers of their labelling, packaging and advertising. The release of Green marketing and the Trade Practices Act follows recent ACCC action over potentially misleading <b>environmental</b> marketing <b>claims</b> in the energy industry.
