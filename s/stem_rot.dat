50|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>rot</b> is {{a disease}} caused by a fungus {{infection}} in the stem. Fungus that causes <b>stem</b> <b>rot</b> are Rhizoctonia, Fusarium and Pythium. <b>Stem</b> <b>rot</b> can readily infect crops that are in their vegetative or flowering stages. The disease can survive {{up to five years}} in the soil. Symptoms of <b>stem</b> <b>rot</b> includes staining of infected area, reduced crop yield and crop failure. The disease can be spread through the use of unfiltered water as well as unsterilized tools. Also leaving previous dead roots in soil can increase the risk of <b>stem</b> <b>rot.</b> Spores can also enter the plant through injured stem tissue on the plant including from insect attacks. The fungus impedes stem functions like transporting nutrients. It can cause water to leak through the lesions of stem tissue. Common infected crop plants are soybeans and potatoes. An issue with maintaining this disease is the lack of management by crop producers. Producers of soybeans tend to not manage for the disease because it is not normally yield limiting in a large area. Fungicides can be used to manage the disease as well as burning the crop after harvest or letting it decompose.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{potential}} reasons for the current prevalence of the fusarium wilt in the oriental melon. Twenty-seven Fusarium isolates obtained from oriental melon greenhouses in 2010 – 2011 were identified morphologically and by analysis of elongation factor- 1 alpha gene (EF- 1 α) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences as 6 Fusarium species (8 isolates of F. oxysporum, 8 F. commune, 5 F. proliferatum, 3 F. equiseti, 2 F. delphinoides, and 1 F. andiyazi), which were classified as same into 6 EF- 1 α sequence-based phylogenetic clades. Pathogenicity of the Fusarium isolates on the oriental melon was highest in F. proliferatum, next in F. oxysporum and F. andiyazi, and lowest in the other Fusarium species tested, suggesting F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum were major pathogens of the oriental melon, inducing <b>stem</b> <b>rots</b> and vascular wilts, respectively. Oriental melon and watermelon were more susceptible to F. oxysporum than shintosa and cucumber; and cucumber was most, oriental melon and watermelon, medially, and shintosa was least susceptible to F. proliferatum, whose virulence varied among and within their phylogenetic subclades. Severe root-knot galls were formed on all the crops infected with Meloidogyne incognita; however, little indication of vascular wilts or <b>stem</b> and/or root <b>rots</b> was shown by the nematode infection. These results suggest the current fungal disease in the oriental melon may be rarely due to virulence changes of the fusarium wilt pathogen and the direct cause of the severe root-knot nematode infection, but may be potentially from other Fusarium pathogen infection that produces seemingly wilting caused by severe <b>stem</b> <b>rotting...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{shelf-life}} of mangoes {{is limited}} by two main postharvest diseases when not consistently managed. These are anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) and <b>stem</b> end <b>rots</b> (Neofusicoccum parvum). The management of these diseases has often relied mainly {{on the use of}} fungicide applications either as field spray treatments and/or postharvest dips. Current postharvest dips are under continuous threats because of health concerns and the maximum residue levels allowed on treated fruit continuous to be reviewed and re-assessed. Research needs {{to keep up with the}} rate at which changes are occurring following some of these reviews. The recent withdrawal of carbendazin (Spinflo), as a postharvest dip being used to manage <b>stem</b> end <b>rots</b> necessitated the urgent search for a replacement fungicide to manage this disease. A study was therefore undertaken to compare the efficacy of current and potential products that could be used to fill the gap. The following products were evaluated: Carbendazin (Spinflo), Prochloraz (Sportak), Thiobendazole (TBZ) and Fludioxonil (Scholar). These products were tested both under ambient temperatures and as hot dips to identify one that was most effective. Scholar as a hot dip was the most effective product among the ones compared. It effectively controlled both anthracnose and <b>stem</b> end <b>rots</b> at highly significant levels when compared to the untreated control and even Spinflo which is being replaced. As a cold dip, it had some limited effect on anthracnose but had virtually no effect on <b>stem</b> end <b>rots.</b> Based on its performance in these experiments, the product has been recommended for rates and residue studies so that it can be registered as a hot dip for use in controlling postharvest diseases of mangoes...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the status of}} spruce stands in the Kysuce and Orava region was performed and their health condition was compared to the spruce forest constitution in the rest of Slovakia. For this purpose, the inventory plots established within the first circle of National Forest Inventory (NFI) in 2005 and 2006 were used. The Kysuce and Orava regions significantly differ from the rest of Slovak forests by its high proportion of spruce. The health status of the spruce stands in these regions, according to the salvage felling {{as a result of the}} damage caused prevailingly by <b>stem</b> <b>rotting</b> and bark beetles appears worse than in the rest of Slovakia. The analysis showed that not only the acute damage of spruce stands (insects) but also the chronic damage of trees (rotting, mechanical damage during logging) is more serious in these regions than in the rest of Slovakia. The browsing caused by deer game (data does not include young stands) in both regions as well as in the rest of Slovakia seems to be low and not so serious compared to the previously mentioned types of damage. Other sorts of damage (stem breakage, standing dead trees, or damage by insect) have also small proportion. More detailed analyses of NFI data with acceptable precision were possible only for most frequent kinds of damages such as <b>stem</b> <b>rotting</b> and damage by logging. The results showed the frequency of rotting tended to be higher with increasing stand age. Influence of altitude on the frequency of the damage was not evident.
