40|$|In {{depressed}} patients, antidepressant resistance {{has been}} associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The scope {{of this study was to}} try to create HPA-related antidepressant resistance in mice and to investigate adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a putative mechanism of antidepressant resistance. Mice were subjected to a 9 week Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress (UCMS). After a 2 weeks drug-free period, mice were segregated in two groups, according to the percentage of corticosterone suppression after dexamethasone injection: High suppression (HS) and Low suppression (LS) mice. From the 5 thweek onwards, fluoxetine at a dose of 15 mg/kg (i. p.) was administered daily and at the end of 8 th week, a battery of behavioral tests assessing the emotional, cognitive, and motor aspects of UCMS-induced depressive-like behavior was applied. Results show that fluoxetine-induced antidepressant effects were observed with higher amplitude in HS when compared to LS on various behavioral phenotypes, like coat state, novelty suppression of <b>feeding,</b> <b>splash</b> test and nest test. The same profile was found concerning the immunohistochimical analysis of ki- 67 positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, which is a marker of neuronal proliferation, but not for doublecortin labelling. This suggests that the failure of fluoxetine to induce antidepressant effects may be associated to the poor ability of the compound to stimulate cell proliferation in the hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|Background: Depression {{and anxiety}} {{disorders}} {{have been linked}} to dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and structural changes within the hippocampus. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) can recapitulate these effects in a mouse model, and UCMS-induced changes, including downregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, can be reversed by antidepressant (AD) treatment. We investigated causality between changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and the effects of both chronic stress and chronic ADs. Methods: Mice were treated with either a sham procedure or focal hippocampal irradiation to disrupt cell proliferation before being confronted with 5 weeks of UCMS. From the third week onward, we administered monoaminergic ADs (imipramine, fluoxetine), the corticotropin-releasing factor 1 (CRF 1) antagonist SSR 125543, or the vasopressin 1 b (V 1 b) antagonist SSR 149415 daily. The effects of UCMS regimen, AD treatments, and irradiation were assessed by physical measures (coat state, weight), behavioral testing (<b>Splash</b> test, Novelty-Suppressed <b>feeding</b> test, locomotor activity), and hippocampal BrdU labeling. Results: Our results show that elimination of hippocampal neurogenesis has no effect on animals' sensitivity to UCMS in several behavioral assays, suggesting that reduced neurogenesis is not a cause of stress-related behavioral deficits. Second, we present evidence for both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms for the reversal of stress-induced behaviors by AD drugs. Specifically, loss of neurogenesis completely blocked the effects of monoaminergic ADs (imipramine, fluoxetine) but did not prevent most effects of the CRF 1 and the V 1 b antagonists. Conclusions: Hippocampal neurogenesis might thus be used by the monoaminergic ADs to counteract the effects of stress, whereas similar effects could be achieved by directly targeting the HPA axis and related neuropeptides. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of peripheral biomarkers {{in the treatment}} of major depressive disorders (MDD) could improve the efficiency of treatments and increase remission rate. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an attractive biological substrate allowing the identification of a drug response signature. Using a proteomic approach with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the present study aimed to identify a biosignature of antidepressant response (fluoxetine, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) in PBMCs in a mouse model of anxiety/depression. Following determination of an emotionality score, using complementary behavioral analysis of anxiety/depression across three different tests (Elevated Plus Maze, Novelty Suppressed <b>Feeding,</b> <b>Splash</b> Test), we showed that a 4 -week corticosterone treatment (35 μg/ml, CORT model) in C 57 BL/ 6 NTac male mice induced an anxiety/depressive-like behavior. Then, chronic fluoxetine treatment (18 mg/kg/day for 28 days in the drinking water) reduced corticosterone-induced increase in emotional behavior. However, among 46 fluoxetine-treated mice, only 30 of them presented a 50 % decrease in emotionality score, defining fluoxetine responders (CORT/Flx-R). To determine a peripheral biological signature of fluoxetine response, proteomic analysis was performed from PBMCs isolated from the “most” affected corticosterone/vehicle (CORT/V), corticosterone/fluoxetine responders and non-responders (CORT/Flx-NR) animals. In comparison to CORT/V, a total of 263 proteins were differently expressed after fluoxetine exposure. Expression profile of these proteins showed a strong similarity between CORT/Flx-R and CORT/Flx-NR (R = 0. 827, p < 1 e- 7). Direct comparison of CORT/Flx-R and CORT/Flx-NR groups revealed 100 differently expressed proteins, representing a combination of markers associated either with the maintenance of animals in a refractory state, or associated with behavioral improvement. Finally, 19 proteins showed a differential direction of expression between CORT/Flx-R and CORT/Flx-NR that drove them away from the CORT-treated profile. Among them, eight upregulated proteins (RPN 2, HSPA 9, NPTN, AP 2 B 1, UQCRC 2, RACK- 1, TOLLIP) and one downregulated protein, TLN 2, were previously associated with MDD or antidepressant drug response in the literature. Future preclinical studies will be required to validate whether proteomic changes observed in PBMCs from CORT/Flx-R mice mirror biological changes in brain tissues...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Ford {{automobile}} lubrication instructions, Southern California, 1930. "Lubricating the Transmission, About {{once every}} five thousand miles the gear lubricant should be drained from the transmission {{by removing the}} drain plug {{at the bottom of}} transmission case. The interior of the trans-mission case should then be thoroughlt flished with kerosene and refilled with fresh gear lubricant. The new lubricant is poured into the transmission through the filler hole, located at the right hand side of the transmission tcase. Pour sufficient lubricant in unti lit reaches the level of the filler hole.; Lubricating the Differential, Every 5000 miles the lubricant in the differential should be drained and the housing flushed with kerosene. New lubricant should then be added until it reaches the level of the oil filler hole in the housing. In the truck the lubricant in the differential must be kept up {{to the level of the}} filler plug oppening at all times.; Engine Lubrication, All parts of the engine are lubricated from the oil reservoir in the oil pan by the Ford Pump, <b>Splash</b> and Gravity <b>Feed.</b> Only high grade engine oil should be used in the engine. Oil of this kind reaches the bearing surfaces with greater east and cuts down frictional heat. It should have sufficient body so that the pressure between the two bearing surfaces will not force out the oil and allow the metal to come in actual contact. Inferior oils have a tendency to carbonize quickly, also "gu m up" the piston rings, valve stems and bearings. In cold weather a light grade of oil having a low cold test is absolutely essential for the proper lubrication of the car. In general an oil having the body S. A. E. viscosity No. 40 will prove satisfactory for summer use. While for winter use oil having specifica-tions of S. A. E. No. 20 should be used. It is essential, however, that this winter oil have a low cold test.; Draining the Oil Pan, It is advisable to clean out the oil pan by draining off the old oil when the new car has been driven five hundred miles, and thereafter to repeat this operation every 500 miles. The oil should be warm before draining.; Lubricating Shock Absorber Connections, The ball joints are made in unit with the instrument arm and spring perches. They are hardened and ground. The ball joint seats are enclosed in the shock absorber connecting links, which should be lubricated every 500 miles with the compressor gun. In order to secure maximum riding comfort, it is important that the spring hangers be free in the bushings and kept well greased. " [...] on instructions...|$|R
