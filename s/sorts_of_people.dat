25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined {{as it was to}} the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the Ind√©pendants, during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born {{in the same way as}} the word 'Impressionism' in 1872.|$|E

500|$|In 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records. In {{addition}} to eventually releasing his own albums on the label, he initially used {{the company as}} an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse {{to serve as a}} creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Harrison explained: [...] "Most of the stuff will be what I produce". Eric Idle commented: [...] "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that you'll never, ever hear of." [...] The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, [...] "Costafine Town". Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.|$|E

The gunshots and struggle could be heard and seen from the street, and within minutes Frick's office had attracted all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> but Berkman continued to resist. A deputy sheriff aimed his gun at Berkman, but Frick said, [...] "Don't shoot. Leave him to the law." [...] As the police led Berkman to the jail, an angry crowd gathered and shouted at Berkman. When he was questioned by police, Berkman said he had arrived in Pittsburgh on July21 and that he had acted alone. A dynamite capsule was discovered in his mouth after a policeman noticed that he was chewing on something.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Mick Avory {{has offered}} an {{alternate}} {{explanation for the}} song's lyrics, claiming that [...] "Lola" [...] was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of trans bars in west London. Avory said, [...] "We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a bit, because being called The Kinks did attract these <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> He used {{to come down to}} Top of the Pops, and he was publicist for John Stephen's shop in Carnaby Street. He used to have this place in Earl's Court, and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs. They were like secret clubs. And that's where Ray [...] got the idea for 'Lola'. When he was invited too, he wrote it while I was getting drunk".|$|E

While the song played, the lead subject, an assault survivor, reminisced about the impact of rape while walking around a college campus. Ziering concluded that having Gaga sing the track fulfilled their need for publicity since she [...] " [...] a whole other demographic. Anyone who has that kind of platform to reach all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that maybe would not necessarily be inclined to be interested in your issue... it's incredible." [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] leaked onto the Internet before it was officially released, through an unofficial recording made at the film's premiere at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In April 2015, Warren confirmed that the song would have an official release and was waiting for a final audio mixing by Gaga. It was later released as a digital download single on September 18, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{science fiction}} fans felt {{compelled}} to condemn the Shaver Mystery as [...] "the Shaver Hoax". These fans, already distressed by Palmer's shift away from the literary or hard science fiction of earlier years to often slapdash space opera, organized letter-writing campaigns {{to try to persuade}} the publishers of Amazing Stories to cease all Shaver Mystery articles. In fact, Palmer printed a number of critical or skeptical letters sent to Amazing Stories, and he and other contributors occasionally rebutted or replied to such letters in print. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, [...] "he young Harlan Ellison, later a famously abrasive writer, allegedly badgered [...] into admitting that the Shaver Mystery was a 'publicity grabber'; when the story came out, Palmer angrily responded that this was hardly the same thing as calling it a hoax". Dash writes that the [...] "critics of the 'Shaver Mystery' were {{quick to point out that}} its author was suffering from several of the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, and that many of the letters pouring into Amazing recounting personal experiences that backed up the author's stories patently came from the <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who would otherwise spend their time claiming that they were being persecuted by invisible voices or their neighbor's dog".|$|E
