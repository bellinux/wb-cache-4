25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber</b> as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber</b> can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E

50|$|The Imhoff tank, {{named for}} German {{engineer}} Karl Imhoff (1876-1965), is a chamber {{suitable for the}} reception and processing of sewage. It {{may be used for}} the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the extracted sludge. It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which collected solids slide down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in which the sludge is collected and digested. The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with sewage flowing only through the upper <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber</b> and no flow of sewage in the lower digestion chamber. The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of digested sludge, typically after 6-9 months of digestion. The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank's simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber.|$|E
40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{describes}} modular systems for treating storm water. One {{of the primary}} modular storm water treatment systems currently on the market is the StormTreat TM System, or STS. The STS, which was developed in 1994, is a storm water treatment technology consisting {{of a series of}} <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chambers</b> and constructed wetlands. These wetlands are contained within a modular, 2. 9 meter (9. 5 feet) diameter recycled-polyethylene tank. The STS can be applied in many different scenarios, ranging from residential areas to most industrial parks, but should not be used in extremely polluted areas, such as directly in wastewater streams. Figure 1 is a diagram of the STS. The STS works as follows: influent is piped into the unit’s <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chambers,</b> where pollutants are removed through sedimentation and filtration. Storm water is then conveyed from the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chambers</b> to a surrounding constructed wetland. Unlike most constructed wetlands systems, STS conveys the storm water directly into the subsurface of the wetland and through the root zone. Pollutants are then removed through filtration, adsorption, and biochemical reactions. These processes occur at higher rates within the root zone, making STS more efficient in pollutant removal. Storm water is retained in the wetlands for five to ten days prior to discharge.

40|$|Blooms of {{the toxic}} dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (Lebour) Balech, a known {{producer}} of potent neurotoxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), are common annual events along the Scottish east coast. The co-occurrence {{of a second}} Alexandrium species, A. ostenfeldii (Paulsen) Balech & Tangen is reported in this study from waters of the Scottish east coast. The latter species has been suspected to be an alternative source of PSP toxins in northern Europe. Recent identification of toxic macrocyclic imines known as spirolides in A. ostenfeldii indicates a potential new challenge for monitoring toxic Alexandrium species and their respective toxins in natural populations.

The filters were deposited in <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chambers</b> for 24  h. Abundance values and taxonomic identification were analyzed after sedimentation following the Utermöhl method (1958).

These vertical chlorophyll a profiles were recorded on an hourly basis from sunrise (5 a.m.) to sunset (9 p.m.). For calibration, the chlorophyll concentrations were determined photometrical in water samples from the corresponding water depths of the fluorometric profile, at least once a day. For this purpose, 20 to 50 l of water was pumped up from each depth. Parts of these samples were directly investigated for their phytoplankton composition performing life counts under the light microscope in Bogorov counting chambers to distinguish between the main groups and to identify the proportion of motile phytoplankton. More samples were fixed in Lugol solution for subsequent determination in <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chambers</b> using Utermöhl technique while others were fixed in glutaraldehyde to account for picoplankton under the epifluorescence microscope. The main part of the water samples was filtered to concentrate the phytoplankton onto GF 92 (GF/F) - filters (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). To extract the pigments from the filters, the residuals on the filter were kept in 5 ml N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma, Germany) for 12 h in darkness at 4 °C. Chlorophyll concentrations were calculated by the absorbance spectra of the extract at 647 and 663 nm, using the formula and extinction coefficients given in Porra et al. [48]. These chlorophyll concentration data served additionally to rule out potential variations of the data due to non-photochemical quenching in surface layers (see below).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the particle distribution of some selected metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a stormwater sedimentation facility, and to caiculate the emitted amounts of these contaminants in the studied catchment area. Chemical analysis and determination of physical parameters were performed on sediments sampled at a stormwater treatment facility consisting of seven <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chambers</b> connected in series. The facility is located in central Gothenburg, Sweden, and receives runoff from the E 6 and E 20 motorway, with a daily traffic bad of approximately 86 000 vehicies. The concentrations of the PAHs and metals showed a trend with sediment concentrations increasing from the first to the last chamber. The pollutant concentrations were weil correlated with the particle size distribution, dry densities, water and organic content of the sediments. in two or more of the chambers, the concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr and carcinogenic PAHs were higher than the given guideline vaiues for contaminated soil. The relative composition of the PAHs in sediment, with a dominance of pyrene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene and chrysene, indicates that rubber tyres, diesel exhaust and road asphalt could be important sources of PAH pollution. The calculated catchment area emission factors (CAEFs) showed, in Wyear ha, the following order: petroleum hydrocarbons Cio - C 4 o (15 000) > Zn (3200) > Ni (~ 3000) > Cu (1500) > Sb (930) > Cr (820) > V (640) > Pb (260) > Co (120) > As (87) > Sn (25) > Mo (43) > ~ 16 -EPA PAH (13) > Cresols (3. 4) > Cd (1. 3) > Hg (0. 43).

The understanding of the ecological mechanisms that influence the population dynamics of these bloom-forming species is fragmentary, partly due to the difficulty in the discrimination between Alexandrium species in mixed phytoplankton assemblages by conventional light microscopy. During 2 surveys carried out in the estuary in July and September 2005, taxon-specific large subunit rRNA targeted probes were used in a whole-cell fluorescent in situ hybridisation assay to facilitate the detection and quantification of Alexandrium spp. in seawater samples. The Alexandrium spp. concentrations derived with molecular probes were on average half those obtained using an Utermöhl <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber</b> and calcofluor. Results showed the dominance of A. tamarense over A. minutum in July and an almost exclusive presence of A. minutum in September.

These complex patterns were recorded by dynamical interferometric analysis using a Mach—Zehnder configuration. Tetragonal hen egg white lysozyme crystals were grown inside APCF (advanced protein crystallisation facility) reactors. Salt and protein diffusion profiles were obtained independently by performing duplicated experiments with and without protein in the protein chamber; salt gradients were observed directly while protein concentration profiles are computed from the differences in refractive index between the two experiments. As expected from computer simulations, the time evolution of supersaturation shows a maximum about 45 h after activation (although this value can change {{as a function of}} the starting conditions and the geometry of the reactor). Nucleation takes place before this maximum supersaturation is reached. This explains the trend of the growth rate versus time curves for experiments performed within APCF reactors (both on ground and in space) and in capillaries by the gel acupuncture technique.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{discharge}} of nutrient rich wastewater {{to the environment}} is a common source of pollution and it is {{partly responsible for the}} eutrophication of surface water, as well as degradation of the quality of groundwater. Constructed wetlands have proven to be an effective and affordable alternative to reduce BOD, suspended solids and even to reduce the concentration of nutrients from domestic wastewater, if the design, operation and establishment of the system meet certain conditions. Two of the most important nutrients are nitrogen and phosphorus. To remove nitrogen it is necessary that first nitrification and then denitrification occurred. The first process is aerobic and autotrophic bacteria carry it out whereas denitrification happens in anoxic conditions by heterotrophic bacteria. Phosphorus is removed basically by precipitation with aluminium, iron and calcium.

This organism has been implicated {{in a range of}} hypersensitivity pneumonitides, including farmer's lung, but is generally isolated in small numbers from contaminated environments. Recovery of S. viridis from moldy hay and mushroom compost on R 8 medium was compared with recovery on conventional media. S. viridis was isolated from both substrates but in highest numbers and most consistently on the R 8 medium. The selectivity of this medium was best observed when the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber</b> method was used for hay samples. Here S. viridis accounted for up to 80 % {{of the total number of}} actinomycetes recovered on R 8 and could not be recovered on rifampin selective medium under the same conditions. R 8 was also found to be an efficient recovery medium for a range of thermophilic actinomycetes from mushroom compost and for another allergenic species, Faenia rectivirgula, from moldy hay. Contamination of isolation plates by thermophilic bacilli was reduced on R 8 compared with the activity on half-strength tryptone soy agar, supplemented with 0. 2 % casein hydrolysate, and this, together with specific improvements in S. viridis growth, accounts for the selective effect. It is possible that the occurrence of S. viridis and its role as a causative agent of hypersensitivity pnuemonitis have been underestimated by the use of suboptimal recovery protocols. It is hoped that use of R 8 in conjunction with dilution plate techniques will generate information on the ecology of S. viridis and contribute to health risk assessment studies...|$|E
40|$|On a {{model of}} a {{circular}} secondary settling tank the dissertation deals with typical flow structures that establish at twelve different combinations of hydraulic and solids loading. Another variable parameter beside the already mentioned were also solid particles that served as suspended matter. The first group of used particles was fine ground hazelnut shell that was available in two different compositions of grain size; the second group were glass microbeads in three different granulations. Three control experiments were conducted at neutral density conditions by introducing a dye. All experiments were filmed with a digital camera. By processing video clips of experiments an indicator of concentration in the inflow and {{in the vicinity of the}} effluent was captured by photogrammetric approach and data on flow field was obtained by computer-aided flow visualization. A repetition of the first series was carried out in order to collect samples of inflow and outflow suspension. A wide set of experiments with carefully chosen parameters enabled a systematic study of hydrodynamic phenomena in the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber.</b> Flow field and clarification efficiency were found out to be closely related to the value of the densimetric Froude number Frd. All experiments exhibited trends of growing efficiency when values of the densimetric Froude number Frd were decreasing. A three-layer flow structure never occurred when the biggest particle granulation from glass microspheres and when coarse ground hazelnut shell was used. By the rest of the model particles a low value of Frd reflected in a formation of favourable three-layer flow structure, whereas the threshold value of Frd (when the value is exceeded, the three-layer flow does not develop) was independent from the type or size of the particles...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: The use {{of local}} {{ventilation}} system {{is one of}} methods to collect and control of air pollutants in the cramp unit of industrial poultry slaughterhouse and its subsequent is reduction {{of the effects of}} air pollutants on human health. The {{purpose of this study is}} to survey the effect of design and proper implementation of local ventilation system and the refiner on the control of dust in industrial slaughterhouse poultry. Materials and methods: This study was conducted in three steps; evaluation of particulate air pollutants before design, design and implementation of local ventilation system and evaluation of local ventilation system. Sampling of respiratory and inhalational particles was done with the use of nylon cyclone and PVC filter according to the NIOSH 0600 method. Then, local ventilation system was designed and implemented according to velocity pressure procedure of the Committee of Industrial Ventilation America. Finally, the efficiency of local ventilation system and the refiner used were evaluated. Results: The concentration of dust in a ventilation off system for respirable and inhalable particles, was obtained 13 / 07 and 1 / 18 mg/m 3, respectively. Previous inefficient efficiency to remove respirable and inhalable particles was about 14 and 18 percent, respectively, which design and implementation of local ventilation systems increased the efficiency to more than 83 and 92 percent. Also, the efficiency of used refiner has been 58 / 26 and 27 / 52 percent for respirable and inhalable particles. Conclusion: Findings of the study showed that design and proper implementation of local ventilation systems can have a great effect on reduction of particles in cramp unit. Also, use of the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber</b> refiner has relatively good efficiency for the control of respiratory particles...|$|E
40|$|A conceituação atual do sistema LCR é de uma entidade dinâmica, com papel ativo na homeostase do sistema nervoso central (SNC). Diversas afecções do sistema nervoso apresentam desde o início, ou a partir de determinado tempo de evolução, citologia do LCR quantitativamente normal. Foram estudadas 103 amostras de LCR de pacientes portadores de doença neurológica ou sistêmica mas com possível repercussão no sistema nervoso. Paralelamente, 30 amostras de LCR de pacientes com cefaléia crônica foram analisadas e consideradas como grupo controle. São analisados e discutidos os resultados de cada grupo, levando em conta os critérios de ativação celular bem como os vários tipos celulares observados. Foi verificado ocorrer sinalização do sistema celular que habitualmente integra a citomorfologia classe 1 em ambos os grupos. No grupo dos 103 pacientes do grupo 1, a essas células, aduziam-se aquelas próprias à classe II em 71 casos. The {{dynamics}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cellular system plays {{an active role}} in the homeostasis of the central nervous system, and it obbeys a cibernetic model. In order to verify the occurrence and the frequency of signalisation among the cellular population proper to the CSF, two series of cases were studied. In the first series patients with neurological disorders of several types were grouped (103 cases). The second series groups patients with chronic headache, the neurological examination being normal as well as the CSF examination (30 cases). In both groups the total cell count was normal. Cytomorphology was studied through optical microscopy of preparates obtained by accelerated gravitational <b>sedimentation</b> employing Suta's <b>chamber,</b> and stained by May Grünwald-Giemsa technique. Polinuclear neutrophils, macrophages, plasmocytes and eosinophil cells were found in 71 cases of the first group, among those proper to normal CSF population. The later was the only finding in the remaining 32 cases of the first group and in all cases of the second group. Lymphocytes and reticulomonocytes proper to the normal population were found both in activated and in non-activated stages. No significant differences beteewen the groups were found in this way. So, activation of the CSF lymphocyte-reticulomonocyte cellular system is a finding registered in cases whose CSF space is signalised by conditions proper to the pathologic process as well as in cases with no evidence of such a signalisation...|$|R
40|$|Paraty {{is a small}} touristic city on the South Eastern {{coast of}} Brazil plagued with public health {{problems}} inherently linked to its poor water and sanitation practices. This thesis centers {{on the design of}} an appropriate wastewater treatment facility for the City. The new and interesting use of seawater as a wastewater treatment tool and its effect on the disinfection potential of the treated effluent is also reviewed and tested in a series of jar tests and laboratory experiments Chemically Enhanced Primary Treatment (CEPT) is a wastewater treatment method that serves as an attractive alternative to conventional primary treatment and can also be used as an efficient preliminary step to biological secondary treatment processes. CEPT adopts coagulation and flocculation and accomplishes remarkable increases in the removals of common pollutants and contaminants from the influent. CEPT was chosen as the most favorable treatment alternative for Paraty as it is an expandable, economic and highly efficient system. The main advantage to CEPT is to generate an effluent that can be efficiently and economically disinfected at a low cost compared to secondary treatment. The most optimal dose of FeCl 3, polymer and seawater to treat the Paraty sewage were estimated at 40 mg/L, 0. 1 mg/L and 5 % seawater by volume respectively. Jar tests were also conducted at the Boston Deer Island WWTP to check the efficiency of using seawater as a coagulation enhancement mechanism on saline influents. CEPT effluents treated with FeCl 3 were also tested for disinfection with both Paracetic acid (PAA) and Chlorine. Although PAA is an effective disinfectant, it was not included due to its high cost. The optimal chlorine dose for Paraty was estimated at 3 mg/L. Additional tests were conducted to test for the disinfectability of the Deer Island effluent treated with CEPT. These tests helped show that the sensitivity of disinfection in the presence of seawater is limited by low seawater concentrations. This thesis concludes with a detailed design of the treatment plant <b>sedimentation</b> tanks, chlorination/dechlorination <b>chambers,</b> and grit removal facility dimensions and draws general encouraging conclusions on the suggested use of seawater as a coagulation catalyst in chemically enhanced primary wastewater treatment. by Claire A.

40|$|The {{management}} and control of cyanobacteria and their toxins in drinking water reservoirs and water supplies have engaged the attention of many scientists worldwide due to their negative effects on population health. The cyanotoxin, microcystin, {{the main focus of}} this research has been responsible for much documented illness in humans and is the most wildly studied cyanotoxin. The World Health Organization has set a guideline limit of 1 µg/l in drinking water. A number of methodologies have been used in this research. These include the use of an inverted microscope for the identification and quantification of cyanobacteria species after <b>sedimentation</b> in counting <b>chambers.</b> The biomass of picocyanobacteria was determined by epifluorescence microscopy after staining with DAPI. Extraction, purification and concentration of dissolved microcystins were done using the Solid Phase Extraction method. Identification of microcystins was done through comparison with commercial standards and their characteristic UV- spectra, and quantified by extrapolations of HPLC peak areas at 238 nin to a linear calibration curve for microcystin-LR standard. Nutrients (N 0 ₂-N, N 0 ₃-N and P 0 ₃-P) in reservoirs in Ghana were analysed using the American Public Health Association standard methods. The results which are the first of their kind from Ghana, and for most part in West Africa, highlight that the water treatment processing currently in place is not effective in removing cyanobacteria cells from the final drinking water. Positive correlations were obtained between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrients concentrations in the reservoirs. Fifteen new cyanobacteria species were identified {{for the first time in}} Ghana of which Cyanogranisferrugineais reported for the first time in tropical waters. Four known microcystin variants - 1 R, -RR, - LF and -YR in both dissolved and intracellular samples were identified in four drinking water reservoirs. The study concludes that, the presence and dominance of potentially toxic small sized cyanobacteria such as Aphanocapsa nubilum, Cyanogranis ferruginea, Geitlerinema unigranulatum and other toxic cyanobacteria species like Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Planktothrix agardhii and Microcystis spp in the Weija, Kpong, Barekese and the Owabi reservoirs all with basic conventional drinking water treatment facilities, shown to be ineffective in removing cyanobacteria and their toxins, present a potential risk to human health through exposure to cyanotoxins such as microcystins and cylindrospermopsin. Even though the concentrations of dissolved microcystins obtained in the reservoirs and drinking water supplies were lower than the WHO limit, there is potentially a risk to public health and ongoing monitoring would be a good idea.

40|$|Thermophilic {{actinomycetes}} and bacilli {{were recovered}} from mushroom compost by conventional dilution plating and sedimentation chamber-Andersen sampler methods. Excessive growth of thermophilic bacilli on dilution plates {{accounted for the}} poor recovery and limited diversity of actinomycete colonies, and this result was largely unaffected {{by the use of}} modified extraction procedures and diluents. Assessment of the actinomycete population was more successfully achieved by applying the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>chamber</b> method, by using selective media, or both. Background resistance of the compost microflora to selective agents (kanamycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, thiostrepton, and NaCl) was extremely varied, but both actinomycetes and bacilli were particularly sensitive to tetracycline. The selective isolation of Thermoactinomyces spp. and Thermomonospora chromogena by novobiocin and kanamycin, respectively, was shown to be reproducible, and the use of high concentrations of kanamycin resulted in the isolation of a novel group of unidentified thermophilic actinomycetes. Comparison of nonselective nutrient media demonstrated that the nutrient-rich protoplast regeneration medium R 5 was surprisingly efficient for actinomycete recovery. This medium was found to be particularly appropriate for the recovery of Saccharomonospora viridis BD 125, introduced as spores into both sterile and fresh samples of mushroom compost. This stable pigmented variant of the S. viridis strains indigenous to compost was released at concentrations of up to 107 spores g of compost− 1 in order to provide information for future experiments on the release and recovery of genetically manipulated strains. The detection limits for this strain were in the region of 102 g− 1 from sterilized compost but only 105 g− 1 from nonsterile compost. These figures correspond to mean recovery efficiencies of approximately 70 % (sterilized compost) and 53 % (fresh compost) of viable spores released. Further improvements in the detection and recovery of S. viridis strains released into compost should be achieved by the introduction of selectable markers developed from this information on the antibiotic resistance profile of the indigenous compost microflora...|$|E
