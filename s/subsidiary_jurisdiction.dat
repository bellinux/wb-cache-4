40|$|The European Union Succession Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 650 / 2012) (hereafter Succession Regulation) {{provides}} a comprehensive {{treatment of the}} diverse private international law issues concerning succession, encompassing within the same instrument rules on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions and authentic instruments in succession matters. At the same time, each of these sets of rules coexisting within the Regulation bears its own regime in terms of spatial applicability. As concerns the rules on jurisdiction, these tend to regulate comprehensively all succession disputes, including those more closely connected to a third country, by providing for <b>subsidiary</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> rules and for a rule on forum necessitatis. Still, the rules contained in the Regulation as concerns choice of forum, as well as lis alibi pendens and related actions, are conceived from a purely inter partes perspective. This causes {{on the one hand}} the impossibility of re-establishing Gleichlauf where the deceased made a professio iuris in favour of the law of a third country, and, on the other hand, does not ensure a satisfactory coordination with parallel proceedings pending before third country courts. The <b>subsidiary</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> rules may in turn cause an excessive enlargement of the scope of the jurisdiction of Member States’ courts, and could also hinder the unity of the succession. The latter concern is likely to arise also in respect of the mechanism embodied in Article 12 (1) of the Regulation, which achieves a rather incomplete coordination with the jurisdiction exercised by third country courts. Some suggestions will be submitted for amendments to be made to the Succession Regulation in order to overcome these shortcomings...|$|E

A panel analysis concerning all 26 Swiss cantons (from 1990 to 2003) shows that public expenditure per capita increases {{with the number of}} inhabitants of a canton. This holds for the aggregate expenditure level and for six expenditure categories of the Government Finance Statistics. The positive elasticity of per capita expenditure with respect to population size can be understood as an indicator for increasing government failure in jurisdictions with bigger population siz...|$|R
50|$|Many {{countries}} that impose tax have subdivisions or <b>subsidiary</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> that also impose tax. This feature {{is not unique}} to federal systems, like the U.S., Switzerland and Australia, but rather is a common feature of national systems. The top tier system may impose restrictions on both the ability of the lower tier system to levy tax as well as how certain aspects of such lower tier system work, including the granting of tax exemptions. The restrictions may be imposed directly on the lower jurisdiction's power to levy tax or indirectly by regulating tax effects of the exemption at the upper tier.|$|R
40|$|In the {{legislative}} acts {{adopted by the}} EU {{in the field of}} private international law different approaches are present as concerns the spatial applicability of the rules addressing, respectively, issues of jurisdiction and of applicable law. Whereas the latter rules tend to apply universally or erga omnes, that is, also in the event in which they designate the law of a third country, the former rules usually apply purely inter partes, in such terms as to address only the jurisdiction of Member States' courts. The tension between these two approaches is particularly evident within Regulation (EU) No. 650 / 2012 (the European Succession Regulation), which provides within a single text a comprehensive set of rules addressing the various private international law issues concerning succession. Also within this Regulation, in fact, different approaches are adopted concerning the spatial aplicability of its rules. As concerns the rules on jurisdiction, these tend to regulate comprehensively all succession disputes, including those more closely connected to a third country, by providing for <b>subsidiary</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> rules and for a rule on forum necessitatis. Nonetheless, the rules contained in the Regulation as concerns choice of forum, as well as lis alibi pendens and related actions, apply purely inter partes. This causes on the one hand the impossibility of re-establishing a correspondence between forum and ius in case the deceased made a professio iuris in favour of the law of a third country, and, on the other hand, does not ensure a satisfactory coordination with parallel proceedings pending before third country courts. The <b>subsidiary</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> rules may in turn cause an excessive enlargement of the scope of the jurisdiction of Member States’ courts, and could also bring attempt to unity of the succession. The latter concern is likely to arise also in respect of the mechanism embodied in Article 12, para. 1, of the Regulation, which achieves a rather incomplete coordination with the jurisdiction exercised by third country courts...|$|E
40|$|The parsimony of {{economic}} theory provides general insights into an otherwise complex world. However, the most straightforward organizing principles from theory have not often taken hold in environmental policy {{or in the}} decentralized climate policy regime that is unfolding. One reason is inadequate recognition {{of a variety of}} institutions. This paper addresses three ways the standard model may inadequately anticipate the role of institutions in the actual implementation of climate policy, with a US focus: multilayered authority across jurisdictions, the impressionistic rather than deterministic influence of prices through <b>subsidiary</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> and the complementary role of prices and regulation in this context. The economic approach is built on the premise that incentives affect behavior. We suggest an important pathway of influence for economic theory is to infuse incentive-based thinking into the conventional regulatory framework. In a complex policy regime, incentives can be shaped by shadow prices as well as market prices...|$|R

The process was used in 2001, when Spanish justice sent an international arrest warrant for responsibles of human rights violations in Argentina. An NGO then deposed a text, as third party, before the Argentine court, setting forth the judicial arguments needed to either extradite or judge suspects of human rights violations (an alternative known as <b>subsidiary</b> universal <b>jurisdiction).</b>|$|R

In more sophisticated offshore insurance markets, onshore insurance companies can also establish an offshore <b>subsidiary</b> in the <b>jurisdiction</b> to reinsure certain risks underwritten by the onshore parent, and thereby reduce overall reserve and capital requirements. Onshore reinsurance companies may also incorporate an offshore subsidiary to reinsure catastrophic risks.|$|R

GAO was asked to update its 2004 report on large federal contractors with subsidiaries in countries sometimes called tax havens because of low taxes and a general lack of transparency. In response, GAO determined how many of the 100 largest publicly traded U. S. corporations and the 100 largest publicly traded U.

GAO (1) combined three lists of such jurisdictions created by governmental, international, and academic sources and (2) identified large publicly traded U.

5000|$|Formulary apportionment, {{also known}} as unitary taxation, is a method of allocating profit earned (or loss incurred) by a {{corporation}} or corporate group to a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a taxable presence. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or <b>subsidiary</b> within the <b>jurisdiction</b> is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with {{other parts of the}} corporation or group to be assigned according to the arm's length standard commonly used in transfer pricing. In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the current criticism, expressed by African states and institutions, {{of the exercise}} of universal jurisdiction by Western states, accusing the latter of overstepping their lawful powers, as well as practicing ‘legal colonialism’. In order to gauge whether this criticism is warranted, this article starts by expounding the normative framework. <b>Subsidiary</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> derives out of the primary obligations of the territorial state or {{the state of the}} perpetrator to initiate criminal investigations and the prosecution of international crimes. These states owe such obligations towards the entire international community (erga omnes). Inadequate performance by the states bearing prior responsibility therefore triggers the right of other states to exercise universal jurisdiction. An analysis of some cases and legal trends provides this author with the impression that Western courts have made prudent use of universal jurisdiction; that their case law has contributed to the development of international criminal law; and that international criminal tribunals have frequently orchestrated their initiatives. The author therefore concludes that this criticism has, in general, been far-fetched and unfair. Nevertheless, he submits that such indignation might have been triggered by isolated events in which Western judges have overstepped their powers and displayed a remarkable lack of political sensitivity...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States {{taxation}} can {{be imposed}} as a statutory {{corporate income tax}} {{as well as a}} taxation on the profits that domestic corporations collect from their subsidiaries abroad. This policy of taxing foreign profits is called a [...] "worldwide" [...] system of taxation, and it contrasts with the [...] "territorial" [...] system employed by most developed countries including the United Kingdom and Canada, which generally tax only profits from domestic activities. The result is that U.S. corporations with <b>subsidiaries</b> in lower-tax <b>jurisdictions</b> face higher taxes on those foreign operations than they would if they were incorporated elsewhere. As Bloomberg View columnist Matt Levine wrote in 2014: If we're incorporated in the U.S., we'll pay 35 percent taxes on our income in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico and Ireland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, but if we're incorporated in Canada, we'll pay 35 percent on our income in the U.S. but 15 percent in Canada and 30 percent in Mexico and 12.5 percent in Ireland and zero percent in Bermuda and zero percent in the Cayman Islands.|$|R

This volume is concerned with how procedural law treats these legally independent but functionally integrated corporations.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{considers}} the effects of pre-empting a resolution procedure for a troubled financial institution by a precautionary recapitalization as specified in Article 32 (4) (d) of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). Benefits are seen for the maintenance of systemically important operations of an institution with legally independent <b>subsidiaries</b> in multiple <b>jurisdictions</b> and possibly for the maintenance of lending in situations where an entire banking system is involved. Other systemic concerns, such as the maintenance of lending when only part of a banking system is affected, the avoidance of damage to money markets, and potential systemic effects from bailing in creditors, can be addressed in a resolution procedure under the rules of the BRRD and do not require the instrument of a precautionary recapitalization. The second part of the paper provides a critical assessment of Article 32 (4) (d) of the BRRD and finds some weaknesses that contribute to raising taxpayers' costs or to reducing the effectiveness of the operation. The availability of precautionary recapitalization outside of resolution contributes to undue and costly delays in acknowledging and addressing problems. The conditions specified in the Directive are problematic, sometimes too tough, sometimes too lenient, most importantly because the objectives of State aid control differ from the objectives of the BRRD. The paper concludes with suggestions for reform...|$|R
