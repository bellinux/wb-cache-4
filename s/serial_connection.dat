25|$|Owen's {{technical}} {{descriptions of}} the Vertebrata were still more numerous and extensive {{than those of the}} invertebrate animals. His Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates (3 vols. London 1866–1868) was indeed the result of more personal research than any similar work since Georges Cuvier's Leçons d'anatomie comparée. He not only studied existing forms but also devoted great attention to the remains of extinct groups, and followed Cuvier, the pioneer of vertebrate paleontology. Early in his career, he made exhaustive studies of teeth of existing and extinct animals and published his profusely illustrated work on Odontography (1840–1845). He discovered and described the remarkably complex structure of the teeth of the extinct animals which he named Labyrinthodontia. Among his writings on fish, his memoir on the African lungfish, which he named Protopterus, laid the foundations for the recognition of the Dipnoi by Johannes Müller. He also later pointed out the <b>serial</b> <b>connection</b> between the teleostean and ganoid fishes, grouping them in one sub-class, the Teleostomi.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} {{multiple}} energy level solar cells is to basically stack thin film solar cells {{on top of}} each other. [...] Each thin film solar cell would have a different band gap which means that if part of the solar spectrum was not absorbed by the first cell then the one just below would be able to absorb part of the spectrum. [...] These can be stacked and an optimal band gap can be used for each cell in order to produce the maximum amount of power. [...] Options for how each cell is connected are available, such as serial or parallel. [...] The <b>serial</b> <b>connection</b> is desired because the output of the solar cell would just be two leads.|$|E

50|$|KGDB is a {{debugger}} for the Linux kernel and the kernels of NetBSD and FreeBSD.
