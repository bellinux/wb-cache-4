5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> parsnips. Camas pocket gophers {{are larger than}} other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{agriculture}} was {{the major}} profession {{in most of the}} provinces in Zambia.

Among all provinces, Central had the maximum area, , constituting 20.64 per cent, while Luapula had the smallest area at 3.06 per cent of the total area. Maize production was maximum in Eastern (22.5%), mixed beans (51.66%) in Northern, sorghum in Southern (40.62%), sunflower in Eastern (70.2%), soya beans (45.06%), sweet potatoes (28.5%) and wheat (49.51%) in Central Province.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus. After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes,</b> <b>and</b> manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and turnips, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats to the Americas.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (kamote) <b>and</b> cassava {{are good}} sources of dietary fiber and {{resistant}} starch and are staple food s in the Philippines. The {{objective of the}} study is to determine changes in glucose and lipid profile after consumption of <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> <b>and</b> cassava in humans with moderately raised serum glucose <b>and</b> lipid profile. <b>Sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (Ipomoea batatas, Super Taiwan variety), and cassava (Manihot esculenta) were used as test foods while white bread was used as the control food. Fifty-nine apparently healthy human adults were fed with the test foods for 90 days and grouped into three: Control, <b>Sweet</b> <b>potato</b> <b>and</b> Cassava. After an overnight fast, 10 mL blood samples were taken from the study partici pants for total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, glucose and hemoglobin A 1 C measurements. Height/weight and percent fat mass were also determined. The groups given <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> <b>and</b> cassava significantly increased HDL-C (P 0. 05). There was a significant decrease in LDL-C in the cassava group (P 0. 05). The group given slice bread signifi cantly increased serum triglycerides (P 0. 05). No significant results were observed with regards to BMI, percent fat, glucose, HbA 1 C, and total cholesterol. In conclusion, <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> <b>and</b> cassava increased HDL-C and decreased LDL-C in humans with moderately raised serum glucose and cholesterol levels. Sustainable intake of <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> <b>and</b> cassava may be promising in the prevention for risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. </p...|$|R

40|$|Elemental {{compositions}} from Yacon, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>Potato</b> {{have been}} analyzed and determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrum {{to study the}} relationship of their chemical elemental compositions with their nutrition quality. In the dry matters of Yacon, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>Potato,</b> the content of carbon element is about 40 %, not only {{to indicate that the}} similar carbon content is a common nature of the three fruits belonging to Potato species, but also to demonstrate that they are classified to low alloy steel calorie food. The content of nitrogen element is determined to be a bigger value in the dry matters of Yacon, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>Potato,</b> namely their protein content is high; especially, the protein content in the dry matter of Potato is the similar to that in millet, which can explain that Potato is a relative nutrition foodstuff in principle of protein. Because of a large proportion of oxygen (47. 88 %) as well as the biggest sugar content in the dry matter of Yacon, Yacon is the sweetest foodstuff among all its kind. The main metal elemental contents are up to 3. 75 %, 2. 64 % and 2. 50 % in the dry matters of Yacon, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>Potato</b> respectively, which is larger not only than those in common foodstuffs, but also than 2. 42 % in soybean. In particular, the contents of K, Fe, Ca, Mg, Mn and Cu in the dry matters of Yacon, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>Potato</b> all are high. It can be ascertained in light of the microelement properties that their nutrition quality is similar to what soybean possesses. Therefore, the obtained results by investigating elemental compositions prove that Yacon, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>Potato</b> are comprehensive <b>and</b> balanced nutrition foodstuffs with high content of protein, trace elements as well as sugar compositions and low content of carbon element. The cultivation of Yacon, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>Potato</b> is an available approach to the food shortage of China, taking advantages of high yield without difficulty, strong adaptability to fertile and paddy field and high nutrition value comparable to rice and flour...|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th {{century the}} {{population}} had risen to 300 million from approximately 150million during the late Ming dynasty. The dramatic rise in population was due to several reasons, including the long period of peace and stability in the 18th century and the import of new crops China received from the Americas, including peanuts, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> maize. New species of rice from Southeast Asia led to a huge increase in production. Merchant guilds proliferated in all of the growing Chinese cities and often acquired great social and even political influence. Rich merchants with official connections built up huge fortunes and patronized literature, theater and the arts. Textile and handicraft production boomed.|$|E

25|$|In the remoter {{areas of}} Japan, black bears can be serious crop predators: black bears feed on {{cultivated}} bamboo shoots in spring, on plums, watermelons and corn in the summer, and on persimmons, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> rice in the autumn. Japanese black bears {{are estimated to}} damage 3,000 bee hives annually. When feeding on large crops such as watermelons or pumpkins, black bears will ignore the flesh, and eat the seeds, thus adversely affecting future harvests. Black bears can girdle and kill trees by stripping their bark for the sap. This can cause serious economic problems in Asia's valuable timber forests. In the late 1970s, 400-1,200 hectares of land had been affected by bears bark stripping Japanese conifers. There is evidence that 70-year-old conifers (commanding the highest market values) {{may also have been}} bark stripped.|$|E

Canadian missionary George MacKay said of 19th century Taiwan: ‘the bulb of the sweet potato is planted in March. In about six weeks the vines are cut into pieces eight inches long, which are planted in drills, and from these vine-cuttings the bulbs grow and are ripe {{about the end of}} June. A second crop is planted in a similar way in July and is ripe in November.’ (Ibid). The influence of <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> taro has been vast.
