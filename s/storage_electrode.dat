Several key factors for example corrosion resistance, pulverization resistance and oxidation resistance were evaluated individually. The V-based solid solution phase has much lower anti-corrosion ability than C 14 Laves phase in KOH solution, {{and the addition of}} Cr in V-Ti-based alloys can suppress the dissolution of the main hydrogen absorption elements of the V-based phase in the alkaline solution. During the charge/discharge cycling, the alloy particles crack or break into several pieces, which accelerates their corrosion/oxidation and increases the contact resistance of the alloy electrodes. Proper decreasing the Vickers hardness and enhancing the fracture toughness can increase the pulverization resistance of the alloy particles. The oxidation layer thickness on the alloy particle surface obviously increases during charge/discharge cycling. This deteriorates their electro-catalyst activation to the electrochemical reaction, and leads to a quick degradation. Therefore, enhancing the oxide resistance can obviously improve the cyclic stability of V-Ti-based hydrogen <b>storage</b> <b>electrode</b> alloys. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this research, composite material of activated carbon and Nafion® was chosen to investigate the potential direct and reversible storage of hydrogen. The ultra-microspores of activated carbon provide the storage sites and Nafion® provides the pathway to guide the hydrogen ions to the storage sites. In total, ten samples of activated carbon were used in this research including five samples that were activated by KOH chemical activation method. The porosity of the samples were characterised by adsorption isotherm of CO 2 at 273 K and N 2 at 77 K. From the ten activated carbons, five were selected for solution casting of composite materials with Nafion® solution. The physical properties, i. e. water uptake and volume expansion, and electrochemical properties, i. e. proton and electron conduction, of the composite materials were measured as a function of relative humidity.
