When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, <b>seedlings</b> originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the <b>seedlings</b> originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses.

30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a <b>seedling</b> storage monitoring module, a <b>seedling</b> taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of <b>seedling</b> indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled <b>seedling</b> storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable <b>seedling</b> tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the <b>seedling</b> plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the <b>seedling</b> tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the <b>seedling</b> tray is moved from the <b>seedling</b> storage mechanism to the <b>seedling</b> tray conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the <b>seedling</b> tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the <b>seedling</b> tray enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of <b>seedling</b> was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the <b>seedling</b> pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable <b>seedling</b> is taken out from the <b>seedling</b> tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable <b>seedling</b> in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula grew on ridges (dry heath) and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath), {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of <b>seedlings</b> in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that <b>seedlings</b> do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar {{situations}} with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced <b>seedlings</b> in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that <b>seedlings</b> had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of <b>seedlings</b> at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E

We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} type of microhabitat suitable for O. europaea recruitment is influenced by microhabitat-specific relationships between seed size and <b>seedling</b> growth rate. To test this hypothesis we conducted field experiments evaluating <b>seedling</b> growth and survival as a function of seed size, microhabitat (determined by presence/absence of scrub cover), and competition (established by means of <b>seedling</b> density gradients). Our results show that, first, seed size was related to <b>seedling</b> size and to differential growth rate. Second, <b>seedling</b> growth rate was negatively correlated with initial <b>seedling</b> size, although this correlation varied among microhabitats and temporally. Third, <b>seedling</b> survival differed between microhabitats and was positively affected by initial <b>seedling</b> size {{until the end of the}} summer drought. Finally, the effect of <b>seedling</b> size on survival was partly mediated by its negative relationship with growth rate. However, the combined effect of size and growth on <b>seedling</b> survival varied between microhabitats. We conclude that establishment depended on microhabitats through facilitation and inhibition processes, and that seed size-related growth rate strongly affected <b>seedling</b> fate. It is noteworthy that the effectiveness of the size-correlated growth depended on microhabitat. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} <b>seedlings</b> germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and <b>seedlings</b> have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} probable allelopathic {{effect of}} {{different parts of}} Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens L.) on the growth of redroot amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) <b>seedling,</b> a factorial experiment was conducted based on randomized complete block design with three replications at the Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University in 2012 (Iran). In this experiment, treatments were different parts of Russian knapweed (aerial part, flower and root) in different amounts (1, 2, 3 and 4 g/pot). Pots included 300 g of soil. Results showed the significant effect of Russian knapweed plant parts on the <b>seedling</b> emergence percent, root length, ratio of root/shoot length, <b>seedling</b> length, <b>seedling</b> fresh weight, and the significant effect of plant material amounts on the <b>seedling</b> emergence percent, <b>seedling</b> fresh weight and <b>seedling</b> dry weight.

40|$|Abstract Seed and <b>seedling</b> {{predation}} may differentially affect competitively {{superior tree}} species {{to increase the}} relative recruitment success of poor competitors {{and contribute to the}} coexistence of tree species. We examined the effect of seed and <b>seedling</b> predation on the <b>seedling</b> recruitment of three tree species, Acer rubrum (red maple), Liriodendron tulipifera (yellow poplar), and Quercus rubra (northern red oak), over three years by manipulating seed and <b>seedling</b> exposure to predators under contrasting microsite conditions of shrub cover, leaf litter, and overstory canopy. Species rankings of <b>seedling</b> emergence were constant across microsites, regardless of exposure to seed predators, but varied across years. A. rubrum had the highest emergence probabilities across microsites in 1997, but Q. rubra had the highest emergence probabilities in 1999. Predators decreased <b>seedling</b> survival uniformly across species, but did not affect relative growth rates (RGRs). Q. rubra had the highest <b>seedling</b> survivorship across microsites, while L. tulipifera had the highest RGRs. Our results suggest that annual variability in recruitment success contributes more to <b>seedling</b> diversity than differential predation across microsites. We synthesized our results from separate <b>seedling</b> emergence and survival experiments to project <b>seedling</b> bank composition. With equal fecundity assumed across species, Q. rubra dominated the <b>seedling</b> bank, capturing 90 % of the regeneration sites on average, followed by A. rubrum (8 % of sites) and L. tulipifera (2 % of sites).
