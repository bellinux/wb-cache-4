40|$|A {{survey of}} the <b>scleractinian</b> <b>corals</b> at Ashmore Reef was {{conducted}} during September/October 1997. This {{is only the second}} such reported survey of Ashmore Reef. As a result of this survey five more species and one more genus of <b>scleractinian</b> <b>corals</b> have been recorded at Ashmore Reef. This brings the total number of <b>scleractinian</b> <b>corals</b> reported for Ashmore Reef to 256 species from 56 genera which distinguishes it as the richest area for coral diversity in Western Australia. In addition, a few alcyonacean corals were collected. From this small collection there were two new generic records and at least 18 new species records of alcyonacean corals for Ashmore Reef.

50|$|Traditional {{methods for}} the {{detection}} of K. brevis are based on microscopy or pigment analysis. These are time-consuming, and typically require a skilled microscopist for identification. Cultivation-based identification is extremely difficult and can take several months. A molecular, real-time PCR-based approach for sensitive and accurate detection of K. brevis cells in marine environments has therefore been developed. Another technique {{for the detection}} of K. brevis is multiwavelength spectroscopy, which uses a model-based examination of UV-vis spectra. Methods of detection using satellite spectroscopy have also been developed. This particular protist is known to be harmful to humans, large fish, and other marine mammals. It has been found that the survival of <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> is negatively affected by brevetoxin. <b>Scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> exhibits decreased rates of respiration when there is a high concentration of K. brevis.|$|E

40|$|The {{answer to}} the title {{question}} is uncertain, as very few manipulative experiments have been conducted to test how deep-sea <b>scleractinians</b> (stony <b>corals)</b> react to changes in seawater chemistry. Ocean pH and calciumcarbonate saturation are decreasing due to an influx of anthropogenic CO 2 to the atmosphere. Experimental evidence has shown that declining carbonate saturation inhibits the ability of marine organisms to build calcium carbonate skeletons, shells, and tests. Here we put forward a hypothesis suggesting that the global distribution of deep-sea <b>scleractinian</b> <b>corals</b> could be limited {{in part by the}} depth of the aragonite saturation horizon (ASH) in the world's oceans. Aragonite is the metastable form of calcium carbonate used by <b>scleractinian</b> <b>corals</b> to build their skeletons and the ASH is the limit between saturated and undersaturated water. The hypothesis is tested by reviewing the distribution of deep-sea, bioherm-forming <b>scleractinian</b> <b>corals</b> with respect to the depth of the ASH. Results indicate that > 95 % of 410 coral locations occurred in saturated waters during pre-industrial times. Projections indicate that about 70 % of these locations will be in undersaturated waters by 2099. Lab experimentation, in situ experimentation, and monitoring efforts are needed to quantify the effects of changing seawater chemistry on deep-sea coral ecosystems...|$|R
50|$|Roughly 1 km2 in size, Varadero boasts {{approximately}} 80% coral cover. Reaching {{more than}} 3 meters in diameter, {{many of the}} massive colonies found in the reef of Varadero belong to the genus of the hermatypic coral Orbicella. This reef is estimated to contain a richness of over 30 <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> species. To adjust to the low light levels resulting from the water’s polluted state, some corals have utilized a flattened, plate-like growth strategy to optimize light exposure for its photosynthetic algal endosymbionts of the genus Symbiodinium. With the rapid decline of coral reefs in the Caribbean, scientists are examining reefs, such as in Varadero, to understand reef resilience.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{means of}} {{reproduction}} is by asexual means; fragments of coral that become detached from branches can form new colonies {{if they are}} deposited in suitable locations. At times of stress, another form of asexual reproduction takes place that may allow some of the polyps to survive even though the parent colony dies. This has been termed [...] "polyp bail-out" [...] and involves growth of the coenosarc (the living tissue covering the skeleton) to isolate the polyp, detachment of the polyp, and settlement of the polyp on the seabed followed by its attachment and growth of a new skeleton. In the laboratory, about 5% of these polyps survived to found a new colony. [...] This coral exhibits a high growth rate, high reproductive output and short life-span. It is a very successful species and is often the first <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> to colonise a disturbed area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{discovery}} {{and analysis of}} Coelosimilia has changed the previous understanding {{of the evolution of}} the Scleractinia. Modern-day scleractinian corals have skeletons composed of aragonite, a calcitic mineral. Analysis of the skeleton of Coelosimilia does not seem to support development from aragonitic compounds. Instead, the skeleton is primarily calcitic [...] - [...] a type rarely if not ever seen in extant scleractinia. It is the first recorded instance of a <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> producing a non-aragonitic skeleton. Production of non-aragonitic skeletons by marine organisms, or the evolution of organisms capable thereof has been explained {{as a response to the}} ratio of the elements Magnesium (Mg) and Calcium (Ca) dissolved in seawater. Magnesium is a component of aragonite, and an abundance of the element is necessary for the development of aragonitic structure-building organisms. The presence of Coelosimilia during the Late Cretaceous has been suggested as an indicator of a low ratio (less than 2) of Mg to Ca in Cretaceous seas. In contrast, modern-day ratios of the two elements would be more than twice the suggested Cretaceous value, at a ratio of around 5.2. This has been used as an indicator of the shifts in the ratios of the two minerals in the oceans over the geologic time scale.|$|E

40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{development}} of microsatellite loci isolated from two <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> species (Montastraea cavernosa and Porites astreoides). To analyze the genetic structure of <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> populations, it is essential to identify a genetic marker that can evaluate individual or population-level differences (Shearer and Coffroth 2004). Optimal PCR conditions are essential when developing microsatellite loci and were determined through numerous PCRs in varying MgCl 2 concentrations, Taq polymerase concentrations, annealing temperatures, and the number of PCR cycles. Sequencing confirmed the presence of microsatellite repeats only in loci McGA 5 (8 and 12 repeats) and McCA 9 (5, 6, and 8 repeats). The microsatellite repeats confirmed length variability among clones within these two loci rendering them useful in population genetic analyses. Genetic analysis of population differentiation and measurements of gene flow provides a powerful tool for investigating dispersal. The creation of two more microsatellite primers will add to the available resources for analyzing the genetic connectivity and diversity of this <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> species.

40|$|Modern <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> skeletons are {{commonly}} composed of aragonite, the orthorhombic form of CaCO 3. Under certain conditions, modern corals produce calcite as a secondary precipitate to fill pore space. However, coral construction of primary skeletons from calcite {{has yet to}} be demonstrated. We report a calcitic primary skeleton produced by the modern <b>scleractinian</b> <b>coral</b> Acropora tenuis. When uncalcified juveniles were incubated from the larval stage in seawater with low mMg/Ca levels, the juveniles constructed calcitic crystals in parts of the primary skeleton such as the septa; the deposits were observable under Raman microscopy. Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed different crystal morphologies of aragonite and calcite in a single juvenile skeleton.
