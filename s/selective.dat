5|$|Columbia {{contains}} the oldest {{college in the}} state of New York and is the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the United States, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded prior to the Declaration of Independence. It was established as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain and renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolutionary War. The college has produced numerous distinguished alumni. It has additionally been amongst the most <b>selective</b> colleges in the United States since its founding. With an undergraduate acceptance rate of 5.8%, it currently stands as the third most <b>selective</b> college in the United States and second most <b>selective</b> college in the Ivy League.|$|E

5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts <b>selective</b> pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the <b>selective</b> pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E

5|$|<b>Selective</b> {{glucocorticoid}} receptor modulators (SEGRMs) and <b>selective</b> glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known}} as dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selective</b> mirrors {{to create}} {{interference}} effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with {{multiple layers of}} chitin in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, the emerald swallowtail butterfly. These act as highly <b>selective</b> mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits; blue light is reflected twice by {{the sides of the}} pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|Sleaford {{is served}} by three {{secondary}} schools with sixth forms: Carre's Grammar School, a boys' grammar school, Kesteven and Sleaford High School, a girls' grammar school, and St George's Academy, a mixed comprehensive school. The grammar schools are <b>selective</b> and pupils are required to pass the Eleven plus exam. St George's is not <b>selective.</b> The co-educational Joint Sixth Form consortium between Carre's and St George's allows pupils to choose subjects taught at either school.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial <b>selective</b> prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of <b>selective</b> prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|The molybdenum-based mixed oxides are {{versatile}} catalysts in {{the chemical}} industry. Some examples are the catalysts for the <b>selective</b> oxidation of propylene to acrolein and acrylic acid, the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile.

5|$|The {{town has}} three {{secondary}} schools with sixth forms: Carre's Grammar School, a boys' grammar school, Kesteven and Sleaford High School, a <b>selective</b> academy girls' grammar school, and St George's Academy, formerly St George's College of Technology, {{and before that}} Sleaford (County) Secondary Modern School (mixed non-selective secondary school). The grammar schools are <b>selective</b> and pupils are required to pass the Eleven plus exam. St George's is not <b>selective.</b> The co-educational Joint Sixth Form consortium between Carre's and St George's allows pupils to choose subjects taught at either school.|$|E

5|$|Columbia University {{received}} 36,292 {{applications for}} its undergraduate class of 2020 (entering 2016). In early decision, 620 out of 3,520 applicants were admitted, for an acceptance rate of 17.61%. In regular decision, 1,573 out of 32,772 applicants were admitted, for an acceptance rate of 4.79%. For the Class of 2021, 2,185 out of 37,389 applicants were admitted for an overall acceptance rate of 5.8%, making Columbia {{the third most}} <b>selective</b> college in the United States behind Stanford and Harvard and the 2nd most <b>selective</b> college in the Ivy League. According to the 2012 college selectivity ranking by U.S. News & World Report, which factors admission and yield rates among other criteria, Columbia was tied with Yale, Caltech and MIT as the most <b>selective</b> colleges in the country. Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516. In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).|$|E

5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator {{to catch the}} prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes <b>selective</b> pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Tucci was <b>selective</b> about {{roles in}} gangster films, believing that Hollywood stereotyped Italian-Americans as gangsters. However, {{attracted}} {{by the prospect of}} working with Mendes, the actor accepted the role of Nitti, a real-life Mob boss from Chicago.|$|E
