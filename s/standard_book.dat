For example, in the International <b>Standard</b> <b>Book</b> Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. To gain access to the book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E
5|$|Kanaka Dasa (whose {{birth name}} was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509–1609) of Kaginele (in modern Haveri district) was an ascetic and spiritual seeker, who {{according}} to historical accounts {{came from a}} family of Kuruba (shepherds) or beda (hunters). Under the patronage of the Vijayanagara king, he authored such important writings as Mohanatarangini ("River of Delight", 1550), written in dedication to King Krishnadevaraya, which narrates the story of Krishna in sangatya metre. His other famous writings are Narasimhastava, a work dealing with glory of God Narasimha, Nalacharita, the story of Nala, which is noted for its narration, and Hari Bhaktisara, a spontaneous writing on devotion in shatpadi metre. The latter writing, which is on niti (morals), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (renunciation), continues to be a popular <b>standard</b> <b>book</b> of learning for children. A unique allegorical poem titled Ramadhanya Charitre ("Story of Rama's Chosen Grain") which exalts ragi over rice was authored by Kanaka Dasa. In this poem, a quarrel arises between ragi, the food grain of the poor, and rice, that of the rich, as to which is superior. Rama decides that ragi is superior because it does not rot when preserved. This is one of the earliest poetic expressions of class struggle in the Kannada language. In addition to these classics, about 240 songs written by Kanaka Dasa are available.|$|E

25|$|Modular {{arithmetic}} {{is often}} used to calculate checksums that are used within identifiers. International <b>Standard</b> <b>Book</b> Number (ISBN) uses modulo 11 (if issued before 1 January, 2007) or modulo 10 (if issued on or after 1 January, 2007) arithmetic for error detection. Likewise, International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), for example, make use of modulo 97 arithmetic to trap user input errors in bank account numbers. In chemistry, the last digit of the CAS registry number (a number which is unique for each chemical compound) is a check digit, which is calculated by taking the last digit of the first two parts of the CAS registry number times 1, the previous digit times 2, the previous digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10.|$|E
25|$|In {{the common}} case when V is a {{positive}} or negative definite space over the reals, the spin group maps onto the special orthogonal group, and is simply connected when V has dimension at least 3. Further the kernel of this homomorphism consists of 1 and −1. So {{in this case the}} spin group, Spin(n), is a double cover of SO(n). Please note, however, that the simple connectedness of the spin group is not true in general: if V is Rp,q for p and q both at least 2 then the spin group is not simply connected. In this case the algebraic group Spinp,q is simply connected as an algebraic group, even though its group of real valued points Spinp,q(R) is not simply connected. This is a rather subtle point, which completely confused the authors of at least one <b>standard</b> <b>book</b> about spin groups.|$|E

At Mass, Catholics believe that they respond to Jesus' command at the Last Supper to [...] "do this in remembrance of me." [...] In 1570 at the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V codified a <b>standard</b> <b>book</b> for the celebration of Mass for the Roman Rite. Everything in this decree pertained to the priest celebrant and his action at the altar. The participation of the people was devotional rather than liturgical. The Mass text was in Latin, as this was the universal language of the church. This liturgy was called the Tridentine Mass and endured universally until the Second Vatican Council approved the Mass of Paul VI, {{also known as the}} New Order of the Mass (...) , which may be celebrated either in the vernacular or in Latin.|$|E
2500|$|Basic {{quilting}} {{instructions were}} difficult {{to find in the}} early 1970s as quiltmaking had fallen out of vogue after World War II, and there were few people who practiced the craft. [...] James turned to two early quilt books for information and inspiration: The <b>Standard</b> <b>Book</b> of Quilt Making and Collecting by Marguerite Ickis, published in 1949 and Jean Ray Laury’s book, Quilts and Coverlets: A Contemporary Approach, published in 1970. [...] In his keynote address to the American Quilt Study Group in 2000, James credits Laury’s book as his “first introduction to the notion that quilts didn’t have to conform to some historical prescription” and with his “first awareness {{that there might be a}} place for experimentation and individual expression.” [...] Before exploring the expressive potential of quiltmaking, however, he became proficient in the technical aspects by creating numerous copies of traditional block patterns.|$|E

It was originally advertised as the [...] "debut novel" [...] of Donald Trump. Marketing materials said the book was within the same vein as Hotel by Arthur Hailey.> When the book was first given its initial International <b>Standard</b> <b>Book</b> Number, primary authorship was ascribed to Donald Trump. The novel was catalogued in the Library of Congress with Trump as the main author. Another edition attributed to Donald Trump was released the same year in audiobook format by Playaway Digital Audio. The cover designer of the work was Jeff Williams. Book vendors and librarians received marketing materials for the book in 2011 with its original cover featuring Trump as primary author, with Robinson's name appearing below Trump's. The literature purveyors subsequently received a notice that the original version of the work would not be sent out to them; instead they were sent a copy of the 2012 edition. Perseus Books Group, supervisor of Vanguard Press, told The Huffington Post when contacted that year, that the first published version of the title from 2011 was unavailable.|$|E
