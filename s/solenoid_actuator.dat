5000|$|Three Mile Island Unit 2 {{was unable}} to contain about 480 PBq of {{radioactive}} noble gases from release into the environment and around 120 kL of radioactive contaminated cooling water from release beyond the containment into a neighbouring building. The pilot-operated relief valve at TMI-2 was designed to shut automatically after relieving excessive pressure inside the reactor into a quench tank. However the valve mechanically failed causing the PORV quench tank to fill, and the relief diaphragm to eventually rupture into the containment building. [...] The containment building sump pumps automatically pumped the contaminated water outside the containment building. Both a working PORV with quench tank and separately the containment building with sump provided two layers of passive safety. An unreliable PORV negated its designed passive safety. The plant design featured only a single open/close indicator based {{on the status of}} its <b>solenoid</b> <b>actuator,</b> instead of a separate indicator of the PORV's actual position. [...] This rendered the mechanical reliability of the PORV indeterminate directly, and therefore its passive safety status indeterminate.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the application of electromagnetic finite element (FE) analysis, using a general purpose package, OPERA- 2 d, and optimization techniques to the design of solenoid actuators used in hydraulic control valves. Different methods of force calculations are reviewed, including Maxwell Stress Tensor (MST), multi-solution Virtual Work Principle (VWP), and single-solution based VWP methods. While the MST method enables the calculation of force using a single solution and provides the distribution of force transmitted across various sections of the integration surface enclosing the armature of the actuator, it requires a finer mesh for accurate force calculation compared to VWP. There is no advantage of MST and single-solution VWP methods over multi-solution VWP technique in computing force-displacement characteristics of a d. c. <b>solenoid</b> <b>actuator</b> with constant current source because in all methods a set of FE solutions has to be found anyway at several armature displacements. However, for solenoids where current varies with displacement, e. g. a. c. solenoids, the multi-solution VWP requires a large number of solutions. In this thesis both multi-solution VWP and MST methods are used. Implementation of single-solution methods is not possible using the current version of OPERA- 2 d. To understand the effect of armature geometry on the shape of the force-displacement characteristic, a parametric study using OPERA- 2 d has been conducted. A customized design shell environment (CusOP) is developed to aid and simplify the repetitive process of using OPERA- 2 d. The results of this study were used to design a new proportional <b>solenoid</b> <b>actuator,</b> which was built and tested. It was found that more desirable force displacement characteristics have indeed been achieved. A comprehensive review of available optimization techniques is presented. The most promising of these techniques, including Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) variable metric procedure, Nelder-Mead simplex method, Gauss-Newton method, Levenberg-Marquardt procedure, Trust region method and Simulated Annealing, have been extensively evaluated by comparing their performance (in terms of number of function evaluations) in the optimization of eighteen general unconstrained problems and eighteen nonlinear least-squares problems. The Levenberg-Marquardt procedure shows clear advantage, displaying consistent performance over the range of problems tested. This method which can only find local optima is preferred to the Simulated Annealing global optimization method, because it does not require too many function calls. Finding local optima is usually sufficient in optimization of solenoid actuators and, therefore, it is chosen for this application. A program called Electromechanical Actuator Modelling and Optimization (EAMON) has been created for the implementation of constrained automated optimization by interfacing the Levenberg-Marquardt technique to OPERA- 2 d. The program has been used successfully to optimize the design of a proportional <b>solenoid</b> <b>actuator</b> to produce a specified force-displacement characteristic. It has also been used in optimizing an actuator, which was subsequently successfully tested, where the area under the force-displacement characteristic is maximized.
