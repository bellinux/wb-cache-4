While the troops, in obedience to this signal, were preparing themselves for the conflict, the two generals went to meet each other at a point midway between their two encampments, for a final consultation and agreement in respect to the arrangements of the day. When this business was concluded, and they were about to separate, in order to proceed each to his own sphere of duty, Cassius asked Brutus what he intended to do in case the day should go against them. [...] "We hope for the best," [...] said he, [...] "and pray that the gods may grant us the victory in this most momentous crisis. But we must remember that it is the greatest and the most momentous of human affairs that are always the most uncertain, and we can not foresee what is to-day to be the result of the battle.

40|$|Significant {{variability}} {{exists in}} the application of protected/permissive left-turn (PPLT) <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> throughout the United States. PPLT signal phasing provides a protected phase for left-turns as well as a permissive phase during which left-turns can be made if gaps in opposing traffic allow, all within the same signal cycle. Although the intent of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) is to provide a national standard, only general guidance is provided in the selection and use of PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays.</b> Additionally, the MUTCD does not require a separate PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> for PPLT <b>signal</b> phasing. Consequently, PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> have been implemented in a variety of configurations throughout the United States. PPLT signal phasing and corresponding displays can be found at approximately 29 percent of signalized intersections in the United States. The five-section cluster is the most common arrangement, used at approximately 63 percent of all PPLT intersections, but is not uniformly applied in placement, location, and use of supplemental signs. Within each PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>display,</b> the MUTCD requires a green arrow for the protected left-turn movement and a circular green indication for the permissive movement...|$|R

5000|$|For those {{familiar}} with modern railways, the sense of this signal aspect is hard to understand. During its period of use, there was often a signal box {{at each end of}} the station or there were areas of hand-operated points that were set by pointsmen. The 'rest' aspect indicated to the pointsmen and shunters that they could [...] "do what they wanted and store what they wanted" [...] on the track so designated. However, they could not use any tracks where the <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> a different aspect.|$|E
5000|$|Older {{forms of}} <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> their {{different}} aspects by their physical position. The earliest types comprised a board that was either turned face-on and fully {{visible to the}} driver, or rotated {{so as to be}} practically invisible. While this type of signal is still in use in some countries (e.g., France and Germany), by far {{the most common form of}} mechanical signal worldwide is the semaphore signal. This comprises a pivoted arm or blade that can be inclined at different angles. A horizontal arm is the most restrictive indication (for 'danger', 'caution', 'stop and proceed' or 'stop and stay' depending on the type of signal).|$|E
5000|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, JNR Limited Express 243, {{consisting}} of a JNR Class C51 coal-fired steam locomotive with nine passengers cars was en route from Nagoya Station to Toba Station. Per the train’s driver and fireman, the signal at Rokken Station indicated that the train had right-of-way, and was proceeding with caution; therefore the train passed the platform of Rokken Station at a speed of 58 km/h. However, {{at the end of the}} platform, the driver found that the token was missing, and that the <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> “stop”, which indicated that it was unsafe to proceed due to oncoming traffic. He applied the emergency brakes, but overran the safety barrier, causing the train to derail, with some of the passenger carriages partially on the rails of the main line.|$|E

50|$|To {{understand}} how the distortion comes about, let us consider an ideal linear process from sampling to display. When a signal is sampled at a frequency that is at least double the Nyquist frequency, it can be fully reconstructed by low-pass filtering since the first repeat spectra does not overlap the original baseband spectra. In discrete displays the image signal is not low-pass filtered since the display takes discrete values as input, i.e. the <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> contains all the repeat spectra. The proximity of the highest frequency of the baseband signal to the lowest frequency of the first repeat spectra induces the beat frequency pattern. The pattern seen on screen can at times be similar to a Moiré pattern. The Kell factor is the reduction necessary in signal bandwidth such that no beat frequency is perceived by the viewer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first five}} trains {{passed through the}} Mud Run station area without incident. As the sixth train passed through, it stopped 600 or 700 feet beyond the station as there was no 'All Clear' <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> ahead. There was a red light on the rear car of this train, {{indicating}} its presence and serving as a stop signal for any approaching train. Unfortunately, the station was on a curve {{making it difficult to}} see the idled train. The flagman, James Hannigan, of the idled train walked back along the track to warn the seventh train, which was then approaching Mud Run. During an inquest conducted by Coroner A. J. Horn of Carbon County on the morning after the accident, Hannigan stated that he had gone 400 feet {{from the rear of the}} idled train and that [...] "he did not know about a rule requiring that he go back a distance of sixteen telegraph poles as required by LVRR regulations." [...] That distance was lengthened to 1,900 feet at his trial. [...] The seventh train, headed westbound, had passed an eastbound train, which would normally indicate that the single track area of the line ahead was now clear. The lookouts on the seventh train (Hugh Mulhearn and Joseph Pohl) failed to see the red signal at Mud Run station and by the time they noticed the light being waved frantically by the flagman of the sixth train, it was too late to avoid a collision.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the safety and effectiveness of selected protected/permissive left-turn (PPLT) <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> through driver comprehension evaluations. Driver evaluations were conducted using full-scale, fixed-based, fully-interactive driving simulators located at the University of Massachusetts and the Texas Transportation Institute. PPLT displays were also evaluated in a static environment to provide comparison data. In an effort to evaluate driver’s comprehension of the various PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> in use, several traditional study methods have been employed. Commonly, pen and paper comprehension tests are used in which the driver simply marks what he/she believes to be the correct answer. The critique of this methodology has focused on the belief that the study responses provided might not be consistent with the decision made in the actual driving environment. To add more realism to the experiment, computer technology has been employed by providing static photos of actual driving environments and superimposing PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> within. Although this technology is believed to be a major step forward in experimentation, the static nature and lack of dynamic cues may still lead drivers through a different decision process. This paper describes the use of a full-scale dynamic driving simulator as a tool for evaluating driver comprehension of PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays.</b> Drivers traversed through a series of signalized intersections created as part of...|$|R

40|$|In vitro {{neuronal}} {{cultures have}} become a popular method with which to probe network-level neuronal dynamics and phenomena in controlled laboratory settings. One of the key dynamics of interest in these in vitro studies has been {{the extent to which}} cultured networks display properties indicative of learning.

Networks receiving this training <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> a time-dependent increase in the response to a low frequency probing stimulation, particularly in the time window of 20 - 50 ms after stimulation. This increase was found to be statistically significant as compared to control networks that did not receive training. The timing of this increase suggests potentiation of synaptic mechanisms. To further investigate this possibility, we leveraged the powerful Cox statistical connectivity method as previously investigated by our group. This method was used to identify and track changes in network connectivity strength...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{hand-held}} ultrasonic Doppler units (probes) {{are often}} used for noninvasive screening of atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lower limbs. The mean velocity of blood flow in time and blood pressures are measured on several positions on each lower limb. By listening to the acoustic signal generated by the device or by reading the <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> on screen, a specialist can detect peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This project aims to design software that {{will be able to}} analyze data from such a device and classify it into several diagnostic classes. At the Department of Functional Diagnostics at the Regional Hospital in Liberec a database of several hundreds signals was collected. In cooperation with the specialist, the signals were manually classified into four classes. For each class, selected signal features were extracted and then used for training a Bayesian classifier. Another set of signals was used for evaluating and optimizing the parameters of the classifier. Slightly above 84 % of successfully recognized diagnostic states, was recently achieved on the test data. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} heat shock on Myxococcus xanthus was {{investigated}} during both glycerol- and starvation-induced development. Cells heat shocked at 40 degrees C for 1 h {{prior to a}} development-inducing <b>signal</b> <b>displayed</b> an accelerated rate of myxospore formation at 30 degrees C. Additionally, M. xanthus cells heat shocked prior to glycerol induction formed a greater total number of myxospores when sporulation was complete than did control cells maintained at 30 degrees C. However, in starvation-induced fruiting cells {{the total number of}} myxospores in control and heat-shocked populations was about equal when fruiting body and myxospore formation was complete. When extended heat shock (3 h) was applied to cells prior to development, no acceleration of myxospore formation was observed. Heat shock elicited the premature expression of many developmentally regulated proteins. Cell fractionation and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography revealed the subcellular location and molecular weights of the 18 glycerol-induced and 9 starvation-induced developmental proteins. Comparison with previously identified M. xanthus heat shock proteins showed that nine of the developmental proteins found in glycerol-induced cells and three of the developmental proteins found in starvation-induced cells were heat shock proteins. Furthermore, heat shock increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, a developmentally regulated enzyme, in vegetative cells, glycerol-induced cells, and starvation-induced cells...|$|E
