25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, Cannon Films {{had faded}} from prominence, and Norris' star appeal <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with it. He reprised his Delta Force role for MGM, which had {{acquired}} the Cannon library after the latter's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Norris went on to make several more films before making a transition to television. In 1993, he began shooting the series Walker, Texas Ranger, which lasted eight seasons on CBS and continued in syndication on other channels, notably the Hallmark Channel.|$|E

25|$|At first {{implementation}} of the August 4 agreement <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well. An African American apprentice electrician, Frequette Pursley III, started work on August 5 without incident, and another began work on August 6. Four black youths applied for plumbers' apprenticeships without incident on August 8, and another electrician apprentice started work on August 12 without incident. By August 16, Plumbers Local 55 had admitted four African American men as journeymen and two as apprentices after unionizing the black-owned Consolidated Heating & Plumbing Co.|$|E
25|$|In the Pyrénées, French Jean Alavoine was the {{dominant}} cyclist, as he won three stages. In the sixth stage, Robert Jacquinot, who was primarily {{known as a}} sprinter, rode away and topped the first three mountains first. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on and win the stage and took over the lead, but the last mountain {{was too much for}} Jacquinot, and he fell off his bike climbing the Peyresourde. Alavoine passed Jacquinot and {{went on to win the}} stage, while Bottecchia won back enough time to regain his lead from Bellenger, who lost a lot of time. When Alavoine won his third stage in Nice, Bottecchia was leading the race, with Alavoine in second place and Henri Pélissier in third place, almost half an hour behind.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, has not only mislaid his glasses, but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E

500|$|The Sunbeam Tiger was a {{development}} of the Sunbeam Alpine series I, introduced by the British manufacturer Rootes in 1959. Rootes realised that the Alpine needed more power if it was to compete successfully in world markets, but lacked a suitable engine and the resources to develop one. The company therefore approached Ferrari to redesign the standard inline-four cylinder engine, recognising the sales cachet that [...] "powered by Ferrari" [...] {{would be likely to}} bring. Negotiations initially <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well, but ultimately broke down.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{despite a}} few setbacks, {{military}} action <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in Gebhard's favor, until October, 1583, when the Elector Palatine died, and Casimir disbanded his army {{and returned to}} his brother's court as guardian for the new duke, his 10-year-old nephew. In November, 1583, from his castle Arensberg in Westphalia, he wrote to Francis Walsingham, adviser and spymaster to Queen Elizabeth: [...] "Our needs are pressing, and you [...] and the Queen's other virtuous counsellors we believe can aid us; moreover, since God has called us to a knowledge of Himself, we have heard from our counsellors that you love and further the service of God." ...|$|E

500|$|Mayor Puusemp {{and the new}} Village Board also reorganized the Village Police force, {{appointing}} Richard F. Miniter Chief-of-Police {{and hiring}} a dozen part-time officers {{most of which were}} adult students at the Ulster County Community College’s Criminal Justice Program. [...] One of the tasks assigned Chief Miniter by the Village Board and Mayor Puusemp was the closing of Billy Guldy’s bar the Well. [...] It was a continual source of disruption late at night and the sidewalk and street outside the premises the site of numerous drug and assault arrests. [...] Billy Guldy also <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{out of his way to}} offend residents for example by having a lifesize caricature of the Virgin Mary painted on the premise’s front wall. [...] However the only body with the power to close the Well was the State Liquor Authority and numerous petitions from Village residents had failed to have it do so.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on and on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed {{all of us that}} it was possible to go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E

[...] The New York World reported, [...] "The floor of the convention seemed to heave up. [...] Everybody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> mad at once." [...] In a demonstration of some half an hour, Bryan was carried around the floor, then surrounded with cheering supporters. [...] Men and women threw their hats into the air, not caring where they might come down. [...] Delegates were shouting to begin the vote and nominate Bryan immediately, which he refused to consider, feeling that if his appeal could not last overnight, it would not last until November. [...] Bryan left the convention, returning to his hotel to await the outcome. [...] In the midst of the crazed crowd, Altgeld, a Bland supporter, commented to his friend, lawyer Clarence Darrow, [...] "That is the greatest speech I ever listened to.

500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft {{gave birth}} to her second daughter, Mary. Although the {{delivery}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; puerperal (childbed) fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, [...] "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again." [...] She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, [...] "Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797." [...] (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).|$|E
500|$|The {{first study}} showed infants a toy car that moved down an {{inclined}} track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged {{at the other}} end, still on the track. The researchers created a [...] "possible event" [...] where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an [...] "impossible event." [...] In this situation, the toy mouse {{was placed on the}} tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the mouse. [...] Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. [...] The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. This indicated that they may have been surprised by the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment. [...] This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.|$|E

500|$|Wintour {{travelled}} to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support. [...] While {{there he}} sought out Guy Fawkes (1570–1606), a committed Catholic {{who had served}} as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands under the command of William Stanley, and who in 1603 was recommended for a captaincy. [...] Accompanied by John Wright's brother Christopher, Fawkes had also {{been a member of the}} 1603 delegation to the Spanish court pleading for an invasion of England. [...] Wintour told Fawkes that [...] "some good frends of his wished his company in Ingland", and that certain gentlemen [...] "were uppon a resolution to doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spain healped us nott". [...] The two men returned to England late in April 1604, telling Catesby that Spanish support was unlikely. [...] Thomas Percy, Catesby's friend and John Wright's brother-in-law, was introduced to the plot several weeks later. [...] Percy had found employment with his kinsman the Earl of Northumberland, and by 1596 was his agent for the family's northern estates. [...] About 1600–1601 he served with his patron in the Low Countries. [...] At some point during Northumberland's command in the Low Countries, Percy became his agent in his communications with James. [...] Percy was reputedly a [...] "serious" [...] character who had converted to the Catholic faith. [...] His early years were, according to a Catholic source, marked by a tendency to rely on [...] "his sword and personal courage". [...] Northumberland, although not a Catholic himself, planned to build a strong relationship with James in order to better the prospects of English Catholics, and to reduce the family disgrace caused by his separation from his wife Martha Wright, a favourite of Elizabeth. [...] Thomas Percy's meetings with James <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well. [...] Percy returned with promises of support for the Catholics, and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence. [...] Percy, keen to improve his standing, went further, claiming that the future King would guarantee the safety of English Catholics.|$|E
500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E
