In order to transport cars she was fitted with a gate on the port side, from where cars were driven inside the ship and then lifted mechanically to the actual car deck. This arrangement was already out of date when the ship was delivered, as Finland SS Co.'s subsidiary Siljavarustamo had taken the delivery of the first ro-ro ferry with bow and rear gates on the North Baltic already in 1961.

40|$|The {{observation}} of a 0. 5 conductance plateau in asymmetrically biased quantum point contacts with in-plane <b>side</b> <b>gates</b> has {{been attributed to}} the onset of spin-polarized current through these structures. For InAs quantum point contacts with the same width but longer channel length, there is roughly a fourfold increase in the range of common sweep voltage applied to the <b>side</b> <b>gates</b> over which the 0. 5 conductance plateau is observed when the QPC aspect ratio (ratio of length over width of the narrow portion of the structure) is increased by a factor 3. Non-equilibrium Green s function simulations indicate that the increase {{in the size of the}} 0. 5 conductance plateau is due to an increased importance, over a larger range of common sweep voltage, of the effects of electron-electron interactions in QPC devices with larger aspect ratio. The use of asymmetrically biased QPCs with in-plane <b>side</b> <b>gates</b> and large aspect ratio could therefore pave the way to build robust spin injectors and detectors for the successful implementation of spin field effect transistorsComment: 30 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
