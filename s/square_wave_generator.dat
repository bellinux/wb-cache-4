Slew rate and bandwidth of the op-amp restricts the performance of Schmitt Trigger based on op-amp. Schmitt Trigger using Current Conveyors lack electronically tuned hysteresis level.

50|$|Simple bench pulse {{generators}} usually allow {{control of the}} pulse repetition rate (frequency), pulse width, delay with respect to an internal or external trigger and the high- and low-voltage levels of the pulses. More-sophisticated {{pulse generators}} may allow control over the rise time and fall time of the pulses. Pulse generators are available for generating output pulses having widths (duration) ranging from minutes down to under 1 picosecond.Pulse generators are generally voltage sources, with true current pulse generators being available only from a few suppliers. Pulse generators may use digital techniques, analog techniques, {{or a combination of}} both techniques to form the output pulses. For example, the pulse repetition rate and duration may be digitally controlled but the pulse amplitude and rise and fall times may be determined by analog circuitry in the output stage of the pulse generator.

50|$|Voltage-to-Frequency {{converters}} are voltage-controlled oscillators, with {{a highly}} linear relation between applied voltage and frequency. They are used to convert a slow analog signal (such as from a temperature transducer) to a digital signal for transmission over a long distance, since the frequency will not drift or be affected by noise. VCOs may have sine and/or <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> outputs. Function <b>generators</b> are low-frequency oscillators which feature multiple waveforms, typically sine, <b>square,</b> and triangle <b>waves.</b> Monolithic function <b>generators</b> are voltage-controlled. Analog phase-locked loops typically contain VCOs. High-frequency VCOs are usually used in phase-locked loops for radio receivers. Phase noise {{is the most important}} specification for them. Low-frequency VCOs are used in analog music synthesizers. For these, sweep range, linearity, and distortion are often most important specs. Audio-frequency VCOs for use in musical contexts were largely superseded in the 1980s by their digital counterparts, DCOs, due to their output stability in the face of temperature changes during operation. From the 1990s on, pure software is the primary sound-generating method, but VCOs have become popular again often thanks to their imperfections.|$|R

A novel modifications of recently developed and studied family of active elements, called voltage differencing buffered amplifier (VDBA) and voltage differencing inverted buffered amplifier (VDIBA) are discussed.

40|$|Thyroglobulin (Tg) {{represents}} one of the largest known self-antigens involved in autoimmunity. Numerous studies have implicated it in triggering and perpetuating the autoimmune response in autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). Indeed, traditional models of autoimmune thyroid disease, experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), are generated by immunizing mice with thyroglobulin protein in conjunction with an adjuvant, or by high repeated doses of Tg alone, without adjuvant. These extant models are limited in their experimental flexibility, i. e. the ability to make modifications to the Tg used in immunizations. In this study, we have immunized mice with a plasmid cDNA encoding the full-length human Tg (hTG) protein, in order to generate a model of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis which is closer to the human disease and does not require adjuvants to breakdown tolerance.

5000|$|Assume {{that the}} <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> is the input rotation. As the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the {{circular}} spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the <b>wave</b> <b>generator's</b> shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the <b>wave</b> <b>generator,</b> the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the <b>wave</b> <b>generator</b> results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{methods and}} {{computational}} techniques for predicting the static and steady state {{characteristics of a}} switched reluctance motor drive are developed and the predicted characteristics are compared with experimental results. Because of high local saturation and narrow airgap in the SR motor, accurate calculation of the static characteristics of the torque, flux linkage, inductances, and speed emf from its FE field solution is not straightforward. For {{the purpose of this}} study, a two-dimensional finite element model is developed to handle the nonlinear magnetic field inside the machine. Based on a thorough study of the potential sources of errors in the field solution and in the computational methods used in postprocessing, new guidelines are developed regarding the shape and uniformity of the mesh in the airgap and the preservation of these qualities of the mesh as the rotor is rotated. When the proposed guidelines on the mesh configuration and its rotation were used, significant improvement in the accuracy of the field distribution and in the accuracy of the predicted torque/angle characteristics as compared to the experimentally measured torque was observed. Furthermore, all three methods of torque calculation, namely global virtual work, local virtual work, and Maxwell-stress tensor methods are converging to the same results and the torque/angle characteristics are smooth. Improvement in the prediction of such static characteristics is also essential to a realistic prediction of the steady state behavior. In the study of steady state performance of the SRM drive, the converter is approximated by a controlled, <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> pulse <b>generator.</b> In the integration process, the coefficients of the governing differential equation, being dependent on the phase current and rotor angle, are updated using surface interpolation method on the static characteristics.

Each of these circuits is built around electrical components that, like all devices, vary in value due to variations in materials, manufacturing, and operating conditions. For example, capacitors are notoriously variable often operating as much as % 20 / from their nominal value. Clearly, a variation in capacitor value can have an affect on the operation of an electronic circuit. If the statistical properties of the capacitor and resistor value distributions are known, stochastic methods {{can be used to}} compute this effect. Unfortunately, this is often not the case and we are frequently left to use empirical methods to determine this effect. A common technique is to use a Monte Carlo method where a circuit will be built (or simulated) many times with different components from a lot and the resulting behavior analyzed.
