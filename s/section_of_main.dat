5|$|Although {{the project}} made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>main</b> pipeline was welded in place on December 6, {{but not all of}} the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's opening, Downtown Flushing {{evolved into}} a major {{commercial}} and transit center, as development sprung around the <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Main</b> Street near the station. On April 24, 1939, express trains began operating {{to and from the}} station, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the Willets Point station for the 1939 World's Fair. Due to the high level of passenger use, beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at the east end of the station, and the widening of existing staircases. A new eastern entrance was added after World War II. Ground broke on the new entrance on November 5, 1947, and it opened on October 28, 1948 with two new street stairs and an additional token booth. Upon its initial opening, the new entrance did little to relieve crowding at the main fare control area.|$|E

25|$|NY60 was realigned in {{the early}} 1960s to bypass Fredonia to the east on a newly {{upgraded}} highway leading from Laona to Reed Corners (US20). From there, NY60 was to follow a new highway to a point on Central Avenue near where it passes under the New York State Thruway, where it would continue into Dunkirk on its original alignment. By 1968, the idea of constructing a new roadway was dropped and NY60 was altered to use Bennett Road, Lamphere Street, and Main Street instead to reach East Lake Shore Drive (NY5). The <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Main</b> Street north of Franklin Street {{had been part of}} NY39 from 1930 to the mid-1960s, when NY39 was cut back to its current western terminus.|$|E

500|$|NY146 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and originally extended from NY43 (now NY443) in Berne northeast through Schenectady to US4 and NY32 in Mechanicville. The portion of the route northeast of Altamont generally followed its modern alignment; however, west of Altamont, NY146 followed what is now NY156 to Berne while NY156 was routed on modern NY146 to Gallupville. Although it was signed as part of NY156, the Gallupville–Altamont highway was locally maintained until 1939, when it was acquired by the state of New York. The alignments of NY146 and NY156 west of Altamont were flipped , placing NY146 on the new state highway. Most of former NY146 west of Altamont became part of NY156, save for a one-block <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Main</b> Street within the village. It is now designated as NY912C, an unsigned [...] reference route serving a connector between NY156 and NY146, which do not meet despite both highways using Main Street as an entrance to the village.|$|E

2500|$|Filming {{began on}} August 22, 2000, {{and ended in}} mid-December 2000. The budget for the miniseries was {{slightly}} more than $35 million. The computer-operated ghost puppets created by XFX cost $150,000 each. Interior sets were built in three former airplane hangars at the abandoned Sand Point Naval Base in Seattle. More than [...] of interior sets were built. The largest set contained a full-scale version of the great hall at Rose Red, including a fireplace, columns, grand staircase, adjacent dining hall, and doorway to the solarium (the last being a feature inspired by the Shirley Jackson novel). Two bedrooms and the billiard room at Thornewood Castle were used for location shots. Sadly, actor David Dukes {{died of a heart}} attack on October 9, 2000, in Spanaway, Washington, while shooting Rose Red. He was due to film his death scene the following day. A double was used for shots of his character running through foliage, and King rewrote some scenes to feature other characters instead of Miller. The intersection of Spring Street and Seventh Avenue in Seattle was used for the fictional location of Rose Red; other Seattle locations used in the miniseries include a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Main</b> Street and a house in Mount Baker (this is the home destroyed by a rain of stones in the miniseries).|$|E
