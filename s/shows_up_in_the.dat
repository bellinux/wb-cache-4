25|$|Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{was influenced}} by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any {{particular piece of}} paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with the brush. The brush strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work. The calligrapher must concentrate and be fluid in execution. The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at {{a moment in time}} (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E

Demare had the cameramen {{and the rest of the}} crew dressed as gauchos or royalist troops so that if they were accidentally included, they would not ruin the shot. While {{directing}} this scene, a sudden wind change moved the fire towards Demare himself making him lose his wig and singeing his fake beard and mustache.|$|E
25|$|This {{mismatch}} also <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{phenomena of}} the supernormal stimulus, a stimulus that elicits a response {{more strongly than}} the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by Niko Tinbergen to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist Deirdre Barrett said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats, and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action. Magazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an EEA where breast development {{was a sign of}} health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient. The psychologist Mark van Vugt recently argued that modern organizational leadership is a mismatch. His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's {{character}} changes {{between the}} manga and anime {{in regard to}} her level of devotion towards Hazumu and how much she {{is willing to do}} to be with her, especially after Hazumu's transformation into a girl. The first instance of this is when Yasuna confesses her love to Hazumu the first day she returns to school as a girl, but in the anime she does not confess to Hazumu after the change and in fact starts to avoid her. Similarly, during the time when Hazumu is shopping for her first bra, Yasuna <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manga version and helps Hazumu into a very feminine bra, but in the anime it is Tomari who helps her try on her first bra. In episode three of the anime, Yasuna continues to avoid Hazumu despite still longing for her, and it takes an effort by Hazumu to restore their previous friendship, but Yasuna never once tries to avoid Hazumu in the manga; on the contrary, Yasuna tries to be around Hazumu as much as possible in the manga version. During the time when Yasuna holds a curry party in the manga, which is combined with the beach trip in episode seven of the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she wants all of Hazumu to herself and she invited the others to the party so that she could see Hazumu's brightest smile. However, during the same scene in the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she invited Tomari and the others so that she could learn more about Hazumu and her likes and dislikes.|$|E

25|$|A {{comparison}} of GOES-12 satellite images shows {{the distribution of}} atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles {{north and south of}} the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.|$|E

500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp {{producer}} Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986) featured Stipe's vocals {{closer to the}} forefront of the music.

And I think that <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> projection of his voice." [...] The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and eventually peaked at number 21 on the Billboard album chart. The single [...] "Fall on Me" [...] also picked up support on commercial radio. The album was the band's first to be certified gold for selling 500,000 copies. While American college radio remained R.E.M.'s core support, the band was beginning to chart hits on mainstream rock formats; however, the music still encountered resistance from Top 40 radio.|$|E

Music Radio stated that [...] "Madonna's {{appearance on the}} brilliantly titled but deeply dreary 'Me Against The Music' was a postmodern prank designed to make all sane listeners think 'actually, American Life was pretty good, after all.'" [...] While reviewing The Singles Collection, Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy said that [...] "the only arguable weak link is the Madonna-featuring 'Me Against The Music', but in this context what once looked like a respectful {{passing of the baton}} now seems like an unconditional surrender of pop Queendom to its rightful heir." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] "the album's coy, overly busy single". Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian noted it as [...] "the only duff track" [...] of the album. Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Madonna <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> album's first song, 'Me Against the Music', as if endorsing Spears's foray into come-hither posing and club-land beats." ...|$|E

2500|$|All the General Chinese {{initials}} {{here are}} voiced: The h in dh {{shows that this}} is a [...] "muddy" [...] consonant, and the q in qiuan represents an initial ng- (becoming g in Japanese). This voicing <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cantonese yang tones, which are represented by aitches in Yale romanization. [...] "Heavy" [...] codas, such as remm, indicate the [...] "departing" [...] (去) tone, as in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Similarly, the spelling ao in dhyao indicates the [...] "rising" [...] (上) tone, but because of the voiced initial, it merges with [...] "departing" [...] in Mandarin and literary Cantonese (though not in colloquial Cantonese). The y in dhyao indicates that the initial is a stop in Min, Japanese, and Vietnamese, but otherwise an affricate. Cantonese and Korean retain the final m of remm. These pronunciations are all predictable given the General Chinese transcription, though it was not designed with the Sinospheric languages specifically in mind. Both the pre-war and post-war Japanese orthographies are recoverable.|$|E

He is a last male descendant of an illustrious and principled family (its story, Simion writes, is [...] "thrilling"), but surrounds himself with misfits, and pursues three women at once: a Greek belle, a delicate Catholic, and a secretive lady who stands for [...] "Byzantinism tainted by the occult". The latter is Ana Ulmu, whose affair with Silion drives fiancé Arghir to a grotesque suicide. Ana also attempts to kill herself, and fails, leaving Silion to ruin himself paying for her recovery in hospital. Lunatecii reaches its climax when Silion attempts to kidnap Ana from her new husband, and ends up being shot and injured by him. Lucu experiences a rapid descent into poverty, alcoholism, and vagrancy, only commending the respect of fellow drunks.|$|E
