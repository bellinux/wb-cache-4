40|$|Yélî Dnye has two discernable {{dedicated}} constructions for reciprocal marking. The {{first and}} main construction uses a dedicated reciprocal pronoun numo, somewhat like English each other. We can recognise two subconstructions. First, the ‘numo-construction’, where the reciprocal pronoun is a patient of the verb, {{and where the}} invariant pronoun numo is obligatorily incorporated, triggering intransitivisation (e. g. A-NPs become absolutive). This <b>subconstruction</b> has complexities, for example in the punctual aspect only, the verb is inflected like a transitive, but with enclitics mismatching actual person/number. In the second variant or <b>subconstruction,</b> the ‘noko-construction’, the same reciprocal pronoun (sometimes case-marked as noko) occurs but now in oblique positions with either transitive or intransitive verbs. The reciprocal element here has some peculiar binding properties. Finally, the second independent construction is a dedicated periphrastic (or woni…woni) construction, glossing ‘the one did X to the other, and the other did X to the one’. It {{is one of the}} rare cross-serial dependencies that show that natural languages cannot be modelled by context-free phrase-structure grammars. Finally, the usage of these two distinct constructions is discussed...|$|E

Background Rossel Island (154. 14 E, 11. 22 S), lying c. 450 km offshore to the east from New Guinea is the easternmost landfall o f the Louiseade archipelago. It is a ‘high ’ is land, roughly equidistant between the Solomons and New Guinea, and belongs territorially to Papua New Guinea, although there is little commerce with the mainland. Four thousand souls live on Rossel, all primarily (or only) speakers of Yeli Dnye, a so-called ‘Papuan (i. e. non-Austronesian) language. The language is an isolate, with no known connections to any other extant language (various speculations by Wurm 1982 and others notwithstanding). Latest bioinformati...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we show that the {{semantic}} characterization of the English ditransitive construction, primarily based {{on the concept of}} transfer and generally assumed in the international literature within Construction Grammar, is insufficient for the remaining branches of Germanic, in particular for the West-Scandinavian languages, both modern and ancient. On the basis of our findings from West-Scandinavian we suggest eight semantic subconstructions of the ditransitive construction, which in turn can be divided into 17 different narrowly-circumscribed semantic verb classes. We depict the semantics of the construction on a semantic map, and lay out the internal structure of the construction on a lexicality–schematicity hierarchy where both higher-level generalizations and lower-level idiosyncrasies are captured. Finally, we investigate a specific <b>subconstruction</b> of the ditransitive in Norwegian, the V-REFL-NP construction, which shows certain idiosyncratic properties, not derivable from any general or specific syntactic rules of Norwegian, nor from the semantics of the individual parts. We conclude that a constructional analysis is needed to satisfactorily account for all the facts of the ditransitive construction in Norwegian and West-Scandinavian...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{goal of this}} {{presentation}} is to analyze the equality mechanism of cooperating morphisms of free monoids, and {{to point out that}} the reachability questions lead to the undecidability and easy characterizations of recursively enumerable languages. In particular, we aim to show, which <b>subconstructions</b> are needed in such results. Moreover, we recall that in some cases the undecidability of the reachability is achieved although the sets of all reachable objects are simple, or more formally, regular languages...|$|R
40|$|Blending of the {{absolute}} construction (subject + nonfinite/verbless predicate) and the "restrictor + adverbial adjunct" construction (e. g., He was repeatedly attacked by terrorists, first in New York, then in Chicago.) yields a new construction of the form "subject + adverbial adjunct" (e. g., The two men were executed in Baghdad, John before the war, (and) Bill during the war.) via intermediate <b>subconstructions</b> that are ambiguous between the source and the target constructions. The semantic notion of "part-whole" relation {{plays a crucial role}} in the syntax and semantics of the relevant constructions and in the process of blending...|$|R

As a result a new multilevel iteration method was developed as well as a new direct approximate method of <b>subconstructions.</b> A program package for the solution of complex space problems of calculation of constructions was developed.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{strengths}} of Goldberg’s version of Construction Grammar (1995 and 2006) is that it shifts our attention away from compositional to non-compositional linguistic expressions. This principle {{seems to be very}} relevant in cases of subconstructions which contain a prepositional group introduced by the German preposition bis (‘until’, ‘up to’, ‘as long as’) followed by a second preposition [bis + PREP 2], like in (1) Der Weg bis an die Grenze ist gleich gefunden (’The way to the border will soon be found’); (2) Er arbeitete bis (spät) in die Nacht (’He worked (late) into the night’); (3) Ich werde Dich lieben bis in den Tod (‘I will love you into death/until I die’); (4) Der Prinz war bis an die Zähne bewaffnet (’The prince was armed to the teeth’); (5) Die Wut steht ihm bis über den Kopf (’Anger was overwhelming him (over his head’) ’). Syntactically, the <b>subconstruction</b> with the preposition bis may serve different purposes and hence fit into different parts of constructions: inside a noun phrase (Weg in (1)), a verb phrase (bewaffnet in (4)) or an adverb (spät in (2)); it may also be dependent on several arguments of a predication, e. g. in (3) : ich, lieben, dich. Starting from examples collected from the two German corpora DWDS and Cosmas II (IDS Mannheim) the study will first describe the syntactic variation of subconstructions with [bis + PREP 2]. It will further deal with the variation in the choice of PREP 2 as illustrated in the following contrasting examples: (6) Er begleitete mich bis zur Gartentür (‘He accompanied me to the garden gate’) (7) Er begleitete mich bis an die Gartentür (‘He accompanied me up to the garden gate’). The selection of the second preposition has manifest implications at the semantic or conceptual level: The use of zu (‘to’) highlights the endpoint (of an implied path or trajectory); with an (‘up to’) it is the path towards the gate that is focussed upon. This static/dynamic difference is also reflected in the case marking at the morpho-syntactic level: The preposition zu requires a dative case, whereas an – which as a ‘two-way preposition’ (Smith 1995) can alternate between the dative or the accusative (see Leys 1989 and 1995) - will require an accusative in these subconstructions for the explicit focusing on the whole stretch of the path, leading to its end. As with most alternations, it is obvious here too that syntactic variation leads to a further morpho-syntactic framing and reflects diversity in construal. The <b>subconstruction</b> with [bis + PREP 2] is polysemous as it may stand for the expression of a concrete spatial path (bis an die Grenze in (1)), a spatial endpoint (bis zur Gartentür in (6)), time (bis in die Nacht in (2)), time + intensity (bis in den Tod in (3)), a metaphorical extension (bis an die Zähne in (4)), a degree (bis über den Kopf in (5)), … In its spatial and temporal uses bis can appear in a <b>subconstruction</b> with a verb that does not convey a spatial or temporal meaning: arbeiten, ’to work’ (2), lieben‚ ’to love’ (3), bewaffnet sein, ’to be weaponed’ (4), and stehen, ’to stand’ (5). Subconstructions with [bis + PREP 2] are so volatile that they can best exemplify the syntax-semantic interface and the importance of postulating an autonomous level of constructions as a unit of its own in the various levels of grammatical organization.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the neglect of impersonal constructions has had two {{significant}} consequences. The first is a descriptive misanalysis of individual constructions, illustrated by the `passive'treatment of `impersonal voice'forms in Finno-Ugric, and `autonomous'forms in Celtic. The second consequence is an extended notion of `passive' that subsumes formally distinct <b>subconstructions</b> and exhibits variation that confounds attempts to impose substantive constraints. The conclusions drawn from `impersonal passives' in Balto-Slavic illustrate the theoretical effects of this misclassification. A passive analysis of synchronically impersonal forms in -no/-to in Ukrainian has fostered the belief that passive constructions may retain structural accusative objects (Sobin 1985). A similar misclassification of -ta forms in Lithuanian underlies claims that passives may be formed from what Perlmutter 1978 calls `initially unaccusative' verbs (Timberlake 1982, Nerbonne 1982). Since these patterns violate various laws proposed within Relational Grammar (rg), they have been interpreted as refuting relational analyses of the passive...|$|R
