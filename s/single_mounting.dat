50|$|The single Mark 8 114 mm gun was not {{intended}} as an anti-aircraft weapon, and as such had an elevation of only 55°.

50|$|The Spademan system {{became very}} popular in the late 1970s. Production mis-steps right when new toe-and-heel {{bindings}} were being introduced led to a , and the Spademan system disappeared in the early 1980s. However, {{the fact that it}} used a <b>single</b> <b>mounting</b> plate eliminated adjustments for different sized boots, which made it popular in rental shops for some time. The Look Integral was introduced to fill this niche when Spademan exited the market.|$|E
50|$|Loch Fada was one {{of seven}} members of her class {{selected}} for extensive modernisation in 1953. The single 4 in gun {{was replaced by the}} ubiquitous twin 4 in mounting HA/LA Mark XIX and the A/A weaponry was standardised as a single twin mounting Mark V and four <b>single</b> <b>mounting</b> Mark VII for the 40 mm Bofors gun, with a Simple Tachymetric Director shipped for the Mark V. Radar Type 277 was fitted with the new ANU antenna array.|$|E

With {{the war in the}} Atlantic won by 1944, and a need forecast for additional fleet A/A escorts for the Royal Navy's increased Far Eastern commitments, twenty-six Loch class were redesigned and renamed (of which nineteen were completed) as Bay-class anti-aircraft frigates.|$|E

50|$|The single 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark 8 gun was not {{intended}} as an anti-aircraft weapon, and as such had an elevation of only 55°. The weapon was designed specifically for reliability over rate of fire, allowing only a <b>single</b> <b>mounting</b> to be shipped, and the comparatively low rate of fire of 25 rounds per minute was ample for the intended anti-ship and shore-bombardment roles. Bristol, although capable of landing a Westland Wasp helicopter on the quarterdeck, lacked a hangar and aviation facilities and thus {{had to rely on}} external air support.|$|E
50|$|A {{single-sided}} swingarm {{is a type}} of swingarm which lies along only one side of the rear wheel, allowing the rear wheel to be mounted like a car wheel (unlike the conventional motorcycle double-sided swingarm). Single-sided swingarms are traditionally found on small motorcycles or scooters, where a robust chain case doubles as the swingarm linking the engine and rear wheel. Single-sided swingarms need to be much stiffer than the double-sided versions, to accommodate the extra torsional forces, and as a result, they are usually heavier than double-sided arms. Having a <b>single</b> <b>mounting</b> point guarantees proper wheel alignment.|$|E
50|$|McGalliard was the {{inventor}} of the Solidstat, a single mount electrical control assembly, and issued a U.S. patent February 8, 1978. The Solidstat is widely used for: resistance heater control, lighting control, motor speed control, pipe heating, tank & kettle heating, laminating press heater control, and medical equipment involving heating, lighting, and temperature controls. A <b>single</b> <b>mounting</b> connection at the potentiometer bushing not only mechanically mounts all of the elements but additionally provides a heat sink connection for the circuit. At the same time, the use of a printed circuit board in the combination permits automated assembly and soldering which substantially reduced the cost of the circuit.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} secondary armament of two 6 in mounts {{was soon}} replaced by eight 4 in guns in <b>single</b> <b>mounts</b> and two 3 in anti-aircraft guns, also in <b>single</b> <b>mounts.</b> Between the wars, the 4 inch low angle guns {{were replaced by}} anti-aircraft mounts and the 3 inch guns by eight 0.50 in anti-aircraft Vickers machine guns in two quadruple mounts.|$|R
