40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Measurements of inspiratory {{strength}} {{are critical}} for detecting inspiratory muscle weak-ness. Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (<b>SNIP)</b> is a quick, noninvasive measurement of global inspiratory strength; however, {{it is not clear}} how many trials are needed for reliable measurements. [Subjects and Methods] One hundred and nineteen subjects (age 39. 9 ± 16. 5, range 18 – 69 yrs) completed the study. They were divided into subgroups of different ages and gender. Subjects were asked to take 20 maximal sniffs after normal expiration, with 30 seconds rest in-between. The highest values among the first 10 and last 10 <b>SNIP</b> maneuvers were recorded as <b>SNIP</b> 1 - 10, and <b>SNIP</b> 11 - 20, respectively. The paired t-test was used to compare the differences. Two-way measures ANOVA was used to compare the effects of age and gender on <b>SNIP.</b> [Results] <b>SNIP</b> 11 – 20 was significantly greater than <b>SNIP</b> 1 – 10, suggesting that 10 trials is not enough to eliminate learning effects. Age did not affect <b>SNIP</b> in either gender, suggesting <b>SNIP</b> is preserved. In stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, the <b>SNIP</b> values were posi-tively related with body mass index in women and positively related with weight in men. [Conclusion] The results suggest that twenty trials are needed for reliable <b>SNIP</b> measurements. The mean value and lower limits of normal <b>SNIP</b> are provided for clinical comparison...|$|R
40|$|Question of the study: Inspiratory muscle {{strength}} monitoring {{is crucial in}} patients with neuromuscular disorders. The sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (<b>SNIP)</b> and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) are usually measured. We investigated whether the test yielding the best value at baseline continued to yield the best value during follow-up. Patients and method: We studied 25 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 61 with myotonic muscular dystrophy (MMD). <b>SNIP</b> and MIP were measured at baseline then annually. Results: At baseline, <b>SNIP</b> was less than MIP in 20 DMD patients (80 %) and 32 MMD patients (52 %). During follow-up in DMD patients, changes in the best method always occurred from <b>SNIP</b> to MIP. In MMD patients, when <b>SNIP</b> was better than MIP at baseline, <b>SNIP</b> was usually better during follow-up (88 %), whereas better MIP than <b>SNIP</b> at baseline was frequently followed by shift to <b>SNIP</b> (50 %). Answer to the question: MIP may be sufficient for monitoring inspiratory muscle function in DMD adults. In MMD, the marked variability in the test yielding the best value at baseline indicates a need for performing both tests at baseline; however, when <b>SNIP</b> yields the best value at baseline, using <b>SNIP</b> alone during follow-up may be appropriate.

40|$|AbstractMeasurement of sniff nasal inspiratory {{pressure}} (<b>SNIP)</b> is {{now used}} widely as a simple, non-invasive assessment of global respiratory muscle strength, {{even though the}} technique evolved originally from measurements of trans-diaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) that reflect {{the status of the}} diaphragm. The relative participation of major respiratory muscles, apart from the diaphragm, in the generation of <b>SNIP</b> is not known. Therefore, we examined the activity during a sniff of both neck and abdominal “accessory” muscles. In seven young adults we implanted fine wire EMG electrodes under direct vision with high-resolution ultrasound into scalene, sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, and transversus abdominis. <b>SNIP</b> was measured during sniffs that were short and sharp, from low to maximal intensity, in both standing and supine postures. Mean maximum <b>SNIP</b> was − 105. 6 cmH 2 O (SD 32. 9) in supine and − 94. 5 cmH 2 O (26. 6) in the standing posture, (difference NS). In every subject, scalene activity appeared even at the lowest <b>SNIP,</b> and increased linearly with increasing <b>SNIP.</b> Sternomastoid activity appeared at higher <b>SNIP</b> levels in three of seven subjects. By contrast, trapezius activity was never present at low <b>SNIP,</b> and appeared in only 2 subjects at maximum <b>SNIP.</b> Sniff abdominal expiratory activity was inconsistent with no activity of transversus in four of seven subjects even at greatest <b>SNIP.</b> Thus, we observed differential activation among these non-diaphragm respiratory muscles during SNIP; while some accessory muscles were very active, others were unlikely to contribute to generation of <b>SNIP.</b> Clinically, this indicates <b>SNIP</b> will be impacted unequally by loss of function of specific respiratory muscles...|$|R

40|$|The <b>SNIP</b> (source {{normalized}} impact per paper) indicator is {{an indicator}} of the citation impact of scientific journals. The indicator, introduced by Henk Moed in 2010, is included in Elsevier's Scopus database. The <b>SNIP</b> indicator uses a source normalized approach to correct for differences in citation practices between scientific fields.

In this paper, a number of modifications that will be made to the <b>SNIP</b> indicator are explained, and the advantages of the resulting revised <b>SNIP</b> indicator are pointed out. It is argued that the original <b>SNIP</b> indicator has some counterintuitive properties, and it is shown mathematically that the revised <b>SNIP</b> indicator does not have these properties. Empirically, the differences between the original <b>SNIP</b> indicator and the revised one turn out to be relatively small, although some systematic differences can be observed. Relations with other source normalized indicators proposed in the literature are discussed as well...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHyperinflation is a {{recognized}} adverse prognostic factor in COPD. As the sniff inspiratory nasal pressure (<b>SnIP)</b> principally reflects {{the severity of}} hyperinflation in COPD, we hypothesized that {{it might also be}} a predictor of mortality. We therefore compared the <b>SnIP</b> to the inspiratory capacity-to-total lung capacity (IC/TLC) ratio as predictors of mortality in advanced COPD. MethodsA retrospective mortality analysis of 110 patients with COPD (mean FEV 1 1. 01 litres, 37 % predicted; 66 % male) was performed. All patients had <b>SnIP</b> and lung volume measurements performed. The power of each test to predict mortality was determined, and predicted survival curves were created for both the <b>SnIP</b> and IC/TLC ratio. Results 37 patients (34 %) died during the study period (29 male, 8 female). Mortality rates were analysed with a Chi 2 test; there was a significant trend towards male death (mortality rate male vs. female; 39. 7 % vs. 21. 6 % respectively; χ 2 p= 0. 058, Chi 3. 6). ROC curves demonstrated that both <b>SnIP</b> and IC/TLC ratio are predictors of mortality, but analysis by Cox proportional hazards suggested the <b>SnIP</b> has a stronger predictive power (<b>SnIP</b> vs. IC/TLC ratio; p= 0. 017 vs 0. 525; HR 0. 97 vs 0. 99 respectively), and analysis of the area under ROC curves (AUC) suggest that <b>SnIP</b> is a better discriminator than IC/TLC ratio (AUC <b>SnIP</b> vs IC/TLC; 0. 679 vs 0. 618). ConclusionsThe <b>SnIP</b> conveys at least as much predictive power for mortality in COPD as hyperinflation determined by IC/TLC ratio. This test is cheaper, quicker and easier than measuring lung volumes by plethysmography...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{methods to}} solve the maximum-reliability stochastic network interdiction problem (<b>SNIP).</b> In this problem, a defender interdicts arcs on a directed graph to minimize an attacker's probability of undetected traversal through the network. The attacker's origin and destination are unknown to the defender and assumed to be random. <b>SNIP</b> can be formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer program via a deterministic equivalent formulation (DEF). As {{the size of this}} DEF makes it impractical for solving large instances, current approaches to solving <b>SNIP</b> rely on modifications of Benders decomposition. We present two new approaches to solve <b>SNIP.</b> First, we introduce a new DEF that is significantly more compact than the standard DEF. Second, we propose a new path-based formulation of <b>SNIP.</b> The number of constraints required to define this formulation grows exponentially with the size of the network, but the model can be solved via delayed constraint generation. We present valid inequalities for this path-based formulation which are dependent on the structure of the interdicted arc probabilities. We propose a branch-and-cut (BC) algorithm to solve this new <b>SNIP</b> formulation. Computational results demonstrate that directly solving the more compact <b>SNIP</b> formulation and this BC algorithm both provide an improvement over a state-of-the-art implementation of Benders decomposition for this problem.
