60|$|She {{looked up}} at the young Goth as she {{pronounced}} these words with the same grateful expression that had appeared on her countenance before; but this time her eyes were not dimmed by tears. Already her disposition--poor as was the prospect of happiness which now lay before it--had begun to return, with an almost infantine facility of change, to the restoring influences of the brighter emotions. Already the short tranquilities of the present began to exert for her their effacing charm over the long agitations of the past. Despair was unnumbered among the emotions that grew round that child-like heart; shame, fear, and grief, however they might overshadow it for a time, left no taint of their presence on its bright, fine <b>surface.</b> <b>Tender,</b> perilously alive to sensation, strangely retentive of kindness as she was by nature, the very solitude to which she had been condemned had gifted her, young as she was, with a martyr's endurance of ill, and with a stoic's patience under pain.|$|E

40|$|Scientific Diving {{techniques}} were employed during a 54 day oceanographic research cruise to the Bellingshausen Sea, Southern Ocean (65 °S– 72 °S, 80 °W– 87 °W), {{in order to}} position sampling and data collecting instrumentation beneath sea ice. Eight Scientific Divers and a Field Diving Officer safely completed 112 individual dives (range 2 – 80 minutes, 2 – 28 m); 94 of these were roped dives through holes cut in 1 m thick sea ice. Seawater temperature was − 1. 8 °C, horizontal visibility 30 m+ and water depth 600 m or more. No problems were encountered with the diving equipment used. Diving techniques enabled the collection of an important data set describing the dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton growth beneath sea ice. Recommendations for future under-ice oceanic scientific diving inc 1 ude the use of dive tables with ascent rates of less than 15 m/min, the provision for therapeutic oxygen at the dive site, and adequate shelter for <b>surface</b> <b>tenders...</b>|$|R

50|$|To abandon a type 1 wet bell or stage, {{the divers}} simply exit the bell {{on the side}} that the umbilicals enter, {{ensuring}} {{that they are not}} looped around anything. This is reliably done by having the <b>surface</b> <b>tender</b> take up slack while returning to the bell and following the umbilical out the other side., after which the tender can simply raise the diver as if there were no bell. On a type 2 bell, the umbilicals are connected to the gas panel in the bell, and the procedure used should minimise the risk of the umbilical snagging during the ascent and forcing the diver to descent again to free it.|$|E

NR-1s last mother ship was MV Carolyn Chouest, which provided towing, communications, berthing, and direct mission support for all NR-1 operations—a versatile platform and an indispensable member of the NR-1 deep submergence team. NR-1 command was manned with thirty-five Navy personnel and ten civilian contractor personnel. NR-1 carried as many as thirteen persons (crew and specialists) at one time, including three of the four assigned officers. (The operations officer rode on Carolyn Chouest). All personnel who crewed NR-1 were nuclear-trained and specifically screened and interviewed by the Director, Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program.|$|E

Siegel gave the album a B+ rating. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand wrote that [...] "instead of finding a comfortable middle ground, there's more {{of a sense of}} tension to the proceedings, the vocal hooks lulling you, only to have electronic noise jolt you awake", further referring to Tender Buttons as [...] "rewarding and their boldest album to date." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the whole, the {{impression}} was favourable. Old Shimbah, the Linguister at Porto da Lenha, and other natives had {{assured me that}} the Cataracts were taller than the tallest trees.

The river here sweeps round from the north-west, and bends with a sharp elbow first to the south-west {{and then to the}} south- east, the length of the latter reach being between four and five miles. As {{far as the eye can}} see, the bed, which narrows from 900 to 400 and 500 yards, is broken by rocks and reefs. A gate at the upper end pours over its lintel a clear but dwarf fall, perhaps two feet high.

The strata are disposed at angles, varying from 35° to 45°, and three streaks of bright trees denote Fiumaras about to be filled.

6000|$|... § XLIX. Of {{the simple}} {{sarcophagus}} tomb {{there are many}} exquisite examples both at Venice and Verona; the most interesting in Venice are those which are set in the recesses of the rude brick front of the Church of St. John and Paul, ornamented only, for the most part, with two crosses set in circles, and the legend {{with the name of}} the dead, and an [...] "Orate pro anima" [...] in another circle in the centre. And in this we may note one great proof of superiority in Italian over English tombs; the latter being often enriched with quatrefoils, small shafts, and arches, and other ordinary architectural decorations, which destroy their seriousness and solemnity, render them little more than ornamental, and have no religious meaning whatever; while the Italian sarcophagi are kept massive, smooth, and gloomy,--heavy-lidded dungeons of stone, like rock-tombs,--but bearing on their <b>surface,</b> sculptured with <b>tender</b> and narrow lines, the emblem of the cross, not presumptuously nor proudly, but dimly graven upon their granite, like the hope which the human heart holds, but hardly perceives in its heaviness.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice {{could not}} refuse this, {{and he talked}} pleasantly about Allenwood matters until he left her. She went on alone in a {{thoughtful}} mood. She wished that Brand had not made his offer, because she knew that her refusal had been a blow, {{and she did not}} like to think that she had wounded him. Moreover, his quiet persistence might still prove troublesome. Perhaps it was unfortunate that she could not return his affection; for Brand had many good qualities, and her father approved of him. Then, with a thrill of perplexing emotion, she thought of Harding. In some respects, he was too practical and matter-of-fact; but she knew that his character had another side. While he worked and planned, he had dreams of a splendid future which she thought would be realized. He was a visionary as well as a man of affairs; virile, daring, and beneath the <b>surface</b> generous and <b>tender.</b> It was curious how she knew so much about him, yet she felt that she was right.|$|R
40|$|A 22 -year-old {{student was}} {{admitted}} to our hospital because of the chief complaint of painless mass of the right scrotal content on August 26, 1977. There was neither history of antecedent trauma nor fever. A thumb-head-sized, hard, rough <b>surfaced</b> and no <b>tender</b> mass was palpated on the spermatic cord near the head of right epididymis. The right testis and epididymis were almost normal. A bone and chest X-ray, excretory urogram and laboratory findings were normal. On August 31, radical orchiectomy was performed. The tumor was 3. 0 × 4. 7 × 2. 0 cm in size and 12 gm in weight. The tumor {{was able to be}} isolated from both testis and epididymis, and then it seemed to have arisen from the right testicular tunics. The histopathological diagnosis was made as mixed type of pleomorphic and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient received chemotherapy with Endoxan but no radiation therapy. He is living without metastasis during four months after the operation. Including our case, 54 cases of the paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma {{have been reported in the}} Japanese literatures. The diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic problems were discussed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|This {{method of}} typographic {{engraving}} {{was brought to}} a practical form and patented in 1860 by an American wood engraver, Mr. de Witt Clinton Hitchcock. The first step in his process is to reduce French chalk or talc to an extremely fine state of division by repeated grindings, elutriations, and siftings. After this is complete, a layer of the material (over an eighth of an inch in thickness) is forced down upon and made to adhere to a thick zinc plate, the necessary pressure being obtained {{by means of an}} hydraulic press, the platen of which is faced with a polished steel plate, so as to communicate a good surface to the layer of compressed French chalk. The device is now drawn reversed on the prepared block with an ink consisting of a weak solution of glue colored by lamp black or some other pigment. In drawing on the prepared block, care must be taken not to damage the somewhat <b>tender</b> <b>surface</b> of the compressed chalk and the safest instrument with which to apply the glutinous ink is a fine sable brush, but an ordinary pen may be employed if the operation of drawing is performed with caution. A pad of silk velvet or a fitch brush may be used for rubbing the block so as to leave the lines in relief, and it is quite sufficient to continue the friction until a depth equal to the thickness of an ordinary playing card is produced, the spaces corresponding to any extended whites of the engraving being then cut out by means of a tool. A 10% solution of sodium silicate may be used for hardening the block and, when dry, nothing remains but to take a mould from it and to reproduce it in metal.|$|R
40|$|ELKRATOSIS palmaris et plantaris (tylosis) {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be an inherited disability of a comparatively trivial kind. That it sometimes may have a sinister significance is shown by this study of two Liverpool familiea with tylosis, in which 18 members have developed carcinoma of the oesophagus. A preliminary letter on the subject has already appeared in the British Medical Journal (Clarke, Howel-Evans, and McConnell, 1957). Tyloais 1. General features. Tylosis is one of many forms of dyskeratosis which have been well classified by Cockayne (1933). Its most conspicuous feature is great thickening of the skin of the palms and soles, and hyperhidrosisis also commonly present. Rarely the condition is confined to the soles. Microscopically there is general hypertrophy of all the layers of the skin, the epidermis being chiefly affected; in addition there is hypertrophy of the sweat glands and their ducts (Cockayne, 1933). In many patients with the abnormality the horny epidermis is shed at intervals in large flakes, or as a complete cast of the palm or sole, and this takes place as a rule every autumn; it leaves a red, <b>tender</b> <b>surface,</b> which soon becomes overgrown again with thick epidermis (Cockayne, 1933). 2. Associated abnormalities are rare. Cockayne (1933) quoted Hanhart, who described a Swiss family, the affected members of which developed tylosis at the age of 15 years and multiple lipomata at the age of 22. Cockayne com-mented that the late age at which the tylosis appeared made it doubtful whether it was the ordinary form of the disease. Many other abnormalities have been described in association with tylosis in isolated patients, but genetic linkage was not demonstrated in any of these cases. We have found no reports in the literature of an association between tylosis and mn. lignA. nt disease of other parts of the body, although Sequeira, Ingram, and Brain (1947) mentioned a case in which epitheliomatous change occurred in the skin of a tylotic patient's hand. ...|$|R
