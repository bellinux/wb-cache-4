5|$|Unconscious <b>self-regulation</b> {{has been}} found to {{increase}} under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious <b>self-regulation</b> it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency. Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley {{opened a}} probe into the {{finances}} of six televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Creflo Dollar Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, Bishop Eddie Long Ministries, Joyce Meyer Ministries, and Paula White Ministries. In January 2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating {{that he believed}} <b>self-regulation</b> by religious organizations was preferable to government action. Only the ministries led by Meyer and Hinn cooperated with Grassley's investigation.|$|E
5|$|Heins recounts how the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{advocated}} for its associated organizations to add Parental Advisory warnings on labels of music albums {{as a way}} to advise parents about possible offensive content. She describes how the Parents Music Resource Center, co-founded by Tipper Gore, and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, which included Senator Al Gore, led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins suggests that this subsequently led to the industry's <b>self-regulation,</b> which the author sees as self-censorship, and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores.|$|E
5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann {{recommend}} that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest {{it may be useful}} to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, <b>self-regulation,</b> and defensiveness.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of <b>self-regulation</b> when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of <b>self-regulation,</b> self-control and emotional competency.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{chapters}} of the book cover the origins {{and implementation of the}} school, and other topics in childrearing. Summerhill, founded in the 1920s, is run as a children's democracy under Neill's educational philosophy of <b>self-regulation,</b> where kids choose whether to go to lessons and how they want to live freely without imposing on others. The school makes its rules at a weekly schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote alike. Neill discarded other pedagogies for one of the innate goodness of the child.|$|E
5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in <b>self-regulation</b> and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{degree of}} <b>self-regulation</b> occurs whereby {{banks and other}} {{financial}} institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E

25|$|For major mining {{companies}} and any company seeking international financing, {{there are a}} number of other mechanisms to enforce good environmental standards. These generally relate to financing standards such as the Equator Principles, IFC environmental standards, and criteria for Socially responsible investing. Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of industry <b>self-regulation.</b> In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for <b>self-regulation</b> instead.|$|E
25|$|Emotional self-regulation: The {{ability to}} respond to the ongoing demands of {{experience}} with the range of emotions {{in a manner that is}} socially tolerable.

25|$|Unlike the RTÃ‰ Authority, the RTÃ‰ Board has not the self-regulatory {{function}} over RTÃ‰, as {{this was}} transferred to a newly appointed Broadcasting Authority of Ireland that replaces the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland regulating commercial TV and radio.

25|$|Laser-assisted NPDS is {{performed}} {{with the use of}} a CO2 laser system. The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This <b>self-regulation</b> effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.|$|E
25|$|Campbell and Foster (2007) {{argue that}} self-regulatory {{strategies}} are {{of paramount importance}} to understanding narcissism. <b>Self-regulation</b> in narcissists involves such things as striving to make one's self look and feel positive, special, successful and important. It comes in both intra-psychic, such as blaming a situation rather than self for failure, and interpersonal forms, such as using a relationship to serve one's own self. Some differences in <b>self-regulation</b> between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder, Sedikides & Elliot (2000) who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative self-enhancement strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy similarly; however, narcissists {{were found to be}} more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.|$|E
25|$|Publishing trade {{organizations}} allowed publishers {{to organize}} business concerns collectively. These arrangements included systems of <b>self-regulation.</b> For example, if one publisher {{did something to}} irritate other publishers he would be controlled by peer pressure. Such systems are known as cartels, and are in most countries now considered to be in restraint of trade. These arrangements helped deal with labour unrest among journeymen, who faced difficult working conditions. Brotherhoods predated unions, without the formal regulations now associated with unions.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}} is {{the branch of}} psychology concerned with {{the scientific study of}} human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, <b>self-regulation,</b> and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.|$|E
25|$|After premonitions {{for example}} {{in the work of}} the Portuguese {{pharmacologist}} Serafim GuimarÃ£es, Î±-adrenoceptor subclassification came in 1971 with the discovery of the <b>self-regulation</b> of noradrenaline release through Î±-adrenoceptors on noradrenergic synaptic terminals, presynaptic Î±-autoreceptors. Their existence was initially combated but is now established, for example by the demonstration of their messenger RNA in noradrenergic neurones.-adrenoceptors |journal =Journal of Neurochemistry |volume = 78|issue =4 |pages = 685â€“693| doi =10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00484.x}} They differed from Î±-receptors on effector cells and in 1974 became the prototype Î±2-receptors, the long-known smooth muscle contraction-mediating receptors becoming Î±1.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} {{rejected}} the suggestion to allow solicitors rights of {{audience in the}} High Court The report concluded {{that the practice of}} law was a profession, and that a profession had to be independent of government, because without independence the interests of a client cannot be a primary consideration. It did not challenge the existing professional <b>self-regulation</b> through organisations such as the Law Society and Bar Council. The Commission did recommend an examination of the court and legal procedures to see if time and money could be saved for the parties involved.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, {{some have argued}} that the unique metacognitive {{capabilities}} demonstrated by humans have arisen out of the development of a sophisticated language (symbolization) systems and culture. Moreover, in a developmental context, it has been proposed that each executive function capability originated as a form of public behaviour directed at the external environment, but then became self-directed, and then finally, became private to the individual, {{over the course of the}} development of <b>self-regulation.</b> These shifts in function illustrate the evolutionarily salient strategy of maximizing longer-term social consequences over near-term ones, through the development of an internal control of behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{psychology}} of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences {{in the organization of}} cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing how students differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and <b>self-regulation,</b> and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable the teacher to cater for the needs of the different students so that no one is left behind.|$|E
25|$|Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC) {{is the use}} of {{technology}} (usually high tech) to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention, memory, <b>self-regulation,</b> navigation, emotion recognition and management, planning, and sequencing activity. Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC. Examples of ATC include: NeuroPage which prompts users about meetings, Wakamaru, which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong, and telephone Reassurance systems.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} has suggested {{a link between}} a child's abilities to gain information about {{the world around them}} and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately. One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function. The tests included assessments of: executive functions (<b>self-regulation,</b> monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of Theory of Mind in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>self-regulation</b> by {{all state}} and non-state actors seems hard to achieve, {{measures}} to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been {{proposed in the}} area of international cooperation. International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level. This could help coordinate efforts for arms control. International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA) or general arms control may also be designed. One may also jointly make differential technological progress on defensive technologies, a policy that players should usually favour. The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggest some technical restrictions. Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.|$|E
25|$|Fukasaku {{originally}} {{opposed the}} R15 rating {{given by the}} Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai (Eirin) because of Fukasaku's experiences as a teenager, the novel's use of 15-year-olds, {{and the fact that}} many of the actors were around fifteen years of age. After he submitted an appeal and before Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai could rule on the appeal, members of the Diet of Japan said that the film harmed teenagers; the Diet members also criticised the film industry ratings, which were a part of <b>self-regulation</b> by the Japanese film industry. Fukasaku dropped the appeal to appease the Japanese Diet in hopes they would not pursue increasing film regulation further.|$|E
25|$|In human studies, testosterone-aggression {{research}} has also focused {{on the role of}} the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This brain area is strongly associated with impulse control and <b>self-regulation</b> systems that integrate emotion, motivation, and cognition to guide context-appropriate behavior. Patients with localized lesions to the OFC engage in heightened reactive aggression. Aggressive behavior may be regulated by testosterone via reduced medial OFC engagement following social provocation. When measuring participants' salivary testosterone, higher levels can predict subsequent aggressive behavioral reactions to unfairness faced during a task. Moreover, brain scanning with fMRI shows reduced activity in the medial OFC during such reactions. Such findings may suggest that a specific brain region, the OFC, is a key factor in understanding reactive aggression.|$|E
25|$|Research on 'protective factors', {{which are}} {{characteristics}} of children or situations that particularly help {{children in the}} context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive <b>self-regulation</b> and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents). Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of friendship in children {{tends to be}} more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations. These friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing <b>self-regulation.</b> Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.|$|E
25|$|Although ADHD has {{typically}} been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it {{has also}} been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits. Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize the problem at perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output). Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional <b>self-regulation.</b> Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental and the result of atypically operating executive systems.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 2007, Burger King {{announced}} that it was joining the Council of Better Business Bureaus Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative. The program, a voluntary <b>self-regulation</b> program designed to adjust advertising messages aimed at children so that they encourage healthy eating habits and lifestyles. As part of this new initiative, Burger King stated that it would restrict its advertising aimed at children under 12 that uses third-party licensed characters to Kids Meals that meet its nutrition guidelines, refrain from advertising in elementary schools and refrain from product placement in media primarily aimed at children under 12, promote Kids Meals that meet its nutrition guidelines and promote healthy lifestyles and healthy dietary choices in its advertising. Several groups, including the CSPI, lauded the move as guarded good news.|$|E
25|$|Andreas Demetriou {{suggests}} that theories which overemphasize {{the autonomy of}} the domains are as simplistic as the theories that overemphasize the role of general intelligence and ignore the domains. He agrees with Gardner that there are indeed domains of intelligence that are relevantly autonomous of each other. Some of the domains, such as verbal, spatial, mathematical, and social intelligence are identified by most lines of research in psychology. In Demetriou's theory, one of the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, Gardner is criticized for underestimating the effects exerted on the various domains of intelligences by the various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency, such as speed of processing, executive functions, working memory, and meta-cognitive processes underlying self-awareness and <b>self-regulation.</b> All of these processes are integral components of general intelligence that regulate the functioning and development of different domains of intelligence.|$|E
