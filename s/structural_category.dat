40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{for a given}} space X, a <b>structural</b> <b>category</b> C, and a {{faithful}} functor η from C to the category of spaces, we introduce a notion of (C, η) -bundle which contains as particular cases, the notions of covering space, of overlaying space (introduced by Fox), of suspension foliation and other well-known topological structures. The new notion allows us to use sheaf theory and category theory {{in order to obtain}} some classification theorems which appear in terms of equivalences of categories. We prove that the category (C, η) -bundle(X) of (C, η) -bundles over X is equivalent to the category pro(πCX, C), which is determined by the fundamental groupoid of X and the <b>structural</b> <b>category</b> C. As particular cases we obtain the standard classification of covering spaces, Fox's classification theorem for overlays with a finite number of leaves and the standard classification of suspension foliations. This paper illustrates the importance of the fundamental progroupoid of a space X, which plays in shape theory the role of the standard fundamental groupoid. If the space X satisfies some additional properties, the progroupoid πCX can be reduced to a surjective progroup, a groupoid or a group. In some cases a surjective progroupoid can be replaced by a topological prodiscrete group. In all these cases the category pro(πCX, C) also reduces to well-known categories...|$|E

40|$|The central {{question}} {{of this paper}} is whether contrastive focus constitutes a proper information <b>structural</b> <b>category</b> on its own or is a property of particular contexts which is not bi-uniquely identified with a particular linguistic form (see Horvath, 2008; Zimmermann, 2007). Looking at the syntactic reflexes of information structure, contrastive focus has been analyzed as associated with particular forms especially for languages that display focus movement (see, e. g., Rumanian in Kiss, 1998, Finnish and Hungarian in Vallduví and Vilkuna, 1998, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Greek, etc. in Molnár, 20022). These languages display an opposition between an in situ and an ex situ realization of the focused constituent. This formal opposition is assumed to correlate with the difference between two different types of focus: ex situ focus is expected to be contrastive or exhaustive, while in situ focus is expected to be new information focus (see Drubig, 2003; Kiss, 1998). In this paper, we examine the question of form-to-...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{significant}} shortcomings of the criminological canon, including its critical strands – feminist, cultural and green – has been its urbancentric bias. In this theoretical model, rural communities are idealised as conforming to the typical small-scale traditional societies based on cohesive organic forms of solidarity and close density acquaintance networks. This article challenges the myth that rural communities are relatively crime free places of ‘moral virtue’ with {{no need for a}} closer scrutiny of rural context, rural places, and rural peoples about crime and other social problems. This challenge is likewise woven into the conceptual and empirical narratives of the other articles in this Special Edition, which we argue constitute an important body of innovative work, not just for reinvigorating debates in rural criminology, but also critical criminology. For without a critical perspective of place, the realities of context are too easily overlooked. A new criminology of crime and place will help keep both critical criminology and rural criminology firmly anchored in the sociological and the criminological imagination. We argue that intersectionality, a framework that resists privileging any particular social <b>structural</b> <b>category</b> of analysis, but is cognisant of the power effects of colonialism, class, race and gender, can provide the theoretical scaffolding to further develop such a project...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} intonation of West Greenlandic, a language from the Inuit {{branch of the}} Eskimo-Aleut language family. More specifically, it concentrates {{on the question of}} focus realisation by means of intonation. Analysing this aspect of West Greenlandic grammar presents two main interests: It closes a gap in the existing research on this language and it contributes to the development of theories modelling intonation in general and the role of intonation in the expression of information structural categories in particular. Concerning the first objective, previous work on West Greenlandic has primarily concentrated on the complex morphological or syntactic properties of this language. There are a few preliminary studies of intonation in West Greenlandic, though none of them considers the effect of focus or any other information <b>structural</b> <b>category.</b> From the theoretical point of view, the study of this language, which differs substantially from the well-studied European languages, is extremely interesting: West Greenlandic does not have any stress or accent and is thus one of those languages that Jun classifies as “non-stress and non-lexical pitch-accent languages ” [1 : 445].

How gender matters can be briefly illustrated by one of the topics GARNET’s group on Gender in International Political Economy is dealing with: The commodification and privatisation of public services, a process that has gathered speed since the establishment of the WTO. This process is highly contested, and will have considerable impacts on gender relations. In the short run, privatization shifts the public-private balance through cutbacks in state expenditure thus changing the relation of exchange entitlements. In the long run, privatization of public assets leads to changing resource entitlements. From a gender perspective one question is how the commodification/privatization of public services is linked to the liberalization of trade and investment in services covered in the GATS, and the reconfiguration of gender relations in different regions of the world.

These densities are investigated by alternative distance measures and also at the interface of multiunit structures. Amino acids are divided into nine <b>structural</b> <b>categories</b> according to three secondary structure states and three solvent accessibility levels. To take account of amino acid abundance differences across protein structures, we normalize the observed density by the expected density defining a density index. Solvent accessibility levels exert the predominant influence in determinations of the regular residue density. Explicitly, the regular density values vary approximately linearly with respect to solvent accessibility levels, the linearity parameters depending on the amino acid. The charge index reveals pronounced inequalities between lysine and arginine in their interactions with acidic residues. The aromatic density calculations in all <b>structural</b> <b>categories</b> parallel the regular density calculations, indicating that the aromatic residues are distributed as {{a random sample of}} all residues. Moreover, aromatic residues are found to be over-represented in the neighborhood of all amino acids.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} the topic Professional Discretion in the Social Services. The {{starting}} point is the experience that a social security officer is exposed to many and partly contradictory expectations and requirements. The thesis is based on review and analysis of relevant literature. This approach has its basis {{in the fact that}} there is a lack of theory on the subject Professional Discretion and I have aimed at gathering available knowledge on the topic. The problem of the Thesis was formulated as follows: How can one explain the content in the practice of professional discretion of the social security service in a perspective which recognizes that the social security worker shall safeguard different and partly contradictory expectations and requirements? My scientifically and theoretically approach is hermeneutic. There are two ways to look upon professional discretion which are important to distinguish between. Professional discretion can be looked upon as an epistemic category and as a <b>structural</b> <b>category.</b> Professional discretion as epistemic category is about how one as a social security officer can understand another person and know something about what is good, right or appropriate for him or her. In the paper I point to the fact that this does not have to be described as tacit knowledge, empathy, intuition, or similar, but that professional discretion as epistemic category can be looked upon as a form of practical reasoning. Professional discretion as <b>structural</b> <b>category</b> {{deals with the}} laws, guidelines, rules, procedures etc. that govern the professional discretion of the social security officer, and I have discussed the influence of these limits on the professional discretion of the social security officer. My findings show that: Professional discretion shall preserve what is fair and good in the situation. One may say that the task of the professional discretion is to argue humanity into the system, at the same time as it is connected to policy, laws, rules and guidelines. Professional discretion has a place in situations where one is facing several equally good optional actions. Professional discretion must be allowed space. If one is too tightly connected (personally or the workplace) to the standards one may lose the space available which the professional discretion shall move in. What is certain or obvious shall not be made uncertain to include the professional discretion. Judgment, consideration and professional discretion are unlike but act together. The practicing of professional discretion is a form of practical reasoning with weak normative clues. Assessments without normative clues are however not professional discretion but feeling. The title of the thesis, "A Room for Thinking", refers to what I consider to be a very significant discovery: Distance to guidelines and rules, gives a necessary room for thoughts and considerations both for oneself and for the other. One should be connected to one’s knowledge but if the professional discretion shall function one must at the same time have a certain distance to the guidelines, standards and rules which is represented by one’s knowledge. A meeting between people is about giving space for both parties to express oneself and present their considerations. If one is more occupied with arguing one’s own views than with understanding the other, that is an expression of the fact that one has conquered the standards. In that way one may achieve security but the consequence is that the professional discretion becomes homeless. </p...|$|E

Chapter 1 presents the goal {{and scope of}} this dissertation. Chapter 2 discusses word formation in various lexical categories of Korean. As in other languages, words in Korean are formed by derivation and compounding. We demonstrate that nouns and adverbs can be formed by derivation and compounding, that verbs can be formed by derivation and compounding, but involve inflection, and that postpositions can be formed by compounding. Chapter 3 discusses blocking phenomena in Korean. Blocking {{is a kind of}} output filter on word formation. We demonstrate that blocking functions to avoid synonymy or homonymy. Chapter 4 discusses interface phenomena between word formation and syntax. Certain constituents in Korean have the same shape in both the lexicon and the syntax. For example, derived nouns resemble verbal nominalizations, noun compounds resemble phrasal nominalizations, and the verb + noun constructions appear identically as either noun compounds or noun phrases. Although these constructions resemble each other, they differ in certain ways. We explore different properties of these formally identical structures. The verb + verb constructions and the noun + verb constructions are ambiguous in <b>structural</b> <b>category.</b> We explore whether these constructions are words or phrases, and examine what properties they have. Chapter 5 discusses other interface phenomena between word formation and phonology. We explore what environments contraction is formed in and how contraction is formed. In addition, we note several inadequacies of lexical phonology. Chapter 6 summarizes and concludes this dissertation...|$|E

The primary goals were to assess the relationship between a company’s business model(s) and its performance in the online grocery channel and to determine if there were other company and/or market related factors that could account for company performance. ^ To assess the primary goals, a case based theory building process was utilized. A three-way cross-case analysis comprising Peapod, GroceryWorks, and Tesco examined the common profit components, the <b>structural</b> <b>category</b> (e. g., pure-play, partnership, and hybrid) profit components, and the idiosyncratic profit components related to each specific company. ^ Based on the analysis, it was determined that online grocery store business models could be represented at three distinct, but hierarchically, related levels. The first level was termed the core model and represented the basic profit structure that all online grocers needed in order to conduct operations. The next model level was termed the structural model and represented the profit structure associated with the specific business model configuration (i. e., pure-play, partnership, hybrid). The last model level was termed the augmented model and represented the company’s business model when idiosyncratic profit components were included. In relation to the five company related factors, scalability, rate of expansion, and the automation level were potential candidates for helping to explain online grocer performance. In addition, all the market structure related factors were deemed possible candidates for helping to explain online grocer performance. ^ The study concluded by positing an alternative hypothesis concerning the performance of online grocers. Prior to this study, the prevailing wisdom was that the business models were the primary cause of online grocer performance. However, based on the core model analysis, it was hypothesized that the customer relationship activities (i. e., advertising, promotions, and loyalty program tie-ins) were the real drivers of online grocer performance. ...|$|E
