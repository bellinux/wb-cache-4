Lastly, the surplus attained should not be wasted on the conspicuous consumption of the land owners or the state, but should be spent {{on the development of}} industries, infrastructure and thereby prepare for <b>self-sustained</b> <b>growth</b> of the economy later on. Furthermore, agriculture becomes commercialized and mechanized via technological advancement; shifts increasingly towards cash or export-oriented crops; and there is a growth of agricultural entrepreneurship.|$|E

In discussing the take-off, Rostow is noted to have adopted the term [...] "transition", which describes the process of a traditional economy becoming a modern one. After take-off, a country will generally take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach the mature stage according to the model, as occurred in countries that participated in the Industrial Revolution and were established as such when Rostow developed his ideas in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of a tachocline in the Sun has been proven by helioseismology. It is unknown whether a similar shear layer, {{widely regarded as the}} seat of magnetic dynamo action, also exists in a protoneutron star. Sudden jumps in magnetic diffusivity η and turbulent vorticity α, for example at the interface between the neutron-finger and convective zones, are known to be capable of enhancing mean-field dynamo effects in a protoneutron star. Here we apply the well-known, plane-parallel, MacGregor-Charbonneau analysis of the Solar interfacial dynamo to the protoneutron star problem and calculate the growth rate analytically under a range of conditions. It is shown that, like the Solar dynamo, it is impossible to achieve <b>self-sustained</b> <b>growth</b> if the discontinuities in α, η, and shear are coincident and the magnetic diffusivity is isotropic. In contrast, when the jumps in η and α are situated away from the shear layer, <b>self-sustained</b> <b>growth</b> is possible for P≲ 49. 8 ms (if the velocity shear is located at 0. 3 R) or P≲ 83. 6 ms (if the velocity shear is located at 0. 6 R). This translates into stronger shear and/or α-effect than in the Sun. <b>Self-sustained</b> <b>growth</b> is also possible if the magnetic diffusivity if anisotropic, through the Ω×J effect, even when the α, η, and shear discontinuities are coincident.

40|$|This paper evaluates Solow's neoclassical growth {{model and}} related {{empirical}} {{estimates of the}} sources of growth. Invoking Allyn Young, it is argued that the fundamental sources of growth cannot be measured by the value of factor inputs (including research inputs) without reference to the overall growth of product demand in the economy that both induces and limits increased specialization. What is attributed to the factors-the value of their marginal products-is not a measure of their contribution. Integration does not give the social picture. Young's theory of macroeconomic increasing returns reveals the limitations of models that assume an aggregate production function exhibiting constant returns to scale while "augmented" by exogenous technical progress. His endogenously <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>growth</b> paradigm is also shown to differ in important respects (including in its policy implications) from modern endogenous growth theory...|$|R

40|$|A {{pervasive}} empirical finding for the US {{economy is}} that inflation is {{negatively correlated with}} the normalized market price of capital (Tobin's q) and growth. A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of endogenous growth is developed to explain these stylized facts. In this model, human capital is the principal driver of <b>self-sustained</b> <b>growth.</b> Long run comparative statics analysis suggests that inflation diverts scarce time resource to leisure which lowers human capital utilization. This impacts growth adversely and modulates cap¬ital adjustment cost downward resulting in a decline in Tobin's q. For the short run, a Tobin effect of inflation on growth weakens the negative association between inflation and q. ...|$|E

Just like in developed economies, there is strong evidence that cities in developing countries bolster productive efficiency.

These findings imply that the traditional agenda of aiming to raise within-city efficiency should be continued. Furthermore, reducing the obstacles to the reallocation of factors and activities, and more generally promoting the movement of human capital and goods across cities may have significant positive dynamic effects as well static ones.

Using panel data over the period 1983 - 2004 for a sample of 16 countries, we test the convergence's hypothesis by the Bayesian iterative estimation method; a technological variable is introduced to control the differences in steady-state. Our empirical results validate the effect of expenditure in R&D in the catching-up process. Consequently, a decrease in these investments would be detrimental to growth...|$|E
