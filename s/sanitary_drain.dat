40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a process to}} treat cooling tower water {{by means of a}} fully automated and chemical free mechanical water treatment process. This is an alternative to conventional chemical treatment. Beginning with a suction pump to draw water out of the tower sump, water goes through a permanent magnetic descaler to increase the water solubility and begin the scale inhibition process. This also descales existing scale build-up in the system. Ozone is manufactured from ambient air and injected into the bypass system through a venturi type injector. This kills algae, slime and bacteria and enhances the magnetic descaling process. The final stage filter separates solids from the water to prevent corrosion from impingement. These solids are automatically purged to the <b>sanitary</b> <b>drain.</b> Clarified water is returned to the sump where the process repeats on a 10 %- 20 % by volume side stream basis...|$|E
40|$|D. C. The {{investigation}} {{was performed in}} response to a request from NAPO staff regarding concerns of health hazards relating to water damage from an uncapped sewage pipe above the NAPO area. The request stated that contractors had removed a section of <b>sanitary</b> <b>drain</b> pipe, which resulted in an overflow of water into the ceiling plenum and the collapse of the ceiling. According to the request, carpeting and building furnishings were contaminated with sewage and a health hazard was believed to exist. Repairs were initiated before the NIOSH investigation took place but water damaged building materials and furnishings were still in evidence. A NIOSH physician conducted interviews with affected employees. A walkthrough survey of the NAPO and the adjoining Corridor G area was conducted, and the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system was evaluated. Bulk samples for microbial analysis were collected from areas within the HVAC system. Anderson cascade impactors were used to sample for bioaerosols in occupied areas of the NAPO and in areas outside of the building. Results of air sampling for bacteria revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} i...|$|E
40|$|In {{almost all}} modern {{buildings}} today, HVAC equipment {{is used to}} provide a conditioned indoor environment while using large amounts of energy to cool, filter, and dehumidify the air in these structures. This {{is especially true for}} buildings located in hot and humid climates around the world. International engineering organizations, such as ASHRAE, have developed indoor air quality standards which stipulate substantial requirements for fresh outside air to be introduced into a building?s air conditioning system. Internal loads and additional outside ventilation air all generate considerable latent loads on these systems and exacerbate the already difficult moisture control problem. A manifestation of this load is the liquid water condensate that is typically drained away from the air conditioning equipment and routed to the nearest <b>sanitary</b> <b>drain.</b> This project investigated sustainability issues associated with the collection and storage of this condensate water from selected air conditioning equipment for an institutional building located on the Education City Campus in Doha, Qatar. Simplified modeling of the condensation potential from the existing air conditioning systems, means for tapping into existing condensate drainage systems for re-routing to a storage facility, metering of collected condensate water, and potential impact for this water capture and re-use technique were studied. This project demonstrated the potential to capture over 6 million liters (1. 6 million gallons) of condensate water each year from the air conditioning systems for this building...|$|E

50|$|A {{pipelayer}} (or pipe-layer or pipe layer) is {{a skilled}} tradesman who lays pipe, such as for storm sewers, <b>sanitary</b> sewers, <b>drains,</b> and water mains. Pipelayers may grade (i.e., level) trenches and culverts, position pipe, or seal joints. The Standard Occupational Classification System code for pipelayers is 47-2151.|$|R
40|$|This {{reference}} contains {{guidance for}} responding to a mercury spill, and how to recycle mercury bearing products. This document also contains specific recommendations for the following types of products: batteries, fluorescent lights, high intensity discharge lamps (HID) lamps, ballasts, thermostats, switches, float switches, sump pumps, silent light switches, washing machines, tilt switches, freezers, flow meters, manometers, barometers, vacuum gauges, flame sensors on gas appliances, rubber flooring containing mercury, and mercury accumulation in <b>sanitary</b> <b>drains.</b> This reference also contains a general checklist of products found to routinely contain mercury. Mercury is a dangerous element in the environment today. It can cause serious health problems such as neurological and kidney damage. Mercury is found in many products that end up in landfills and incinerators allowing the mercury to re-enter the environment and pollute drinking water and contaminate the food chain. The following information is a helpful guide to identify products that contain mercury switches and thermostats. This guide describes where mercury switches and thermostats are located and how to remove and dispose of these properly. Mercury bearing articles should not be thrown in the trash, and serious care should be taken when dealing with this element. Safe Disposal â€¢ Store mercury thermostats and switches in a suitable sturdy, sealed container. A five gallon plastic bucket with a lid may work...|$|R

50|$|The use of {{asbestos}} to manufacture transite was phased out in the 1980s. Previously transite was made of cement, with varying amounts (12-50%) {{of asbestos}} fiber to provide tensile strength (similar to the steel in reinforced concrete), and other materials. It was frequently used for such purposes as furnace flues, roof shingles, siding, soffit and fascia panels, and wallboard for areas where fire retardancy is particularly important. It was also used in walk-in coolers made in large supermarkets in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Other uses included roof drain piping, water piping, <b>sanitary</b> sewer <b>drain</b> piping, laboratory fume hood panels, ceiling tiles, landscape edging, and HVAC ducts. Because cutting, breaking, and machining asbestos-containing transite releases carcinogenic asbestos fibers into the air, its use has fallen out of favor. Despite asbestos-containing transite being phased out, {{it is still not}} banned in the United States; some 230,000 deaths have been attributed to it. Demolition of older buildings containing transite materials, particularly siding made from transite requires special precautions and disposal techniques to protect workers and the public. Finding and safely handling asbestos-containing transite is dangerous and difficult and should only be done by an asbestos abatement professional.|$|R
25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave {{was followed by}} a cascade of water into the well deck amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray, and water entered living spaces through hatches opened to access ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation dripped from the overheads. The head (or <b>sanitary</b> toilet) was <b>drained</b> by a straight pipe to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any dark place that offered a little warmth. The inability to store perishable food meant a reliance on preserved food such as corned-beef and powdered potato for all meals.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Metro Wastewater Reclamation District has {{completed}} an approach for their five-year program {{to assess the}} condition of all utilities located at their Central Treatment Plant. Over 260 utilities including diffused air, centrate, drains, sludge, effluent and influent wastewater, grit, hot water, service water, natural gas, potable water, <b>sanitary</b> sewer, storm <b>drain,</b> process fluid, waste oil, and well water pipes will be inspected and rehabilitated over a five-year period. Inspection technologies will include proven approaches such as closed-circuit television inspection, ground-penetrating radar, core sampling, visual inspections, and pipe-to-soil potential surveys, but may also include emerging technologies such as acoustic monitoring, non-destructive testing of insulated pipe, impact echo testing, and others. A criticality evaluation to set inspection priorities, existing and emerging inspecting technologies that {{could be applied to}} pipes within the project area were reviewed, evaluation criteria established, and potential rehabilitation technologies assessed as part of the approach for the five-year program. The program will also establish standards to be used for the inspections during the preliminary design phase. By establishing an approach {{at the start of the}} project, before any inspection work is undertaken, the District will be able to select technology-specific contractors and ensure that data is collected and evaluated on a consistent basis for this work and in the future. This paper provides a summary of the various activities undertaken to develop the five-year program and demonstrates the various project tools utilized to complete the plan such as decision support tools and flow charts...|$|R
