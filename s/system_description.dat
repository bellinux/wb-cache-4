25|$|In {{order to}} deliver the {{developed}} product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and software components at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the software vendor will carefully have to check if the package is complete. The package will have to provide the customer with all the tools and information to use the product. When {{this is not the}} case the software vendor will get a lot of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore very important that the package is checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: software package, <b>system</b> <b>description,</b> manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.|$|E
25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, <b>system</b> <b>description,</b> manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E

40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} {{is an important}} task in technical domains. In the model [...] based diagnosis literature it has mostly been assumed that technical systems are described by complete, deterministic <b>system</b> <b>descriptions.</b> We show that intuitive <b>descriptions</b> of technical <b>systems</b> are often incomplete, {{and need to be}} completed for providing correct diagnoses. Due to the structure of the axioms of such <b>system</b> <b>descriptions</b> completion is not straightforward, because predicate completion is not applicable and circumscription does not yield first order sentences. We introduce an algorithm which reduces the <b>system</b> <b>descriptions</b> to propositional representations which are then completed. Furthermore, we discuss how diagnoses can be computed efficiently for the completed <b>system</b> <b>descriptions.</b> While the original <b>descriptions</b> of the <b>system</b> behaviour usually consist of horn clauses, their completions are typically not horn. We provide formal results, which allow to exploit the structure of the original horn clau [...] ...|$|R

Initially, the BD-RE version 1.0 (BDFS) was specifically developed for recording of digital broadcasts using the Blu-ray Disc application (BDAV application).
