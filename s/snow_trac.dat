50|$|The Swedish made Aktiv <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> {{of which}} {{approximately}} 2265 were manufactured in Sweden between 1957 and 1981. Production of the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> ceased when VW stopped European {{production of the}} engines {{that were used to}} power these vehicles. Additional vehicles were manufactured in Scotland bringing the total to over 2300 units produced. Numerous accounts from Antarctica related successful use of the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> by research organizations such as ANARE in Antarctica. Snow Tracs were used at all major Antarctica research bases by numerous government research bodies and several examples now reside in museums with Antarctic research exhibits.|$|E

50|$|Until {{production}} ceased, <b>Snow</b> <b>Tracs</b> {{competed successfully}} with much larger Tucker Sno-Cats (Medford, Oregon, USA) {{as well as}} Bombardier (Canada). Kristi Snowcats (Colorado and later Washington, USA) were also produced at this time but were not commercially successful and under 200 units were manufactured. Bombardier remains in business manufacturing personal watercraft, ATVs, and jet airplanes, but no longer produces snowcats. Tucker Sno-Cat continues to manufacture snowcats and other specialty vehicles and is widely used in polar regions.|$|R
50|$|With over 50% of the <b>Snow</b> <b>Tracs</b> {{exported}} to North America, <b>Snow</b> <b>Tracs</b> competed successfully with much larger Tucker Sno-Cats (Medford, Oregon, USA) {{as well as}} Bombardier (Canada). Tucker Sno-Cats produced both 2 track and 4 track snowcats in their earlier years but switched to all 4 track production and became a leading vehicle manufacturer for extreme duty conditions. Utah snowcat producer Thiokol of Logan Utah produced {{a wide range of}} snowcats from the small IMP to very large ski trail groomers. During a company restructuring, Thiokol sold its snowcat operation in 1978 to John DeLorean, and the name was changed to DMC. DMC later was bought out by its management team and renamed LMC. LMC ceased production in 2000. Thiokol's Imp, Super-Imp and Spryte were most its popular products were continued, in improved versions, by DMC and LMC. Many of these models are still in use today in the commercial market and are popular with as privately owned snowcats. Bombardier of Canada built very popular B12 and C18 Snow coaches, with over 3000 units produced. These units were fast and held up to 18 passengers, but were not suitable for mountain use. Bombardier remains in business manufacturing snowmobiles, personal watercraft, ATVs, and jet airplanes, but no longer produces snowcats. Tucker Sno-Cat continues to manufacture snowcats and other specialty vehicles and is widely used in polar regions.|$|R

50|$|Aktiv <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> ceased {{assembly}} in 1982 when its engine supplier (Volkswagen) ceased production of its air-cooled engines in Europe. Over 1000 Snow Tracs were imported to Canada and the USA, mostly by Canadian utilities and U.S. governmental agencies; the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> {{is still in}} common use in private ownership {{and to a lesser}} degree in commerce having produced over 2200 total machines which saw popular use all over the globe.|$|E
50|$|Matchbox also {{produced}} {{a very limited}} run of cardboard puzzles featuring agricultural equipment and vehicles, one such puzzle featured the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac.</b>|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers include Formatic, Kässbohrer Geländefahrzeug, Prinoth, Ratrak, Logan Machine Company, Tucker Sno-Cat, <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac,</b> Thiokol, the Ohara Corporation (Japan) and Aztec, SAS (France).|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, a toy {{maker in}} Melbourne, Australia, {{produced}} a snap together model kit of the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac.</b> The company, ROSENHAIN & LIPMANN, more {{commonly referred to}} as R&L, specialised in the manufacture of cereal premiums. The <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> was part of their [...] "Polar Base" [...] series that took inspiration from the ANARE activities in Antarctica. The toys were issued as a free cereal premium inside boxes of cereal in Australia by the Kellogg Company. They may have also been issued as a cereal premium in the USA. They were produced in at least five colours and built up into a model 45 mm in length. In 1975, R&L produced a large order of toys for use by Aurora in the USA. The Snap-A-Roos series by Aurora, included an [...] "Antarctic Explorers" [...] box set that contained the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> model.|$|E
50|$|The Bv 202 {{was used}} by NATO forces, and {{replaced}} the older Swedish <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> ST4 Over-snow Vehicle, which was employed by the British Royal Marines under NATO.|$|E
5000|$|So {{popular and}} unique was the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> that {{a line of}} toys from Matchbox was introduced. Lesney MATCHBOX of England made 3 {{different}} versions of the Aktiv Fischer <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> ST4. All were very similar in appearance, 2 of them used the same molds. All of the Matchbox toys are modeled after the 2 large wheel Aktiv Snow Trac; this version has 2 large rubber tires, one at the rear, and the third about 24" [...] aft of the drive sprocket. Lesney designated their toy #35 in the Matchbox series.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "snowcat" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} 1946 trademark by Tucker Sno-Cat Corporation. This specialized over-snow vehicle dominated the snow transportation market until the 1960s when other manufacturers entered the business. By then [...] "snowcat" [...] {{was such a}} common description that {{it was used to}} describe all over-snow vehicles (see generic trademark). Tucker is also well known for its use of four tracks on its vehicles. Tucker Sno-Cat is arguably the best known of the early manufacturers and remains in business today. Tucker Sno-Cats have been used by numerous military, governmental agencies and utilities. Another early model was the Swedish made Aktiv <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> of which 2265 were manufactured in Sweden between 1957 and 1981. NATO forces used the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> successfully during the cold war between NATO and the USSR. Numerous accounts from Antarctica related successful use of the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> by research organizations such as A.N.A.R.E. in Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|During the Cold War era, NATO and British Royal Marine forces {{used the}} Swedish made <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> as a carrier for the L6 Wombat in the snow-covered {{mountains}} of Norway.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the common}} use of Volkswagen engines, {{transmissions}} and other critical parts, the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> {{is still a very}} popular vehicle with many 30- to 40-year-old vehicles being used daily during the winter months. <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> vehicles are commonly used as personal vehicles for transport, and often are used for providing tours to tourists in remote areas. The Roughwoods Inn, located in Nenana Alaska, runs a small fleet of Snow Tracs and Snow Masters for tourists in the winter months. The fleet at The Roughwoods Inn is probably the largest fleet in ownership today. Other resorts and hotels also use Snow Tracs and other model snowcats to provide tours of remote snowbound areas.|$|E
50|$|KRISTI snowcat had {{a limited}} {{production}} of 2 track snowcats between 1956 and 1968 in Colorado, it {{was purchased by}} a group of Boeing engineers and moved to Washington where it ceased production in the early 1970s with a total production reported to be less than 180 units. Aktiv <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> ceased production in 1982 when its engine supplier (Volkswagen) ceased production of its air-cooled engines in Europe. Of over 2200 Snow Tracs made, over 50% of the Snow Tracs were imported to Canada and the USA, mostly by Canadian utilities and U.S. governmental agencies; the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> is still in common use in private ownership and to a lesser degree in commerce.|$|E
50|$|Other brands that {{competed with}} DMC and LMC {{included}} the Tucker Sno-Cat and Bombardier snowcats. DeLorean sold his shares to an investment group in 1993, {{by that time}} several snowcat brands had ceased operation due to market factors, among them the <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> and Kristi.|$|E
50|$|While Tucker {{is still}} in business, its early {{competitors}} have not fared well {{in the face of}} competition. Other notable players in the North American snowcat market included Thiokol, Bombardier, KRISTI snowcat and Swedish manufacturer Aktiv <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac.</b> All the historic competitors to Tucker Sno-Cat made two-track snowcats.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{competitors}} {{included the}} Aktiv <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> ST4 from Sweden, Thiokol, and Tucker Sno-Cat from the USA. The <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac</b> was produced, virtually unchanged, until 1981, {{but it was}} successful, with over 2,000 units sold, and it was used {{all over the globe}} for exploration and commercial purposes, as well as the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. Tucker Sno-Cat grew {{to become one of the}} world's largest builders of these vehicles, and currently produces a wide range of large commercial and exploration vehicles from its location in Medford, Oregon, USA. Thiokol produced many popular units, notably the Imp, Super Imp, and Spryte models, but changed ownership and name several times before going out of business in 2000 as the Logan Machine Company and manufacturer of the LMC brand.|$|E
50|$|Aktiv {{started making}} tracked {{vehicles}} 1957 {{when they started}} making <b>Snow</b> <b>Trac,</b> a small personal Snowcat that is {{roughly the size of}} a modern compact car. Aktiv started making small snowmobiles in 1973 when they bought Snö-Tric brand. First dual-Trac snowmobile made by Aktiv was Snö-Tric Blå 75- and SC 20/2 75-.|$|E
