25|$|The main {{function}} of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization ensues. There are distinct differences in the brain’s electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep: Low voltage fast burst brain waves (EEG desynchronization) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep. Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized {{and when they are}} in tonic mode it is desynchronized. Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1Hz), delta waves (1–4Hz), and <b>spindle</b> <b>wave</b> oscillations (11–14Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40Hz) oscillations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} from sleep to waking {{is associated with}} the abolition of spindle waves in thalamocortical neurons and the GABAergic cells of the thalamic reticular/perigeniculate nuclei. We tested the possibility that norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5 -HT) may abolish <b>spindle</b> <b>wave</b> generation through an enhancement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih in thalamocortical neurons. Local application of agents known to enhance Ih, including 5 -HT, NE, the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, and the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to lamina A 1 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus resulted in an abolition of local <b>spindle</b> <b>wave</b> generation in thalamocortical neurons. The abolition of spindle waves was reversed by the local application of the Ih channel blocker, cesium. These results suggest that NE and 5 -HT may abolish the generation of spindle waves through the modulation of Ih in thalamocortical neurons...|$|E

The comparison between the spontaneous optical signals and the neuronal activities recorded from the local cortex showed a temporal correspondence, implying that the spontaneous optical signal {{is related to the}} local variations resulted from neuronal activities. Two rhythmic components, low frequency oscillation (LFO) and <b>spindle</b> <b>wave,</b> have been demonstrated in cat visual cortex by optical imaging {{of intrinsic}} signals at wavelength of 540 nm. In ipsilateral visual cortex, the LFO is essentially synchronized between areas 17 and 21 a, while for areas 17 and 18 it is in anti-phase. The LFO and <b>spindle</b> <b>wave</b> obtained from contralateral visual areas 17 are out of phase or anti phase for 65 % of the time reckoned. In order to understand the temporal and inter-area parameters of this activity, we compared the oscillatory activity of these visual cortical areas using correlation analysis. The synchrony of activation between areas 17 and 21 a may reflect a synergy of function by which the form of a visual scene in the central field can be analyzed with high resolution. The anti-phase activation between areas 17 and 18, which are assumed to be the neural substrates of form and movement processing respectively, is interpreted as reflection of reciprocal inhibition between the X- and Y- channels. The possible mechanism of the periodic interhemispheric asynchrony revealed by the LFO and <b>spindle</b> <b>wave</b> is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Spindle-like afterdischarges {{evoked by}} {{stimulation}} of ventrolateral thalamic nucleus and spontaneous <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> were analized {{to investigate the}} electrophysiological mechanism of cortical synchronized activities in man {{as well as in}} cat. In man, three positive and three negative waves, namely Ⅰ-P, Ⅰ-N, Ⅱ-P, Ⅱ-N, Ⅲ-P and Ⅲ-N, were observed as cortical evoked responses after single stimulation of the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus. And Ⅳ-P and Ⅳ-N were observed after the stronger stimulation which could provoke augmenting response with the repetitive volley. Later components of evoked cortical responses were investigated in cat immobilized under local anesthasia. Recording electrole was located on the anterior sigmoid gyrus. As the intensity of the thalamic stimulation was increased, afterdischarges of the negative waves, which appeared with long latency (about 200 msec.), increased in number and developed into spindle-like pattern with notches on afterdischarges. The long latencied negative wave in cat and Ⅳ-N in man were considered to correspond to Lehtinen's "precursor of the evoked spindle activity". It has been already reported by Miyamoto that Ⅳ-N was supposed {{to play an important role}} in augmenting response in man. Close relationship was indicated between augmenting response and spindle-like afterdischarges. Futhermore, the similarities of the pattern between spindle-like afterdischarges following thalamic stimulation and spontaneous <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> in cat, and attenuation of ipsilateral spontaneous <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> after destruction of the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus in cat as well as in man were also observed. From these facts these cortical synchronized activities, namely AR, spindle-like afterdischarges and spontaneous <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> were considered to be brought by similar neuronal mechanism with some varieties of synchronization ascribed to arousal levels under influences of activities of the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus. On the other hand, spindle-like afterdischarges and spontaneous <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> in cat were analized for investigating their waxing and waning phenomena. Notches were observed on each waves. When the wave grew with maximal amplilude in a train of spindle, the notch of the wave became obscure. The phenomenon was considered that the notch was synchronized with the wave, forming maximal amplilude of the wave in a train of spindle. In other words, mechanism of this phenomenon was supposed to be explained as a beat of two rhythmic activities slightly different in frequency...|$|R
40|$|The neocortex of awake animals {{requires}} spaced {{and repeated}} tetanization to successfully induce long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Changes in synaptic strength can be promoted by synchronous neuronal activation, and the theta-rhythm (10 Hz) may be effective at inducing these changes. To investigate if theta-patterned stimulation is effective at inducing LTD in the sensorimotor cortex standard 1 Hz stimulation, pairs of pulses (with a 100 ms inter-pulse interval) delivered every 2 seconds, or 20 -pulse 10 Hz trains were delivered daily for 10 days.

To assess if 10 Hz activity {{in the form of}} large amplitude <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> are affected by plasticity of neocortical synapses, evoked <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> were recorded before and after LTP induction. The ability of single pulses to evoke <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> was increased following induction of LTP. The increased activation of <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> may have occurred due to strengthening of Layer V horizontal projections. To directly assess changes in the strength of these projections, LTP was induced and responses were recorded from a rostro-caudal array of five electrodes following corpus callosum stimulation as well as following direct stimulation of Layer V. Long-term potentiation of monosynaptic inputs to the cortex was found, but no significant increases in field potentials evoked by direct stimulation of the horizontal projections were observed. In addition, paired-pulse facilitation was observed at all electrode sites indicating the ability of the recording array to reflect enhanced responses. This research emphasizes the importance of theta-patterned activity in bi-directional synaptic plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex and suggests that LTP may occur primarily at monosynaptic inputs to the cortex rather than at synapses within the horizontal collaterals of Layer V...|$|R
40|$|The use of EEGmonitors {{to assess}} the level of {{hypnosis}} during anaesthesia has becomewidespread. Anaesthetists, however, do not usually observe the raw EEG data: they generally pay attention only to the Bispectral Index (BIS™) and other indices calculated by EEGmonitors. This abstracted information only partially characterizes EEG features. To properly appreciate the availability and reliability of EEG-derived indices, {{it is necessary to}} understand how raw EEG changes during anaesthesia. With hemi-frontal lead EEGs obtained under volatile anaesthesia or propofol anaesthesia, the dominant EEG frequency decreases and the amplitude increases with increasing concentrations of anaesthetic. Looking more closely, the EEG changes aremore complicated. At surgical concentrations of anaesthesia, spindlewaves (alpha range) become dominant. At deeper levels, this activity decreases, and theta and delta waves predominate. At even deeper levels, EEG waveform changes into a burst and suppression pattern, and finally becomes flat. EEG waveforms vary in the presence of noxious stimuli (surgical skin incision), which is not always reflected in BIS™, or other processed EEG indices. <b>Spindle</b> <b>waves</b> are adequately sensitive, however, to noxious stimuli: under surgical anaesthesia they disappear when noxious stimuli are applied, and reappear when adequate analgesia is obtained.

The present study was designed to investigate both the effects of foot bathing and aromatherapy on the central nervous system, with special reference to the brain activity. Six healthy young students (20 - 22 years old) participated as subjects in this study. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from the midline of the frontal (Fz) central (Cz) and parietal(Pz) areas, during which the subjects were lying on a bed with their eyes closed and their feet soaking in warm water (40 - 41 ℃) for ten minutes. An EEG was also recorded with eyes closed for 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the foot bathing. This procedure for was done twice with and without the essential oil of lavender in the warm water at the same time of day for each subject. All EEG records except artifacts were continuously digitized for 50 sec each at a 40 /sec sampling rate, and then were processed for power spectrum analysis. During the session of foot bathing without lavender oil, the frequency of the alpha wave on Pz and Cz became slower within a few minutes after the foot bathing than those in the rest period (before foot bathing). Then the alpha wave gradually diminished and in turn, the theta or hump wave (sleep stage 1) and <b>spindle</b> <b>wave</b> (sleep stage 2) appeared in all EEG recording sites within 5 - 10 minutes after the foot bathing. In the session of foot bathing with lavender oil, the alpha components in the power spectrum increased and the slowing of the alpha frequency was observed during the period of foot bathing. The sleep onset time was earlier (within 1 - 5 minutes after foot bathing), and also the delta component (sleep stage 4) increased more than without the lavender. These results suggested that the procedure of foot bathing with lavender had an additive effect on the brain activity and was a more effective method for giving rise to relaxation and sleep...|$|E

Here, we report that application of histamine to the GABAergic neurons of the thalamic perigeniculate nucleus (PGN), which is innervated by histaminergic fibers from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, causes a slow membrane hyperpolarization toward a reversal potential of - 73 mV through a relatively small increase in membrane conductance to Cl-.

Each neuron fires only one spike. The velocity and stability of propagating continuous pulses are calculated analytically. Above a certain critical value of the constant delay, these pulses lose stability. Instead, lurching pulses propagate with discontinuous and periodic spatio-temporal characteristics. The parameter regime for which lurching occurs is strongly affected by the footprint (connectivity) shape; bistability may occur with a square footprint shape but not with an exponential footprint shape. For strong synaptic coupling, the velocity of both continuous and lurching pulses increases logarithmically with the synaptic coupling strength gsyn for an exponential footprint shape, and it is bounded for a step footprint shape. We conclude that the differences in velocity and shape between the front of thalamic <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> in vitro and cortical paroxysmal discharges stem from their different effective delay; in thalamic networks, large effective delay between inhibitory neurons arises from their effective interaction via the excitatory cells which display postinhibitory rebound...|$|R

METHODS: Starting with matching pursuit (MP) decomposition, we automatically detect and parametrize sleep <b>spindles,</b> slow <b>wave</b> activity, K-complexes and alpha, beta and theta waves present in EEG recordings, and automatically construct profiles of their time evolution, relevant to the assessment of residual brain function in patients with DOC. RESULTS: Above proposed EEG profiles were computed for 32 patients diagnosed as minimally conscious state (MCS, 20 patients), vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS, 11 patients) and Locked-in Syndrome (LiS, 1 patient). Their interpretation revealed significant correlations between patients' behavioral diagnosis and: (a) occurrence of sleep EEG patterns including sleep <b>spindles,</b> slow <b>wave</b> activity and light/deep sleep cycles, (b) appearance and variability across time of alpha, beta, and theta rhythms. Discrimination between MCS and VS/UWS based upon prominent features of these profiles classified correctly 87 % of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Proposed EEG profiles offer user-independent, repeatable, comprehensive and continuous representation of relevant EEG characteristics, intended as an aid in differentiation between VS/UWS and MCS states and diagnostic prognosis. To enable further development of this methodology into clinically usable tests, we share user-friendly software for MP decomposition of EEG ([URL] and scripts used for creation of the presented profiles (attached to this article).

40|$|The thalamic reticular (RE) nucleus {{is a key}} {{structure}} in the generation of spindles, a hallmark bioelectrical oscillation during early stages of sleep. Intracellular recordings of RE neurons in vivo revealed the presence of prolonged hyperpolarizing potentials preceding spindles in a subgroup (30 %) of neurons. These hyperpolarizations (6 - 10 mV) lasted for 200 - 300 ms and were present just {{before the onset of}} spontaneously occurring <b>spindle</b> <b>waves.</b> Corticothalamic volleys also were effective in generating such hyperpolarizations followed by spindles in RE neurons. A drop of up to 40 % in the apparent input resistance (Rin) was associated with these hyperpolarizing potentials, suggesting an active process rather than disfacilitation. Accordingly, the reversal potential was approximately - 100 mV for both spontaneous and cortically elicited hyperpolarizations, consistent with the activation of slow K+ conductances. QX- 314 in the recording pipettes decreased both the amplitude and incidence of prolonged hyperpolarizations, suggesting the participation of G protein-dependent K+ currents in the generation of hyperpolarizations. Simultaneous extracellular and intracellular recordings in the RE nucleus demonstrated that some RE neurons discharged during the hyperpolarizations and, thus, may be implicated in their generation. The prolonged hyperpolarizations preceding spindles {{may play a role in}} the transition from tonic to bursting firing of RE neurons within a range of membrane potential (- 60 to - 65 mV) at which they set favorable conditions for the generation of low-threshold spike bursts that initiate spindle sequences. These data are further arguments for the generation of spindles within the thalamic RE nucleus...|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{the detection}} of oscillatory events in the EEG is presented. By estimating autoregressive (AR) models on short segments the EEG is described as a superposition of harmonic oscillators with damping and frequencies varying in time. Oscillatory events are detected, whenever the damping of one or more frequencies falls below a predefined threshold. The algorithm works well {{for the detection}} of sleep spindles and in addition identifies delta and alpha waves. The distribution of the occurrence of oscillatory events shows a similar pattern with maxima around 3 - 4 s for most classes of events except for slow delta waves (< 2 Hz).

40|$|A novel {{direction}} to existing neural mass modeling technique is proposed where the commonly used “alpha function” for representing synaptic transmission {{is replaced by}} a kinetic framework of neurotransmitter and receptor dynamics. The aim is to underpin neuro-transmission dynamics associated with abnormal brain rhythms commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders. An existing thalamocortical neural mass model is modified by using the kinetic Q 1 framework for modeling synaptic transmission mediated by glutamatergic and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric-acid) -ergic receptors. The model output is compared qualitatively with existing literature on in vitro experimental studies of ferret thalamic slices, as well as on single-neuron-level model based studies of neuro-receptor and transmitter dynamics in the thalamocortical tissue. The results are consistent with these studies: the activation of ligand-gated GABA receptors is essential for generation of <b>spindle</b> <b>waves</b> in the model, while blocking this pathway leads to low-frequency synchronized oscillations such as observed in slow-wave sleep; the frequency of spindle oscillations increase with increased levels of post-synaptic membrane conductance for AMPA (alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic-acid) receptors, and blocking this pathway effects a quiescent model output. In terms of computational efficiency, the simulation time is improved by a factor of 10 compared to a similar neural mass model based on alpha functions. This implies a dramatic improvement in computational resources for large-scale network simulation using this model. Thus, the model provides a platform for correlating high-level brain oscillatory activity with low-level synaptic attributes, and makes a significant contribution toward advancements in current neural mass modeling paradigm as a potential computational tool to better the understanding of brain oscillations in sickness and in health...|$|R

We analyzed the temporal organization of sleep spindles and discuss {{to what extent the}} observed interevent intervals correspond to properties of stationary stochastic processes and whether additional slow processes, such as slow oscillations, have to be assumed. We have found evidence for such an additional slow process, most pronounced in sleep stage 2...|$|R
40|$|K-complexes (KCs), spindles, {{and slow}} {{oscillations}} characterize non-REM (NREM) sleep. Understanding how these large-scale cortical modulations coordinate cortical processing requires knowing {{where and how}} they are generated and spread. However, this is largely unknown, especially in humans. In this thesis, the interaction of the thalamus and cortex in giving rise to these sleep events, in particular the KC, was examined using computational modeling and a variety of recordings in humans: scalp electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECOG), and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). The overall aim to characterize how the KCs arise in the human cortex and how the thalamus may be implicated in this process is addressed in three parts. Chapter 1 presents a novel thalamocortical computational model of NREM stage 2 sleep that produces spindles as well as spontaneous and evoked KCs. Properties of the model are based on evidence outlined in the chapter from EEG, ECOG, and SEEG recordings that KCs may arise synchronously across the cortex. The model suggests the disruption of thalamic spindling via inactivation of the low-threshold Ca 2 + current (IT) as a possible mechanism for the production of synchronous KCs. Chapter 2 examines the spatial and temporal dynamics of individual KCs measured locally in the cortex using SEEG recordings. This study addresses where KCs occur, how often they occur, how large they are in amplitude, whether they co-occur across the cortex, and whether they propagate in sequential order across the cortex. Unlike a previously dominant model, this work finds that the KC can start anywhere, and then spread over a large or small cortical area, in any direction. Chapter 3 describes how the downstate differentially groups the cortical and thalamic spindle using simultaneous bipolar SEEG recordings. This study finds that the thalamus leads the cortex in the initiation of spindles, as well as driving individual <b>spindle</b> <b>waves,</b> while the downstate occurs in the cortex before the thalamus. In sum, the body of work presented here furthers our understanding of how corticothalamic mechanisms in humans give rise to stereotyped patterns of brain activity during sleep and suggests how these mechanisms may underlie the functional role of sleep in the brain...|$|R
40|$|T-type Ca 2 + {{channels}} play {{a number}} of different and pivotal roles in almost every type of neuronal oscillation expressed by thalamic neurones during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including those underlying sleep theta waves, the K-complex and the slow (< 1 Hz) sleep rhythm, sleep <b>spindles</b> and delta <b>waves.</b> In particular, the transient opening of T channels not only gives rise to the ‘classical’ low threshold Ca 2 + potentials, and associated high frequency burst of action potentials, that are characteristically present during sleep <b>spindles</b> and delta <b>waves,</b> but also contributes to the high threshold bursts that underlie the thalamic generation of sleep theta rhythms. The persistent opening of a small fraction of T channels, i. e. ITwindow, is responsible for the large amplitude and long lasting depolarization, or UP state, of the slow (< 1 Hz) sleep oscillation in thalamic neurones. These cellular findings are in part matched by the wake-sleep phenotype of global and thalamic-selective CaV 3. 1 knockout mice that show a decreased amount of total NREM sleep time. T-type Ca 2 + channels, therefore, constitute the single most crucial voltage-dependent conductance that permeates all activities of thalamic neurones during NREM sleep. Since ITwindow and high threshold bursts are not restricted to thalamic neurones, the cellular neurophysiology of T channels should now move away from the simplistic, though historically significant, view of these channels as being responsible only for low threshold Ca 2 + potentials...|$|R
