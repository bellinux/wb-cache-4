30|$|Because {{children}}’s {{minimum age}} at school entry in Australia varies across States and Territories, and some children repeat the 4 -year-old kindergarten program, we present the attendance data as formal ECEC usage and non-parental care {{in each of}} the years <b>before</b> <b>school</b> rather than focussing on children’s ages; specifically we present ECEC usage by children who were 1  year <b>before</b> <b>school,</b> 2  years <b>before</b> <b>school,</b> 3  years <b>before</b> <b>school,</b> and so on. As would be expected children’s ages bear a systematic relationship with these categories, with an average age at entry to the first year of school being 5.2  years, 4.2  years for one year <b>before</b> <b>school,</b> 3.2  years at entry to 2  years <b>before</b> <b>school,</b> 2.2  years at entry to 3  years <b>before</b> <b>school</b> and 1.2  years at entry to 4  years <b>before</b> <b>school.</b> Children’s ages were calculated as of 1 January for each year for this purpose.|$|R
