50|$|Schiller's {{success in}} the Grand Coalition helped to give the SPD an electoral victory in 1969 {{and a chance to}} form a new {{coalition}} government with the Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei—FDP) under Willy Brandt. The SPD-FDP coalition expanded the West German social security system, substantially increasing the size and cost of the <b>social</b> <b>budget.</b> Social program costs grew by over 10 percent a year during much of the 1970s, introducing into the budget an unalterable obligation that reduced fiscal flexibility (although Schiller and other Keynesians believed that it would have an anticyclical effect). This came back to haunt Schiller as well as every German government since then. Schiller himself had to resign in 1972 when the West German and global economies were in a downturn and when all his ideas did not seem able to revive West German prosperity. Willy Brandt himself resigned two years later.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research is to discuss future development of healthcare system revenues and expenditures in selected CEE countries, now all new EU Member States 1. The report’s projections {{are based on the}} methodology adopted in the International Labour Organization (ILO) <b>social</b> <b>budget</b> model. The projections examine the impact of demographic changes and changes in health status on future health expenditures. Additionally, future changes in the countries ’ labour market participation as well as the impact on each healthcare system’s revenues were also examined. Methodology The ILO <b>social</b> <b>budget</b> model has been used for it is suitable for both middle and long-term projections of revenues and expenditures of major social welfare schemes and for the simulation of the impact of demographic, economic, and legislative changes on social welfare financing. The model can also be used for short-term evaluation of already existing schemes, as well as the simulation of future reforms of specific parts of the system. The ILO <b>social</b> <b>budget</b> model takes demographic changes, such as the ageing of the population, into account. The model looks at four key factors 1.) Economic 2.) Governmental 3.) Demographic and labor market and finally 4.) Health status of the population, medical service utilization, and medical technologies for the purpose of projecting healthcare system revenues and expenditures. The model applied in the AHEAD research was modified and slightly different from the original <b>social</b> <b>budget</b> model. One of the most significant modifications (in the cases of Hungary and Poland) was the introduction of per capita expenditures instead of average medical service utilization levels. This modification was due to greater availability of data on expenditure levels per capita, by gender and age than the data pertaining to average medical service utilization in these two countries. The healthcare budget model applied in the report’s projections is not limited to health insurance in a given country, but covers the whole public financing of the healthcare sector. This implies that not only insurance revenues and expenditures, but also budgetary revenues and expenditures were included...|$|E

40|$|Through its {{demographic}} and economic effects, the HIV/AIDS pan-demic poses a huge {{challenge to the}} financial management of national social protection systems. For example, increased mortality owing to HIV/AIDS may {{reduce the number of}} contributors to pension schemes. And although the share of contributors reaching retirement age declines, the number of surviving dependents entitled to benefits increases. At the same time, the demand for health services increases. Using a simplified <b>social</b> <b>budget</b> model, this chapter tries to assess the potential financial effects of HIV/AIDS on national social protection schemes. The institutional arrangements and coverage of social insurance schemes differ substantially across developing countries, and often only a small pro-portion of the population is covered by formal schemes.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{welfare policy}} and the trends of development of public expenditure and the <b>social</b> <b>budget</b> in Greece in the post-war period. Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} expansion of income transfers during the 1980 s under the conditions of economic recession. An understanding {{of the relationship between the}} state and civil society in Greece is crucial for explaining social policy developments. Our analysis focuses on the strong grip of politics on civil society, which constitutes a major aspect of Greek statism and contributes to an increased fragmentation of social demands and conflicts. The main argument of this article is that the growing size and political weight of the middle classes since the mid- 1970 s intensified social fragmentation and the contradictions of Greek statism, and made it more difficult to achieve any consensus about social policy aims. Public expenditure and the <b>social</b> <b>budget</b> increased significantly during the 1980 s, as a result of presstrre from various middle-class strata, yet no major changes occurred in the logic of the distribution of social provision. Competition among the middle classes for access to political power and the state apparatus intensified, and this put severe limitations on the possibilities of any reforms aimed at redistribution on the basis of social need...|$|E
