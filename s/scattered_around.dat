5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} shrines, dens and other student-built curiosities are <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the {{northern}} campus. These structures, mostly assembled from branches and other forest detritus, were formerly {{concentrated in the}} area known as Elfland, a glen the university razed in 1992 to build colleges Nine and Ten. Students were able to relocate and save some of the structures, however.|$|E

5|$|The University of Paris, {{founded in}} the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its {{original}} medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> {{the city and the}} suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Various {{segments}} of maps are <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the galleon, which will form a complete {{view of the}} game's overworld once all the segments are picked up. Other scattered items in the game include keys for locked doors, gunpowder to fire cannons and pieces of jewellery, the latter having no additional use other than adding to the player's score.|$|E
5|$|An {{assortment}} of unusual sculptures are <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the park, including: Still Water, a massive horse head lapping up water; Jelly Baby Family, {{a family of}} giant Jelly Babies standing {{on top of a}} large black cube; and Vroom Vroom, which resembles a giant human hand pushing a toy car along the ground. The sculptor Jacob Epstein constructed several works in Hyde Park. His memorial to the author William Henry Hudson, featuring his character Rima caused public outrage when it was unveiled in 1925.|$|E

5000|$|Aeon Jusco, Tesco, and Giant Hypermarket are {{the nearest}} {{shopping}} malls which {{are located in}} Seksyen 13, Shah Alam. There are many restaurants, food courts and cafes <b>scattering</b> <b>around</b> the area as well.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{nationwide}} {{news coverage}} in both {{white and black}} newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion. Most of the survivors <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, including children, took on odd jobs to make ends meet. Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income. As a result, most of the Rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs, working as maids, shoe shiners, or in citrus factories or lumber mills.|$|E
5|$|For Nordic skiing, Great Glen Trails {{offers a}} large, groomed trail system that also {{includes}} {{the lower half of}} the Auto Road. Several warming huts are <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the trail system, including scenic Great Angel Cabin, with views of the Great Gulf and surrounding peaks. Great Glen also permits biking on the trails during the summer, and is the only mountain bike facility in the notch. Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of Jackson, extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the wreck}} was located by Danish divers. The British marine {{archeologist}} Innes McCartney led a subsequent dive and {{confirmed that the}} wreck sits upright on the sea floor and is largely intact. Skeletal remains from the ship's crew are <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the sunken cruiser. The wreck was positively identified when McCartney's team recovered the ship's bell in 2001, which they donated to the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel, where the bell is currently on display.|$|E
5000|$|... {{refers to}} a [...] "dominant discharge" [...] or [...] "channel-forming discharge", which is {{typically}} the 1-2 year flood, {{though there is a}} large amount of <b>scatter</b> <b>around</b> this mean. This is the event that causes significant erosion and deposition and determines the channel morphology.|$|R
25|$|The {{trees in}} the park tend to produce dead leaves <b>scattering</b> <b>around</b> the field and {{sometimes}} get blown to the residential areas, which is considered as inconvenient. There are also people in the park collecting firewood, pine cones and twigs. Graffiti {{seems to be a}} persistent problem.|$|R

5|$|The game {{world is}} {{presented}} in a horizontal wraparound and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in instalments <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the map), and then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is broadly repeated. In addition, the player has to defend themselves from the planet's aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{significantly}} underestimating {{the size}} of the position they faced, the Australians had succeeded in the pushing D445 VC Battalion and 3/33 NVA Regiment out of a valuable base area intended for long-term use. Regardless, there were few other tangible results to show for the casualties they had incurred as, although numerous blood trails and body parts <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the battlefield indicated that communist casualties had been heavy, the majority of their dead had either been removed from the battlefield or were entombed in the bunkers that had been crushed by the Australian tanks. The battle had cost the Australians three killed and six wounded, while only five Viet Cong bodies were recovered.|$|E
5|$|During the {{earthquake}} of 1905, there was large scale {{damage to the}} temple complex. Substantial part of the temples were damaged resulting in many broken parts seen lying <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the temple. Further, the heterogeneous structural compactness of the sandstone rock mass, from which the temples have been carved out, {{has contributed to the}} damage. A particular structural part of the temple which {{is not part of the}} main monolithic temple complex suffered severe damage to most of its circular columns which resulted in collapse of the mandapa and the roof (probably made of local timber) of the structure.|$|E

5000|$|The third version {{states that}} {{there was a time when}} bones of {{different}} kinds of animals were <b>scattered</b> all <b>around</b> the place. Whenever people would see bones all around, they always commented, [...] "nagdudulag hin tul-an." [...] This means that bones were <b>scattered</b> all <b>around.</b> The word nagdudulag was then shortened to Dulag.|$|R
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E
5|$|No. 20 Squadron {{was formed}} at Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 1 August 1941 {{for a general}} {{reconnaissance}} role, {{under the command of}} Squadron Leader W.N. Gibson. Its establishment was six PBY Catalina flying boats and 133 personnel, but only five aircraft (all transferred from No. 11 Squadron) and 55 personnel were available initially. The squadron conducted long-range patrols between bases <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the islands to Australia's north in conjunction with No. 11 Squadron. On 18 November, No. 20 Squadron's Catalinas were augmented by two Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scattered</b> <b>around</b> {{each level}} are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. Rings act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in his possession will be scattered; they flicker and disappear {{in a few seconds}} if not picked up again. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time, will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E

40|$|We present rest-frame optical spectra for {{a sample}} of nine low-mass star-forming galaxies in the {{redshift}} range 1. 5 = 0. 01 ± 0. 08, suggesting a universal relationship. Remarkably, the <b>scatter</b> <b>around</b> the fundamental metallicity relation is only 0. 24 dex, smaller than that observed locally at the same stellar masses, which may provide an important additional constraint for galaxy evolution models...|$|R
5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated {{between high and low}} water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|The Sri Lankan {{military}} began attacking Kilinochchi {{from three}} directions on 23 November 2008. Throughout {{the month of}} December, the SLA conducted three offensives {{in an attempt to}} take Kilinochchi. Heavy monsoon rains affected both sides during the months of November and December, with floods covering a large area in and around Kilinochchi. Troop movements were limited by this, and mines had been <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the area by the flood waters. Throughout the offensive, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out numerous air strikes against Kilinochchi in support of the SLA.|$|E
5|$|The Witness is a 3D puzzle {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Thekla, Inc. It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in January 2016, and later for Xbox One, Nvidia Shield, macOS, and iOS. Inspired by Myst, the game involves the exploration of an open world island filled with natural and man-made structures. The player progresses by solving puzzles, {{which are based on}} interactions with mazes presented on panels around the island or hidden within the environment. The player will have to determine the rules of each puzzle from visual clues and audio recordings <b>scattered</b> <b>around</b> the island.|$|E
