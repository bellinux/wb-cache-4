25|$|Among {{the poets}} of the Matterhorn {{during these years}} (1834 to 1840) were Elie de Beaumont, a famous French geologist; Pierre Jean Édouard Desor, a naturalist of Neuchâtel, who went up there with a party of friends, two of whom were Louis Agassiz and Bernhard Studer. Christian Moritz Engelhardt, who was <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> admiration for Zermatt and its {{neighbourhood}} that he returned there at least ten times (from 1835 to 1855), described these places in two valuable volumes, drew panoramas and maps, and collected the most minute notes on the mineralogy and botany of the region. Zermatt {{was at that time}} a quiet little village, and travellers found hospitality at the parish priest's, or at the village doctor's.|$|E
500|$|To {{kick off}} the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. Kiedis {{recalled}} the situation: [...] "Red Square was <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage." [...] Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, {{and then at the}} Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot was}} viewed {{by an average}} of 2.49 million American viewers on its {{original}} broadcast, ranking 108 out of 112 in the weekly charts. Debra Leithauser and Amy Amatangelo of The Washington Post praised the pilot for relying [...] "on strong storytelling and casting", but hoped that viewers would be able to follow the multiple storylines. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter said that the pilot was [...] "so cleverly constructed, the hero so engaging and complicated and the story <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> great dialogue that I wonder how anyone can sustain this level of accomplishment." [...] He said that the protagonist [...] "has all the sass, strength, resolve and ingenuity of any of literature's classic detectives [...] and Bell is so convincing in the role that it all somehow makes perfect sense." [...] He praised the pilot and Thomas' writing, saying it had [...] "comedy, deathly serious drama, parody and danger, ingredients not typically mixed together", and said that [...] "if future episodes are half as good, this still will be one of TV's bright spots". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness".|$|E

[...] Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating on their syndicated television program, Siskel and Ebert and the Movies. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film's director, writing that [...] "Glimcher shows an epicure's taste in his choice of both cast and crew. The look of [...] "The Mambo Kings" [...] is doubtless richer than the text, which is, however, strengthened by Glimcher's nostalgia for the teenage, eager America of the 1950s." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The Mambo Kings is most fun when it practically dares you to swoon. It's a movie you don't have to believe to enjoy." [...] Betty Goodwin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's visual style: [...] "The innocence of the pre-MTV '50s mambo scene is expressed through meticulously real details and honest styling." ...|$|E

The Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "A performance so charismatic, <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> sheer magnetic talent... expect big things from this potential new international star", while the New York Times wrote: [...] "With raised arms and delicately stepping feet, she was no unapproachable, packaged pop diva, but an irrepressible entertainer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} Sama is {{credited}} to Rumi, Sufi master and in whose name the Mevlevi Order was founded. The {{story of the}} creation of this unique form of dhikr tells that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day, when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters. It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr, [...] "la elaha ella'llah" [...] in Arabic [...] "لا اله الا الله", or in English, [...] "There is no god but Allah (The God)", spoken by the apprentices beating the gold, and was <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> happiness that he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle. With that, the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi Order were born.|$|E

2500|$|The Academic Building {{stands at}} the {{crossroads}} of the campus. Completed in 1914, it stands on the site of Old Main, the first campus building, which burned to the ground in 1912. Its most prominent feature is its copper dome, which is green with oxidation, much like the Statue of Liberty. When the building was constructed, {{it was one of the}} first on campus to use rebar. Its architect, A Professor F. E. Giesecke knew little about reinforced concrete, [...] "so [...] just figured out the amount of steel...necessary and doubled it". The result was an extremely durable building <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> steel that blowtorches had to be used when piping for water fountains was added. In front of the Academic Building is the Academic Plaza, which is the site of a wide range of campus events, most notably Silver Taps.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 December 1942, {{an advance}} {{party of the}} Lilliput Task Force arrived with landing barges {{in advance of the}} first U.S. Army {{controlled}} KPM vessels , [...] and [...] between 20 and 24 December. Destroyers had been requested as convoy escorts by General Blamey, Commander, Allied Land Forces, but rejected by Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender commanding Allied Naval Forces noting the entire area between Cape Nelson and Buna was <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> reefs that destroyers would be limited in maneuver and not effective against Japanese forces with clear sea room from bases in Rabaul. Further, requirements preliminary to the Guadalcanal operation required fleet units be on standby south of New Guinea. Thus the convoys would only have small, shallow draft warships for escort. A part of the Buna-Gona general plan was development of a deep water port in Oro Bay with a road to be constructed to an airfield to be developed for logistics and as a bomber base at Dobodura.|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat more iconoclastic {{views of}} the film and its content are {{occasionally}} expressed. In 1947, film critic Manny Farber wrote, [...] "To make his points [...] always takes an easy, simple-minded path that doesn't give much credit to the intelligence of the audience", and adds {{that there are only}} a [...] "few unsentimental moments here and there." [...] Wendell Jamieson, in a 2008 article for The New York Times which was generally positive in its analysis of the film, noted that far from being simply a sweet sentimental story, it [...] "is a terrifying, asphyxiating story about growing up and relinquishing your dreams, of seeing your father driven to the grave before his time, of living among bitter, small-minded people. It is a story of being trapped, of compromising, of watching others move ahead and away, of becoming <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> rage that you verbally abuse your children, their teacher and your oppressively perfect wife." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, {{publisher}} and politician Steve Forbes, writing in Forbes magazine, praised Sowell's Wealth, Poverty and Politics: An International Perspective, saying [...] "It's a scandal that economist Thomas Sowell {{has not been}} awarded the Nobel Prize. No one alive has turned out so many insightful, richly researched books. His latest is another triumph of crackling observations that underscore the ignorance of our economists and policymakers. His take on how culture, geography, politics and social factors affect how societies progress—or don't—will rile those addicted to political correctness but leave everyone else wiser." [...] Columnist Steven Pearlstein of The Washington Post criticized Sowell, saying [...] "as an intellectual combatant, Sowell thrives on jousting with straw men whose existence he posits {{with little or no}} proof. In the world according to Sowell, liberals (including rich ones, apparently) are <b>so</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> envy and resentment that they will deny billionaires the chance to create new jobs and new products if it means adding even a dollar to their incomes. Black leaders want to keep their people in poverty because otherwise they would have no purpose. The media and government officials systematically ignore and cover up racially motivated black-on-white violence (he knows about these incidents, according to the footnotes, from major news outlets). These are more like the rants of a talk-radio host than the considered judgments of a respected academic." [...] Walter E. Williams stated, [...] "Wealth, Poverty and Politics: An International Perspective is a true gem in terms of exposing the demagoguery and sheer ignorance of politicians and intellectuals in their claims about wealth and poverty." ...|$|E
