The system for {{classifying}} such patents for efficient retrieval is a specialized part of the United States Patent Classification. It is described here under the following topics: purpose, the classification schedule, schedule organisation, relationship to design and utility patent classification, class definition, <b>search</b> <b>notes,</b> line notes, hierarchy, and special features of plant patents, such as coloration {{and the effect of}} commercial or market practice. The article then considers placement rules for consistent classification of such patents, searching for a patented plant, and aids for such searching.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the present article is to review the {{literature}} of note-taking to explore its theoretical and practical state. The author has also cultivated in his mind the idea of providing the students, teachers and researchers with a rich source of information and future research priorities concerning the theme. Methodologically, note-taking studies were searched for in books, on the web and in some important databases including Elsevier, ScienceDirect, Sagepub and Springer. The <b>search</b> <b>notes</b> focused on the theory underlying th note-taking and the findings of the previous studies. It was found that from the early of 20 century up to now note-taking has occupied the minds of many scholars. Rooted in cognition and metacognition, note-taking performs a crucial function in learning and academic achievement. Practically, note-taking is significant for students-they learn via this study skill-, for teachers-they can raise the level of students ' knowledge by acquainting them with various note-taking strategies-and for the researchers-they can use it as a unique datagathering instrument and conduct further research about it.

Android {{is one of the}} most popular platforms in mobile technology and gives lot of space for creative development as it is open source. There are various discussion forums and official Android development support websites that encourages mobile and tablet application development. The Quick Organizer application provides three main features for managing and organizing everyday tasks. 1. Calendar with smooth navigation buttons and flexible layout to view all calendar events. This calendar synchronizes with Google calendar and calendar application in Android device and allows user to create events in all the user calendar accounts. 2. Notes management for creating new note, viewing all notes for current month and <b>search</b> <b>notes</b> for the user account that synchronizes with the Ever Notes application. 3.

30|$|The {{complexity}} of our scheme per distance estimation sample for K nodes {{is comprised of}} K signal sampling, storing, and communication events (nodes transmitting the recorded signals to the central entity), and K(K - 1)/ 2 computations of the signal cross correlations and peak <b>searches.</b> <b>Note</b> that the computation of cross correlations can be done computationally efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. In contrast, conventional TDOA-based schemes need K(K - 1)/ 2 ranging actions (i.e., ranging between all pairs of nodes). Subsequently, the ranging information must be communicated by at least K - 1 nodes. Thus, the main difference in complexity lies in the computation of the cross correlations.|$|R

The silhouette coefficient, originally proposed in [13] for interpretation and validation of consistency within general clusters of data, is used as a simple quality measure of the clustering step of ASTS, allowing the automatic estimation of similarity thresholds associated to individual <b>searches.</b> <b>Note</b> that the silhouette coefficient is an internal evaluation measure [30], which does not require an evaluated dataset, i.e. it does not require matching data instances to be known. As a result, our approach does not require human intervention.|$|R

Our <b>search</b> <b>noted</b> studies showing decreases in carotenoid density in the retina’s of AMD sufferers and the ability of nutritional supplementation to increase retinal densities in AMD and non-AMD sufferers.
