5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E

500|$|Skelton's {{first major}} post-television {{recognition}} came in 1978, when the Golden Globe Awards named {{him as the}} recipient for their Cecil B. DeMille Award, which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment. [...] His excitement was so great upon receiving the award and a standing ovation, that he clutched it tightly enough to break the statuette. When he was presented with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Governor's Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation. [...] "I {{want to thank you}} for sitting down", he <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ovation subsided. [...] "I thought you were pulling a CBS and walking out on me." [...] The honor came 16 years after his television program left the airwaves.|$|E
500|$|Loev {{was well}} {{received}} in North America; {{it was the}} first Indian film to be screened at the SXSW, with Brooke Corso of The Macguffin stating that the beautiful and heartbreaking film shines when, [...] "it focuses on what is <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> characters aren't speaking, and what is avoided when they do". Matt Shiverdecker of Austin American-Statesman was largely laudatory of the film at the same event as well, dubbing it as a [...] "small miracle". He praised the added realism, unlike the clichéd storybook romance. He attributed the film's success to its actors and the beautiful scenery. Siddhant Adlakha of Birth Movies Death called Loev a [...] "minuscule film of miraculous construction" [...] and [...] "a melancholy tale where questions have no easy answers, [...] but one where bliss, even momentary, feels infinite".|$|E
500|$|When a final {{agreement}} was reached with the Republican legislative leadership, Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19. The legislature met on July 20 and passed the budget bills, which were signed the same day by the governor. Most state employees returned to work on July 21, facing a backlog of unfinished work and new problems in many agencies. After the budget was passed, Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens—who said they wanted government services to resume and did not care how the shutdown was ended—and because he feared a worse budget deal and unease in the DFL legislative minorities. Zellers <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> deal was finalized that in his view it was [...] "a deal {{that we can all}} be disappointed in, but a deal that is done, a budget that was balanced". His sentiments that a 'balanced' budget needed to be passed, and that both sides had something to be unhappy about, were echoed by Koch.|$|E

500|$|According to French and German prosecutors, {{the crash}} was {{deliberately}} {{caused by the}} co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. Brice Robin said Lubitz was initially courteous to Captain Sondenheimer during {{the first part of}} the flight, then became [...] "curt" [...] when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing. Robin <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> captain returned from a probable toilet break and tried to enter the cockpit, Lubitz had locked the door. The captain had a code to unlock the door, but the lock's code panel can be disabled from the cockpit controls. The captain requested re-entry using the intercom; he knocked and then banged on the door, but received no response. The captain then tried to break down the door. During the descent, the co-pilot did not respond to questions from air traffic control and did not transmit a distress call. Robin said contact from the Marseille air traffic control tower, the captain's attempts to break in, and Lubitz's steady breathing were audible on the cockpit voice recording. The screams of passengers in the last moments before impact were also heard on the recording.|$|E
500|$|The Sages of the Talmud {{stated that}} anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, [...] "it is {{as if he has}} prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is {{situated}} there and it is open to hear prayer." [...] Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes [...] "since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, it is understandable that all Israel's prayers ascend on high there... {{as one of the great}} ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall." [...] A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Adam Scott, who also appeared in the subsequent season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and became a regular cast member during the third season. Scott left the Starz comedy Party Down to join the Parks and Recreation cast, a decision he made {{in part because it}} was unclear whether Starz would renew the series: [...] "It was a matter of me asking Starz {{if it was going to}} continue, and them saying they weren't ready to make that decision. I couldn't pass up the opportunity on Parks and Rec for a show that could possibly not exist anymore." [...] Schur <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Ben Wyatt character was written, Scott was envisioned as the [...] "dream scenario" [...] for casting. Schur described Scott as [...] "brilliant and funny" [...] and praised his comedic range: [...] "There just aren't that many people with a comedic range that spans Step Brothers to Party Down.". Several commentators said Ben Wyatt closely resembles the character Scott played on Party Down, Henry Pollard. While Ben was a politician who found great success at a young age then suffered a downfall, Henry was an actor who became a caterer after his acting career declined. Scott, however, said he feels they are [...] "vastly different characters and circumstances". The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the series of Parks and Recreation in general, but one that was ultimately not used until the Ben Wyatt character was introduced. During the scene when Ben explains his failed mayoral tenure, shots of a newspaper clip with images of the character's prom pictures are shown. Those pictures are the actual high school prom photos of actor Adam Scott.|$|E

Jewish tradition says that when the Sun completes this cycle, it has returned to its position when the world was created.

But maybe eventually, Alica {{will be able to}} have her own kind of power." [...] Lexa, with [...] "such an iconic look and distinct wardrobe," [...] was an alien role for Debnam-Carey. She stated, [...] "I signed on for this role at a time in my personal and work life when {{there was a little bit}} of a lull period. I was like, 'I don't know what I'm doing!' It was one of those actor freak-out moments." [...] She <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> chance to portray Lexa presented itself, she was excited because of the quality of the show and its actors, and because the character allowed for a multifaceted dynamic; this resulted in Lexa being the character she has favored portraying thus far. [...] "Thankfully, (show creator) Jason , the creative team, the writers, and the hair and make-up are very collaborative," [...] Debnam-Carey said. [...] "They're really willing to create something. And that's what's so lucky about this show. It never started with expectation, so we've been able to embrace it and really make it our own, and that's been wonderful." ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{water is}} poured on level ground it will avoid the parts which are dry and move towards {{those that are}} wet. If (two) {{identical}} pieces of firewood are exposed to fire, the latter will avoid the damp and ignite the dry one. All things reject what is different (to themselves) and follow what is akin. Thus it is that if (two) [...] are similar, they will coalesce; if notes correspond, they resonate [...] The experimental proof [...] of this is extraordinarily clear. Try tuning musical instruments. The kung [...] note or the shang [...] note struck upon one lute will be answered by [...] the kung or the shang notes from other stringed instruments. They sound by themselves. This is nothing miraculous , but the Five Notes being in relation; they are what they are according to the numbers [...] (whereby the world is constructed). (Similarly) lovely things summon others among the class of lovely things; repulsive things summon others among the class of repulsive things. This arises from the complementary {{way in which a}} thing of the same class responds [...] as for instance if a horse whinnies another horse whinnies in answer , and if a cow lows, another cow lows in response [...] When a great ruler is about to arise auspicious omens first appear; when a ruler is about to be destroyed, there are baleful ones beforehand. Things indeed summon each other, like to like, a dragon bringing rain, a fan driving away heat, the place where an army has been being thick with thorns. Things, whether lovely or repulsive, all have an origin. (If) they are taken to constitute destiny (it is because) no man knows where that origin is[...] [...] It is not only the two [...] of the Yin and the Yang which advance and retreat [...] according to their categories. Even the origins of the varied fortunes, good and bad, of men, behave in the same way. There is no happening that does not depend for its beginning upon something prior, to which it responds because (it belongs to the same) category, and so moves ... (As I <b>said)</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> note kung is struck forth from a lute, other kung strings (nearby) reverberate of themselves in complementary (resonance) a case of comparable things being affected according to the classes to which they belong [...] They are moved by a sound which has no visible form, and when men can see no form accompanying motion and action, they describe the phenomenon as a 'spontaneous sounding' [...] And wherever there is a mutual reaction [...] without anything visible (to account for it) they describe the phenomenon as 'spontaneously so' [...] But in truth there is no (such thing as) 'spontaneously so' (in this sense). (I.e. everything in the universe is attuned to certain other things, and changes as they change.) That there are (circumstances which) cause a man to become what in fact he is, we know. So also things do have a real causative (power), invisible though this may be. (1, tr. Needham 1954: 281-282) ...|$|E
