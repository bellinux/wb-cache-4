500|$|Though hip-hop {{dancing is}} {{established}} on film and on television, {{it has not}} gained {{the same level of}} exposure in theater. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the dance is performed more in film and in television than it is in a theatrical setting. B-boy and popper Stefan [...] "Mr. Wiggles" [...] Clemente and hip-hop historian Jorge [...] "Popmaster Fabel" [...] Pabon were involved in hip-hop theater at its inception. Their dance company, GhettOriginal, produced the first hip-hop stage shows: 1991's off Broadway musical <b>So!</b> <b>What</b> <b>Happens</b> Now? and 1995's Jam on the Groove. Both shows were performed by the Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians. Aside from the pioneers in New York City was Rennie Harris' Puremovement hip-hop theater company. Harris founded Puremovement in 1992 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of Puremovement's theater shows Rome & Jewels won two Black Theater Alliance Awards and three Bessie Awards. In 2012, Harris and his company toured Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian territories as part of Dance Motion USA, a program sponsored by the US State Department to showcase American dance to other countries and promote cultural exchange.|$|E
500|$|He {{wished to}} set the film in a field he {{understood}} and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much since I had been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't like any of the three [...] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{initially}} intended that Sam {{would save}} Dean from Hell, possibly even before [...] "No Rest for the Wicked", by {{giving in to}} his demonic powers and becoming [...] "this fully operational dark force" [...] who would then want to go after Lilith. The battle would have been [...] "much more climactic", with the Winchesters [...] "going to war to save Dean's life". By {{the middle of the}} season, however, the writers realized the costs associated with depicting such an engagement and scaled it down. To make matters worse, the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented them from fleshing out Sam's evolving abilities throughout the season, and his entire story arc was pushed back into the fourth season. With Sam's storyline no longer dovetailing with Dean's, the writers [...] " [...] any doubt in [...] minds" [...] to send Dean to Hell. Kripke disliked that the second-season finale [...] "just ended", and he felt that this episode provided a cliffhanger ending that had people [...] "biting their nails". Although the viewers' expectations that Dean would be saved was [...] "reason enough", his imprisonment in Hell also served as a [...] "turning point" [...] for both the character and the series. Kripke commented, [...] "You need huge moves to happen that can cause radical shifts in the characters, that set them off in a new direction. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to Dean in Hell and how Dean gets out become primary concerns of season four." ...|$|E
