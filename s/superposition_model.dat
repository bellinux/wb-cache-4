40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{experimental}} results of uniaxial time-dependent ratcheting behavior of SS {{304 stainless steel}} at room temperature and 973 K, three kinds of time-dependent constitutive models were employed to describe such time-dependent ratcheting by using the Ohno-Abdel-Karim kinematic hardening rule, i. e., a unified viscoplastic model, a creep-plasticity <b>superposition</b> <b>model</b> and a creep-viscoplasticity <b>superposition</b> <b>model.</b> The capabilities of such models to describe the time-dependent ratcheting were discussed by comparing with the corresponding experimental results. It is shown that the unified viscoplastic model cannot provide reasonable simulation to the time-dependent ratcheting, especially to those with certain peak/valley stress hold and at 973 K; the proposed creep-plasticity <b>superposition</b> <b>model</b> is reasonable when the creep is a dominant factor of the deformation, however, it cannot provide a reasonable description when the creep is weak; the creep-viscoplastic <b>superposition</b> <b>model</b> is reasonable not only at room temperature but also at high temperature...|$|E

40|$|Continuous superpositions of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck {{processes}} are proposed {{as a model}} for asset return volatility. An interesting class of continuous superpositions is defined by a Gamma mixing distribution which can define long memory processes. In contrast, previously studied discrete superpositions cannot generate this behaviour. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian inference are developed which allow the estimation of such models with leverage effects. The continuous <b>superposition</b> <b>model</b> is applied to both stock index and exchange rate data. The continuous <b>superposition</b> <b>model</b> is compared with a two-component superposition on the daily Standard and Poor’s 500 index from 1980 to 2000. ...|$|E
40|$|High {{dimensional}} <b>superposition</b> <b>models</b> characterize observations using parameters {{which can}} be written as a sum of multiple component parameters, {{each with its own}} structure, e. g., sum of low rank and sparse matrices, sum of sparse and rotated sparse vectors, etc. In this paper, we consider general <b>superposition</b> <b>models</b> which allow sum of any number of component parameters, and each component structure can be characterized by any norm. We present a simple estimator for such models, give a geometric condition under which the components can be accurately estimated, characterize sample complexity of the estimator, and give high probability non-asymptotic bounds on the componentwise estimation error. We use tools from empirical processes and generic chaining for the statistical analysis, and our results, which substantially generalize prior work on <b>superposition</b> <b>models,</b> are in terms of Gaussian widths of suitable sets...|$|R

40|$|Molecular <b>superposition</b> <b>models</b> {{guided the}} design of novel {{melatonin}} receptor ligands characterized by a 2 -acylaminomethyltetrahydroquinoline scaffold. Starting from the structure of N-anilinoethylamide ligands, the flexible chain was conformationally constrained to reproduce the bioactive conformation of melatonin. Structure-activity relationships were investigated, focusing on the substituent at the nitrogen atom, {{the position of the}} methoxy group, and the replacement of the amide side chain by urea and thiourea groups. The compounds were tested for binding affinity and intrinsic activity at human MT 1 and MT 2 receptors. Structural optimization resulted in N-[(1 -benzyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 5 -methoxyquinolin- 2 -yl) methyl]propionamide (UCM 1014), with picomolar MT 2 binding affinity (Ki = 0. 001 nM), more than 10000 -fold selectivity over the MT 1 receptor, and a full agonist profile (GTPγS test), being the most potent MT 2 -selective full agonist reported to date. Molecular dynamics simulations provided a rationale for high binding affinity, stereoselectivity, and agonist behavior of these novel melatonin receptor ligands based on <b>superposition</b> <b>models</b> and conformational preference...|$|R

40|$|Various chimeras of the ErbB 1 -specific ligands {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) display an enlarged repertoire as activators of ErbB 2. ErbB 3 heterodimers. Mutational analysis indicated that particularly residues in the N terminus and B-loop region of these ligands {{are involved in the}} broadened receptor specificity. In order to understand the receptor specificity of T 1 E, a chimeric ligand constructed by the introduction of the linear N-terminal region of TGFalpha into EGF, we determined in this study the solution structure and dynamics of T 1 E by multidimensional NMR analysis. Subsequently, we studied the structural characteristics of T 1 E binding to both ErbB 1 and ErbB 3 by <b>superposition</b> <b>modeling</b> of its structure on the known crystal structures of ErbB 3 and liganded ErbB 1 complexes. The results show that the overall structure of T 1 E in solution is very similar to that of native EGF and TGFalpha but that its N terminus shows an extended structure that is appropriately positioned to form a triple beta-sheet with the large antiparallel beta-sheet in the B-loop region. This conformational effect of the N terminus together with the large overall flexibility of T 1 E, as determined by 15 N NMR relaxation analysis, may be a facilitative property for its broad receptor specificity. The structural <b>superposition</b> <b>models</b> indicate that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of the N terminus and B-loop of T 1 E are particularly important for its binding to ErbB 3. 7435...|$|R

The presence of spatiotemporal intermittency in the interaction region could explain the essential features of the experimentally observed intermittency patterns (impact parameter and projectile dependence).
