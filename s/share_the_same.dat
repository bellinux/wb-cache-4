5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating {{to fly the}} 767 and <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles.

5|$|Kelowna International Airport, an {{international}} airport operated in nearby city of Kelowna, {{has had a}} small impact on this airport, since they both <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> catchment area. About 13percent of the local residents in 2007 choose the Kelowna International Airport over the Kamloops Airport to fly to regional destinations, specifically due to its significant growth. Despite this, some Kelowna residents choose the Kamloops Airport over their local airport.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> physical channel are called multiplex systems.

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Hsp90 {{binding site}} (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids that <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> biosynthetic pathway tend to {{have the}} same first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also {{tend to have}} similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|As {{with nearly}} all primates, strepsirrhines {{typically}} reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, {{as many as}} 11 or 12species <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny forest on {{the southern tip of}} the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.|$|E

5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make {{the arrangement of the}} orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures <b>share</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
