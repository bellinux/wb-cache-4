25|$|Toilet {{paper is}} a <b>soft</b> <b>paper</b> product (tissue paper) used to {{maintain}} personal hygiene after human defecation or urination. However, {{it can also}} be used for other purposes such as absorbing spillages or craft projects. Toilet paper in different forms has been used for centuries, namely in China. The ancient Greeks used clay and stone; the Romans, sponges and salt water. But according to a CNN article, the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe a person's buttocks was by New York City entrepreneur Joseph Gayetty, who in 1857, invented aloe-infused sheets of manila hemp dispensed from Kleenex-like boxes. However, Gayetty's toilet paper was a failure for several reasons. Americans soon grew accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog, they saw no need to spend money on toilet paper when catalogs for their use came in the mail for free, and because during the 19th century, it was a social taboo to openly discuss bathroom hygiene with others. Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott of the Scott Paper Company co-invented rolled toilet paper.|$|E

500|$|The book {{opens up}} with the introduction: [...] "Everything {{you are about to}} see and read is a fantasy, a dream, pretend". Throughout Sex, Madonna offers poems, stories, and essays. She also uses the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Mistress Dita" [...] as a homage to German actress Dita Parlo; her friends in these stories are Bunny, Dex, Stella, Chiclet and Stranger. According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{a big part of the}} book is read as a letter to a pornographic magazine. As a thank you for recovering the stolen pictures during the making of the book, in the credits of the book Madonna mentioned the FBI for [...] " ... rescuing photographs that would have made J. Edgar Hoover roll over." [...] Madonna also wanted to explore the notion of power in Sex. Melcher said that the artist wanted to talk about [...] "gentle and hard, soft and violent [...] She was playing out all those elements in her book. That was reflected in the materials: uncoated, <b>soft</b> <b>paper</b> on the inside and hard metal coating on the outside." ...|$|E

60|$|Neither spoke, and {{she applied}} her pocket handkerchief. What came peeling away under her pressure? It was the <b>soft</b> <b>paper,</b> {{and as she}} was passing {{the edge of the}} figure of the girl, she found a large smear {{following}} her finger. The peculiar brown of Indian ink was seen upon her handkerchief, and when she took it up a narrow hem of white had become apparent between the girl's head and its surroundings. Neither spectator spoke, they scarcely looked at her, when she took another drop from the vase, and using it more boldly found the pasted figure curling up and rending under her hand, lines of newspaper type becoming apparent, and the dark cloud spreading around.|$|E

Then you must have some pieces of <b>soft</b> <b>paper,</b> of the same size and shape, to put between them. You must also have a piece of cord or braid, or something of that kind, to tie around them, to keep them together. Then, when you are travelling, if you find any pretty flower, you can put it into this press, and put the press in your pocket. Thus, the press will not only be a souvenir itself, but it will procure for you a great many other souvenirs." ...|$|E

Whilst I was {{stroking}} the now quiescent cat, the Doctor went {{to the table and}} tore off a piece of blotting-paper from the writing-pad and came back. He laid the paper on his palm and, with a simple [...] "pardon me!" [...] to Miss Trelawny, placed the cat's paw on it and pressed it down with his other hand. The haughty cat seemed to resent somewhat the familiarity, and tried to draw its foot away. This was plainly what the Doctor wanted, for in the act the cat opened the sheaths of its claws and and made several reefs in the <b>soft</b> <b>paper.</b> Then Miss Trelawny took her pet away.

60|$|Adam throve, being prayed {{over before}} {{the gods of}} at least three creeds, in a garden almost as fair as Eden. There were {{gigantic}} clumps of bamboo that talked continually, and enormous plantains on whose <b>soft</b> <b>paper</b> skin he could scratch with his nails; green domes of mango-trees as huge as the dome of St. Paul's, full of parrots as big as cassowaries, and grey squirrels the size of foxes. At the end of the garden stood a hedge of flaming poinsettias higher than any-thing in the world, because, childlike, Adam's eye could not carry to the tops of the mango-trees. Their green went out against the blue sky, but the red poinsettias he could just see. A nurse who talked continually about snakes and pulled him back from the mouth of a fascinating dry well, and a mother who believed that the sun hurt little heads, were the only drawbacks to this loveliness. But, as his legs grew under him, he found that by scaling an enormous rampart -three feet of broken-down mud wall {{at the end of the}} garden - he could come into a ready-made kingdom where every one was his slave. Imam Din showed him the way one evening, and the police troopers cooking their supper received him with rapture, and gave him pieces of very indigestible but altogether delightful spiced bread.|$|E

"So I stole your keys, as I often do, Baas, when I want anything, {{because you}} leave them lying about everywhere, and to deceive you first opened {{one of the}} boxes that are full of square-face and brandy and left it open, for I wished you to think that I had just gone to get drunk like anybody else. Then I opened another box and got out two one-pound tins of the sugar which kills dogs and fowls. Half a pound of it I melted in boiling water with some real sugar to make the stuff sweet, {{and put it into}} a bottle. The rest I tied with string in twelve little packets in the <b>soft</b> <b>paper</b> which is in one of the boxes, and put them in my pocket. Then I went up the hill, Baas, to the place where I saw those goats are kraaled at night behind a reed fence. As I had hoped, no one was {{watching}} them because there are no tigers so near this town, and man does not steal the goats that are sacred. I went into the kraal and found a fat young ewe which had a kid. I dragged it out and, taking it behind some stones, I made its leg fast with a bit of cord and poured this stuff out of the bottle all over its skin, rubbing it in well. Then I tied the twelve packets of hard poison-sugar everywhere about its body, making them very fast deep in the long hair so that they could not tumble or rub off.|$|E

6000|$|I courted my {{wife from}} the {{footboard}} of the cart. I did indeed. She was a Suffolk young woman, {{and it was}} in Ipswich market-place right opposite the corn-chandler's shop. I had noticed her up at a window last Saturday that was, appreciating highly. I had took to her, and I had said to myself, [...] "If not already disposed of, I'll have that lot." [...] Next Saturday that come, I pitched the cart on the same pitch, and I was in very high feather indeed, keeping 'em laughing the whole of the time, and getting off the goods briskly. At last I took out of my waistcoat-pocket a small lot wrapped in <b>soft</b> <b>paper,</b> and I put it this way (looking up at the window where she was). [...] "Now here, my blooming English maidens, is an article, the last article of the present evening's sale, which I offer to only you, the lovely Suffolk Dumplings biling over with beauty, and I won't take a bid of a thousand pounds for from any man alive. Now what is it? Why, I'll tell you what it is. It's made of fine gold, and it's not broke, though there's a hole in the middle of it, and it's stronger than any fetter that ever was forged, though it's smaller than any finger in my set of ten. Why ten? Because, when my parents made over my property to me, I tell you true, there was twelve sheets, twelve towels, twelve table-cloths, twelve knives, twelve forks, twelve tablespoons, and twelve teaspoons, but my set of fingers was two short of a dozen, and could never since be matched. Now what else is it? Come, I'll tell you. It's a hoop of solid gold, wrapped in a silver curl-paper, that I myself took off the shining locks of the ever beautiful old lady in Threadneedle Street, London city; I wouldn't tell you so if I hadn't the paper to show, or you mightn't believe it even of me. Now what else is it? It's a man-trap and a handcuff, the parish stocks and a leg-lock, all in gold and all in one. Now what else is it? It's a wedding-ring. Now I'll tell you what I'm a going to do with it. I'm not a going to offer this lot for money; but I mean to give it to the next of you beauties that laughs, and I'll pay her a visit to-morrow morning at exactly half after nine o'clock as the chimes go, and I'll take her out for a walk to put up the banns." [...] She laughed, and got the ring handed up to her. When I called in the morning, she says, [...] "O dear! It's never you, and you never mean it?" [...] "It's ever me," [...] says I, [...] "and I am ever yours, and I ever mean it." [...] So we got married, after being put up three times--which, by the bye, is quite in the Cheap Jack way again, and shows once more how the Cheap Jack customs pervade society.|$|E
