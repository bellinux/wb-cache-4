5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, Commodore <b>sales</b> <b>were</b> {{beginning}} to decline.

Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira <b>sales</b> <b>were</b> strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a model of}} general equilibrium with incomplete markets in which firms can innovate by issuing arbitrary, costly securities. When short <b>sales</b> <b>are</b> prohibited, firms behave competitively and equilibrium is efficient. When short <b>sales</b> <b>are</b> allowed, these classical properties may fail. If unlimited short <b>sales</b> <b>are</b> allowed, imperfect competition may persist even {{when the number of}} potential innovators is large. If limited short <b>sales</b> <b>are</b> allowed, perfect competition may obtain in the limit, but equilibrium can be inefficient {{because of the presence of}} an externality: the private benefits of innovation for firms differ from the social benefits.
