25|$|Bangladesh is {{a unitary}} state and {{parliamentary}} democracy. Bangladesh also {{stands out as}} one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. “It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant — though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment — alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world”, <b>said</b> <b>Dan</b> Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. Experts say that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.|$|E
500|$|The team {{developed}} {{the story and}} design simultaneously. [...] "We use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan</b> Houser. Houser {{found it difficult to}} create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic [...] "rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy". The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity. Houser felt that each mission is [...] "its own short story", and part of an [...] "overarching story". Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by Martin Scorsese. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with post-it notes to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.|$|E
2500|$|During wartime, {{structures}} in Los Alamos were temporary {{because people were}} expecting to leave after the wartime project was completed. In August 1945, following the Allied victory in Japan, it was decided the Los Alamos Laboratory's nuclear research would continue in order to counter a rising Soviet threat. In 1946 Los Alamos begin erecting permanent structures, including Los Alamos High School. Life {{during the war and}} post-war transition was difficult for the first students of LAHS. [...] "' normal teenagers trying to have a normal life in very adverse conditions," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan</b> Nelis, one of the school's original students.|$|E

6000|$|After a {{prolonged}} caress, Joe <b>said</b> to <b>Dan,</b> as if answering the remark which the amateur detective {{had made a}} few moments previous: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Twenty-five shillings," [...] <b>said</b> old <b>Dan</b> reluctantly; [...] "an’ I’ll {{spend the}} odd five shillings on you chaps when we git to Limehouse." ...|$|R
2500|$|Transformations {{actually}} {{come in two}} types: (i) the post-Deep structure kind mentioned above, which are string or structure changing, and (ii) Generalized Transformations (GTs). Generalized transformations were originally proposed in the earliest forms of generative grammar (e.g., Chomsky 1957). They take small structures, either atomic or generated by other rules, and combine them. For example, the generalized transformation of embedding would take the kernel [...] "Dave said X" [...] and the kernel [...] "Dan likes smoking" [...] and combine them into [...] "Dave <b>said</b> <b>Dan</b> likes smoking." [...] GTs are thus structure building rather than structure changing. [...] In the Extended Standard Theory and government and binding theory, GTs were abandoned in favor of recursive phrase structure rules. However, they are still present in tree-adjoining grammar as the Substitution and Adjunction operations, and they have recently re-emerged in mainstream generative grammar in Minimalism, as the operations Merge and Move.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No use!' <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> questing like {{a puzzled}} hound. 'The dew's drying off, and old Hobden says otters'll travel for miles.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Three more owls,' <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> counting. 'Two stoats, four jays, and a kestrel. That's ten {{since last}} week. Ridley's a beast.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{fire has}} cost me seventy cents, besides the breakfast we lost when {{the place was}} burned," [...] he <b>said</b> to <b>Dan,</b> and the latter replied mournfully: ...|$|R
60|$|When the <b>said</b> court-marital--as <b>Dan</b> called it--was held, the {{compromise}} was agreed to, {{and it was}} finally fixed that six weeks thereafter the two couples should be united in Ben Nevis Hall.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{had been}} right when he <b>said</b> that <b>Dan</b> Baxter was like his father. Parent and son were {{thoroughly}} bad, but how bad the Rover boys and their friends were still to learn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, we'll get a splendiferous dinner," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan.</b> [...] "Cousin Mattie's a great {{cook and}} there's nothing stingy about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, they're {{the nicest}} kind of people," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> in optimistic generalisation. [...] "You'd like Mrs. Pasmer. She's awfully nice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not yet,' <b>said</b> <b>Dan.</b> 'Where's Mr Dudeney? Where's Master?' Old Jim {{looked as}} if he thought they were mad, and asked again.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a nasty {{wound to}} look at," [...] the major <b>said,</b> as <b>Dan</b> lifted the pad of wet linen. [...] "But with youth and health you will soon get round it, never fear." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Dan</b> <b>said</b> that Naomi Tani fit {{all these}} conditions, {{and that he}} used her {{as the model for}} several of the women in his novels. Commenting on Tani's sudden {{retirement}} at the height of her popularity in 1979, <b>Dan</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I went into shock. It {{was the end of the}} Golden Duo. I almost decided to quit writing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to go}} up to the engine-house for a spell; but I'll be in {{the room}} in time to go with you to school," [...] he <b>said</b> to <b>Dan,</b> and the latter replied cheerily: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, splendidly,' <b>said</b> <b>Dan.</b> 'Only afterwards, I think, {{we went to}} sleep. it {{was very}} hot and quiet. Don't you remember, Una?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That?' <b>said</b> <b>Dan</b> and Una, and stared, and stared, and stared. Mr Culpeper made {{impatient}} noises in {{his throat}} and went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anchored, sure enough, but his graound-tackle's kinder shifty," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> laughing. [...] "Whale's fouled it. [...] . Dip, Harve! Here they come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} to mind your head," [...] <b>said</b> Captain <b>Dan,</b> relighting the candle; [...] "you had better carry it in your hand in the levels, it will light your path better. Look out now--here is a winze." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an episode}} of Dan Vs., [...] "The Ninja", after Dan's milk carton {{exploded}} from the ninja's shuriken, a teenager <b>said</b> to <b>Dan</b> [...] "Drinking problem much?" [...] and Dan complained that the sentence had no verb, just a gerund.|$|R
60|$|<b>Dan</b> <b>said</b> nothing, {{but turned}} {{and made for}} the canoe {{with the speed of}} a porpoise. His {{companion}} followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you want}} to fight?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> {{promptly}} descending from the barrel and doubling up his fists in a business-like manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> {{wondering}} how Mr. Walters knew {{so much about}} him, and if these were the preliminaries of prosecution.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{tired to}} death, that's what's {{the matter with}} you," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> returning. [...] "You girls have worked like slaves today." ...|$|E
6000|$|The sailor {{agreed with}} effusive heartiness {{to all that}} he <b>said,</b> and <b>Dan</b> thought while he was speaking--orating--as one of the American {{settlers}} would have expressed it--that Jenkins wore a peculiar expression on his manly countenance. Attributing it to unusual interest in the event, he continued-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{involvement}} in Storage Wars {{has led to}} her being featured in several news articles including The Washington Post, USA Today and TMZ.

6000|$|... "Who's that boy?" [...] <b>said</b> Cheyne to <b>Dan,</b> well used to {{all manner}} of {{questions}} from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you mean}} old Hobden the hedger, he's only seventy-two. He {{told me so}} himself,' <b>said</b> <b>Dan.</b> 'He's a {{intimate}} friend of ours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' <b>said</b> <b>Dan,</b> 'I don't {{see what}} else she could have done, either--do you? How did they stop King Philip from getting Virginia?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh; thanks!--thank you aver so much!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dan.</b> [...] "I'll {{bring them}} to you--they'll understand!" [...] He slipped into the crowd again.|$|E
6000|$|Sam {{appeared}} {{to realize the}} truth of this statement, for he had no further suggestions to offer, and <b>Dan</b> <b>said,</b> after some reflection: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe's gone to Baltimore to live; {{went off}} last night," [...] <b>Dan</b> <b>said</b> promptly, and an {{expression}} of disappointment came over Jip's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they are}} local preachers. The {{last time you}} saw the upper one," [...] <b>said</b> Captain <b>Dan</b> with a smile, [...] "you were seated in the Wesleyan chapel, and he was in the pulpit dressed like a gentleman, and preaching as eloquently {{as if he had been}} educated at college and trained for the ministry." ...|$|R
