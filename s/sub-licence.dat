25|$|A {{report to}} the Christchurch City Council meeting of 13 December 2007 gives {{the details of the}} final loan arrangements. On 19 October 2007, two Council general {{managers}} signed the loan agreement with Dairy Holdings Limited. The amount initially borrowed from Dairy Holdings Limited is $NZ1.7 million out of a maximum of $4.8 million. The law firm Anthony Harper had certified that the loan was not contrary to the Memorandum of Agreement as the resource consent applications were not used as security. However, the loan agreement grants a <b>sub-licence</b> from CPWL to Dairy Holdings Limited to use the CPW water consents by taking water for irrigation from the Rakaia River. The <b>sub-licence</b> will start from the date the consents are granted to the date that the whole scheme is operational. The Christchurch City councillors voted (eight votes against, five votes for) not to accept the report.|$|E

40|$|The project {{aimed to}} map the JISC NESLi 2 Online Journals, Datasets, and Ebooks model {{licences}} into the ONIX for Publications Licenses (ONIX-PL) format, and to install the mapping into the ONIX-PL editing software that is being developed under a separate and parallel JISC-supported project. The first of the JISC model licences to be tackled was NESLi 2. A substantially complete first draft mapping was prepared manually and was sent to JISC Collections {{at the beginning of}} January 2007, accompanied by a list of queries that had arisen. At the same time, an examination of the Dataset and Ebooks <b>sub-licences</b> showed that there were unlikely to be further issues specific to those models, although there was some inconsistency between NESLi 2 and the others in the treatment of certain permitted usages. The whole of this work took place in parallel with, and has significantly influenced, the continuing development of the ONIX-PL format and the ONIX-PL Dictionary of terms used in licence expressions. It is noteworthy that the JISC licences include some quite specific permissions that were neither part of the existing ONIX-PL vocabulary, nor part of the DLF ERMI vocabulary on which some existing Electronic Resource Management (ERM) systems are based. The ONIX-PL vocabulary has been extended to include these permissions but it remains for future work to determine how such permissions can best be managed within a subscribing institution, whether through an ERM system or by other means...|$|R

Various arrangements were debated over the preceding three years following the previous limited liability company (controlled by minority shareholders) trading insolvently which forced UCSA to inject funds and restructure the organisation. After the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the radio station lost its base at the University of Canterbury and for the next three years, it broadcast from a modified horse truck.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Channel Four {{launched}} a dedicated horse racing channel, At the Races, {{in conjunction with}} British Sky Broadcasting and Arena Leisure plc, owner of 28 of Britain's racecourses. The channel ceased broadcasting in 2003 owing to financial problems, but was subsequently restructured and re-launched (without Channel 4's involvement) in June 2004 and it is branded with almost identical livery as Sky Sports. Channel 4's racing coverage, renamed to incorporate [...] "At The Races" [...] in the title, returned to its original name of Channel 4 Racing when the channel left involvement with At The Races. Channel 4 racing programmes now feature close co-operation with rival digital racing channel Racing UK, who <b>sub-licence</b> the live rights and share the same production company. Channel 4 cross-promote Racing UK's coverage of the day's racing during its broadcasts.|$|E
5000|$|... 'This {{is a very}} {{difficult}} issue. Most unagented authors (and some with agents) grant worldwide volume rights, <b>sub-licence</b> and subsidiary rights including translation rights to their publishers. Many publishers choose to sell or sub-license to their overseas associate companies. This can work in your favour; very often a publisher is able to give a larger advance because it knows that its associate will take the book overseas. In an ideal world its established relations with its associate company should allow the two companies to work smoothly together to ensure that sales are maximised. However, many authors are rightly suspicious that cosy deals go on within groups which result in lesser overall royalties to the author....Publishers must make reasonable endeavours to sell books, and must deal with third parties on a bona fide arm's length basis which is reasonable and fair to you. Publishers are not entitled to make a secret profit by selling through a subsidiary, particularly if you would have obtained more by direct sales.|$|E
