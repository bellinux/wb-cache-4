40|$|This study uses {{detailed}} {{monitoring of}} a peat catchment {{to estimate the}} amount of DOC loss within a stream. The study compares DOC concentrations and specific absorbances (absorbance at 400 nm per concentration of DOC) of shallow and deep soil waters with those at the catchment outlet. The mass balance between source and outlet is assessed by two methods: a simple method based upon a conservative tracer, and one based upon a principal component analysis using multiple tracers. The single tracer method suggests an average removal of 20 % while the principal component approach suggests 32 % removal. The rate of removal varies between 0. 03 and 23 mg C/day. On an annual basis the removal amounts to between 45. 8 and 85 ton C/year, equivalent to an areal loss of between 4 and 7. 4 g C/m 2 /year. The change in <b>specific</b> <b>absorbance,</b> at 400 nm, shows that the DOC is sourced from shallow soil water (10 cm) and not from the deep soil water (50 cm). There is consistent increase in <b>specific</b> <b>absorbance</b> through the catchment.

The dependency on many variables makes prediction of U transport in bench-scale experiments and in the field difficult. In particular, the identification of colloidal U phases poses a technical challenge. Transport of U in the presence and absence of natural organic matter (Suwannee River humic acid, SRHA) through silica sand and hematite coated silica sand was tested at pH 4 and 5 using static columns, where flow is controlled by gravity and residence time between advective pore volume exchanges can be strictly controlled.

Key results include that the transport of U through the columns was enhanced by pre-equilibration with SRHA, and previously deposited U was remobilized by the addition of SRHA.

No matter how the results were expressed, comparison of the Mab binding patterns of macrophages with those of blood monocytes showed that spleen macrophages bound significantly less F 4 / 80 and more M 5 / 114 (Ia antigen). Kupffer cells and skin macrophages bound either approximately the same amount or considerably less of the various Mabs than monocytes did. Pulmonary tissue and alveolar macrophages bound significantly more 30.
