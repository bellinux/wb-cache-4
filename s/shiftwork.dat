40|$|Although prior {{research}} has documented {{the harmful effects}} of <b>shiftwork</b> on health and well-being, the relationship between <b>shiftwork</b> and other workplace stressors remains unclear.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of seasonal changes in daylength on adaptation to <b>shiftwork.</b> <b>Shiftwork</b> can be problematic when it conflicts with our natural daily or circadian rhythms. As synchronization of the internal clock that drives circadian rhythms is achieved primarily through exposure to the light-dark cycle, <b>shiftwork</b> schedules during the winter months, which significantly restrict shiftworkers 2 ̆ 7 exposure to daylight, were expected to have particularly adverse effects on shiftworker health and well-being. A longitudinal study was conducted at the Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia, Canada from December 2001 until January 2003. Eighty-eight shiftworkers completed the Standard <b>Shiftwork</b> Index (SSI) and the 21 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in the summer, when daylight hours were longest, and in the winter, when daylight hours were shortest. The SSI provides six measures of <b>shiftwork</b> adaptation and four measures of individual difference factors associated with <b>shiftwork</b> adaptation. As predicted, there was a significant increase in psychological distress and depressed mood during the winter months, while sleep was more disturbed in the summer. Measures of physical health and psychosocial well-being, and relationships among explanatory and outcome variables, showed no seasonal effects. Across both seasons, neuroticism was the strongest predictor of adaptation to <b>shiftwork.</b> Findings provide evidence of a seasonal pattern of <b>shiftwork</b> adaptation and suggest that shiftworkers may be at risk for seasonal-type depression...|$|E
40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{identify}} {{the impact of}} <b>shiftwork</b> on individuals and their lives and to discuss the implications this has for nurses and nursing. Background: The context of <b>shiftwork</b> in the early 21 st century is changing rapidly, and those involved in or required to work <b>shiftwork</b> are now spread over many different sectors of the community. In the Australian community, 16 % of workers regularly work <b>shiftwork.</b> Most nurses undertake <b>shiftwork</b> {{at some time in}} their career, and health services could not operate without a shiftworking nursing workforce. Design: Narrative literature review. Methods: A narrative review of journal articles was conducted. Databases searched were CINAHL, EBSCO Host, JSTOR, Medline/PubMed and Google Scholar. Search terms used were ‘shiftwork’ and ‘shift work’. Limitations included ‘English language’, ‘published between 1980 – 2013 ’ and ‘human’. Results: Reviewed for this paper were 118 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Results were categorised using thematic analysis. Themes that emerged were physical and psychosocial health, and sleep. Findings will be explored under these themes. Conclusions: <b>Shiftwork</b> research has mainly focussed on the physiological and psychosocial health and sleep effects. Absent from the literature are studies focussing on the personal experience of the shiftworker and how workers mediate the effects of <b>shiftwork</b> and how <b>shiftwork</b> fits into the rest of their lives. Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions about how people ‘manage’ their <b>shiftwork,</b> and further research needs to be undertaken in this area. Relevance to clinical practice: Working shifts for nurses is a reality that comes with the profession. While there is a significant body of research on <b>shiftwork,</b> little of this has been specifically applied to nursing, and the implications for individual nurses needing to care for their own health have not been drawn...|$|E

40|$|Research into {{workplace}} {{influences on}} the gambling behaviour of gaming venue employees found that <b>shiftwork</b> was perceived by most employees as the key factor encouraging gambling by venue staff. Using a qualitative design, researchers visited venues in 5 regions of Queensland to interview 92 employees from hotels, licensed clubs and casinos. A thematic analysis uncovered key reasons for <b>shiftwork</b> being seen as more important than other workplace influences. These themes include: a lack of alternative social opportunities, only gambling venues are open after late shifts, staff tend to socialise with other hospitality workers, social isolation, gamble to fill in time, and <b>shiftwork</b> {{makes it easier to}} hide heavy gambling. However, some interviewees felt <b>shiftwork</b> discouraged them from gambling, because most gambling venues are closed after finishing late shift and <b>shiftwork</b> means they go out less overall. Other employees considered that <b>shiftwork</b> had no influence, because they find other activities in their time off and/or they just go home after a shift. Providing more regular shifts and promoting family and alternative social and recreational activities for staff are measures venues could implement to help counter these effects.

40|$|Dissatisfaction with <b>shiftwork</b> {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} with age and work experience. The objective was to determine if differences in preferred paid work time existed between shiftworkers with different lengths of <b>shiftwork</b> experience and age-matched non-shiftworkers (controls). A questionnaire was used to determine how controls and shiftworkers with different <b>shiftwork</b> experience perceived the value of preferred work time across the week. Participants were required to value each hour across the days of the week on a scale from 0 (least preference) to 10 (highest preference). Data were analysed across groups to produce mean and standard deviation matrices. Unpaired t-tests determined significant differences between groups. This study found that preferred hours-of-work change with years of <b>shiftwork</b> experience. For shiftworkers in their first 5 years and those in their 30 th-year-plus of <b>shiftwork,</b> night work was a low priority. Shiftworkers with 17 – 30 years experience indicated a preference for work any time across the week. Overall, shiftworkers extended their preferred work hours to include the evenings and weekend. Controls adhered more strongly to current societal norms.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} an association between <b>shiftwork</b> and coronary heart disease. The increased risk {{could be due to}} job strain, which could act as a mediator of disease. There is also a possibility that interaction between <b>shiftwork</b> and job strain could occur that may induce or modify the development of disease. We conducted this study to explore the relation between <b>shiftwork,</b> job strain, and myocardial infarction. METHODS: 2006 cases with acute first time myocardial infarction were compared with 2642 controls without symptoms of myocardial infarction, and obtained from the same population that gave rise to the cases (population based case-control study). RESULTS: Myocardial infarction risk was associated with <b>shiftwork</b> both in men (odds ratio (OR) 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 1 to 1. 6) and women (OR 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 9 to 1. 8). In the age group 45 - 55, the relative risk was 1. 6 in men and 3. 0 in women. The results cannot be explained by job strain, age, job education level, or smoking. No interaction was found between <b>shiftwork</b> and job strain. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that <b>shiftwork</b> is associated with myocardial infarction in both men and women.

40|$|Exposure to <b>shiftwork</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with multiple health disorders and cognitive impairments in humans. We tested if we could replicate metabolic and cognitive consequences of <b>shiftwork,</b> as reported in humans, in a rat model comparable to 5 wks of non-rotating night shifts. The following hypotheses were addressed: (i) <b>shiftwork</b> enhances body-weight gain, which would indicate metabolic effects; and (ii) <b>shiftwork</b> negatively affects learning of a simple goal-directed behavior, i. e., the association of lever pressing with food reward (instrumental learning), which would indicate cognitive effects. We used a novel method of forced locomotion to model work during the animals' normal resting period. We first show that Wistar rats, indeed, are active throughout a <b>shiftwork</b> protocol. In contrast with previous findings, the <b>shiftwork</b> protocol attenuated the normal weight gain to 76 +/- 8 g in 5 wks as compared to 123 +/- 15 g in the control group. The discrepancy with previous work may be explained by the concurrent observation that with our <b>shiftwork</b> protocol rats did not adjust their between-work circadian activity pattern. They maintained a normal level of activity during the "off-work" periods. In the control experiment, rats were kept active during the dark period, normally dominated by activity. This demonstrated that forced activity, per se, did not affect body-weight gain (mean +/- SEM: 85 +/- 11 g over 5 wks as compared to 84 +/- 11 g in the control group). Rats were trained on an instrumental learning paradigm during the fifth week of the protocol. All groups showed equivalent increases in lever pressing from the first (3. 8 +/-. 7) to the sixth (21. 3 +/- 2. 4) session, and needed a similar amount of sessions (5. 1 +/-. 3) to reach a learning criterion (>= 27 out of 30 lever presses). These results suggest that while on prolonged non-rotating <b>shiftwork,</b> not fully reversing the circadian rhythm might actually be beneficial to prevent body-weight gain and cognitive impairments.

40|$|Characteristics of <b>shiftwork</b> {{schedules}} {{have implications}} for off-shift well-being. We examined {{the extent to which}} several shift characteristics (e. g., shift length, working sundays) are associated with three aspects of off-shift well-being: work-to-family conflict, physical well-being, and mental wellbeing. We also investigated whether these relationships differed in four nations. The Survey of Work and Time was completed by 906 healthcare professionals located in Australia, Brazil, Croatia, and the USA. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses supported the hypothesis that <b>shiftwork</b> characteristics account for significant unique variance in all three measures of well-being beyond that accounted for by work and family demands and personal characteristics. The patterns of regression weights indicated that particular <b>shiftwork</b> characteristics have differential relevance to indices of work-to-family conflict, physical well-being, and mental well-being. Our findings suggest that healthcare organizations should carefully consider the implications of <b>shiftwork</b> characteristics for off-shift well-being. Furthermore, although our findings did not indicate national differences in the nature of relationships between shift characteristics and well-being, <b>shiftwork</b> characteristics and demographics for healthcare professionals differ in systematic ways among nations; as such, effective solutions may be context-specific.

40|$|Our current 24 -h society {{requires}} {{an increasing number}} of employees to work nightshifts with millions of people worldwide working during the evening or night. Clear associations have been found between <b>shiftwork</b> and the risk to develop metabolic health problems, such as obesity. An increasing number of studies suggest that the underlying mechanism includes disruption of the rhythmically organized body physiology. Normally, daily 24 -h rhythms in physiological processes are controlled by the central clock in the brain in close collaboration with peripheral clocks present throughout the body. Working schedules of shiftworkers greatly interfere with these normal daily rhythms by exposing the individual to contrasting inputs, i. e., at the one hand (dim) light exposure at night, nightly activity and eating and at the other hand daytime sleep and reduced light exposure. Several different animal models are being used to mimic <b>shiftwork</b> and study the mechanism responsible for the observed correlation between <b>shiftwork</b> and metabolic diseases. In this review we aim to provide an overview of the available animal studies with a focus on the four most relevant models that are being used to mimic human shiftwork: altered timing of (1) food intake, (2) activity, (3) sleep, or (4) light exposure. For all studies we scored whether and how relevant metabolic parameters, such as bodyweight, adiposity and plasma glucose were affected by the manipulation. In the discussion, we focus on differences between <b>shiftwork</b> models and animal species (i. e., rat and mouse). In addition, we comment on the complexity of <b>shiftwork</b> as an exposure and the subsequent difficulties when using animal models to investigate this condition. In view of the added value of animal models over human cohorts to study the effects and mechanisms of <b>shiftwork,</b> we conclude with recommendations to improve future research protocols to study the causality between <b>shiftwork</b> and metabolic health problems using animal model...|$|E

40|$|It is {{becoming}} widely recognised that <b>shiftwork</b> has significant {{implications for the}} health, safety {{and quality of life}} of shiftworkers. To date, little research has been carried out on how individuals cope with the problems caused by <b>shiftwork</b> and how effective coping strategies maintain their health and well-being. It has been proposed, by Monk (1994), {{that there are a number}} of aspects of a shiftworker's life which are important in determining the ability of an individual to cope with <b>shiftwork.</b> These factors are an individual's circadian rhythms, sleep patterns, and social and domestic situation. Further literature also suggests that workplace factors and coping style are an important part of tolerating <b>shiftwork.</b> The primary aim of the present study was to determine which factors are important in predicting the physical and mental well-being of Air Traffic Services staff working on shifts. It was hypothesised that individuals who are evening types, have few social, domestic, sleep, and work place difficulties will be physically and mentally healthy. In addition, it was hypothesised that the use of engagement strategies in dealing with <b>shiftwork</b> related problems will relate to better physical and mental health. To test the hypotheses, 183 Air Traffic Services staff from Melbourne centre, Australia were surveyed by questionnaire. The results of the regressions showed that physical health was predicted by variables from each of the five areas considered; circadian typology, the social and domestic situation, work place factors, sleep patterns and coping style. Mental well-being was best predicted by a single domestic variable, which is the extent to which <b>shiftwork</b> caused domestic problems and the two coping variables of engagement and disengagement. The results support the suggestion that in order for an individual to be able to tolerate <b>shiftwork</b> they must have strategies in place to help them deal with the effect of <b>shiftwork</b> variables on a range of factors in their lives. An additional aim of the present study was to determine the reliability of a questionnaire for use with Air Traffic Services staff.
