5000|$|In 19th-century handwriting, these {{terminals}} {{were often}} elevated, {{that is to}} say written as <b>superscripts</b> (e.g. 2, 34). With the gradual introduction of the typewriter in the late 19th century, it became common to write them on the line in typewritten texts, and this usage even became recommended in certain 20th-century style guides.Thus, the 16th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style states: [...] "The letters in ordinal numbers should not appear as <b>superscripts</b> (e.g., 122nd not 122)", as do the Bluebook and style guides by the Council of Science Editors, Microsoft, and Yahoo. Two problems are that <b>superscripts</b> are used [...] "most often in citations" [...] and are [...] "tiny and hard to read". Some word processors format ordinal indicators as <b>superscripts</b> by default (e.g. Microsoft Word). Style guide author Jack Lynch (Rutgers) recommends turning off automatic <b>superscripting</b> of ordinals in Microsoft Word, because [...] "no professionally printed books use superscripts".|$|R
30|$|When necessary, {{we shall}} use <b>superscripts</b> {{to inform the}} {{parameters}} of attack, namely the type of attack (parallel or sequential) using the respective symbols (∥ or ∴), and the intrusion adversarial effort (IAE) λ. Whenever clear in the context, we may omit these <b>superscripts.</b>|$|R

Although this <b>superscripting</b> of layers should be appended to all variables, for notational simplicity we shall remove it from all formulae of the manuscript when deduced by the context.|$|R
5|$|<b>Superscript</b> {{notation}} is also used, {{especially in}} group theory, to indicate conjugation. That is, , where g and h are elements of some group. Although conjugation obeys {{some of the}} same laws as exponentiation, it is not an example of repeated multiplication in any sense. A quandle is an algebraic structure in which these laws of conjugation play a central role.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} several power-associative binary {{operations}} defined on a set, any of which might be iterated, {{it is common to}} indicate which operation is being repeated by placing its symbol in the <b>superscript.</b> Thus, x∗n is , while x#n is , whatever the operations ∗ and # might be.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table, the years {{correspond to the}} year of book's release; the ceremonies are always held {{the following}} year. Entries with a lavender background have won the relevant award; those with a white background are the nominees. Entries with a green background are current nominees, from which a winner {{has yet to be}} chosen. <b>Superscript</b> letters after the result indicate simultaneous nominations in other categories. Categories are abbreviated, the official category titles are presented in the key.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, high <b>superscripts</b> {{are used}} for exponentiation to {{indicate}} that one number or variable is raised {{to the power of}} another number or variable. Thus y4 is y raised to the fourth power, 2x is 2 raised to the power of x, and the famous equation E=mc² includes a term for the speed of light squared. This led over time to an “abuse of notation” whereby <b>superscripts</b> indicate iterative function composition, including derivatives. In an unrelated use, <b>superscripts</b> also indicate contravariant tensors in Ricci calculus.|$|R

5|$|In the {{following}} table, the years {{correspond to the}} year of the award ceremonies; the books were all first published before the founding of the awards in 1998. No novels have been inducted into the Hall of Fame since 2003. Entries in bold and with a lavender background were inducted into the Hall of Fame that year; those that are neither highlighted nor in bold were not inducted that year (NI), but may be inducted later (IL). <b>Superscript</b> letters after the result indicate simultaneous nominations in other categories.|$|E
5|$|Placing {{an integer}} <b>superscript</b> after the name or {{symbol of a}} {{function}}, as if the function were being raised to a power, commonly refers to repeated function composition rather than repeated multiplication. Thus, f 3(x) may mean f(f(f(x))); in particular, f −1(x) usually denotes the inverse function of f. Iterated functions are {{of interest in the}} study of fractals and dynamical systems. Babbage was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1/2(x).|$|E
25|$|Note: The <b>superscript</b> (n) is {{an index}} {{and not an}} exponent.|$|E
50|$|In {{a context}} where tensor index {{notation}} {{is used to}} manipulate tensor components, the Levi-Civita symbol may be written with its indices as either subscripts or <b>superscripts</b> with no change in meaning, as might be convenient. Thus, one could writeIn these examples, <b>superscripts</b> should be considered equivalent with subscripts.|$|R
50|$|In addition, several scripts use glyph {{position}} such as <b>superscripts</b> and subscripts {{to differentiate}} semantics. In these cases subscripts and <b>superscripts</b> {{are not merely}} rich text, but constitute a distinct character — similar to a hybrid between a diacritic and a letter — in the writing system (130 total).|$|R

25|$|In a {{parallel}} development, the HP38G {{also used the}} HP48 series' character set internally. Starting with the HP39G in 2000, the <b>superscript</b> 3 (³) at codepoint 179 (0xB3) {{was replaced by a}} <b>superscript</b> -1 (−1) in the HP39/40 series (except for the HP39gII, which started to use Unicode). Codepoint 160 (0xA0) was also changed to the euro sign (€) in this third variant of the character set.|$|E
25|$|The <b>superscript</b> rhotic {{diacritics}} were {{no longer}} mentioned, though they were still available, as they follow from the general principals of diacritics.|$|E
25|$|Positive and {{negative}} sets are denoted by a <b>superscript</b> - or +. For example, ℚ+ represents {{the set of}} positive rational numbers.|$|E

50|$|Usage of {{subscripts}} and <b>superscripts</b> is also {{an important}} convention. In the early days of computers with limited graphical capabilities for text, subscripts and <b>superscripts</b> were represented with the help of additional notation. In particular, n2 could be written as n^2 or n**2 (the latter borrowed from FORTRAN) and n2 could be written as n_2.|$|R
25|$|In the Cree family, vowels {{are marked}} by {{rotating}} or flipping the consonants, and final consonants are indicated with either special diacritics or <b>superscript</b> forms of the main initial consonants.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{pharmaceutical}} drugs, there is standardization {{of the drug}} nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals, although various standards coexist. The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as atomic weight, no space, element symbol) in parentheses with no <b>superscript,</b> followed by the ligand (if any). It is common to see square brackets and <b>superscript</b> superimposed onto the INN name, because chemical nomenclature (such as IUPAC nomenclature) uses those. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) name gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as element symbol, space, atomic weight) with no parentheses, no hyphen, and no <b>superscript,</b> followed by the ligand (if any). The USP style is not the INN style, despite their being described as {{one and the same}} in some publications (e.g., AMA, whose style for radiopharmaceuticals matches the USP style). The United States Pharmacopeial Convention is a sponsor organization of the USAN Council, and the USAN for a given drug is often the same as the USP name.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing {{think of it as a}} 0), and if there is a carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in <b>superscript</b> under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the {{resulting}} sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a <b>superscript</b> to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit then do not write this carry-digit as a <b>superscript,</b> but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E
