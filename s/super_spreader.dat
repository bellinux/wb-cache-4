40|$|Heterogeneity in host {{populations and}} {{communities}} can have large {{effects on the}} transmission and control of a pathogen. In extreme cases, a few individuals give rise {{to the majority of}} secondary infections, which have been termed super spreading events. Here, we show that transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) is dominated by extreme heterogeneity in the host community, resulting in highly inflated reproductive ratios. A single relatively uncommon avian species, American robin (Turdus migratorius), appeared to be responsible for the majority of WNV-infectious mosquitoes and acted as the species equivalent of a <b>super</b> <b>spreader</b> for this multi-host pathogen. Crows were also highly preferred by mosquitoes at some sites, while house sparrows were significantly avoided. Nonetheless, due to their relative rarity, corvids (crows and jays) were relatively unimportant in WNV amplification. These results challenge current beliefs about the role of certain avian species in WNV amplification and demonstrate the importance of determining contact rates between vectors and host species to understand pathogen transmission dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The transcontinental {{spread of}} multidrug-resistant (MDR) {{tuberculosis}} is poorly characterized in molecular epidemiologic studies. We used genomic sequencing {{to understand the}} establishment and dispersion of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis within a group of immigrants to the United States. We used a genomic epidemiology approach to study a genotypically matched (by spoligotype, IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism, and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeat signature) lineage 2 /Beijing MDR strain implicated in an outbreak of tuberculosis among refugees in Thailand and consecutive cases within California. All 46 MDR M. tuberculosis genomes from both Thailand and California were highly related, with a median difference of 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The Wat Tham Krabok (WTK) strain is a new sequence type distinguished from all known Beijing strains by 55 SNPs and a genomic deletion (Rv 1267 c) associated with increased fitness. Sequence data revealed a highly prevalent MDR strain that included several closely related but distinct allelic variants within Thailand, rather than the occurrence of a single outbreak. In California, sequencing data supported multiple independent introductions of WTK with subsequent transmission and reactivation within the state, {{as well as a}} potential <b>super</b> <b>spreader</b> with a prolonged infectious period. Twenty-seven drug resistance-conferring mutations and 4 putative compensatory mutations were found within WTK strains. Genomic sequencing has substantial epidemiologic value in both low- and high-burden settings in understanding transmission chains of highly prevalent MDR strain...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{intriguing}} {{characteristics of the}} 2003 {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemics was the occurrence of super spreading events (SSEs). Here, the authors report the results of identifying the occurrence of SSEs in the Hong Kong and Singapore epidemics using mathematical and statistical analysis. Their predicted occurrence of SSEs agreed well with the reported occurrence of all seven <b>super</b> <b>spreaders</b> in the two cities. Additional unidentified SSEs were also found to exist. It was found that 71. 1 % and 74. 8 % of the infections were attributable to SSEs in Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. There also seemed to be "synchronized" occurrences of infection peaks in both the community and the hospitals in Hong Kong. The results strongly suggested that the infection did not depend on the total number of symptomatic cases, with only a very small proportion of symptomatic individuals being shown to be infectious (i. e., able to infect other individuals). The authors found that the daily infection rate did not correlate with the daily total number of symptomatic cases but with the daily number of symptomatic cases who were not admitted to a hospital within 4 days of the onset of symptoms. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Mathematical {{modeling}} is {{an important}} approach to study information diffusion in online social networks. Prior {{studies have focused on}} the modeling of the temporal aspect of information diffusion. A recent effort introduced the spatio-temporal diffusion problem and addressed the problem with a theoretical framework built on the similarity between informa-tion propagation in online social networks and biological inva-sion in ecology [1]. This paper examines the spatio-temporal characteristics in further depth and reveals that there exist regularities in information diffusion in temporal and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we propose a simpler linear partial differential equation that takes account of the influence of spatial population density and temporal decay of user interests in the information. We validate the proposed linear model with Digg news stories which received more than 3000 votes during June 2009, and show that the model can describe nearly 60 % of the news stories with over 80 % accuracy. We also use the most popular news story as a case study and find that the linear diffusive model can achieve an accuracy as high as 97 : 41 % for this news story. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this model towards finding <b>super</b> <b>spreaders</b> and classifying news story into groups. Keywords-information diffusion, mathematical modeling, PDE, spatio-temporal, online social network. I...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} {{infection}} spread on networks predict that targeting vaccination at {{individuals with a}} very large number of contacts (superspreaders) can reduce infection incidence by a significant margin. These models generally assume that superspreaders will always agree to be vaccinated. Hence, they cannot capture unintended consequences such as policy resistance, where the behavioral response induced by a new vaccine policy tends to reduce the expected benefits of the policy. Here, we couple a model of influenza transmission on an empirically-based contact network with a psychologically structured model of influenza vaccinating behavior, where individual vaccinating decisions depend on social learning and past experiences of perceived infections, vaccine complications and vaccine failures. We find that policy resistance almost completely undermines the effectiveness of superspreader strategies: the most commonly explored approaches that target a randomly chosen neighbor of an individual, or that preferentially choose neighbors with many contacts, provide at best a 2 % relative improvement over their non-targeted counterpart as compared to 12 % when behavioral feedbacks are ignored. Increased vaccine coverage in <b>super</b> <b>spreaders</b> is offset by decreased coverage in non-superspreaders, and superspreaders also have a higher rate of perceived vaccine failures on account of being infected more often. Including incentives for vaccination provides modest improvements in outcomes. We conclude that the design of influenza vaccine strategies involving widespread incentive use and/or targeting of superspreaders should account fo...|$|R
40|$|Internet {{has become}} an {{essential}} part of the daily life for billions of users worldwide. However, everyday we are still reading news stories about major security breaches, new polymorphic worm/virus spreading, identity theft, DDoS or phishing emails. Attackers are using botnets as an effective tool to conduct a wide range of criminal activities even more efficiently than before. It becomes very challenging to detect/defend cyber attacks in high-speed networks nowadays. Firstly, the Internet traffic exhibits huge fluctuations and long range dependence, which makes the attack traffic often be hidden by large volumes of normal traffic. In order to get reliable information for the malicious traffic, we must be able to process each packet in a wire speed. Secondly, ISPs want to detect the attacks when they are still at a low-profile volume in order to reduce the damage as much and early as possible. Therefore, the detection algorithm should be able to correlate multiple data sources and identify the root of causes efficiently. In this dissertation, we propose data streaming algorithms to detect/defend cyber attacks in high-speed networks. We propose a novel data structure to detect click frauds in the online advertising network, and track the command-and-control communications in the botnets. Next, we introduce a fast sketch for the aggregate queries in high-speed network traffic, which can preserve some critical information for root cause analysis, like IP addresses, port numbers, etc. This sketch can also be extended to track <b>super</b> <b>spreaders.</b> Lastly, we apply the low-rank matrix approximation to monitor network-wide traffic anomalies and traffic activity graphs...|$|R
