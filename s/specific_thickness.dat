50|$|Steel {{that has}} been freshly ground or {{polished}} will form oxide layers when heated. At a very specific temperature, the iron oxide will form a layer with a very <b>specific</b> <b>thickness,</b> causing thin-film interference. This causes colors {{to appear on the}} surface of the steel. As temperature is increased, the iron oxide layer grows in thickness, changing the color. These colors, called tempering colors, have been used for centuries to gauge the temperature of the metal. At around 350˚F (176˚C) the steel will start to take on a very light, yellowish hue. At 400˚F (204˚C), the steel will become a noticeable light-straw color, and at 440˚F (226˚C), the color will become dark-straw. At 500˚F (260˚C), steel will turn brown, while at 540˚F (282˚C) it will turn purple. At 590˚F (310˚C) the steel turns a very deep blue, but at 640˚F (337˚C) it becomes a rather light blue.|$|E
50|$|Masonry heaters take a {{long time}} (from 5 hours up to two days) to get up to the right {{temperature}} and so are not always practical for taking the chill off a single cool evening or morning. The speed with which a masonry heater achieves the right temperature is called its responsiveness. Responsiveness is determined by the <b>specific</b> <b>thickness</b> and characteristics of the materials used in its construction. Very responsive heaters warm up faster and are good for quicker adjustments to indoor temperature. Less responsive heaters take longer to warm, but they are well-suited for long periods of cold weather because they store heat so well and provide dependable, even heat all day and night. Because the radiant heat is given off at a low level a masonry heater is not likely to overheat a home the way a metal stove might in warmer parts of the year like fall or spring.|$|E
40|$|Surface pitting {{fatigue life}} tests were {{conducted}} with five lubricants, using spur gears made from a single lot of consumable-electrode vacuum melted (CVM) AISI 9310 steel. The gears were case carbonized and hardened to a Rockwell c- 60 and finish ground. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm.

Conversely, the relative cap thickness was increased with age increased. With respect to confluence trait, the present results observed that both brown and white eggs owned shells with similar values of confluence.

40|$|One of {{the main}} gear damage {{mechanisms}} is the formation of pitting and spalling on the tooth flank. Several factors have significant influence on the damage formation, such as: contact stress level; tooth profile type; relative contact speed; surface finish and lubrication conditions. This work comprehends the global observation of all such parameters and was carried out to explain the phenomena related to this wear mechanism. The wear test equipment uses the power recirculation principle and {{is commonly known as}} FZG test rig. The gears were made from AISI 8620 steel and had two types of surface finishing (by shaving or by milling).

50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the <b>specific</b> <b>thickness</b> and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|E
