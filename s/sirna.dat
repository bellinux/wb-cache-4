5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, <b>siRNA</b> {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering <b>siRNA</b> to deep tissues, the <b>siRNA</b> must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of <b>siRNA</b> to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to safety}} {{concerns}} with viral vectors, nonviral delivery methods, typically employing lipid-based or polymeric vectors, are also promising candidates. Computational modeling of nonviral <b>siRNA</b> delivery paired with in vitro and in vivo gene knockdown studies elucidated the temporal behavior of RNAi in these systems. The model used an input bolus dose of <b>siRNA</b> and computationally and experimentally showed that knockdown duration was dependent {{mainly on the}} doubling time of the cells to which <b>siRNA</b> was delivered, while peak knockdown depended primarily on the delivered dose. Kinetic considerations of RNAi are imperative to safe and effective dosing schedules as nonviral methods of inducing RNAi continue to be developed.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single <b>siRNA</b> for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design <b>siRNA</b> libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{distinction}} between the effective <b>siRNAs</b> and the ineffective ones is in high demand for gene knockout technology. To design effective <b>siRNAs,</b> many approaches have been proposed. Those approaches attempt to classify the <b>siRNAs</b> into effective and ineffective classes but they are difficult to decide the boundary between these two classes. Findings Here, we try to split effective and ineffective <b>siRNAs</b> into many smaller subclasses by RMP-MiC(the relative mean probabilities of <b>siRNAs</b> with the mini-clusters algorithm). The relative mean probabilities of <b>siRNAs</b> are the modified arithmetic mean value of three probabilities, which come from three Markov chain of effective <b>siRNAs.</b> The mini-clusters algorithm is {{a modified version of}} micro-cluster algorithm. Conclusions When the RMP-MiC was applied to the experimental <b>siRNAs,</b> the result shows that all effective <b>siRNAs</b> can be identified correctly, and no more than 9 % ineffective <b>siRNAs</b> are misidentified as effective ones.

5|$|In C. elegans this {{initiation}} {{response is}} amplified through {{the synthesis of}} a population of 'secondary' <b>siRNAs</b> during which the dicer-produced initiating or 'primary' <b>siRNAs</b> are used as templates. These 'secondary' <b>siRNAs</b> are structurally distinct from dicer-produced <b>siRNAs</b> and appear to be produced by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).|$|R
5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each <b>siRNA</b> is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of <b>siRNA.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. Differently from <b>siRNA,</b> a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as <b>siRNA</b> substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian interferon response, a form of innate immunity that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of <b>siRNA,</b> for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E

However, RDE-1 shows no stable association with the more abundant secondary <b>siRNAs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Synthetic small interfering RNAs (<b>siRNAs)</b> are an {{indispensable}} tool to investigate gene function in eukaryotic cells 1, 2 {{and may be}} used for therapeutic purposes to knockdown genes implicated in disease 3. Thus far, most synthetic <b>siRNAs</b> have been produced by chemical synthesis. Here we present a method to produce highly potent <b>siRNAs</b> in E. coli. This method relies on ectopic expression of p 19, a siRNA-binding protein found in a plant RNA virus 4, 5. When expressed in E. coli, p 19 stabilizes ~ 21 nt siRNA-like species produced by bacterial RNase III. Transfection of mammalian cells with <b>siRNAs,</b> generated in bacteria expressing p 19 and a hairpin RNA encoding 200 or more nucleotides of a target gene, at low nanomolar concentrations reproducibly knocks down gene expression by ~ 90 % without immunogenicity or off-target effects. Because bacterially produced <b>siRNAs</b> contain multiple sequences against a target gene, they may be especially useful for suppressing polymorphic cellular or viral genes.

40|$|Small RNAs (sRNAs) are ~ 20 to 24 {{nucleotide}} single-stranded RNAs {{that play}} crucial roles in regulation of gene expression. In plants, sRNAs are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs), repeat-associated <b>siRNAs</b> (ra-siRNAs), phased <b>siRNAs</b> (pha-siRNAs), cis and trans natural antisense transcript <b>siRNAs</b> (cis- and trans-nat <b>siRNAs).</b> Pima (Gossypium barbadense L.) {{is one of}} the most economically important fiber crops, producing the best and longest spin-nable fiber. Although some miRNAs are profiled in Pima, little is known about <b>siRNAs,</b> the largest subclass of plant sRNAs. In order to profile these gene regulators in Pima, a compre-hensive analysis of sRNAs was conducted by mining publicly available sRNA data, leading to identification of 678 miRNAs, 3, 559, 126 ra-siRNAs, 627 pha-siRNAs, 136, 600 cis-nat <b>siRNAs</b> and 79, 994 trans-nat <b>siRNAs.</b> The 678 miRNAs, belonging to 98 conserved and 402 lineage-specific families, were produced from 2, 138 precursors, of which 297 arose from introns, exons, or intron/UTR-exon junctions of protein-coding genes.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an algorithm for the prediction of dual-targeting short interfering RNAs (<b>siRNAs)</b> in which both strands are deliberately designed to separately target different mRNA transcripts with complete complementarity. An advantage of this approach versus the use of two separate duplexes is that only two strands, as opposed to four, are competing for entry into the RNA-induced silencing complex. We chose to design our dual-targeting <b>siRNAs</b> as Dicer substrate 25 / 27 mer <b>siRNAs,</b> since design features resembling pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) can be introduced for Dicer processing. Seven different dual-targeting <b>siRNAs</b> targeting genes that are potential targets in cancer therapy have been developed including Bcl 2, Stat 3, CCND 1, BIRC 5, and MYC. The dual-targeting <b>siRNAs</b> have been characterized for dual target knockdown in three different cell lines (HEK 293, HCT 116, and PC 3), where they were as effective as their corresponding single-targeting <b>siRNAs</b> in target knockdown.

5|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA-bound argonaute protein. Here, the phosphorylated 5' {{end of the}} RNA strand enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation (an atom with two positive charges) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth) between the 5' nucleotide in the <b>siRNA</b> and a conserved tyrosine residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the <b>siRNA</b> to its mRNA target. Analysis of the inhibitory effect of mismatches in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the length}} of RNA chain, RNA {{includes}} small RNA and long RNA. Usually, small RNAs are shorter than 200nt in length, and long RNAs are greater than 200nt long. Long RNAs, also called large RNAs, mainly include long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA. Small RNAs mainly include 5.8S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (<b>siRNA),</b> small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) and small rDNA-derived RNA (srRNA).|$|E
5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound <b>siRNA.</b> As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional <b>siRNA.</b> However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe use native gel {{electrophoresis}} to characterize complexes that mediate RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila. Our data reveal three distinct complexes (R 1, R 2, and R 3) that assemble on short interfering RNAs (<b>siRNAs)</b> in vitro. To form, all three complexes require Dicer- 2 (Dcr- 2), which directly contacts <b>siRNAs</b> in the ATP-independent R 1 complex. R 1 {{serves as a}} precursor to both the R 2 and R 3 complexes. R 3 is a large (80 S), ATP-enhanced complex that contains unwound <b>siRNAs,</b> cofractionates with known RNAi factors, and binds and cleaves targeted mRNAs in a cognate-siRNA-dependent manner. Our results establish an ordered biochemical pathway for RISC assembly and indicate that <b>siRNAs</b> must first interact with Dcr- 2 to reach the R 3 “holo-RISC” complex. Dcr- 2 does not simply transfer <b>siRNAs</b> to a distinct effector complex, but rather assembles into RISC along with the <b>siRNAs,</b> indicating that its role extends beyond the initiation phase of RNAi...|$|R

5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and <b>siRNA</b> knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are phosphorothioate linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of <b>siRNA,</b> at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E

To dissect the interplay of siRNA-mediated regulation and TE evolution, and to examine how TE differences affect nearby gene expression, we investigated genome-wide differences in TEs, <b>siRNAs,</b> and gene expression among three Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Both TE sequence polymorphisms and presence of linked TEs are positively correlated with intraspecific variation in gene expression. The expression of genes within 2 kb of conserved TEs is more stable than that of genes next to variant TEs harboring sequence polymorphisms. Polymorphism levels of TEs and closely linked adjacent genes are positively correlated as well. We also investigated the distribution of 24 -nt-long <b>siRNAs,</b> which mediate TE repression. TEs targeted by uniquely mapping <b>siRNAs</b> are on average farther from coding genes, apparently because they more strongly suppress expression of adjacent genes. Furthermore, <b>siRNAs,</b> and especially uniquely mapping <b>siRNAs,</b> are enriched in TE regions missing in other accessions. Thus, targeting by uniquely mapping <b>siRNAs</b> appears to promote sequence deletions in TEs.
