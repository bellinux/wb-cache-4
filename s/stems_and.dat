5|$|B.telmatiaea grows as {{an upright}} bush up to 2m (7ft) high.

5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Pannexin 1 forms ion and {{metabolite}} permeable hexameric {{channels and}} is abundantly {{expressed in the}} brain. After discovering pannexin 1 expression in postnatal neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells we sought to elucidate its functional role in neuronal development. Results We detected pannexin 1 in neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. We manipulated pannexin 1 expression and activity in Neuro 2 a neuroblastoma cells and primary postnatal neurosphere cultures to demonstrate that pannexin 1 regulates neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cell proliferation likely through the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Conclusions Permeable to ATP, a potent autocrine/paracine signaling metabolite, pannexin 1 channels are ideally suited to influence the behavior of neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells. Here we demonstrate they play a robust role in the regulation of neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cell proliferation. Endogenous postnatal neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells are crucial for normal brain health, and their numbers decline with age. Furthermore, these special cells are highly responsive to neurological injury and disease, and are gaining attention as putative targets for brain repair. Therefore, understanding the fundamental role of pannexin 1 channels in neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells is of critical importance for brain health and disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> {{progenitor}} cell biology is expanding. Much of the enthusiasm {{is based on}} the potential of using <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells as a cellular therapy for the treatment of human disease. Although the concept of using human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic indications is intriguing, significant challenges face investigators pursuing research in this area. Therefore, renewed scientific energy is focusing on the molecular pathways that differentiate a pluripotent embryonic stem cell from more-committed tissue-specific cells. Molecular mechanisms that govern tissue-specific <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cell function are also topics of intense investigation, given that altered function of these cells may promote a variety of human pathologies including aging, vascular disease, and cancer. Considerable progress has been made, but a clear identification of the molecular signatures of <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells remains elusive. A growing body of literature demonstrates that distinct functional characteristics of <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells are under redox regulation.

5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less deeply lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack <b>stems,</b> <b>and</b> the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, more deeply cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E

5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
