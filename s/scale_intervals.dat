40|$|The {{effect of}} the number of <b>scale</b> <b>intervals</b> of a {{continuous}} variable on the results of principal components factor analysis was investigated. Analyses were performed for seven different numbers of <b>scale</b> <b>intervals.</b> The general effect was a decrease {{in the size of the}} eigenvalues, communalities, and factor loadings as the number of scale divisions was reduced. The magnitude of the effect was, however, not large and the pattern of the rotated factor loadings was not appreciably affected. IN recent years, there has been widespread interest in, and application of, factor analysis in a number of fields. One considera-tion that confronts the researcher is that the model underlying factor analysis seldom matches precisely the characteristics of the data being analyzed. One problem that has concerned investigators is the {{effect of the}} number of intervals along the measurement scale of a, continuous variable on the results of the analysis. In its extreme form it is desired to know what effect reducing a continuous measurement scale to a dichotomy has on the analysis where the Pearson product moment correlation is used to represent the re-lationships between dichotomous variables (Carroll, 1961; Henrys-son and Thunberg, 1965) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} the soft gamma repeater SGR J 1550 [...] 5418 are investigated carefully. We find that the cumulative distributions of fluence, peak flux and duration can be well fitted by a bent power law, while the cumulative distribution of waiting time follows a simple power law. In particular, the probability density functions of fluctuations of fluence, peak flux, and duration have a sharp peak and fat tails, which can be well fitted by a $q$-Gaussian function. The $q$ values keep approximately steady for different <b>scale</b> <b>intervals,</b> indicating a scale-invariant structure of soft gamma repeaters.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{recursive}} multiscale new white top-hat (NWTH) filter for small target detection {{in the infrared}} (IR) images. At first, NWTH filter based on white top-hat (WTH) transformation is performed for three scales (structure elements) with wide <b>scale</b> <b>interval.</b> For the discrimination of candidate target and background region, Threshold is calculated by using maximum value of the summation image by NWTH filter. By using this threshold, a structure element is selected by candidate target clutter ratio (CTCR), modification of signal to clutter ratio gain (SCRG).

30|$|Although {{organizational}} citizenship behaviors {{have been}} initially evaluated {{in this study}} from a graduated semantic differential scale, we {{have an idea of}} why the subjects have not explored all the <b>scale</b> <b>intervals.</b> This hypothesis is related to the fact that organizational citizenship, measured as behavioral intentions, would be closer to the actual behaviors in which the subject could hardly find different levels of intensity for making decisions. For instance, the item 36 proposes the following situation: “You have your daily activities to perform and one of you co-workers asks for your help in his/her activities. What would you do?” In answering this question, the individual must choose, based on the graduated scale, to either adjust his or her schedule to help colleagues, or not help them at all. Nevertheless, although the graduated scale had been previously proposed, choosing whether or not to adjust one’s schedule tends to be a dichotomized decision (adjust/not adjust the schedule).|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} study the {{construct}} validity of BISOC, we applied different techniques from Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT). The first step to take before carrying out the analysis was to investigate through CTT if the individual’s responses were evenly distributed across the <b>scale</b> <b>intervals.</b> As stated by Sisto et al. (2006), an interval with less than 15  % of responses may suggest that it was not chosen by the majority of the respondents and could be therefore withdrawn or collapsed with another interval. Based on the principles of the IRT, the intervals of a scale should be analyzed in terms of the order of their thresholds, which are the boundaries between categories. Disordered thresholds may represent a violation of the measurement construct since that a higher interval (e.g., 5 -point) cannot assume the position of a lower interval (e.g., 4 -point) in the latent trait scale. Similarly, if one of the intervals overlaps with others this means that the scale has probably been using more intervals than necessary to measure the construct.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{current study}} extends {{the efforts of}} Bischoff Renninger, Granot and Donchin (2003) to non-Western musical systems and focuses {{specifically}} on Event-Related Potential (ERP) responses to scalar deviations within the Javanese pélog scale by groups of musicians trained within the Western and Javanese systems. The principal aim is to ascertain whether results found in previous experiments may be obtained cross-culturally. Participants include five subjects trained in the Western system only (control group) and five subjects trained in both the Western and Javanese systems (experimental group). Tasks include identifying scalar deviations within the Western diatonic scale, identifying scalar deviations within the Javanese pèlog scale, and identifying target letters in a visual control task. ERP and overt behavioral responses are recorded. Results show significant differences between group responses to diatonic and Javanese scale conditions.

40|$|Abstract—Multi-resolution image {{features}} may be approximated via extrapolation from nearby scales, {{rather than being}} computed explicitly. This fundamental insight allows us to design object detection algorithms that are as accurate, and considerably faster, than the state-of-the-art. The computational bottleneck of many modern detectors is the computation of features at every scale of a finely-sampled image pyramid. Our key insight is that one may compute finely sampled feature pyramids {{at a fraction of}} the cost, without sacrificing performance: for a broad family of features we find that features computed at octave-spaced <b>scale</b> <b>intervals</b> are sufficient to approximate features on a finely-sampled pyramid. Extrapolation is inexpensive as compared to direct feature computation. As a result, our approximation yields considerable speedups with negligible loss in detection accuracy. We modify three diverse visual recognition systems to use fast feature pyramids and show results on both pedestrian detection (measured on the Caltech, INRIA, TUD-Brussels and ETH datasets) and general object detection (measured on the PASCAL VOC). The approach is general and is widely applicable to vision algorithms requiring fine-grained multi-scale analysis. Our approximation is valid for images with broad spectra (most natural images) and fails for images with narrow band-pass spectra (e. g. periodic textures).

40|$|To {{understand}} the world around us, scientists measure numerous properties of the environment. Their aim is often to quantify a resource or assess how it changes over space or time. For example, a soil scientist {{might be interested in}} how the clay content of soil varies over a landscape, and a hydrologist might want to know how the nitrate concentration in a river varies over time. At its simplest, the variance statistic quantifies this. Scientists are also often interested in the correlation between two variables as this can, in some cases, provide insight into how one variable responds to changes in another. Typically we should expect both variance and correlation to change with the scale of the measurements and the locations at which they were made. This is because there are likely to be different processes affecting a given variable at different scales, and these processes might change across space or time. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the Maximum Overlap DWT (MODWT) are signal processing methods {{that can be used to}} partition the variance (and correlation) in a series of measure according to given <b>scale</b> <b>intervals</b> and locations (see Percival and Walden, 2000).

We present some simulations and numerical evaluation to illustrate the results and to estimate the scale for sfBm as a semi-selfsimilar process.
