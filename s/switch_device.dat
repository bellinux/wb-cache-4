40|$|Experimentations and {{performance}} analysis following designs and developments of energy efficient switchable distribution transformers are of first significant step as it reveals improvements, {{such as in}} energy efficiency, {{through the use of}} unique configurations and <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> in the transformers. This paper explains a personal computer based application and hardware, using lab VIEW and a data acquisition (DAQ) card, that have been used for acquiring and analyzing data from the transformers and <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> A 3 -phase 10 kVA energy efficient switchable distribution transformer and some types of <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> were utilized in some experimentations. Generally in the implementation, the developed application will firstly configure the tappings of the windings through the use of some <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> and then acquire important information such as waveforms of voltages and currents by using developed hardware and the DAQ card. The analysis is performed to show improvements in the efficiency, power factor and voltage regulation. The application also provides a protection to transformers under a test by turning off the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> in case of a fault detected. Results reveal that the system can work well with the implemented transformer and <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> in the experimentations. Finally, this system can be further developed to perform full automation in experimentations {{and performance}} analysis of switchable transformers. ...|$|R

5000|$|American Standard - American Standard by R.B. Ripley and Ryan Dixon, {{focused on}} three {{characters}} who conned, stole and murdered {{their way through}} the narrative in the hopes of hiding a deadly secret that had the power to change the course of American politics. While the story on stage had a linear narrative, each audience member was provided with a headset and small <b>switch</b> <b>device</b> dubbed a 'thought box' that allowed them to enter the inner thoughts of the characters onstage during the play. During the performance, audience members were able to choose which character's thoughts to listen to, switch back and forth between them or simply take the headset off and watch the 'play' transpire on stage. The original production of American Standard premiered at the 2005 Los Angeles Edgefest. It was directed by Ryan Dixon and co-starred Katy Mixon.|$|E
5000|$|Terminal {{manufactures}} are Thrane & Thrane, Hughes Network Systems, and Addvalue. Terminal cost {{is between}} US$1800 and US$5000 varying based on class and {{capabilities of the}} various systems. Depending on terminal type users can connect their computers via USB, Bluetooth, WiFi, or Ethernet connection(s). This allows them to access the Internet, check e-mail, download files, or any other Internet activity they might do at a home or office. Many come equipped with a regular RJ11 Phone Jack for making PSTN calls, using an ordinary telephone handset, and many terminals have an ISDN connection to do ISDN phone calls. Some BGAN terminals have both so users can make either type of phone call. Users can also send faxes or SMS text messages. Most BGAN terminals can support a router or <b>switch</b> <b>device</b> so users can plug in multiple computers or even VOIP phones {{and set up a}} mobile office. One hybrid BGAN technology is the MCD-4800 aka [...] "The Football", which is an auto-pointing case-based global Wi-Fi hotspot that will run for 6 hours on internal battery.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{cascaded}} transformer multilevel inverter is proposed. The {{number of}} the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> is reduced in the proposed topology. This topology comprises of a DC source, several single phase low-frequency transformers, two main power switches and some bidirectional <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> In this topology, only one bidirectional switch is employed for each transformer. However, in conventional cascaded transformer multilevel inverter, four <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> are required for each transformer. Therefore, more output voltage levels can be obtained using fewer switching components. Reduction {{in the number of}} <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> which also means {{reduction in the number of}} gate drivers results in smaller size and low implementation cost. Switching power losses are also reduced in this topology. Selective harmonic elimination (SHE) technique is applied to the proposed inverter to obtain a high quality output voltage. Simulation and experimental results are also provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed converter...|$|R

30|$|Future {{work should}} also {{consider}} {{details of the}} <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Different patients are able to use different muscles to control a <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> A person who uses eye blinks (Bauby, 1997), a sip-puff headset, or manipulates EEG signals (Serby, Yom-Tov & Inbar, 2005) may produce very different error probabilities than what is reported here and thus would require different keyboard designs. Future work should also explore easier methods of estimating and modeling a user’s ability to use the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Koester & Simpson (2014) simply measured how well users could trigger single, double, and triple clicks of the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Such an approach would be much faster than the empirical approach used here. Likewise, Simpson, Koester and LoPresti (2007) proposed that an appropriate cursor duration is one that generates a ratio of the user’s reaction time and the cursor duration equal to 0.65. If true in general, then it should be easy to model error probabilities. Regardless of the empirical method, once the error probabilities for a user’s ability with a <b>switch</b> <b>device</b> are identified and modeled, the optimization algorithm described here can be readily applied.|$|E

30|$|For each {{character}} to be entered, the participant initiated the cursor with a selection action (pressing the <b>switch</b> <b>device),</b> {{and then the}} cursor moved across the keyboard with a cursor duration, D, that was fixed for a block of sessions. The cursor always started at the top row and moved down the rows of the keyboard. When the participant hit the <b>switch</b> <b>device</b> to select a row, the cursor started to move across the selected row {{from left to right}} until the participant again triggered the switch or the cursor went past the last character of the row. A correct selection of the target character caused the prompt window to highlight the target character in green, and an incorrect selection (i.e., the participant responded too early or the cursor moved past the target) led to the target character being highlighted in red in the prompt window (see Fig. 5). There was no opportunity for the participant to correct an error; instead, the trial was scored and the participant started the next trial when ready. When a given quote was finished, the participant clicked the “Next text” button in the prompt window to be presented with another quote.
