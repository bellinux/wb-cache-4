5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
25|$|Much of the Motown <b>Sound</b> <b>came</b> {{from the}} use of overdubbed and {{duplicated}} instrumentation. Motown songs regularly featured two drummers instead of one (either overdubbed or in unison), as well as three or four guitar lines.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} more {{aggressive}} <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> a transition from a four-piece to a five-piece line-up, with bassist Preston Hetherington switching over to second guitar, and the band recruiting Ricky the Intern from the 'Zero Skills Employment Agency' (according to their bio) on bass. With last-minute addition Trey Robles (ex-Hard Feelings) on drums, the band toured the East Coast in Spring of 2005, hitting renowned punk-rock enclave, CBGB in New York City, as well as recording a live broadcast for XM Satellite Radio, {{at the invitation of}} Lou Brutus of the station's Fungus 53 channel. Fungus 53 later named Broker's Banquet one of the top 25 punk albums of 2005, and John Peel kicked-off his BBC broadcast during SXSW 2005 with the Yuppie Pricks song, 'Cherry Red'.|$|E

25|$|Schuldiner's primary guitar {{throughout}} {{most of his career}} was the B.C. Rich Stealth model, an extremely rare model available only through the BC Rich custom shop until 2008, when it was released to the public as the Chuck Schuldiner Tribute Stealth.(The stealth was also released as an N.J. model in the 80's and 90's, but was extremely rare) Prior to this, he used a BC Rich Mockingbird. Most of Schuldiner's <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> from a DiMarzio X2N pickup placed in the bridge. During the (In)Human Tour of the World (1991â€“92), Schuldiner briefly endorsed a small Wisconsin custom guitar company called Axtra, who worked with him on designs, though he still insisted on using his BC Rich during filming of the Lack of Comprehension video in September 1991 in Orlando.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on BBC4's Synth Britannia programme ( [...] at 1h 21m 19s), Neil Tennant explains {{the role of the}} then new sampling technology on the track and how every single <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> from the newly introduced E-mu Emulator keyboard.|$|E
500|$|This {{aspect of}} the {{basement}} recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> {{as a shock to}} other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, [...] "Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [...] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar." [...] Dylan summed up the gap: [...] "At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads." ...|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Bernard Fanning {{noted that}} another {{important}} element of the album was that there [...] "was more space in the songs, it wasn't overcrowded". However, Fanning commented that Powderfinger had not intended to greatly change their sound in creating Double Allergic, instead, the change in <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> as a natural progression. the guitarist Ian Haug agreed, stating the music was [...] "more melodic and sort of simpler", without [...] "so many different time signatures and things". Rolling Stone author Tracey Grimson also commented on this, stating that [...] "Powderfinger have become practical advocates of space" [...] and lauding their acknowledgment that the [...] "absence of sound can be lush, evocative". She noted {{that even in the}} [...] "rockers" [...] on the album songslike [...] "Pick You Up" [...] and [...] "Skinny Jean"the band were still able to pull back and give the songs additional space.|$|E
500|$|Like punk, grunge's <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> from a lo fi (low fidelity) {{recording}} and production approach. Before {{the arrival of}} major labels, early grunge albums were recorded using low-budget studios: [...] "Nirvana's first album Bleach, was recorded for $606.17 in 1989." [...] Sub Pop recorded most of their music at a [...] "...low-rent studio named Reciprocal", where producer Jack Endino created the grunge genre's aesthetic, a [...] "raw and unpolished sound with distortion, but usually without any added studio effects". Endino {{is known for his}} stripped-down recording practices and his dislike of 'over-producing' music with effects and remastering. His work on Soundgarden's Screaming Life and Nirvana's Bleach {{as well as for the}} bands Green River, Screaming Trees, L7, The Gits, Hole, 7 Year Bitch, and TAD helped to define the grunge sound. An example of the lower cost production approach is Mudhoney; even after the band signed to Warner Music, [...] "rue to [...] indie roots......probably one of the few bands that would have to fight [...] to record for a lower budget rather than a higher one." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Nine Inch Nails {{relocated}} to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed [...] "Le Pig" [...] by Reznor), {{the site of}} the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's [...] "family" [...] murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. It was used for the band to record Broken, an extended play (EP) that was the first release distributed by Nothing Records and reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized Broken as a guitar-based [...] "blast of destruction", and as [...] "a lot harder... than Pretty Hate Machine". The inspiration for the harder <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from Broken earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single [...] "Happiness in Slavery" [...] from Woodstock '94, and the second single [...] "Wish". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for [...] "Wish", Reznor joked his epitaph should read: [...] "REZNOR: Died. Said 'fist fuck', won a Grammy." [...] Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{has a more}} pop punk sound {{compared}} to Can't Slow Down, which was a melodic hardcore-driven record. Allmusic reviewer Vincent Jeffries described the record's sound as [...] "emocore". Conley explained that the shift in <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> from the music he was listening to. He liked several hardcore bands, but had played their albums [...] "to death" [...] and wanted to look for other sources of inspiration. While working on Through Being Cool, he was listening to: the Foo Fighters' The Colour and the Shape (1997), Weezer's Pinkerton (1996), and Joni Mitchell's Blue (1971) among others.|$|E
2500|$|Hovercraft's {{material}} {{consisted of}} lengthy songs featuring an avant-garde and moody sound {{that was a}} direct reaction to the local grunge scene. Hovercraft's <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> to be characterized by the sounds a bee makes, which made heavy use of delay and reverb on Shinn's main guitar, a Fender Stratocaster. The use of looping effects enabled Shinn to often simulate the simultaneous playing of multiple guitarists, though he was always the lone guitarist, both {{in the studio and}} onstage. Leibling generally played single-note, ominous, pulsating bass lines, played [...] "clean" [...] (with no effects). Early drum beats were generally sparse, yet jazzy. The band became more complex as the band gradually added more highly skilled drummers over the years.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Miami disco <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> {{to life with}} TK Records, {{featuring}} the music of KC and the Sunshine Band, with such hits as [...] "Get Down Tonight", [...] "(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty" [...] and [...] "That's the Way (I Like It)"; and the Latin-American disco group, Foxy (band), with their hit singles [...] "Get Off" [...] and [...] "Hot Number". Miami-area natives George McCrae and Teri DeSario were also popular music artists during the 1970s disco era. The Bee Gees moved to Miami in 1975 and have lived here ever since then. Miami-influenced, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine, hit the popular music scene with their Cuban-oriented sound and had hits in the 1980s with [...] "Conga" [...] and [...] "Bad Boys".|$|E

2500|$|The consonantal / was {{sometimes}} used to transliterate the Hebrew letter yodh, representing the palatal approximant sound /j/ (and transliterated in Greek by iota and in Latin by [...] ); words like Jerusalem, Joseph, etc. would have originally followed the Latin pronunciation beginning with /j/, that is, {{the sound of}} [...] in yes. In some words, however, notably from Old French, / {{was used for the}} affricate consonant , as in joie (modern [...] "joy"), used in Wycliffe's Bible. This was similar to the geminate sound , which had been represented as [...] in Old English. By the time of Modern English, the <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> to be written as / at the start of words (like joy), and usually as [...] elsewhere (as in bridge). It could also be written, mainly in French loanwords, as , with the adoption of the soft G convention (age, page, etc.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{distortion}} on a rock'n'roll {{record was}} more accurately [...] "Rocket 88" [...] by Jackie Brenston and the Delta Cats. The legend {{of how the}} <b>sound</b> <b>came</b> about says that guitarist Willy Kizart's amplifier was damaged on Highway 61 when the band was driving from Mississippi to Memphis, Tennessee. An {{attempt was made to}} hold the cone in place by stuffing the amplifier with wadded newspapers, which unintentionally created a distorted sound; Phillips liked the sound and used it. Robert Palmer has written that the amplifier [...] "had fallen {{from the top of the}} car", and attributes this information to Sam Phillips. However, in a recorded interview at the Experience Music Project in Seattle, Washington, Ike Turner stated that the amplifier was in the trunk of the car and that rain may have caused the damage; he is certain that it did not fall from the roof of the car.|$|E
