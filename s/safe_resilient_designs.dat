40|$|<b>Resilient</b> <b>design</b> {{techniques}} {{are used to}} (i) ensure correct operation under dynamic variations and to (ii) improve design performance (e. g., timing speculation). However, significant overheads (e. g., 16 % and 14 % energy penalties due to throughput degradation and additional circuits) are incurred by existing <b>resilient</b> <b>design</b> techniques. For instance, <b>resilient</b> <b>designs</b> require additional circuits to detect and correct timing errors. Further, {{when there is an}} error, the additional cycles needed to restore a previous correct state degrade throughput, which diminishes the performance benefit of using <b>resilient</b> <b>designs.</b> In this work, we describe an improved methodology for <b>resilient</b> <b>design</b> implementation to minimize the costs of resilience in terms of power, area, and throughput degradation. Our methodology uses two levers: selective-endpoint optimization (i. e., sensitivity-based margin insertion) and clock skew optimization. We integrate the two optimization techniques in an iterative optimization flow which comprehends toggle rate information and the trade-off between cost of resilience and margin on combinational paths. Since the error-detection network can result in up to 9 % additional wirelength cost, we also propose a matching-based algorithm for construction of the error-detection network to minimize this resilience overhead. Further, our implementations comprehend the impacts of signoff corners (in particular, hold constraints, and use of typical vs. slow libraries) and process variation, which are typically omitted in previous studies of resilience trade-offs. Our proposed flow achieves energy reductions of up to 21 % and 10 % compared to a conventional (with only margin used to attain robustness) design and a brute-force implementation (i. e., a typical <b>resilient</b> <b>design,</b> where <b>resilient</b> endpoints are (greedily) instantiated at timing-critical endpoints), respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) green {{building}} certification program {{is dedicated to}} the design of sustainable buildings by incentivizing reductions in energy, water, and building materials consumption, {{while at the same time}} enhancing occupant health and overall community connectivity. While {{green building}}s certified by the program do reduce the environmental footprint of buildings, they must also be designed for resilience to withstand external stressors that may arise over the buildings’ lifetime for it to be truly sustainable. Therefore, a resilient building should be able to adapt and remain functional while under pressure from more frequent and severe climatic events. The goal of the study was to analyze existing inherent overlaps between <b>resilient</b> <b>design</b> principles and the LEED certification system. Synergistic opportunities together with improvements for better integrating <b>resilient</b> <b>design</b> into the LEED checklist, and hence green buildings, by modifying existing or proposing new credits were discussed.
