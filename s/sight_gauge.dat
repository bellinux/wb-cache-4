50|$|The {{fuel tank}} is located behind the {{right-hand}} seat. The quantity {{can be read}} directly through a <b>sight</b> <b>gauge</b> behind the seat. The standard tank is 70 litres (18 US gallons) with 87 litres (23 US gallons) optional. Behind the left-hand seat is a small baggage compartment, with additional baggage space above and behind both seats.|$|E
40|$|Powder feeder for oxygen-sensitive powders {{facilitates}} {{transfer of}} powder while protecting it against oxidation. <b>Sight</b> <b>gauge</b> enables continuous monitoring of level to which feeder filled with powder, {{as well as}} for visual monitoring of quality powder. Coupling mates with specially designed containers, in which powders packaged under vacuum or inert gas. Eliminating need for unncessary handling of powders and attendant risk of contamination by oxygen. Internal funnel unloads unused powder from feeder in vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere. Pressure gauge monitors pressure of inert backfill gas...|$|E
50|$|Engine safety {{appliances}} were sparse. The Bourdon gauge for pressure readings was patented in 1849. A rival gauge {{was developed in}} 1857 by Wooten. Glass <b>sight</b> <b>gauges</b> for boiler water level were not popular until the 1890s. Part {{of the problem was}} production of the proper glass, and the sealing of the gauge.|$|R
2500|$|The {{mechanic}} {{said he had}} {{remarked to}} Denver that the fuel <b>sight</b> <b>gauges</b> were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was [...] "less than half in the right tank and {{less than a quarter}} in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look {{over his shoulder at the}} fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|R
50|$|Static balance can be {{measured}} by a static balancing machine where the tire is placed in its vertical axis on a non-rotating spindle tool. The spot on the tire with the greatest mass is acted upon by gravity to deflect the tooling downward. The amount of deflection indicates {{the magnitude of the}} unbalance. The angle of the deflection indicates the angular location of the unbalance. In tire manufacturing factories, static balancers operate by use of sensors mounted to the spindle assembly. In tire retail shops, static balancers are usually non-rotating bubble balancers, where the magnitude and angle of the unbalance is observed by looking at the center bubble in an oil-filled glass <b>sighting</b> <b>gauge.</b> While some very small shops which lack specialized machines still do this process, they have been largely replaced in larger shops with machines.|$|R
5000|$|Water level indicators: They {{show the}} {{operator}} {{the level of}} fluid in the boiler, {{also known as a}} <b>sight</b> glass, water <b>gauge</b> or water column.|$|R
50|$|It was {{a common}} <b>sight</b> on broad <b>gauge</b> {{passenger}} trains to Port Pirie circa 1978, when it provided head-end power for an RBJ buffet car while the Cafeteria Car was unavailable.|$|R
2500|$|In Octavianus' stealth levels, {{the player}} must use stealth to {{navigate}} various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, {{he can only}} knock them out by hitting them from behind with objects such as vases, choking them with ropes or placing banana peels in front of them. Once he has done so, he often has to drag their body into hiding to make sure other enemies don't find it. Other ways to avoid enemies are by hiding in large pots, or by stealing clothes and impersonating guards or other people. During these levels, there is an alert gauge which appears when Octavianus is spotted by an enemy. The gauge gradually empties over time if {{he is out of}} sight, and once it is completely empty, enemies stop looking for him. Octavianus can also distract enemies by throwing items such as stones and by whistling. Even if Octavianus is disguised, enemies can become suspicious of him if he does anything unusual, such as running, standing still for no reason, or trying to open locked doors. Often, enemies will stop him and question him. The player will be presented with a series of choices to try to assuage the guards' suspicions. If the player picks the wrong answer, Octavianus' disguise will fail, and he will be killed. Octavianus is also able to listen to conversations in locked rooms by peeking through keyholes. During levels where he must follow someone, he has a [...] "Tail Gauge." [...] When the person he is following is out of his <b>sight,</b> the <b>gauge</b> starts to empty, and when it is fully depleted he is adjudged to have lost the person he was tailing and the game is over.|$|R
