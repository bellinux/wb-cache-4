40|$|The {{charge state}} of {{proteins}} in solution {{is a key}} biophysical parameter that modulates both long and short range macromolecular interactions. However, unlike {{in the case of}} many small molecules, the effective charges of complex biomolecules in solution cannot in general be predicted reliably from their chemical structures alone. Here we present an approach for quantifying the effective charges of solvated biomolecules from independent measurements of their electrophoretic mobilities and diffusion coefficients in free solution within a microfluidic device. We illustrate the potential of this approach by determining the effective charges of a charge-ladder family of mutants of the calcium binding protein calbindin D- 9 k in solution under native conditions. Furthermore, we explore ion-binding under native conditions, and demonstrate the ability to detect the chelation of a single calcium ion through the change that ion binding imparts on the effective charge of calbindin D- 9 k.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a general model for determining density-dependent effective dielectronic recombination (DR) rate coefficients in order to explore finite-density effects on the ionization balance of plasmas. Our model consists of multiplying by a suppression factor those highly-accurate total zero-density DR rate coefficients which have been produced from state-of-the-art theoretical calculations and which have been benchmarked by experiment. The suppression factor is based upon earlier detailed collision-radiative calculations which were made {{for a wide range}} of ions at various densities and temperatures, but used a simplified treatment of DR. A general suppression formula is then developed as a function of isoelectronic <b>sequence,</b> <b>charge,</b> density, and temperature. These density-dependent effective DR rate coefficients are then used in the plasma simulation code Cloudy to compute ionization balance curves for both collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas at very low (n(e) = 1 cm(- 3)) and finite (n(e) = 10 (10) cm(- 3)) densities. We find that the denser case is significantly more ionized due to suppression of DR, warranting further studies of density effects on DR by detailed collisional-radiative calculations which utilize state-of-the-art partial DR rate coefficients. This is expected to impact the predictions of the ionization balance in denser cosmic gases such as those found in nova and supernova shells, accretion disks, and the broad emission line regions in active galactic nuclei...|$|R
40|$|We study an {{intermediate}} quantum coherent-incoherent charge transport mechanism in metal-molecule-metal junctions using Büttiker's probe technique. This tool {{allows us to}} include incoherent effects in a controlled manner, and thus to study situations in which partial decoherence affects charge transfer dynamics. Motivated by recent experiments on intermediate coherent-incoherent charge conduction in DNA molecules [L. Xiang et al., Nature Chem. 7, 221 - 226 (2015) ], we focus on two representative structures: alternating (GC) _n and stacked G_nC_n sequences; the latter structure is argued to support charge delocalization within G segments, and thus {{an intermediate}} coherent-incoherent conduction. We begin our analysis with a highly simplified 1 -dimensional tight-binding model, while introducing environmental effects through Büttiker's probes. This minimal model allows us to gain fundamental understanding of transport mechanisms and derive analytic results for molecular resistance in different limits. We then use a more detailed ladder-model Hamiltonian to represent double-stranded DNA structures [...] -with environmental effects captured by Büttiker's probes. We find that hopping conduction dominates in alternating sequences, while in stacked <b>sequences</b> <b>charge</b> delocalization (visualized directly through the electronic density matrix) supports significant resonant-ballistic charge dynamics reflected by an even-odd effect and a weak distance dependence for resistance.

This array encloses the entire cell body, and it is apposed to, and connected with, the overlying cell membrane. The microtubules of this array contain numerous microtubule- associated proteins. Prominent among those is a family of high molecular weight, repetitive proteins which consist {{to a large extent}} of tandemly arranged 38 -amino acid repeat units. The binding of one of these proteins, MARP- 1, to microtubules has now been characterized in vitro and in vivo. MARP- 1 binds to microtubules via tubulin domains other than the COOH-termini used by microtubule-associated proteins from mammalian brain, e. g., MAP 2 or Tau. In vitro binding assays using recombinant protein, as well as transfection of mammalian cell lines, have established that the repetitive 38 -amino acid repeat units represent a novel microtubule-binding motif. This motif is very similar in length to those of the mammalian microtubule-associated proteins Tau, MAP 2, and MAP-U, but both its <b>sequence</b> and <b>charge</b> are different.

40|$|Cosensitization {{based on}} two or {{multiple}} dyes as âdye cocktailsâ can hit the target on compensating and broadening light-harvesting region. Two indoline D-A-Ï-A motif sensitizers (WS- 2 and WS- 39) that possess similar light response area but distinctly reversed feature in photovoltaic performance are selected as the specific cosensitization couple. That is, WS- 2 shows quite high photocurrent but low photovoltage, and WS- 39 gives relatively low photocurrent but quite high photovoltage. Due to the obvious âbarrel effectâ, both dyes show medium PCE around 8. 50 %. In contrast with the previous cosensitization strategy mostly focused on the compensation of light response region, herein we perform different cosensitization sequence, for taking insight into the balance of photocurrent and photovoltage, and achieving the synergistic improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Electronic impedance spectra (EIS) indicate that exploiting dye WS- 39 with high VOC value as the primary sensitizer can repress the charge recombination more effectively, resulting in superior VOC rather than using dye WS- 2 with high JSC as the primary sensitizer. As a consequence, a high PCE value of 9. 48 % is obtained with the delicate cosensitization using WS- 39 as primary dye and WS- 2 as accessory dye, which {{is higher than the}} corresponding devices sensitized by each individual dye (around 8. 48 â 8. 67 %).

40|$|Membrane lipid glycosyltransferases (GTs) {{in plants}} are enzymes that {{regulate}} {{the levels of}} the non-bilayer prone monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (GalDAG) and the bilayer-forming digalactosyldiacylglycerol (GalGalDAG). The relative amounts of these lipids affect membrane properties such as curvature and lateral stress. During phosphate shortage, phosphate is rescued by replacing phospholipids with GalGalDAG. The glycolsyltransferase enzyme in Arabidopsis thaliana responsible for this, atDGD 2, senses the bilayer properties and interacts with the membrane in a monotopic manner. To understand the parameters that govern this interaction, we have identified several possible lipid-interacting sites in the protein and studied these by biophysical techniques. We have developed a multivariate discrimination algorithm that correctly predicts the regions in the protein that interact with lipids, and the interactions were confirmed {{by a variety of}} biophysical techniques. We show by bioinformatic methods and circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopic techniques that two regions are prone to interact with lipids in a surface-charge dependent way. Both of these regions contain Trp residues, but here charge appears to be the dominating feature governing the interaction. The sequence corresponding to residues 227 – 245 in the protein is seen to be able to adapt its structure according to the surface-charge density of a bilayer. All results indicate that this region interacts specifically with lipid molecules and that a second region in the protein, corresponding to residues 130 – 148, also interacts with the bilayer. On the basis of this, and <b>sequence</b> <b>charge</b> features in the immediate environment of S 227 – 245, a response model for the interaction of atDGD 2 with the membrane bilayer interface is proposed...|$|R
