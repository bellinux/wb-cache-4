40|$|INTRODUCTION: In view of {{transparency}} in health care, the widespread desire for more patient-centred care, {{and in an}} attempt to facilitate educational programmes that effectively respond to these changes, two research questions are formulated: (i) How do dental students rate the importance of various organisational aspects of dental practices compared with dental patients and general dental practitioners (GDPs), and what prescripts, defined as specific operational responsibilities of GDPs in these matters, do dental students propose? and (ii) In doing so, do <b>students</b> <b>resemble</b> patients or GDPs? METHODS: In two survey studies, dental students (n = 198), patients (n = 3127) and GDPs (n = 303) were asked to rate by questionnaire the importance of 41 organisational aspects of a general dental practice and proposed specific operational responsibilities ('prescripts'). RESULTS: Seven of 41 aspects were rated as important by the majority of the students. Although in a different rank order, three aspects were predominantly selected by all three groups: continuing education, accessibility by telephone and Dutch-speaking GDP. For most aspects, {{significant differences were found between}} the prescripts proposed by students and those proposed by patients, and few differences were found between students and GDPs. CONCLUSION: The findings do not permit the general conclusion that the views of dental <b>students</b> <b>resemble</b> those of patients or GPDs. Looking at the overall rank order, the three respondent groups showed a great resemblance although significant differences were found for specific aspects. With regard to the proposed prescripts, students showed realistic views and the majority wants to participate in continuing education and work with protocols and guidelines. In this, they tend to resemble GDPs more than they resemble patients...|$|R

The thesis revealed a strong overall overuse of result/inference connectives by students as well as overuse and underuse of individual connectives.

Findings ÃÂ¿ Overall, male <b>students</b> <b>resemble</b> female <b>students</b> rather than senior female managers. They reject some stereotypically male strategies, seeing them as more effective for women. Yet, male students regard an ineffective but probable approach to getting credit for ideas as even less effective for men than for women, and an effective, but feminine, strategy for getting noticed for promotion as more effective for women. Male students may believe using overtly feminine strategies penalizes men. Like female students, male students 2 ̆ 7 confidence affects their personal choice of strategy.

60|$|Our Western {{civilization is}} built upon assumptions, which, to a psychologist, are rationalizings of {{excessive}} energy. Our industrialism, our militarism, our love of progress, our missionary zeal, our imperialism, our passion for dominating and organizing, all spring from a superflux of the itch for activity. The creed of efficiency {{for its own}} sake, without regard for the ends {{to which it is}} directed, has become somewhat discredited in Europe since the war, which would have never taken place if the Western nations had been slightly more indolent.

Russia, like China, may be described as an artist nation; but unlike China it has been governed, since the time of Peter the Great, by men who wished to introduce all the good and evil of the West. In former days, I might have had no doubt that such men were in the right.

The Great War showed that something is wrong with our civilization; experience of Russia and China has made me believe that those countries can help to show us what it is that is wrong. The Chinese have discovered, and have practised for many centuries, a way of life which, if it could be adopted by all the world, would make all the world happy. We Europeans have not. Our way of life demands strife, exploitation, restless change, discontent and destruction. Efficiency directed to destruction can only end in annihilation, and it is to this consummation that our civilization is tending, if it cannot learn some of that wisdom for which it despises the East.|$|R
