5|$|The hussar cavalry were garbed in a black, {{light blue}} {{collared}} dolman, sometimes {{with a black}} pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight breeches of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black <b>Shako.</b> The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design. The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being {{a copy of the}} Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a red and yellow pennon. By 1815, the Uhlans were wearing all-black uniforms, but retained the yellow-topped czapka.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather <b>shako</b> was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E

50|$|The Prussian Schutzpolizei, {{newly formed}} after 1918, nicknamed the green police, {{received}} <b>shakos</b> {{like those of}} the guards rifles. These kind of <b>shakos</b> remained in use by the police of the West German states until the 1960s. Also the green colour remained.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the first}} regiment, {{the second was}} {{distinguished}} by the <b>shako</b> which all the modern works indicate to have been cylindrical, and was decorated by a surmounted rosette of a ganse cord and of a half-spherical pompom. The cord was tied in front of and behind the neck for the officers, the troopers carrying it in the usual way. The <b>shako</b> issued to the regiment is therefore same as that worn by the hussars at the time. The spherical pompom was the colour of the squadron.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} uniform was grey with scarlet facings and the headgear was a <b>shako,</b> {{in which}} the 5th Northampton RVC wore a red tuft. The <b>shako</b> {{was replaced by a}} spiked helmet in 1879. When the Volunteers were affiliated to the Regular county regiments they were given the option of adopting the scarlet coat, but the 1st Northampton VB rejected this and retained the grey jacket. Only when the battalion became the 4th Northamptons did it adopt a scarlet uniform faced in white. The facings were changed to the buff of the old 48th Foot (1st Bn Northampton Regiment) in 1926.|$|E

25|$|When marching {{into war}} a soldier would have worn the {{traditional}} redcoat uniform {{consisting of the}} distinctive regimental coat, a white shirt, grey trousers to be held up {{by a pair of}} braces, shoes and a cap. The cap may have differed depending on the regiment, but a traditional pattern was the Tricorne to be replaced by the Stovepipe <b>Shako.</b> This too would be replaced in the majority of regiments by the widespread use of the Belgic <b>shako</b> by 1812, as displayed by the 33rd Regiment of Foot. A greatcoat, fashioned in grey wool, would be worn and was normally tied on top of the haversack or knapsack which was carried by the men whilst on the move.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the issue}} of the Belgic <b>shako</b> in 1812, company {{officers}} wore bicorne hats; afterwards, they usually wore the same headgear as their men while on campaign, their status as officers denoted with braided cords. Generals, field officers and staff officers generally wore bicorne hats.|$|E
25|$|In 1870 when {{troops were}} mobilized for the Franco-Prussian War {{large numbers of}} French {{soldiers}} either refused to wear the issued shakos or threw them away. Emperor Napoléon III abolished the infantry <b>shako</b> for active service {{and replaced it with}} the kepi on 30 July 1870.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>shakos</b> {{are still}} worn as full-dress {{headgear}} by cadets of West Point (where {{it is known}} colloquially as a tarbucket), Virginia Military Institute, The Citadel, Marion Military Institute, and Valley Forge Military Academy (in a modified form) with their Full Dress Grey uniforms. Many college and high-school marching bands feature <b>shakos</b> {{as part of their}} dress uniform.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, the {{infantry}} of the French Republican Guard, cadets at Saint-Cyr, cadets at the Belgian Royal Military Academy, cadets at the Portuguese Colégio Militar and Pupilos do Exército military schools, the Italian Horse Guards Corps, Horse Artillery and cadets at the Military Academy of Modena, the Danish Guard Hussar Regiment, and the Spanish Royal Guard and 1st King's Immemorial Infantry Regiment all have <b>shakos</b> {{as part of}} their respective ceremonial uniforms. Various Latin American armies, including those of Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay and Argentina, retain <b>shakos</b> for ceremonial guard or military academy uniforms. In Russia, the historic kiver has been reintroduced for wear by the Kremlin Guards for ceremonial occasions. In India the Madras Sappers & Miners of the Madras Engineer Group wear dark-blue visorless <b>shakos</b> {{as part of their}} ceremonial uniform. An Indonesian ceremonial unit as well as the cadet corps of the military academies of the Philippines and South Korea also use <b>shakos.</b>|$|R

25|$|During {{the period}} up to 1915 the Romanian Gendarmerie wore a {{distinctive}} dress comprising a <b>shako</b> with white plume, dark blue tunic with red facings, white trefoil epaulettes and aiguillettes plus light blue trousers with red stripes. Mounted {{units of the}} Gendarmerie wore a silver helmet with spike and white plume, a similar tunic to the foot branch but with yellow epaulettes and aiguillettes, white breeches and high boots.|$|E
25|$|The kepi was {{formerly}} {{the most common}} headgear in the French Army. Its predecessor originally appeared during the 1830s, {{in the course of}} the initial stages of the occupation of Algeria, as a series of various lightweight cane-framed cloth undress caps called casquette d'Afrique. These were intended as alternatives to the heavier, cloth-covered leather French Army <b>shako.</b> As a light and comfortable headdress, it was adopted by the metropolitan (French mainland) infantry regiments for service and daily wear, with the less practical <b>shako</b> being relegated to parade use. In 1852, a new soft cloth cap was introduced for campaign and off-duty. Called bonnet de police à visière, this was the first proper model of the kepi. The visor was generally squarish in shape and oversized and was referred to as bec de canard (duck bill). This kepi had no chinstrap (jugulaire). Subsequent designs reduced the size of the cap and introduced chinstraps and buttons. The kepi became well known outside France during the Crimean War and was subsequently adopted in various forms by a number of other armies (including the U.S. and Russian) during the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E
25|$|In Spain, {{a version}} of the kepi (actually a low <b>shako),</b> the ros, is used by the Guardia Real (Royal Guard) for {{ceremonial}} functions. The Spanish 1887 regulation kepi or Teresiana was made of black oilcloth with a tortoise shell visor. This type of headdress was retained by the Civil Guard as its regulation kepi, worn on non-ceremonial occasions for normal police duties, until it was abolished under the 2011 revised regulations and replaced by a baseball cap.|$|E
25|$|During the Paraguayan War between Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay versus Paraguay, Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan {{troops and}} {{officers}} primarily wore kepis (although many Brazilian troops wore brimmed hats, and Uruguayan and Argentine light infantry wore <b>shakos).</b> The Paraguayans mostly wore leather <b>shakos,</b> but senior officers were given kepis. Leather kepis were however issued as a forage cap to Paraguayan troops, {{and because of}} poor supply standards, were often seen in combat.|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 19th century, the Austro-Hungarian army {{were issued}} with shakos, {{originally}} in black leather {{and later in}} pike grey wool. Gradually, {{the height of the}} <b>shako</b> decreased and the cardboard stiffening removed until, by 1908, it had evolved into the ski cap. This was worn by Austrian officers and enlisted personnel during both World Wars, but when the postwar Austrian Bundesheer was established in 1955 an olive drab peaked cap and American style uniform were introduced.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, {{new dress}} uniform {{regulations}} were issued; the new uniform had a French-style <b>shako</b> with an unpopular pom-pon. There {{was also the}} option of a fatigue cap, fashioned after the French képi. In the expeditionary period post Civil War, Marines began wearing a khaki field uniform, better suited to tropical and arid environments. In the 1890s, the Marines adopted some practical changes to the field uniform, adding a campaign cover, with a large Marine emblem on the side, and canvas leggings.|$|E
25|$|The current OSUMB uniform is very {{different}} from the earliest uniforms. The earliest band uniforms were military in style and were pieced together from U.S. military uniforms with pieces dating back to even the Civil War era. High collar jackets were the first solidified design for the band uniform. The first hats worn by the band were Pershing style military visor caps with military “peace” eagles as the hat emblem and red and gray “powder puff” plumes, so called because of the very fine, almost down-like feathers with which they were constructed. OSU also experimented with gray wool bucket hats that looked similar to a kepi or <b>shako</b> with a plume.|$|E

25|$|By the 1840s frock coats were {{regulation}} for the American, Prussian, Russian and French armies, {{although the}} British did not adopt them {{until after the}} Indian Mutiny. US army officers were first issued navy blue frocks during the Mexican War with gold epaulettes and peaked caps of the German pattern. Enlisted USMC personnel received a double breasted version with red piping worn with a leather stock and <b>shako</b> to reflect their status as an elite unit, although infantry soldiers continued to be issued the 1833 pattern shell jacket until the M1858 uniform, complete with French style kepi, entered service shortly before the US Civil War.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, the kepi {{has been}} used with several uniform types. The most common was the grey kepi worn {{as part of the}} M1923 field uniform and the dark blue kepi worn as part of the uniform types m/1886 and m/1895, and still in use by the Life Guards. Significantly such {{historic}} opponents of France as Germany and Britain, avoided the use of kepis, with only a few short-lived exceptions, such as for service in India during the 1850s-60s. During this time the Albert <b>Shako</b> was preferred. This may have been for practical rather than patriotic reasons, as the distinctive profile of the kepi would be likely to lead to confusion in battle.|$|E
25|$|In 1806, four light dragoon regiments (the 7th, 10th, 15th and 18th) were {{converted}} into regiments of Hussars, with {{no change in}} their role, but a great increase in the expense of their uniforms. From 1812, the uniforms {{of most of the}} remaining British cavalry changed, following French styles. The heavy cavalry (excepting the Household Cavalry who adopted a helmet with a prominent woolen comb and the Scots Greys, who retained their bearskins) adopted a helmet with a horsetail crest like those of French dragoons or cuirassiers, while the light dragoons adopted a jacket and <b>shako</b> similar to those of French chasseurs a cheval. The Duke of Wellington objected to these changes, as it became difficult to distinguish French and British cavalry at night or at a distance, but without success.|$|E
