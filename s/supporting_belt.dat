A mathematical model is produced employing a suitable analysis capable of representing the non-linear behaviour of a sling supported GRP vessel. This system is {{used to examine the}} phenomena occurring at the interface between the vessel and the <b>supporting</b> <b>belt.</b> Each component is initially considered some distance apart and then brought together using three-dimensional contact surfaces. External loads are thereafter applied to the combined model. Although several numerical difficulties arise due to the difference in flexibility between the vessel shell and the sling support, these are overcome and the resulting vessel strains and contact interface pressures show good agreement with experimental work. The magnitudes of the strains at the location of the saddle horn are significantly reduced. Results of a parameter study are also presented which show the effect of the sling position together with the influence of the wrap-round angle and a number of recommendations are made with respect to design...|$|E
40|$|Low-back {{pain and}} injury are {{responsible}} for {{a major portion of}} lost workdays and injury compensation claims. The use of back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> has been forwarded as a counter measure towards reducing low-back injuries in the industrial setting. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a back <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> relieves stresses encountered by the lumbar spine during stoop type lifting and potentially reduce the risk of injury. METHODS: Twelve male participants (49. 7 ± 3. 7 years) performed two sessions of stooped type lifting with a loaded milk crate (11. 5 kg), at 4 repetitions per minute, for 15 minutes in accordance with the NIOSH lifting equation. One lifting session was performed without a <b>support</b> <b>belt,</b> while the other with a <b>support</b> <b>belt.</b> Three sets of fluoroscopic images were collected with the participants positioned at the initiation (flexed trunk), mid-range, and completion of the lift (erect standing). The first series of images were collected under a no-load condition, while the second (no <b>support</b> <b>belt)</b> and third series (<b>support</b> <b>belt)</b> of images were collected with the participants lifting the 11. 5 kg milk crate. Images were imported into AutoCAD where lumbar disc deformation and joint angles were measured by calculating changes in position of adjacent vertebra (L 3 - 4 and L 4 - 5). A reduction of disc deformation was deemed indicative of reduced stress. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed that compressive and shear disc deformation were reduced while in the erect trunk posture for the <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> condition (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). No significant reduction in disc deformation was detected while in flexed trunk postures for the <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> condition (p 3 ̆e 0. 05).

This article aims {{to review}} the {{literature}} published {{to date on the}} types, current use, the biomechanical effects and adverse effects of maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> for low back pain during pregnancy, to identify future research directions. Background. Lumbar/pelvic <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> are frequently recommended for the prevention and treatment of low back pain during pregnancy. Design. Systematic review. Methods. MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and patents databases were electronically searched. Results. Maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> belong to one of the four main types of maternity support garments, which are widely commercially-available. Current research showed limited evidence in support of the commercial maternity products regarding the effectiveness in the prevention and/or treatment of low back pain during pregnancy, other than that from the manufacturers. However, potential stabilisation effect of maternity <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> was demonstrated in some studies. Adverse effects reported include increased pain, fetal heart rate changes, skin irritation and discomfort. Conclusions. There is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that wearing maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> reduces pregnancy-related low back pain and/or pelvic girdle pain. Future research directions in the area of biomechanics and physiology are recommended. Relevance to clinical practice. This review provides comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> for the relief of low back pain during pregnancy which will facilitate healthcare professionals in providing evidence-based advice to their patients.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the technique of the individual, using an integrated biomechanical approach, to assess injury potential and performance. The effects of five neoprene athletic supports were investigated for the cricket bowl and javelin throw. A significant improvement in distance thrown {{and an increase in}} linear speed of body segmental movements were found for a lumbar <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> during the javelin throw. A two-handed overhead throwing activity was designed to investigate the effect of this lumbar <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> during the hyperextension - flexion movement of the torso. Significant differences in the distances thrown and segmental timing during the belt condition were found for both novice and experienced athletes. An integrated approach (three-dimensional cinematography, ground reaction forces and electromyography) was then used to analyse the effect of this lumbar <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> during the delivery phase of both sporting activities. The rate at which the torso uncoiled, (the relative peak shoulder to peak hip speed) was found to be significantly different during the belt condition for both activities.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> relieve stresses encountered by the lumbar spine during lifting activities and thus reduce the risk of injury. Additionally, trunk strength and endurance measures were collected in order to determine if strong, well conditioned trunk musculature aids in the support of the lumbar spine. Summary of Background Data. Low-back pain and injury are responsible for a major portion of lost work days and injury compensation claims. Back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> have been proposed as a counter measure towards reducing low-back injuries in the industrial setting. Methods. Twelve male subjects (average age, 49. 7 years) performed two sessions of stoop type lifting with a loaded milk crate (11. 5 kg), at a rate of 4 repetitions per minute, for a total 15 minutes per session in accordance with the NIOSH 1993 lifting equation. The order of testing with and without a belt was randomized for the two sessions. Fluoroscopic images were collected prior to and following both lifting sessions. Fluoroscopic images were collected with the subjects positioned at the initiation (flexed trunk), mid-range, and completion of the lift (erect standing). Images were imported into Auto Cad where lumbar disc deformation and joint angles were measured by calculating changes in position of adjacent vertebra (L 3 - 4 and L 4 - 5). A reduction of deformation was deemed indicative of reduced stress. Trunk extension and flexion strength were measured with a Kin Com isokinetic dynamometer. Trunk flexion endurance was measured via a 60 second curl-up test. Results. Analysis of variance revealed that compressive and shear disc deformation were reduced while in the erect trunk posture for the <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> condition (p. 05). A significant inverse relationship was detected (p< 05) between: abdominal strength and shear stress (flexed trunk positions), abdominal endurance and shear stress (erect trunk), and spinal erector strength and L 4 -L 5 joint angle (erect trunk). Conclusions. During stoop type lifting, <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> provide a measurable amount of stress reduction of the lumbar spine when the trunk is in the erect posture, with little effect during flexed trunk positions.

40|$|Background: As the {{population}} ages, {{the number of}} elderly individuals using a wheelchair is increasing. A standard wheelchair with a vertical backrest (S-WC) pushes on a kyphotic spine and exacerbates forward head posture. Forward head posture limits cervical movement. We used a new wheelchair (N-WC) that does not exacerbate thoracic kyphosis. The N-WC {{does not have a}} flat backrest, but has a <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> for the thorax and pelvis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare head-neck angle, cervical range of motion, and cervical muscle activity in the N-WC and the S-WC in healthy elderly women. Methods: We measured head-neck alignment, trunk tilt angle, cervical muscle activity, and pressure distribution on the backrest. Data from 17 subjects were analyzed. Results: Head-neck angle was close to neutral in the N-WC. The trunk was tilted further back and the area over which pressure was distributed on the backrest was expanded in the N-WC. Cervical range of motion and cervical muscle activity during neck extension were significantly greater in the N-WC than in the S-WC, but during neck flexion, there was no significant difference between the wheelchairs. Conclusion: In the N-WC, head-neck alignment was close to the neutral posture because the wheelchair <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> accommodated kyphosis and did not push the spine forward, so cervical muscle activity may be reduced when at rest. These results suggest that the N-WC prevented forward head posture and improved cervical movement and muscle activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS and European Union Geriatric Medicine Society.

Other complications that arise from immobilization include muscle atrophy and osteoporosis, especially to the lower limbs, increasing the risk of fractures to the femur and tibia. While passive weight bearing of paralyzed lower extremities appears to be ineffective, stressing the bones through muscular contractions initiated by functional electrical stimulation (FES) has yielded positive results in some cases. The intensity, frequency, and duration of stress to the bones appear to be important determinants of improved bone parameters. Generally, the frequency is effective with three or more weekly exercise sessions. Studies of duration suggest that several months to one or more years of FES are necessary.|$|R
