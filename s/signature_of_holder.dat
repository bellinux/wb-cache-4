5000|$|Currently, {{there are}} three types of valid {{identity}} documents (Személyi igazolvány, abbr. Sz.ig.). The oldest valid type is a hard-covered, multi-page book issued before 1989 by the People's Republic of Hungary (Internal passport); the second type is a soft-cover, multi-page book issued after the restoration of democracy in 1989. Each of these documents has an original photo of the owner embedded, with original <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> the owner and the local police representative.

Electronic chip of biometric passport contains digital images of fingerprints, photo and electronic <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the passport <b>holder.</b> The passport will be valid for 10 years.|$|R
50|$|Ukraine's law on {{biometric}} passports {{came into}} force on December 6, 2012. The document foresees {{the introduction of}} electronic passports containing electronic chips with biometric information for traveling abroad, according {{to the standards of}} the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). According to the law, the passports of Ukrainian citizens will be produced in the form of cards with contactless smart chips and issued no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the submission of a relevant application. The electronic passports will include the name of the state, the name of the document, the full name <b>of</b> the <b>holder,</b> the holder's gender, citizenship, date of birth, and a unique number in the register, the number of the document, the document's date of , the date of issue of the document, the name of the agency that issued the document, the place of birth, a photo and the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>holder.</b> Information about the parents or the guardian <b>of</b> the <b>holder</b> may be included to the document upon a relevant written request. At the president's request, a new provision has been included in the law that says that people who refuse to enter their personal information in an electronic chip due to their religious beliefs have the right to refuse to use this document or the insertion of such information into the chip.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second line}} of a {{machine-readable}} zone of a passport contains the passport number, supplemented by a check digit; the code of the issuing country (e.g., [...] "MKD" [...] for [...] "Macedonia"); the date of birth <b>of</b> the passport <b>holder</b> (two digit year, two digit month, two digit day i.e. 020507), supplemented by a check digit; a notation of the sex <b>of</b> the passport <b>holder</b> ("M" [...] or [...] "F"); the date of expiration of the passport, supplemented by a check digit; the holder’s personal number and, {{at the end of}} the line, two overall check digits.The data page has a line for the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a passport <b>holder.</b> The non-biometric passports of the first three generation were not valid until they were signed by the passport holder. If a holder was unable to sign his passport, it was to be signed by a person who has legal authority to sign on the holder's behalf. The new biometric passports however, require that you sign the passport on the day when you apply for the passport, which is done by signing with a digital pen on a tablet, after which the image <b>of</b> the <b>signature</b> is printed on the first page along with the other data, and cannot be altered thereafter.|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} Universal Designated Verifier Signature (UDVS), {{introduced}} by Steinfeld et al. in Asiacrypt 2003, allows any <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> a <b>signature</b> to convince any designated verifier that the signer indeed generated the signature without revealing the signature itself, while the verifier cannot transfer the proof to convince anyone else of this fact. Such signature schemes can protect the privacy <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> <b>holders</b> and have applications in certification systems. Very recently, {{as pointed out}} by Baek et al. in Asiacrypt 2005, one significant inconvenience of all existing UDVS schemes is that they require the designated verifier to create a public key using the signer’s public key parameter and have it certified to ensure the resulting public key {{is compatible with the}} setting that the signer provided. This is unrealistic in some situations where the verifier is not willing to go through such setup process. Baek et al. introduced the concept of Universal Designated Verifier Signature Proof (UDVSP) to solve this problem. In this paper, we first introduce the idea of identity-based (ID-based) UDVSP system. Furthermore, we point out that the algorithm “Signature Transformation ST ” of the UDVSP defined by Baek et al. can be eliminated, which results in a more efficient UDVSP system. We present two ID-based UDVSP systems based on bilinear pairings, and provide the security proofs of our systems in the random oracle model...|$|R
