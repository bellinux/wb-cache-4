5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his <b>skin</b> <b>tone,</b> it was also widely suggested that his lighter <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E

Two years later, a controversy arose when she appeared in an advert promoting a L'Oréal product; it showed Pinto in what was perceived to be a lighter <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> due to make-up or editing. The company denied claims of retouching Pinto's picture.|$|E

Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in {{with the addition of a}} skin texture over the animation.

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{in which}} the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar {{from one of the}} five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar can have their eye and hair color, facial features, and <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> customized, and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. Their chosen tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed.|$|E

40|$|Employing the {{pioneering}} work of Charles Parrish {{as a basis}} of comparison, this study serves as a follow-up to “Color Names and Color Notions ” by deconstructing the contemporary language and attitudes surrounding skin color. Nine focus groups with 58 black {{women between the ages}} of 18 and 25 reveal that the color names and color notions offered were consistent with many of the terms and stereotypes that Parrish found, thereby indicating that there has been no change in colorist ideology among African Americans. Participants discussed 40 color names regularly employed to describe light, medium, and dark <b>skin</b> <b>tones.</b> The terms and attitudes associated with light <b>skin</b> <b>tones</b> were generally negative; conversely, the terms and attitudes asso-ciated with dark <b>skin</b> <b>tones</b> were derogatory. The language and beliefs con-nected to medium <b>skin</b> <b>tones</b> indicate that colorism operates as a three-tiered structure rather than the traditionally situated binary paradigm...|$|R

25|$|More recent {{analysis}} of Cro-Magnon fossils indicates {{that they had}} larger skulls than modern populations, and possessed a dolichocephalic (long-headed) and low cranium, with a wide face. It also suggests that some Cro-Magnons may have had brown skin. The very light <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> found in modern Northern Europeans is a relatively recent phenomenon.

30|$|Another surprise: Americans’ {{preference}} for lighter <b>skin</b> <b>tones</b> and the advantages it confers on the possessors {{have been widely}} documented in the past (Jones, 2000).
