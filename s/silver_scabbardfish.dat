40|$|Important {{reproduction}} {{aspects of}} six demersal species from Azores were studied: red (blackspot) seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo), bluemouth (Helicolenus daclylopterus), two alfonsinos (Beryx splendens and Beryx decadac~lus), yellow-orange scorpionfish (Pontinus kuhlii) and <b>silver</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Lepidopus caudatus). Sex ratios were calculated and tested by chi-square analysis. In {{order to determine}} the size at first maturity, maturation ogives were estimated using Logistic or Gompertz models. The gonadosomatic index was determined for those species for which the reproductive period was not well known. The ratio of males to females was significantly different (p< 0. 05) from 1 :l for all species: P. bogaraveo (1 : 0. 20), H. dactylopterus (1 : 0. 86), B. splendens (1 : 1. 25), B. decadactylus (1 : 1. 38), P. kuhlii (l : 1. 75) and L. calrdatus (1 : 1. 74).

40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), {{polychlorinated dibenzofurans}} (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{concentrations}} were determined in three species of edible fish from Sepetiba bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: <b>silver</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Lepidopuscaudatus), Whitemouth croaker (Micropogoniasfurnieri), and mullets (Mugilliza), which {{were collected in}} July 2012. PCDD/Fs and PCBs were determined by high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRGC/HRMS) according to the US EPA 1613 B, 8290 A, and US EPA 1668 B methods. The concentration of total PCDDs/PCDFs ranged from 0. 10105 ~ 0. 2141 pg-WHO-TEQ/g ww and PCBs ranged from 0. 08834 ~ 0. 62304 pg-WHO-TEQ/g ww. Judging from the European Union regulation limit levels of PCDD/PCDFs and PCDD/PCDFs/PCBs were lower than the criteria in all samples. The main objective of the survey was to obtain information about existing levels of pollutants, having as a consequence the possibility of providing preventive actions and assessing risk; but, the results showed the dietary consumption of fish from Sepetiba region, did not represent a risk for human health...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{identification of}} anisakid nematodes at any life cycle stage is important both to deepen the knowledge on their taxonomy, ecology, epidemiology and for diagnosis and control, as larval stages cause a clinical disease in humans known as anisakidosis. With the aim {{to investigate the}} presence of anisakid larvae, specimens of horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus (Linnaeus, 1758), <b>silver</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> Lepidopus caudatus (Euphrasen, 1788), European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus (Linnaeus, 1758) and opah fish, Lampris guttatus (Brunnich, 1788), were collected by trawling at depths ranging from 50 to 400. m. A molecular approach based on restriction profiles obtained after digestion of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region was used to identify Anisakis spp. larvae recovered in fish samples. Restriction profiles showed three banding patterns, corresponding to Anisakis pegreffii, Anisakis physeteris and to heterozygote pattern between A. pegreffii and Anisakis simplex s. s. Specimens showing the heterozygote restriction pattern were also analyzed by sequencing of the entire ITS region, to confirm the heterozygote status. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>silver</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> Lepidopus caudatus (Euphrasen 1788) is a bathypelagic fish {{living off}} the Canary Islands. The sexual pattern, {{reproductive}} cycle and growth were studied from samples collected from October 1996 and December 1997. The macroscopic observations and the histological analysis of the gonads reveal that this species is a gonochoristic species, showing the ovary a group-synchronous development. A new macroscopic and histological maturity scale of six stages was elaborated according to multiple spawning pattern observed in females. The development of the testis is continuous or unrestricted spermatogonial type being acinar the type of spermatogenesis. Range of length of fish was between 141 and 189 cm FL predominating the females in the catches (89. 6 % of the total). The length-weight and length-length relationships studied did not point out differences between sexes. Age was determined in whole otoliths ranging from 1 to 7 years in females and between 1 and 5 years in males. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated for females were L∞ = 186. 90 cm FL, k = 0. 23 year- 1 and to =- 1. 23 years...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates {{the effects of}} {{different}} cooking methods (grilling, frying and boiling) on selenium contents of six marine species commonly consumed in Portugal. Forty-two composite samples of sardine, horse mackerel, gilthead seabream, <b>silver</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> hake and octopuswere digested in a microwave systemand analysed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The described method is adequate {{for the analysis of}} selenium in marine species and meets the requirements of validation and quality control. Mean selenium contents in raw species ranged from 0. 35 mg kg− 1 to 1. 24 mg kg− 1. Cooked samples presented mean selenium contents from 0. 38 mg kg− 1 to 1. 85 mg kg− 1 in grilled fish, from 1. 22 mg kg− 1 to 1. 28 mg kg− 1 in fried fish and from 0. 84 mg kg− 1 to 0. 87 mg kg− 1 in boiled fish. No statistically significant differences were determined for selenium levels in raw and cooked samples and in different marine species. Estimated selenium intake agrees well with recommendations and is far below the Upper Tolerable Nutrient Level. This is the first study concerning the evaluation of the effects of cooking methods on selenium contents of marine species consumed in Portugal.

40|$|Dissertação de mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 An {{experimental}} crustacean {{bottom trawling}} survey targeting the {{deep-water rose shrimp}} Parapenaeus longirostris was carried out off the south of Portugal over five 24 -hour cycles. Although circadian bias in the catch rates for this fishery has been reported, no conclusive study had been carried out until now. Catch per unit effort oscillated with {{the time of the}} day. Total catches, both in numbers and weight considerably higher in daytime than at night, suggesting that the 24 -hour light cycle strongly influences catchability of rose shrimp. The rose shrimp, shows a clear shift in abundance from daytime to night hours, with catches decreasing sharply at dusk and, then increasing significantly at dawn. Overall, the most captured fish species: european hake, Merluccius merluccius; monkfish, Lophius budegassa; european conger, Conger conger; and great forkbeard, Phycis blennoides; present the same trend, although less marked. The exceptions are: <b>silver</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> Lepidopus caudatus; blue Whiting, Micromesistius poutassou; tongue sole, Symphurus nigrescens; atlantic mackarel Scomber scombrus and silver cod, Gadiculus argenteus; whose catches were higher in the night hours. Understanding, the circadian variability in catches of highly valuable commercial species such as the deep-water rose shrimp may contribute to an improved management, by allowing a better control of fishing effort and more efficient use of technical measure...|$|E
