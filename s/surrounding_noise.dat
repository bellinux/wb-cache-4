This paper presents a novel iris segmentation scheme which utilizes the orientation matching transform to outline the outer and inner iris boundaries initially. It then employs Delogne-Kåsa circle fitting (instead of the traditional Hough transform) to further eliminate the outlier points to extract a more precise iris area from an eye-image. In the extracted iris region, the proposed scheme further utilizes {{the differences in the}} intensity and positional characteristics of the iris, eyelid, and eyelashes to detect and delete these noises. The scheme is then applied on iris image database, UBIRIS. v 1. The experimental results show that the presented scheme provides a more effective and efficient iris segmentation than other conventional methods...|$|R

Face to face conversation and group meeting through video mobile phone become standard usage of video mobile service. People will put the mobile phone in front of his/her face when they use this kind of service.

And sound source localization model (SSLM) is the first approach. In this paper, we used feed forward neural network (FFNN) to simulate the hyperplane to map the detected time intervals to space coordinates. Thus the SSLM computation complexity is reduced and automatic adaptability is achieved. Experiments have been done to show the feasibility and high accuracy of this method. Furthermore, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm has been proposed to be our training algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Seismic {{attributes}} {{have been}} widely used in seismic object detection. While no unique attribute is expected to perfectly identify the targeted object, various attributes contributing to the same purpose should be utilized simultaneously when performing detection. Artificial neural network has been successfully applied in seismic object detection by combining multiple attributes into a single object-sensitive attribute. An optimized neural network fault detection approach was introduced by a case study from Stratton field, south Texas, United States. Results indicate that the new produced “fault probability ” attribute could suppress the <b>surrounding</b> <b>noises</b> and highlight the faults. Application of ant-tracking to the fault-cube shows more convincible results than to individual attributes. In addition, several potential cross-strike fractures increase the structural complexity. The neural network-based fault detection contributes to better structural interpretation and is of great significance to hydrocarbon exploration, especially in area with complex fault system...|$|R

50|$|Moreover, {{the earth}} used {{to fill in}} the bay to create the park was not clean. Although it is {{unlikely}} it ever included much night soil (human excrement) the ground was created using builders spoil from construction sites throughout the city along with much unidentifiable 'rubbish', probably including many fragments of lead paint. Over the years this material has undoubtedly been inundated with leakage of chemicals from the adjacent industries; arsenic and cyanide from the timber yards for example. This means the ground soil of the park (ironically intended as a healthy place and a refuge from the <b>surrounding</b> <b>noise</b> and pollution) is itself contaminated. To mitigate this the playground was recently reconstructed over an impermeable layer to stop emissions of toxic gasses from the ground.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an architecture extending bottom-up visual attention for dynamic scene analysis. In dy-namic scenes, particularly when learning actions from demon-strations, robots have to stably {{focus on the}} relevant movement by disregarding <b>surrounding</b> <b>noises,</b> but still maintain sensi-tivity to a new relevant movement, which might occur in the surroundings. In {{order to meet the}} contradictory requirements of stability and sensitivity for attention, this paper intro-duces biologically-inspired mechanisms for retinal filtering and stochastic attention selection. The former reduces the complex-ity of peripheral signals by filtering an input image. It results in enhancing bottom-up saliency in the fovea as well as in detecting only prominent signals from the periphery. The latter allows robots to shift attention to a less but still salient location in the periphery, which is likely relevant to the demonstrated action. Integrating these mechanisms with computation for bottom-up saliency enables robots to extract important action sequences from task demonstrations. Experiments with a simulated and a natural scene show better performance of the proposed model than comparative models. I...|$|R

50|$|Dr. Feng’s work {{applies the}} neuroethology of frog {{communication}} to medicine. A recent project on hearing aids {{is based on}} how female frogs find their mates. Females must recognize the male they choose by his call. By localizing where his call is coming from she can find him. An additional challenge {{is that she is}} localizing his call while listening to the many other frogs in the chorus, and to the noise of the stream and insects. The breeding pond is a very noisy place, and females must distinguish a male’s calls from the other noise. How they recognize the sound pattern of the male they are pursuing from the <b>surrounding</b> <b>noise</b> is similar to how intelligent hearing aids help people hear certain sounds and cancel out others. The underlying neural mechanisms are fast neural oscillations, and synaptic inhibition to cancel out noise. The timing and frequency of the sound also play a part in frog communication and may be used in Feng’s work. He also studies bat echolocation to create intelligent hearing aids. He is also working on cochlear implants.|$|E

50|$|TV Ears, {{or sound}} {{clarifying}} headsets, {{are classified as}} an assistive listening device and are specifically designed for clear and distinct television listening and dialogue comprehension. For this reason, TV Ears are legally {{able to have a}} volume of 120 decibels. Using break through digital technology, known as Voice Clarifying Circuitry, the headsets work to automatically and exponentially increase the gain on high frequency sounds. This works to make the words appear clearer from audio tracks that are on television programs or movies. Unlike traditional headphones, TV Ears are worn under the listener’s chin where they hook to the ears. With the wireless technology of TV Ears the user is capable of setting a volume and tone that they’re comfortable with, without upsetting others in the vicinity. This is in contrast to noise reduction headphones, which hush ambient sounds by creating frequencies that minimalize <b>surrounding</b> <b>noise.</b> However, like headphones, TV Ears are designed for single-user use, meaning that multiple sets must be purchased in the home for multiple and different users.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} learn and engage in a {{classroom}} environment, children {{must be able to}} direct their attention effectively. Specifically, children {{need to be able to}} extract the important messages from the <b>surrounding</b> <b>noise</b> or distractions. Adults are much more adept at blocking out distracting information in their environment compared to children. Therefore, the distractions that might impact a child’s ability to focus his or her attention may be difficult for an adult to appreciate. Distractions can present themselves in the form of auditory sounds, such as other children talking in the classroom, noise from a television, cars driving by outside, etc. However, visual information can also be distracting to children, hindering them from properly focusing their attention. For instance, if a child is attempting to concentrate on a given task in a room where there are many interesting things around her, the abundance of visual information will make it harder for her to concentrate on the task at hand. The more distractions that are present in the child’s environment, the more effortful it will be for the child to effectively focus her attention.|$|E

He uses its universal language adaptor to interpret for foreign clients or to relive moments from his childhood. During a camping trip in Lake Winnipesaukee, his parents had a barbeque, but the other kids had declined his invitation in favor of another family that was better off. This affected Michael's adult personality; he is determined to succeed in order to avoid raising his family in the same squalor his parents did. Morty attempts to explain the error of Michael's work ethic, and reminds him to not to take Donna for granted by showing some of Michael's past girlfriends who were homely or had awful personalities. However, Michael ultimately uses the remote to skip quarrels with Donna, to avoid suffering a cold by skipping to the point at which he recovers, and to skip a family dinner in order to finish an important project. Later, Morty reveals that when Michael fast-forwards through time, his body is on [...] "auto-pilot", meaning his mind skips ahead while his body goes through the motions of everyday life. After seeing his children upset that he cannot afford new bicycles he promised for them, Michael decides to use the remote to fast forward to when Ammer delivers on his promised partnership, but learns that it was one whole year ahead. Michael finds out that, during the span of that year, he entered marriage counseling; his children prefer to watch CSI instead of Dragon Tales; and he missed the death of his dog. To make matters worse, the remote begins fast-forwarding on its own, as a feature that would automatically follow Michael's preferences based on how he used it. Michael's various attempts to dispose of or destroy the remote fail, giving him the resolve to regain agency of his life.|$|E
