5000|$|Reed organ {{frequencies}} {{depend on}} the blowing pressure; the fundamental frequency decreases with medium pressure compared to low pressure, but it increases again at high pressures by several hertz for the bass notes measured. American reed organ measurements showed a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> with sharp pressure transitions when the reed bends above and below its frame. The fundamental itself is nearly the mechanical resonance frequency of the reed. [...] The overtones of the instrument are harmonics of the fundamental, rather than inharmonic, although a weak inharmonic overtone (6.27f) was reported too. The fundamental frequency comes from a transverse mode, whereas weaker higher transverse and torsional modes were measured too. Any torsional modes are excited because of a slight asymmetry in the reed's construction. During attack, it was shown that the reed produces most strongly the fundamental, along with a second transverse or torsional mode, which are transient.|$|E

40|$|Free {{induction}} decay (FID) {{measured by}} {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) in a polycrystalline solid is the isotropic average of the FIDs for individual single crystallites. It has been recently proposed theoretically and verified experimentally that the long-time behavior of single-crystal FIDs has the universal form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Polycrystalline averaging complicates the situation theoretically, while the available experimental evidence is also ambiguous. Exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been observed for Xe- 129 in polycrystalline solid xenon but not for F- 19 in the powder of CaF 2. In this paper, we present the first principles FID calculations for the powders of both CaF 2 and solid xenon. In both cases, the asymptotic long-time behavior has the expected form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations,</b> which {{is determined by the}} single crystallite FID with the slowest exponential decay. However, this behavior appears only at rather small values of the signal that have not yet been measured in experiments. At intermediate times accessible experimentally, a polycrystalline FID depends on the distribution of the exponential decay constants and oscillation frequencies for single crystallite FIDs. In CaF 2, these parameters are relatively broadly distributed, and as a result, the <b>sinusoidal</b> long-time <b>oscillations</b> become somewhat washed out. In contrast, the single crystallite parameters are more clustered in solid xenon, and, as a result, the experimentally observable range is characterized by well-defined oscillation frequency and exponential decay constant even though both of these parameters do not represent the true long-time behavior. The above difference of the intermediate FID behavior originates from the difference of the crystal structures of solid xenon and CaF 2. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the formation of}} lamellipodia and filopodia, intracellular concentration and cross-talk between different Rho proteins drives the extensions and contractions that cause cellular locomotion. Sakumura et al. proposed a model based on differential equations that helps explain the activity of Rho proteins and their relationship to motion. This model encompassed the three proteins Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac. Cdc42 was assumed to encourage filopodia elongation and block actin depolymerization. RhoA was considered to encourage actin retraction. Rac was treated to encourage lamellipodia extension but block actin depolymerization. These three proteins, although significantly simplified, covered the key steps in cellular locomotion. Through various mathematical techniques, solutions to the differential equations that described various regions of activity based on intracellular activity were found. The paper concludes by showing that the model predicts that there are a few threshold concentrations that cause interesting effects on the activity of the cell. Below a certain concentration, there is very little activity, causing no extension of the arms and feet of the cell. Above a certain concentration, the Rho protein causes a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> much like the extensions and contractions of the lamellipodia and filopodia. In essence, this model predicts that increasing the intracellular concentration of these three key active Rho proteins causes an out-of-phase activity of the cell, resulting in extensions and contractions that are also out of phase.|$|E
5000|$|William R. Hewlett's Wien bridge {{oscillator}} can {{be considered}} as a combination of a differential amplifier and a Wien bridge, connected in a positive feedback loop between the amplifier output and differential inputs. At the oscillating frequency, the bridge is almost balanced and has very small transfer ratio. The loop gain {{is a product of the}} very high amplifier gain and the very low bridge ratio. [...] In Hewlett's circuit, the amplifier is implemented by two vacuum tubes. The amplifier's inverting input is the cathode of tube V1 and the non-inverting input is the control grid of tube V2. To simplify analysis, all the components other than R1, R2, C1 and C2 can be modeled as a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 1+Rf/Rb and with a high input impedance. R1, R2, C1 and C2 form a bandpass filter which is connected to provide positive feedback at the frequency of oscillation. Rb self heats and increases the negative feedback which reduces the amplifier gain until the point is reached that there is just enough gain to sustain <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> without over driving the amplifier. If R1 = R2 and C1 = C2 then at equilibrium Rf/Rb = 2 and the amplifier gain is 3. When the circuit is first energized, the lamp is cold and the gain of the circuit is greater than 3 which ensures start up. The dc bias current of vacuum tube V1 also flows through the lamp. This does not change the principles of the circuit's operation, but it does reduce the amplitude of the output at equilibrium because the bias current provides part of the heating of the lamp.|$|E

The present paper concerns with an examination on wave characteristics of these monochromatic <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> and on an oscillation mechanism by analyzing numerous wave events observed by ATS- 6. The results indicate that oscillations show a clear local time variation {{in the period}}, shorter in the morning and longer in the evening. With regard to an oscillation mechanism our conclusion strongly supports a hypothesis that the second harmonic resonance oscillation of standing Alfven wave is most probably an oscillation mode near the synchronous orbit at 6. 6 earth radii. Another examination of the satellite and ground correlation of those waves indicates that there is a clear evidence of a rotation of the principal axis of the waves observed by the satellite and on the ground...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed to investigate free and forced oscillation {{of a gas}} bubble and cavitation in viscoelastic liquids of a three‐parameter Oldroyd model. The first‐order perturbation method for small amplitudes has been employed to obtain periodic solutions to the bubble dynamics equation.

It is disclosed that transient behavior of the bubble in viscoelastic liquids is governed by five dimensionless parameters. Conditions for stable bubbles are obtained. Free oscillation consists of a decaying exponential component and a damped <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> associated with the natural frequency of the bubble‐liquid system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to extend the {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) passive dynamic biped walker to a 3 -D dynamic biped walker, i. e., a walker that can walk on a horizontal surface based on a passive dynamic walking. A new prototype of 3 -D biped walker called RW 04, which has telescopic knee joints, was developed and its ability for walking was validated through some experiments. A <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation,</b> which is regarded as a central pattern generator with no sensory feedback, was provided to the knee joints to achieve the biped walking. The results showed that the biped gait of RW 04 was possible only via a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the knee joint. Moreover, the 3 -D dynamic walking gait via frequency response and zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory was also analyzed. The biped locomotion had a resonance, i. e., the frequency matched the natural frequency of the locomotion in the gain property. An “ 8 ” shaped ZMP trajectory was observed, which was found to be similar to that of the human gait. However, the simple <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> had limitations such as stride reduction or discontinuation by phase difference. Therefore, in future work, more adaptable control strategy such as a sensory feedback using ZMP should be provided. ...|$|E
