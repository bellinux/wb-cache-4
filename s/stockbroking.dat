In 1951, he became chairman of the associated sporting committee of the National Fitness Council of Western Australia; he served in this role until 1967. Aged 79, Brownell died at Subiaco, Western Australia, on 12 April 1974 and was accorded a funeral with full Air Force honours. Brownell's autobiography, From Khaki to Blue, was posthumously published by the Military Historical Society of Australia in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Allen did {{not feel}} suited to working in a {{department}} store, and on his return home took {{a job with the}} <b>stockbroking</b> company David Bevan and Co. Consequently, he played little cricket in 1933. He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form, so he was persuaded to play in the first Test. He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team. In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets. That December, he was elected {{as a member of the}} Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned in the Royal Australian Air Force during 1921, Brownell {{had risen}} {{to the rank of}} group captain by the {{beginning}} of the Second World War. Establishing the Royal Australian Air Force base in Singapore, he returned to Australia in 1941 as an air commodore and was appointed to lead No. 1 Training Group. He was Air Officer Commanding Western Area from January 1943 until July 1945, when he took charge of the recently formed No.11 Group on Morotai. Retiring from the Air Force in 1947, Brownell assumed a partnership in a <b>stockbroking</b> firm. He died in 1974 at the age of 79; his autobiography, From Khaki to Blue, was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed <b>stockbroking</b> during 1942. In his {{biography}} of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|With retirements of both Woodfull and Ponsford {{following}} the 1934 tour to England, {{positions at the}} top of the Australia's batting order became available. Fingleton also found state cricket more attractive now that Bradman had decided to move to South Australia to take up <b>stockbroking.</b> Fingleton responded to his omission from the Ashes tour by leading the run-scoring aggregates in the 1934–35 season. He scored 880 runs at 58.66 with four centuries and four fifties, almost 200 runs more than the second most prolific batsman, Brown. After Fingleton started the summer with a fifty in Woodfull's testimonial match, the pair started the Shield campaign with a 249-run stand in New South Wales' first match of the season against South Australia, both scoring centuries in an innings victory. Fingleton made 134 in just over three hours. Fingleton reached 49 at least once in the remaining five matches, including a 108 against Queensland. Despite the form of the openers, New South Wales failed to win the Sheffield Shield after losing both of their matches against Victoria. Fingleton ended the season with consecutive centuries, 124 and 100, against Western Australia, and took the first of two first-class wickets in his career in the first of the two matches.|$|E
5|$|Deregulation in the 1980s, {{culminating}} in the Big Bang in 1986, also encouraged the bank to enter the securities business. County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various <b>stockbroking</b> and jobbing firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible overdraft facility on which customers only pay interest (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex electronic purse (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches across two states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged into National Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{except the}} odd occasion, he wasn't the stroke player {{that he had}} been. He served as Billy Griffith's vice captain at Sussex in 1946 and took over the {{captaincy}} {{for the next three}} seasons. In 1947, he lifted Sussex from bottom to ninth place, but they slipped back to 16th and 14th in the next two years. He scored more than a thousand runs in 1938, 1939 and 1947. Before the 1950 season, he resigned the captaincy following some disputes and returned to <b>stockbroking.</b> Later, he reconciled with the club and served as the President between 1977 and 1979.|$|E

500|$|After the war, Allen {{dedicated}} most of {{his time}} to <b>stockbroking</b> and was made a partner by David Bevan and Co. He had little time for cricket, although he appeared twice for Middlesex in 1946. The following season, he played once for Middlesex, and captained their second team. He also played twice for the Free Foresters, a club of wandering amateurs, in first-class games. Late in the 1947 season, Allen was asked to captain and manage an MCC team which was to tour the West Indies that winter. The young and experimental team suffered badly with injuries; Allen missed several matches himself through strains. In first-class games on the tour he scored 262 runs and took six wickets, but writing in Wisden, Norman Preston judged: [...] "Allen was too old." [...] Allen also clashed with several members of his team; he did not get along with Ken Cranston, his vice-captain, nor Joe Hardstaff, his senior professional. When Allen tried to impose discipline on the team to prevent his players staying out late to drink alcohol, neither Cranston nor Hardstaff backed him.|$|E

The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. [...] Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's <b>stockbroking</b> firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the [...] situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.|$|E
500|$|Lukis took up {{his final}} RAAF posting, as Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, in December 1945. With the end of hostilities, he was summarily retired along {{with a number of}} other senior commanders and {{veterans}} of World WarI, ostensibly {{to make way for the}} advancement of younger and equally capable officers. According to RAAF historian Alan Stephens, the Air Board believed that Lukis [...] "had not taken a role commensurate with his seniority during the war, a strange accusation to make against a man who had been Air Member for Personnel and AOC of the RAAF's most important operational group in the Southwest Pacific Area". He was officially discharged on 2May 1946. Employed by Australian National Airways (ANA) after leaving the Air Force, Lukis become airfield manager at Essendon, Melbourne. He took over the airline's Canberra office in 1952, before joining a <b>stockbroking</b> firm in 1957, the year that ANA merged with Ansett Airways to become Ansett-ANA. Active in veterans' organisations, he served as president of the Air Force Association in Victoria during 1947–48, and helped found the Commonwealth Club in Canberra in 1954. Survived by his wife and children, Frank Lukis died in Melbourne of cancer on 18February 1966, and was cremated.|$|E

2500|$|... 1937: The Australian Associated Stock Exchanges (AASE) was {{established}} in 1937. Since 1903 the state stock exchanges had met on an informal basis, but in 1936 Sydney {{took the lead in}} formalising the association. Initially, this involved the exchanges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Sydney. Melbourne and Perth joined soon after. Through the AASE the exchanges gradually brought in common listing requirements for companies and uniform brokerage and other rules for <b>stockbroking</b> firms. They also set the ground rules for commissions and the flotation of government and semi-government loan raisings.|$|E
2500|$|Just as London enjoyed growth through {{international}} trade, {{the rest}} of Great Britain also benefited from the economic boom. Two other cities, in particular, showed great business development, Liverpool and Manchester. Consequently, in 1836 both the Manchester and Liverpool stock exchanges were opened. Some stocks were known to rise in price by ten, twenty or even thirty percent in a week. These were times when <b>stockbroking</b> was considered a real business profession and such attracted many entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, with booms came busts, and in 1835 the [...] "Spanish panic" [...] hit the markets, also followed by a second one two years later.|$|E

2500|$|Korean Air {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} {{examples}} of the South Korean [...] "chaebol" [...] system, wherein corporate conglomerates, established with government support, overreach diverse branches of industry. For much of the time between the foundation of Korean Air as Korean National Airlines in 1946 and the foundation of Asiana Airlines in 1988, Korean Air was the only airline operating in South Korea. The process of privatization of Korean National Airlines in 1969 was supported by Park Chung-hee, the South Korean military general-president who seized power of the country through a military coup d'état; and the monopoly of the airline was secured for two decades. After widening the Jaebeol branches, the subsidiary corporations of Korean Air include marine and overland transportation businesses, hotels and real estate among others; and the previous branches included heavy industry, passenger transportation, construction and a <b>stockbroking</b> business. The nature of the South Korean chaebeol system involves nepotism. A series of incidents involving Korean Air in 2000s have [...] "revealed an ugly side of the culture within chaebeols, South Korean’s giant family-run conglomerates".|$|E
2500|$|Bradman {{volunteered for}} the RAAF in 1940, but {{transferred}} to the Australian Army as a lieutenant in the Army School of Physical Training. Stress and depression aggravated his fibrositis and he was invalided out of the army in 1941, after which he spent months in poor physical condition and lost {{the use of his}} right thumb and forefinger. He resumed <b>stockbroking</b> in 1942 and set up his own firm after his employer was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement. In 1945 he joined the South Australian Cricket Association and became their representative with the Board of Control and he seriously considered retiring from cricket in order to concentrate on an administrative role. He played a few games in 1945–46, but Richard Whittington thought he was [...] "the ghost of a once great cricketer". The press and public badly wanted to see him play and after a few warm up matches Bradman agreed to captain Australia against the advice of his doctor. In the First Test he played poorly for 28 when he chopped a ball to Jack Ikin in gully. The England players (and Keith Miller from the dressing room) thought he was out, but Bradman was confident that the ball had been jammed into the ground by his bat before it flew up to Ikin and refused to walk. The umpire gave him the benefit of the doubt, but Wally Hammond told Bradman [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series." [...] Bradman went on to make a match-winning 187 and it was thought if Bradman had been given out he would have retired from cricket.|$|E

He was engaged on a Work--he spoke of it always with bated breath, and a capital letter was implied in his intonation; the Work was one on the Interpretation of Prophecy. Unlike Lady Georgina, who was tart and crisp, Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst was devout and decorous; where she said 'pack of fools,' he talked with unction of 'the mental {{deficiencies}} of our poorer brethren.' But his religious opinions and his <b>stockbroking</b> had got strangely mixed up at the wash somehow. He was convinced that the British nation represented the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel--and in particular Ephraim--a matter on which, as a mere lay-woman, I would not presume either to agree with him or to differ from him.

60|$|The Englishwoman's Year-Book {{contains}} a really {{extraordinary amount of}} useful information on every subject connected with woman's work. In the census taken in 1831 (six years before the Queen ascended the Throne), no occupation whatever was specified as appertaining to women, except that of domestic service; but in the census of 1881, the number of occupations mentioned as followed by women is upwards of three hundred and thirty. The most popular occupations seem to be those of domestic service, school teaching, and dressmaking; the lowest numbers on the list are those of bankers, gardeners, and persons engaged in scientific pursuits. Besides these, the Year-Book makes mention of <b>stockbroking</b> and conveyancing as professions that women are beginning to adopt. The historical account of the literary work done by Englishwomen in this century, as given in the Year-Book, is curiously inadequate, and the list of women's magazines is not complete, but in all other respects the publication seems a most useful and excellent one.|$|E
60|$|And observe also, that of {{the three}} types of lout, whose {{combined}} chorus and tripudiation leads the present British Constitution its devil's dance, this last and smoothest type is also the dullest. Your operative lout cannot indeed hold his cup of coffee with a grace, or possess himself of a biscuit from Lady Clara's salver without embarrassment; but, in his own mill, he can at least make a needle without an eye, or a nail without a head, or a knife that won't cut, or something of that sort, with dexterity. Also, the middle class, or Smithian lout, at least manages his <b>stockbroking</b> or marketing with decision and cunning; knows something by eye or touch of his wares, and something of the characters of the men he has to deal with. But the Ducal or Marquisian lout has no knowledge of anything under the sun, except what sort of horse's quarters will carry his own, farther weighted with that smooth block or pebble of a pow; and no faculty under the sun of doing anything, except cutting down the trees his fathers planted for him, and selling the lands his fathers won.|$|E

60|$|After slowly {{attaining}} {{her present}} amount of convalescence, she had there stopped short, without progress in strength or spirits, and alarms constantly varying for her head, spine, and lungs, {{as if the}} slightest accidental cause might fix permanent disease in either quarter; and to those who daily watched her, and knew the miserable effects produced by the merest trifles, it was terrible to think that her destination was {{in the hands of}} a comparative stranger, urged on by the dull Augusta and the acid Juliana. Mervyn needed no severer penalty for having forfeited his right to protect his sisters; attached to them and devoted to Bertha as the anxieties of the spring had rendered him. The sight of Bertha had so far modified Lady Bannerman's scheme, that she proposed herself to conduct the three to Brighton, and there remain till the London season, when the two younger could be disposed of in some boarding-school, and Phoebe conducted to Albury-street. Mr. Crabbe did not appear averse to this offer, and there was a correctness about it which rendered it appalling to those who had not Phoebe's quiet trust that no part of it would be allowed to happen unless it were good for them. And she found her eldest brother so much subdued and less vituperative, that she thought him quite obliged by her experienced counsel on his housekeeping and cookery, breaking up his present establishment and letting the house for a year, during which she promised him all facilities for meeting a young widow, the wealth of whose <b>stockbroking</b> husband would be exactly what his business and estate required, and would pay off all his debts.|$|E
60|$|The real {{business}} of life, I fancy, can form but little {{portion of the}} novelist's budget. When he is speaking of the profession of arms, in which men can show courage or the reverse, and in treating of which the writer naturally {{has to deal with}} interesting circumstances, actions, and characters, introducing recitals of danger, devotedness, heroic deaths, and the like, the novelist may perhaps venture to deal with actual affairs of life: but otherwise, they scarcely can enter into our stories. The main part of Ficulnus's life, for instance, is spent in selling sugar, spices and cheese; of Causidicus's in poring over musty volumes of black-letter law; of Sartorius's in sitting, cross-legged, on a board after measuring gentlemen for coats and breeches. What can a story-teller say about the professional existence of these men? Would a real rustical history of hobnails and eighteenpence a day be endurable? In the days whereof we are writing, the poets of the time chose to represent a shepherd in pink breeches and a chintz waistcoat, dancing before his flocks, and playing a flageolet tied up with a blue satin ribbon. I say, in reply to some objections which have been urged by potent and friendly critics, that of the actual affairs of life the novelist cannot be expected to treat--with the almost single exception of war before named. But law, <b>stockbroking,</b> polemical theology, linen-drapery, apothecary-business, and the like, how can writers manage fully to develop these in their stories? All authors can do, is to depict men out of their business--in their passions, loves, laughters, amusements, hatreds, and what not--and describe these as well as they can, taking the business part for granted, and leaving it as it were for subaudition.|$|E
6000|$|She rose superior, above all, on {{the happy}} {{fact that there}} were always gentlemen in town and that gentlemen were her {{greatest}} admirers; gentlemen from the City in especial--as to whom she was full of information about the passion and pride excited in such breasts by the elements of her charming commerce. The City men did in short go in for flowers. There was a certain type of awfully smart stockbroker--Lord Rye called them Jews and bounders, but she didn't care--whose extravagance, she more than once threw out, had really, if one had any conscience, to be forcibly restrained. It was not perhaps a pure love of beauty: {{it was a matter of}} vanity and a sign of business; they wished to crush their rivals, and that was one of their weapons. Mrs. Jordan's shrewdness was extreme; she knew in any case her customer--she dealt, as she said, with all sorts; and it was at the worst a race for her--a race even in the dull months--from one set of chambers to another. And then, after all, there were also still the ladies; the ladies of <b>stockbroking</b> circles were perpetually up and down. They were not quite perhaps Mrs. Bubb or Lady Ventnor; but you couldn't tell the difference unless you quarrelled with them, and then you knew it only by their making-up sooner. These ladies formed the branch of her subject on which she most swayed in the breeze; to that degree that her confidant had ended with an inference or two tending to banish regret for opportunities not embraced. There were indeed tea-gowns that Mrs. Jordan described--but tea-gowns were not the whole of respectability, and it was odd that a clergyman's widow should sometimes speak as if she almost thought so. She came back, it was true, unfailingly to Lord Rye, never, evidently, quite losing sight of him even on the longest excursions. That he was kindness itself had become in fact the very moral it all pointed--pointed in strange flashes of the poor woman's nearsighted eyes. She launched at her young friend portentous looks, solemn heralds of some extraordinary communication. The communication itself, from week to week, hung fire; but it was to the facts over which it hovered that she owed her power of going on. [...] "They are, in one way and another," [...] she often emphasised, [...] "a tower of strength"; and as the allusion was to the aristocracy the girl could quite wonder why, if they were so in [...] "one way," [...] they should require to be so in two. She thoroughly knew, however, how many ways Mrs. Jordan counted in. It all meant simply that her fate was pressing her close. If that fate was to be sealed at the matrimonial altar it was perhaps not remarkable that she shouldn't come all at once to the scratch of overwhelming a mere telegraphist. It would necessarily present to such a person a prospect of regretful sacrifice. Lord Rye--if it was Lord Rye--wouldn't be [...] "kind" [...] to a nonentity of that sort, even though people quite as good had been.|$|E
