Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent, and will find extra dimensions, such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to run, or a more general wish to revive a sense of 'Englishness', through raising awareness of the tradition of the past.|$|E

Sheldon focused on the political and scientific situation of this era, and explained his intensive research, saying [...] "all of the puzzles have to be contextual. They all have to either help character, help story or define period." [...] The developers also drew influence from a train museum outside Miami with an original Pullman carriage - the same as the carriages used on the Orient Express in the 1930s. The museum also contained a locomotive similar to the one the developers were looking for. The developers ended up using the train museum, several books about the Orient Express, the 1974 film version of Christie's novel, and the internet as research resources. With Murder on the Orient Express being the first Poirot game produced, Sheldon was careful that the game fitted into Christie's timeline of Poirot's exploits.

I find real difficulty in making this attempt, not from want of matter, nor from want of feeling, but because it is not in the power of any language I can command, to give adequate expression to the affectionate enthusiasm which pervades all ranks of our community, and which is truly characteristic of the humanity and the Christianity of Great Britain. We welcome Mrs. Stowe as the honored instrument of that noble impulse which public opinion and public feeling throughout Christendom have received against the demoralizing and degrading system of human slavery. That system is still, unhappily, identified {{in the minds of many}} with the supposed material interests of society, and even with the well being of the slaves themselves; but the plausible arguments and ingenious sophistries by which it has been defended shrink with shame from the facts without exaggeration, the principles without compromise, the exposures without indelicacy, and the irrepressible glow of hearty feeling--O, how true to nature!--which characterize Mrs. Stowe's immortal book. Yet I feel assured that the effect produced by Uncle Tom's Cabin is not mainly or chiefly to be traced to the interest of the narrative, however captivating, nor to the exposures of the slave system, however withering: these would, indeed, be sufficient to produce a good effect; but this book contains more and better than even these; it contains what will never be lost sight of--the genuine application to the several branches of the subject of the sacred word of God. By no part of this wonderful work has my own mind been so permanently impressed as by the thorough legitimacy of the application of Scripture,--no wresting, no mere verbal adaptation, but in every instance the passage cited is made to illustrate something in the narrative, or in the development of character, in <b>strictest</b> <b>accordance</b> with the design of the passage in its original sacred context. We welcome Mrs. Stowe, then, as an honored fellow-laborer in the highest and best of causes; and I am much mistaken if this tone of welcome be not by far the most congenial to her own feelings. We unaffectedly sympathize with much which she must feel, and, as a lady, more peculiarly feel, in passing through that ordeal of gratulation which is sure to attend her steps in every part of our country; and I am persuaded that we cannot manifest our gratitude for her past services in any way more acceptable to herself than by earnest prayer on her behalf that she may be kept in the simplicity of Christ, enjoying in her daily experience the tender consolations of the Divine Spirit, and in the midst of the most flattering commendations saying and feeling, in the instincts of a renewed heart, 'Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto thy name be the praise, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.'" ...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of a textile requires several stages of mechanical processing such as spinning, weaving, knitting, and garment production, which seem to be insulated from the wet treatment processes like pretreatment, dyeing, printing, and finishing operations. Тhere is a strong interrelation between treatment processes in the dry state and consecutive wet treatments. Most of the processes and products {{have a negative impact}} on the environment. Laws and standards for environmental protection and prescribed <b>strict</b> criteria, in <b>accordance</b> with the laws of the European Union, forced this to be in the spotlight of the textile industry. The textile industry emits a wide variety of pollutants in all stages in the processing of fibres and textile materials. They are: liquid effluent, solid waste, hazardous waste, emissions in the air and noises. Most of the textile waste is composed of natural and synthetic polymeric materials such as: cotton, polyester, nylon, and polypropylene. Recovery from the waste stream includes re-use of a product in its original form and recycling to convert the waste into a new product. Textile recycling is one of the categories for waste management in the textile industries. Typically, recycling technologies are divided into: primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary approaches. Primary approaches involve recycling a product into its original form. Secondary recycling involves melt processing a plastic product into a new product that has a lower level of physical, mechanical and chemical properties. Tertiary recycling involves processes such as: pyrolysis and hydrolysis, which convert the plastic wastes into basic chemicals or fuels. Quaternary recycling refers to burning the textile solid waste and utilizing the heat generated. The predominant method of solid textile waste managment is landfilling. The processes of {{production of}} textiles or wet treatments and finishing processes of textile materials (finishing, dyeing, printing, etc [...] ) are huge consumers of water with high quality. As a result of these various processes, considerable amounts of polluted water are released. There is no single effective treatment of wastewater from the textile industry and it is necessary using a combination of methods in order to achieve the required standards. End-of-pipe technologies are used for wastewater treatment and include sequential application of a set of methods: coagulation / flocculation, flotation, adsorption, evaporation, oxidation, combustion, usе of membranes, etc., that have been adapted to the particular situation of a textile plant. As a result of the extreme variety of textile processes and products, it is impossible to develop a realistic concept for an effective treatment of wastewater without a detailed analysis of the actual situation in the textile plant. It is important to explore all aspects of reducing emissions and waste products from the textile industry because it will result not only in improved environmental performance, but also in substantial savings on individual textile companies. ...|$|R
