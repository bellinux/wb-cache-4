50|$|As a {{consequence}} of its main shareholder's dissatisfaction, the British Caledonian Group's board of directors established contact with ILG's board in November 1985. The purpose of this meeting was to begin exploring ways of combining BCal's and Air Europe's separate short-haul operations in a new joint venture that would have enabled both airlines to acquire the economies of scale to compete with a privatised BA on a level playing field. Another objective of this exercise was to smooth out each other's peaks and troughs, for BCal's peaks occurred during week days while Air Europe's occurred on week-ends. This meant that both airlines could offer their <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> to each other to achieve an overall higher level of equipment utilisation and higher load factors throughout the week. ILG's dominant position in the inclusive tour market would also have helped BCal to significantly increase its generally low short-haul loads by filling seats that would otherwise remain empty with ILG's clients, especially on week-ends. A series of meetings ensued. The result was a 150-page study entitled An Airline for Europe. It envisaged the commencement of joint scheduled operations from Gatwick to Hamburg, Munich, Düsseldorf, Milan Linate and Nice in 1987. The next stage of development was to occur during the 1988/89 winter timetable period when further routes linking Gatwick with Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna, Rome and Athens were to be added. The study also envisaged adding services from Gatwick to Zürich, Dublin, Madrid and Lisbon at a later stage to enable the joint venture to acquire sufficient economies of scale to become a viable entity in the long term. However, it recognised {{that it might be}} difficult to implement the last stage of the envisaged expansion as the relevant routes had already been licensed to Dan-Air.|$|E

An area of prime concern is network survivability. The main challenges within this domain are: to provide survivability schemes under different failure scenarios and {{to reduce the amount of}} required <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> while providing the required quality of service (QoS). Due to its flexibility and simplicity, one candidate technique is pre-allocated restoration. In this paper, the performance of pre-allocated restoration mechanisms are investigated considering a distributed GMPLS-based IP/WDM mesh network under single and dual-link failure scenarios. Several issues are considered. Firstly, two proposed <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation schemes are investigated; link partitioning and lightpath partitioning. Secondly, the paper evaluates a retrial scheme that supports the utilisation of <b>spare</b> <b>capacity.</b> Thirdly, proposed class prioritisation scheme applied to the differentiated survivability concept with pre-allocated restoration is investigated.

40|$|Future {{communication}} networks {{will carry}} many WDM channels {{at very high}} bit rate. Thus, it is desirable to avoid electronic switching at the core. The all-optical backbone network can be interconnected by optical cross-connects at strategic locations to allow for flexible capacity provisioning and fault-tolerant rerouting. Such an all-optical core layer nicely decouples the long-term capacity planning problem from the short-term dynamic bandwidth allocation problem which can be better tackled in the electronic domain. An essential requirement for the all-optical core layer is {{that it must be}} fully fault-tolerant, otherwise, a single failed link can cause a disaster for the entire network. We consider {{the problem of how to}} allocate the required capacities and <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> on a given all-optical core network so as to make the network fully single-fault (or multi-faults) tolerant. The objective function is the total cost of the spare fibers. Based on a given traffic requirement on all source-destination pairs, the optimal bandwidth requirement for each link in the given topology is first computed. We then consider link failures one-by-one for the entire network. For each link failure, we show how spare capacity can be added in other links so as to take advantage of existing <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> that have already been added. The algorithm is based on the shortest path routing algorithm and has a polynomial time complexity.

40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{throughput}} and low complexity achieved by input scheduling based on Birkhoff-von-Neumann (BvN) decomposition; {{the performance of}} the BvN switch becomes less predictable when the input traffic is bursty. In this paper, we propose a deflection-compensated BvN (D-BvN) switch architecture to enhance the quasi-static scheduling based on BvN decomposition. The D-BvN switches provide capacity guarantee for virtual circuits (VCs) and deflect bursty traffic when overflow occurs. The deflection scheme is devised to offset the excessive buffer requirement of each VC when input traffic is bursty. The design of our conditional deflection mechanism is {{based on the fact that}} it is unlikely that the traffic input to VCs is all bursty at the same time; most likely some starving VCs have <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> when some other VCs are in the overflow state. The proposed algorithm makes full use of the <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> of those starving VCs to deflect the overflow traffic to other inputs and provide bandwidth for the deflected traffic to re-access the desired VC. Our analysis and simulation show that this deflection-compensated mechanism can support BvN switches to achieve close to 100 % throughput of offered load even with bursty input traffic, and reduces the average end-to-end delay and delay jitter. Also, our result indicates that the packet out-of-sequence probability due to deflection of overflow traffic is negligible, thus only a small re-sequencing buffer is needed at each output port...|$|E

Using simulated natural listening environments, the aims of this paper were to (1) evaluate an English version of a recently introduced auditory test to measure cognitive <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> that targets the updating process of the executive function, (2) investigate if the test predicts speech comprehension better than the reading span test commonly used to measure working memory capacity, and (3) determine if the test is sensitive to {{increasing the number of}} attended locations during listening.

The investigation {{is based on the}} in-depth dynamic clinicobiochemical study of 43 patients who has undergone surgical myocardial revascularization under extracorporeal circulation. Ten current standardized laboratory tests were used to evaluate the hemostatic system. At the stages of the investigation, the parameters of the latter were determined and the blood hemostatic potential was estimated in the patients with coronary heart disease. Results. The investigation has indicated that in patients with chronic heart disease, hypercoagulation was compensated due to the changes in the anticoagulation and fibrinolytic systems. In patients with the acute coronary syndrome, the indices of the external and internal mechanisms of coagulation were in the normal physiological range at all the stages of the investigation, even at its stage 3 whereas the parameters, such as the levels of soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC), fibrinogen, and D-dimers, suggest thrombinemia and activated coagulation. Conclusion. The absence of activation of the external and internal coagulation pathways with the elevated level of markers of activated coagulation of SFMC and D-dimers in patients with ACS is not that of activation, as such. The patients of this group show a reduction in coagulation factors due to their uptake for the stabilization of the functional status of the hemostatic system.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of provisioning <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> in two-layer backbone networks using shared backup path protection. First, two <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation (SCA) optimization problems are formulated as integer linear programming (ILP) models for the cases of protection at the top layer against failures at the bottom layer. The first model captures failure propagation using overlay information between two layers for backup paths to meet diversity requirements. The second model improves bandwidth efficiency by moving <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> sharing from the top layer to the bottom layer. This exposes a tradeoff between bandwidth efficiency and extra crosslayer operation. Next, the SCA model for common pool protection is developed to allow <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> sharing between two layers. Our previous SCA heuristic technique, successive survivable routing (SSR) is extended for these optimization problems. Numerical results {{for a variety of}} networks indicate that the common pool protection is attractive to enhance bandwidth efficiency without loss of survivability and that the SSR heuristic quickly results in near optimal solutions.

Two important considerations in such approaches are the recovery time and the needed <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> to complete the recovery. Usually, these techniques attempt to achieve a recovery time less than 50 ms. In this paper we introduce an approach that provides link failure recovery in a hitless manner, or without any appreciable delay. This is achieved {{by means of a}} method called diversity coding.

40|$|Summary: Hungary aims at {{reconciling}} its diversification {{efforts and}} improvement of {{its relations with}} Russia. In order to achieve such a balance, diversification is understood not {{as a result of}} Russian threat, but as a consequence of existing imparities in the coun-try’s energy system. Hungary has to decrease the level of its energy supply vulnerability anyway, not particularly because of Russia’s policy. At the same time, Russian supplies are going to remain crucial in the country’s and Europe’s imports even in a more diversi-fied energy landscape. Therefore Hungary tries to help in finding a new balance of inter-ests in the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue and avoid any breakdown in these relations. Hungary {{has one of the most}} one-sided and vulnerable energy systems in the EU 25. Almost half of the primary energy supply consists of natural gas 1, a share comparable only to that of the Netherlands’. What is more, in contrast to the leading gas consumer countries of the EU, Hungary has no significant indigenous production, imports nearly 84 % of its demand exclusively from Russia through the Russian-Ukrainian pipeline network.

The use of integration of computers with telecommunications has created a so-called “Information Age”. The advent of high capacity digital telecommunication facilities has made it possible for the huge amount of traffic to be carried in an economical and efficient method, in recent years. These facilities, which are used to carry much higher capacities than the traditional ones, also result in the network’s vulnerability to the failure of network facilities, i. e. a single link failure. This thesis is concerned with the technology by which the spare capacity on the link of mesh networks is placed {{in order to protect the}} active traffic from network failure with a minimal cost. Although there have been many works to address the issue all of these works have been developed based on the assumption that the link cost with its capacity is linear. In fact, the linear cost functions does not reflect the reality that optic fiber cables with the specific amount of capacities are only available, in other words, the link cost function is stepwise rather than linear. Therefore, all existing algorithms developed for the linear assumption may not be applicable properly for the stepwise case. A novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in this thesis. The algorithm is composed of two parts as follows. In part one, a maximum flow algorithm is employed to work out the maximal amount of feasible spare paths consisting of <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> in the network to re-route the disrupted traffic at the event of network failure. In part two, a newly proposed algorithm is used to find an alternative path on which to place the non-rerouted traffic on the failed link with the minimum network cost increment.

One {{task is to}} route backup paths and allocate <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> in the network to guarantee seamless communications services survivable {{to a set of}} failure scenarios. This is a complex multi-constraint optimization problem, called the <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation (SCA) problem. This paper unravels the SCA problem structure using a matrix-based model, and develops a fast and efficient approximation algorithm, termed successive survivable routing (SSR). First, per-flow <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> sharing is captured by a spare provision matrix (SPM) method. The SPM matrix has a dimension the number of failure scenarios by the number of links. It is used by each demand to route the backup path and share <b>spare</b> <b>capacity</b> with other backup paths. Next, based on a special link metric calculated from SPM, SSR iteratively routes/updates backup paths in order to minimize the cost of total <b>spare</b> <b>capacity.</b> A backup path can be further updated {{as long as it is}} not carrying any traffic. Furthermore, the SPM method and SSR algorithm are generalized from protecting all single link failures to any arbitrary link failures such as those generated by Shared Risk Link Groups or all single node failures. Numerical results comparing several SCA algorithms show that SSR has the best trade-off between solution optimality and computation speed.
