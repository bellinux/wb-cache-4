At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of <b>social</b> <b>pedagogy,</b> majoring in history. At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively. She also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.|$|E
2500|$|While {{still in}} Paris, Ralea was {{confident}} that he would find employment: the University of Iași Chair of Sociology had been set aside for him by Rădulescu-Motru, with Ibrăileanu's approval. The matter was complicated when another Paris graduate, Garabet Aslan, ran for the same position. Supported by Ibrăileanu and Gusti, Ralea was eventually moved to the Logic and Modern Philosophy Department, as an assistant professor to Ion Petrovici, while also employed as lecturer in <b>social</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> According to Ralea's own words, this was a [...] "ridiculous" [...] situation: most of his students were girls, {{some of whom were}} infatuated with him. He had married Ioana Suchianu in November 1923, while still in Bucharest, and lived with her in a small apartment above the Viața Românească offices.|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} study investigates {{what happens}} when students participate in an afterschool science club designed around action-oriented science instruction, a set of curriculum design principles based on <b>social</b> justice <b>pedagogy.</b> Comprised of three manuscripts written for journal publication, the dissertation includes 1) Negotiating community-based action-oriented science teaching and learning: Articulating curriculum design principles, 2) Middle school girls’ socio-scientific participation pathways in an afterschool science club, and 3) Laughing and learning together: Productive science learning spaces for middle school girls. By investigating how action-oriented science design principles get negotiated, female identity development in and with science, {{and the role of}} everyday social interactions as students do productive science, this research fills gaps in the understanding of how <b>social</b> justice <b>pedagogy</b> gets enacted and negotiated among multiple stakeholders including students, teachers, and community members along what identity development looks like across social and scientific activity.

40|$|It {{is common}} for poststructural {{analyses}} of curriculum and pedagogy to question perceived pedagogical truths {{as part of a}} strategy of challenging injustices produced through the institutions, practices, and knowledge structures of education. However, poststructuralism itself has often been subject to the criticism that it is incapable of offering anything other than critique, that it fails to provide pedagogical and curricular alternatives or direction for educational reform. In this chapter we explore the implications and inherent contradictions of poststructural analyses for pedagogy in general, and for <b>social</b> justice <b>pedagogy</b> more specifically. Throughout this discussion, we elaborate the efficacy of poststructural analyses in and for social justice education, arguing that poststructural theory can inform a productive rethinking of <b>social</b> justice <b>pedagogy.</b> In its concern with local manifestations of inequality and injustice, we argue that poststructuralism offers new spaces of freedom for the enactment of a social justice agenda in education...|$|R
