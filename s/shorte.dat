The nexte morning the shipe came, but they were fast, & could not stir till about noone. In the mean time, the shipe maister, perceiveing how the matter was, sente his boate to be getting the men abord whom he saw ready, walking aboute the shore. But after the first boat full was gott abord, & she was ready to goe for more, the Mr. espied a greate company, both horse & foote, with bills, & gunes, & other weapons; for the countrie was raised to take them. The Dutchman seeing this swore his countries oath, 'sacremente,' and having the wind faire, waiged his Ancor, hoysed sayles, & away.

It drew tears from their eyes, and any thing they had they would have given to have been a shore againe; but all in vaine, ther was no remedy, they must thus sadly part. The rest of the men there were in greatest danger, made shift to escape away before the troope could surprise them: those only staying that best might, to be assistante unto the women. But pitifull it was to see the heavie case of these poore women in this distress: what weeping & crying on every side, some for their husbands, that were carried away in the ship as is before related; others not knowing what should become of them, & their little ones; others again melted in teares, seeing their poore little ones hanging aboute them, crying for feare, and quaking with could. Being thus aprehanded, they hurried from one place to another, and from one justice to another, till in the ende they knew not what to doe with them; for to imprison so many women & innocent children for no other cause (many of them) but that they must goo with their husbands, seemed to be unreasonable and all would crie out of them; and to send them home againe was as difficult, for they aleged, as the trueth was, they had no homes to goe to, for they had either sould, or otherwise disposed of their houses & livings.

Through the new media of {{communication}} and transport our horizon has widened radically, and we have the possibility to interact with an ever growing array of people, of organizations, of media, of knowledge. Each of these systems may support us in solving existing problems, but together somehow they seem to create new problems of an unseen complexity. Intuitively it appears that the easier systems can interact, the faster they will change, both individually and as a collective. The faster the evolution of the global system, the more difficult it becomes for the individual subsystems to remain adapted. This explains why so many people nowadays experience feelings of stress, of anxiety and meaninglessness.

Spikes of a few tens of millisecond duration occur at decimetric/microwave wavelength in the particle acceleration phase of solar ares. A rst method determines the dominant spike bandwidth scale based on their scalegram, the mean squared wavelet coecient at each frequency scale. This allows to measure the scale bandwidth independently of heuristic spike selection criteria, e. g. manual selection. The major drawback is a low resolution in the bandwidth. To overcome this uncertainty, a feature detection algorithm and a criterion for spike shape in the time-frequency plane is applied to locate the spikes. In that case, the bandwidth is measured by tting an assumed spike prole into the denoised data. The smallest FWHM bandwidth of spikes was found at 0 : 17 % and 0 : 41 % of the center frequency in the two events. Knowing the <b>shortes</b> [...] ...|$|R

Problem usually happen in decision making are {{there are not enough}} information, a lot of information, information that is not accurate, can not analyze problem and many more. It is also happening in decision making to choose a training. There is some problem that happen in decision making to choose training such as condition that is not surely to choose either of training, there is some training that offered, there is some criterias that influenced toward alternative that given such as student interest, ability that student had toward the training, and the price of training. Method that used in decision support to choose a training are Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Both of method is choosed because AHP is a decision making model that is used to take decision with kind criterias and can use to solve problem that relied on intuition as a main input. TOPSIS is a decision support method that based on concept the best alternative not only has <b>shortes</b> way from positive ideal solution but also has longest way from negative ideal solution. Decision support system use AHP and TOPSIS method can analyse criterias and alternatives that compared and can give recommend alternative that appropriate...|$|R
