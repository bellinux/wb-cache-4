Public gardens have {{played a major role}} in the exploration of plant life, in the acclimatization and introduction of species, in the education of plant life and in plant conservation. Throughout the world, public gardens host more than 200 million people each year, helping their visitors appreciate, enjoy and respect the plant life that sustains our planet. In an age of rapid loss of plant species and wild habitats, gardens have become vital centers of education, research, horticulture and conservation. Gardens have developed roles and responsibilities that are becoming increasingly important for protecting plant biodiversity. This research sought to determine if having conservation as part of the garden's mission promotes organizational practice's that conserve biodiversity. Surveys to public gardens in the United States and four case study site visits offered perceptions and opinions related to the contribution of organizational practices to biological diversity conservation. The three identified areas of organizational practices include: <b>saving</b> <b>biodiversity,</b> studying biodiversity and using biodiversity sustainably. <b>Saving</b> <b>biodiversity</b> is taking steps to protect genes, species, habitats, and ecosystems through preventing, managing and protecting the degradation of natural ecosystems. Organizational practices that contribute to <b>saving</b> <b>biodiversity</b> include: native plant collections, ex situ conservation, networking and partnerships. Studying biodiversity is undertaking and/or promoting scientific research programs, public understanding and awareness. Organizational practices that contribute to studying biodiversity include research, public programs, interpretation and display. Using biodiversity sustainably is utilizing organizational practices that maintaining biodiversity including horticultural practices and low impact resource use. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the relationship between a conservation mission statement and twenty-seven organizational practices investigated in this study, nineteen are found to have a significant correlation at the 0. 01 level. The nineteen organizational practices are: native plant collections, propagation, monitoring, plant exploration, seed bank, rescue station, regional partnerships, national partnerships, international partnerships, educational programs, public awareness, display, interpretation, research, invasive species control, recycling, land management, water management, and wildlife management. This means that when conservation is part of a garden's mission statement, those practices are likely to be part of the garden's conservation strategy...|$|E

An increase of 880 TWh of electricity consumption in transport in 2030 {{compared with the}} Reference Scenario, of which 90 % occurs in PLDVs, results in about 250 Mt of additional CO 2 emissions. The rise {{in the amount of}} CO 2 in the atmosphere is 1. 0 – 3. 50 C (1 PCC, 2007 a). If emissions of greenhouse gases, and in particular CO 2, continue unabated the enhanced greenhouse effect may alter the world’s climate system irreversibly. This review attempted to examine how climate change constitutes a threat to food security and environmental conservation. Climate change (CC) refers to changes in modern climate. It reflects abnormal variations to the expected climate within the earth’s atmosphere and subsequent effects on other parts of the earth. It is emphasized that CC poses a threat to food security as it impacts on natural systems and resources through erratic rainfall patterns, heightened temperature and susceptibility to pest and disease outbreaks hence decreasing crop yields and consequently increased hunger. CC negatively affects biodiversity conservation and management through exacerbated drought conditions, increased risk of wildfires leading to some extreme events like heat, waves, river and coastal flooding, landslides, storms, hurricanes and tornadoes which culminate in environmental degradation. For its effects to be reduced establishment of more forest plantations and maintenance of the existing natural and artificial forests should be encouraged. <b>Saving</b> <b>biodiversity</b> in the form of standing forests and interact lands can help prevent climate change and help communities and natural areas cope with a changing planet.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{scientific}} contribution towards evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} Community-based Conservation (CBC) in <b>saving</b> <b>biodiversity,</b> protecting ecosystem services and enhancing human well-being. The impact of CBC interventions carried out by Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust over 109 villages in five conservation areas in Madagascar (Lake Alaotra, Baly Bay National Park, Menabe dry forest, Manombo rain forest, and Nosivolo River) since 1997, were retrospectively evaluated. The evaluation used a quasi-experimental design to contrast changes {{in a set of}} biodiversity and human wellbeing indicators in the intervention villages with 109 control villages, which were matched for a range of social and environmental attributes. In Chapter 2, findings suggest that over the period 2000 - 2014 the CBC approach has impacted the incidence of fire, resulting in a lower rate of increase in fire frequency. Although CBC interventions were not able to reduce forest loss, the rate of deforestation in CBC villages has generally been maintained at lower levels than in control villages. Political disruption, population size and travel cost (access and distance) to the villages were identified as important contributing factors towards an increase in the severity of fires and deforestation while access to mobile phones may help mitigate the pressures. In Chapter 3, results indicate that support to education through CBC interventions is significantly associated with improvements in educational attainment. However, analysis of the historical Index of Health Status at village level did not show evidence that provision of clean drinking water or other health interventions improved public health. In terms of human well-being (Chapter 4), {{there is no evidence that}} CBC interventions have any positive impact on the Multidimensional Poverty Index. Since poverty has been identified as a key factor reducing happiness, mutual trust, and power to change local decision-making, the claim that CBC will be effective in enhancing subjective well-being cannot be supported by the evidence from this study. According to the Index of Perception of Valued Ecosystem Services the declines in forest cover between 2000 and 2013 were observed by local people, with people in CBC villages demonstrating a greater propensity to note resulting changes in the provision of ecosystem services. This result could be of value when designing future CBC interventions. Maximum Entropy modelling using a set of environmental GIS layers was performed in Chapter 5 for predicting geographic distribution zones of four globally threatened species living exclusively in the five study areas. Results suggested that over the period 2000 - 2014 there has been a decline in habitat suitability expressed by a decrease in probability of presence of the species. Vegetation cover is predicted to be the most important factor affecting the variability of species distribution range. Potential factors responsible for the success of some actions and failure, others within the CBC approach are discussed and pragmatic recommendations are given at the end of the thesis. For example, transforming local associations into social enterprise could possibly motivate poorer households to join CBC efforts and thereby improve social and biodiversity impacts in the future. </p...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 to over 100 million years {{communities}} {{evolved in the}} tropics which attained unprecedented levels of biodiversity, strikingly represented by evergreen lowland rain forests offering {{home to more than}} 50 % of all the world's extant species. Within only some 30 years human action reduced the area covered with tropical rain forests to about half of its former size, thereby negatively affecting local and global functions of the biosphere and exterminating an unknown number of species. With an exponentially increasing rate we are throwing away our and all future generations' biological heritage. We destroy the most complicated, scientifically most interesting living systems before we have gained any knowledge of their structures,and dynamics. To understand the particular structures and dynamics of tropical communities means in the first place to understand the causes and consequences of their ten- to more than hundredfold higher alphadiversity (as compared to temperate systems). This problem has a historical dimension and a functional side requiring answers as {{to the nature of the}} proximate mechanisms of its maintenance. My review is only concerned with the latter aspect, and its maIn emphasis is on the gaps in our knowledge. Two sets of hypotheses have been developed for explaining the high within-commUnIty diversity. (1) According to the classical concept interspecific niche competition and subsequent niche separation are the main forces determining the structure of the community. These so-called equilibrium models have been contrasted in recent times with (2) non-equilibrium models. These models do not attribute the decisive role to interspecific competition. Strong niche overlaps are presumed to be very common within species-rich communities. Continuous stochastic local disturbances are assumed to prevent the achievement of any long-term equilibrium (climax) state. Being on the right spot at the right time is regarded as most important. Whether oneor a combination of both models provide the best key for understanding the structure of a special section within a community will certainly depend on many properties of the species at debate (mobility, disr. ersal, fertility etc.). For the vast majority of tropical organisms all such information is at present unavailable. The principles governing the structure of communities is just one of the very,basic open problems. Another very prominent question is how the qualitatively very rich, however quantitatively poor resources are distributed among the members of highly diverse guilds of consumers and decomposers. Does the scarcity rather favour generalists or specialists, are small species overrepresented, are resources more extensively used than in temperate communities? One important property is fairly well established: Populations of most tropical species seem to be very small. Since a) in very many' cases distribution range is obviously very limited, since b) predator pressure is generally assumed to be higher in the tropics and c) recent - perhaps unduely generalized - results claim abundance fluctuations in the tropics fully comparable in their dimensions to those in the temperate zone, the question arises as to how these small populations can persist for seemingly long periods of time and avoid rapid extinction. Additionally treated PoInts concern detritivore communities, plant animal Interactions, key stone groups. <b>Saving</b> <b>biodiversity</b> in general and the tropical species and community richness in particular is one of the most urgent tasks of our generation, and biologists have to play a still more prominent role in this extremely important endeavor than they have in the past decades...|$|E
40|$|Plants can fulfil various functions. Plants provide {{places for}} playing, sports and recreation, {{establishing}} social contacts, isolation and escape from urban life, aesthetic enjoyment, viewing buildings {{from a distance}} and so on. Vegetation and plants on roofs and façades {{is one of the}} functions of plants most with respect to the built environment and horticulture. The presented report contains a general description of vertical greening systems (plants or vegetations against a façade) and their behaviour in relation to air quality improvement, aesthetics, energy <b>saving,</b> <b>biodiversity,</b> mitigation of the urban heat island effect and its social impact. Vegetation in relation to moisture transport and a life cycle analysis (LCA) for two living wall systems are particularly extensively explained. Vertical green or “green walls” is at the moment a popular item of sustainable development for a better environment related to dense urban areas. Vertical greening can be divided in three main branches, namely: - green façades; (traditional use of climbing plants against a façade from the ground or from planter boxes), are the easiest and cheapest manner to cover the vertical surfaces with vegetations. Green façades that are available until now can be classified in to two main categories, namely plants rooted into the ground and plants that are rooted in artificial substrate at grade with watering system. Green façades can be applied directly to the wall and also indirectly to the wall with a supporting structure such as net system or cable and wire net system. A large variety of plants can be used for making green façades. Especially Hedera plants (common ivy) are the most common ones. - wall vegetations; (spontaneous growing of plants on structures), are growing without any human intervention in a natural way with irregular patterns. This type of vegetation can be typically found on older buildings and monuments. Concrete panels with large pores variety are a new development to create green structures within {{a short period of time}} (1 - 2 years). These panels are also a type of façade which are suitable to plant vegetation on them. - living wall system (LWS); (pre-vegetated “prefabricated” modular panels or in situ applied panels), is a relative new application form of vertical green using modern technology. A watering system and nutrients distribution are always required and the modular panels are replaceable. There are various types of living wall systems which are already applied and applicable. Living walls are distinct from green façades in that they support vegetation that is rooted in substrate attached the wall itself, rather than being rooted at the base of the wall, and as a consequence have been likened more to vertical living systems. Living wall systems can be used either outdoor or indoor. A large verity of plants as herbs can be used on the living wall panels. A few examples of living wall systems that are described in this report are LWS based on planter boxes, LWS based on foam substrate, LWS based on mineral wool and LWS based on felt layers. Vertical greening systems have a range of advantages and disadvantages, which are summarized below. Advantages of vertical greening systems include: - filtering air particulates to improve air quality. - reducing (mitigate) the heat island effect (UHI). - providing sound insulation. - moderating a building's internal temperature via external shading. - creating a microclimate, which will help to alter the climate of a city as a whole. - providing biodiversity and a natural animal habitat. - protecting the wall against graffiti. - improving the insulation properties in summer and winter. Disadvantages of vertical greening systems include: - chance of damage on façade in case of green façade directly to the wall. - maintenance of vertical greening systems. - costs of vertical green systems, especially living wall systems. - irrigation systems. An experimental setup called ‘hotbox’ is made to test a number of vertical greening systems to determine the moisture transport through it. The hotbox is made of plywood (thickness 18 mm) and EPS-SE insulation material (thickness 200 mm). The hotbox has a dimension of (3000 mm x 1800 mm x 1800 mm) and has two compartments for indoor and outdoor climates. The principle of testing in the hotbox is to determine under steady state conditions (laboratory condition) moisture transport through a test specimen (bare wall) placed between a warm and a cold enclosed enclosure and to compare this with vertical greening systems hung on the wall under a variety of climate conditions (summer and winter). The test specimen used for the experiment consists of a wall with a surface of 1 m 2 (made in Dutch building system). The test specimen has a (inner leaf + insulation + air cavity + masonry). The measurements are performed with thermocouples and hygrometers through the complete system of a bare wall with greening systems on it. As it is mentioned the behaviour of different vertical greening systems according to building physics and sustainability aspects are also discussed in this report. A start was made to determine the black spots within the thermal behaviour aspects of vertical greening systems. In a number of experiments some vertical greening systems (Hedera helix directly to the wall, Hedera helix, indirectly to the wall, LWS planter boxes system, LWS foam based system, LWS mineral wool based system and LWS felt layers system) have been tested in a test setup called ‘hotbox’. The results of the performed tests show that the vertical greening systems which are calculated for determining of moisture transport (Hedera helix directly to the wall, Hedera helix indirectly to the wall and LWS based on planter boxes) have no negative influence with respect to moisture transport and condensation on the surface of the wall. It became clear that vertical greening systems on the façades in the winter cause condensation. The summer measurements show that with a normal relative humidity of about 75 % the condensation cannot take place in any layer of the structure. Condensation is occurred at all measured greening systems with freezing temperatures. According to Glaser method the condensation in all cases does not exceed the limitations. This means that the absorbed moisture by the structure in the winter (60 days) should evaporate back in the summer (90 days). There is not a vapour diffusion resistance figure (µ) for greening systems in the literature and therefore it is needed to assume a vapour diffusion resistance figure (µ) for vertical greening systems to calculate the condensation. For all condensation calculations a vapour diffusion resistance figure (µ) of 1. 5 is assumed for vertical greening systems, which corresponds with the regulations that (µ? 1). It is important to notice that the relative humidity outdoor and indoor, vertical greening system type, outdoor and indoor temperatures play a major role in determining of condensation and vapour diffusion. Living wall systems have a more or less airtight texture and they are protecting the façade better against direct sunshine and (heavy) rains. The materials used for living wall systems can ensure that the moisture transport does not take place easily. To realize vertical greened surfaces, it is necessary to take in to account that manufacturing of for example supporting structures can have a negative environmental effect, which is in struggle with sustainability. Sustainable construction could be described as a way of designing and constructing building that support human health (physical, psychological and social) and which is in harmony with nature, both animate and inanimate. A system is sustainable when the environmental burden is lower than the environmental benefit profile. The results from the conducted life cycle analysis for living wall system based on mineral wool and living wall system based on foam substrate provide insight in the environmental impact of the studied vertical greening systems. - the LWS based on mineral wool has one of the high environmental burdens due to the materials used. The aluminium supporting structure forms largely the effect since the materials affect positively the thermal resistance of the system. - the LWS based on foam substrate has also high influence on the total environmental burden, but the foam substrate (biodegrable) itself is a sustainable product. - for the living wall system based on mineral wool and living wall system based on foam substrate in both climate types (Mediterranean and temperate) the environmental burden profile is higher than the benefits gained for heating and cooling. - both LWS based on mineral wool and LWS based on foam substrate have almost the same contribution to the energy savings for heating but, for the Mediterranean climate, a higher influence was noted for the cooling properties of the plants which are to recognise for all 6 vertical greening system tested in hotbox.

40|$|Offsetting habitat {{destruction}} has widespread appeal {{as an instrument}} for balancing economic growth with biodiversity conservation. Requiring proponents to pay the nontrivial costs of habitat loss encourages sensitive planning approaches.

40|$|Restoration, {{through its}} {{potential}} to reduce {{the negative effects of}} habitat fragmentation, is becoming increasingly important in <b>saving</b> global <b>biodiversity.</b> However, evidence is increasing that passive faunal recolonization of restored areas may take centuries for some species, subsequently reducing, or negating, any restoration benefits for those species. Reptiles have been identified as typically the slowest vertebrate group to recolonize restored areas due to their low vagility and, often, specific thermal and microhabitat requirements, but relatively few studies have examined their recolonization of restored areas. We examined reptile recolonization patterns in pits restored after bauxite mining in eucalypt forests in south-western Australia to identify filters that slow, or prevent, reptile return and identify practices that reduce the effect of these filters. Three species, the skinks Cryptoblepharus buchananii and Egernia napoleonis and the gecko Christinus marmoratus were slow, or failed, to recolonize restored mine-pits. All rely on slow developing microhabitats (e. g. coarse woody debris and tree hollows) for shelter so the absence, or scarcity, of these microhabitats in restored forest is likely the unidirectional filter slowing their recolonization. Our work on E. napoleonis suggest that coarse woody debris densities need to be much higher (~ 50 logs ha- 1) than current restoration prescriptions (1 log pile ha- 1) to accelerate recolonization by that species. Another skink, Morethia obscura, was common in unmined forest and rapidly recolonized restored areas but disappeared as restored areas matured. Thinning and burning was an effective management strategy to facilitate recolonization by this species but its effects were short-term (< 7 years), indicating that overdense vegetation structure is a dynamic filter that influences recolonization by this species, probably due to thermal requirements. Our study shows active management of restored areas to facilitate and accelerate faunal recolonization is required for some species, to maximise biodiversity benefits from restoration. Provision of coarse woody debris and planting species at densities that will approximate the structure of reference communities are two strategies likely to facilitate faunal recolonization in many forested ecosystems. Techniques to accelerate the formation of slow-developing microhabitats are poorly developed and are an important area for future research...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe price {{volatility}} of fossil resources, {{the uncertainty of}} their long-term availability and the environmental, climatic and societal problems posed by their operation, lead to the imperative of an energy transition enabling the development and utilization of other alternative and sustainable resources. Acknowledging that indirect land-use change can increase greenhouse gas emission, the European Union (EU) has reshaped its biofuel policy. It has set criteria for sustainability {{to ensure that the}} use of biofuels guarantees real carbon <b>savings</b> and protects <b>biodiversity.</b> From a sustainability perspective, biofuels and bioliquids offer indeed both advantages (e. g., more secure energy supply, emission reductions, reduced air pollution and production of high added-value molecules) as well as risks (monocultures, reduced biodiversity and even higher emissions through land use change). Approaching economic, environmental and social sustainability at the local level and in an integrated way should help to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

Acknowledging that indirect land-use change can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions savings, the EU has reshaped its biofuel policy. It has a set of sustainability criteria to ensure that the use of biofuels guarantees real carbon <b>savings</b> and protects <b>biodiversity.</b> From a sustainability perspective, biofuels and bioliquids offer indeed both advantages (more secure energy supply, emissions reductions, reduced air pollution, production of high added-value molecules) and risks (monocultures, reduced biodiversity, and even higher emissions through land use change). Approaching economic, environmental and social sustainability at the local level and in an integrated way helps to maximize benefits and minimize risks. This approach has been adopted to assess the relevance of bio-refineries supplied from lignocellulosic biomass and implementing emerging technologies such as pyrolysis process in an olive-growing area (Sierra Mágina). Sierra Mágina is vulnerable to climate change because of its high level of specialization in olive growing and the burning in loco of pruning waste (several dozen of kilos per tree) contributes to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Therefore this territory has been selected for the OLIZERO project. The OLIZERO bio-refinery concept is part of an interdisciplinary thinking which aims to optimize the use of biomass available in a specific territory by analyzing local and integrated production of finished and/or intermediate products and higher added-value molecules (from solvents to aroma, flavors and products of medical interest). The final objective is to develop innovative methods for recovering chemicals from the most difficult valuable fractions (lignocellulosic fractions). The project is then about a study of the feasibility of a bio-refinery coupled to existing olive mills. We initially identified and mapped the resource available in a Spanish territory located in Sierra Mágina, Andalucía. We have in a second step associated a Py-GCMS analysis from a sampling of several available olive tree cuttings in this territory. This preliminary study will provide a picture of what kind of chemicals can be obtained from a pyrolysis process. The second on-going step is to perform lab scale pyrolysis experiments with the selected resources. The coupling of the territorial study and physicochemical analysis will optimize the annual output of high-value molecules and associated biochar (fertilizer). It is then necessary to define the geographic data (workflow, localization, mapping etc.) to plan the availability of the biomass according to harvest periods and secondly physicochemical characteristics to assess the nature of bio-molecules that will be extracted (volumes and material flow).

40|$|Upstream India and {{downstream}} Bangladesh share {{more than}} 50 international rivers. India {{has set up}} water diversion constructions in more than 50 % of these rivers, the largest one being on the Bangladeshâs northwest upon the Ganges River, puts Bangladeshâs Gangetic ecosystem at stake. In some border rivers, India has set up groins on her side of river banks. Also, Indian side pumps Bangladesh river water stealthily from border-rivers. Further, India is constructing another dam and reservoir upstream on the Barak River on the northeast of Bangladesh. Furthermore, India has chalked out a grand plan for river networking. Exploration {{has been made to}} assess the degree of the ecosystem degradation both inland and on the coast due to all water diversion constructions around the border, except for the Tipaimukh Dam in which case estimation of projected ecosystem degradation has been mentioned. Finally, Indian grand plan of river networking plan has been briefly touched upon. Site visitations, observations, surveys, measurements and interviews of professionals were made in the project country. Relevant literatures on this issue were reviewed in electronic and print databases. Related published articles in electronic and print media were systematically searched following the key words for the case. Finally, both electronic and print news media have been closely followed to know the latest developments on this issue. The reduced flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh has caused scarcity of fresh water, species endangerment and extinction, obstruction to livestock raising, loss of livelihoods, peopleâs displacement, changes in crop production, reduction in navigable routes, extreme weather, increased flood occurrences, scarcity of potable water, groundwater contamination, reduction in coastal sediment deposition, deterioration of the Ganges water quality and inland intrusion of saline water front. Water diversion constructions in other rivers have caused similar type of ecological problems. The construction of groins on the Indian side of the border rivers has caused bank erosion on the Bangladesh side which changes her map. India benefits herself by occupying the resulting shoal formation within the Bangladesh side of the riverbeds. The Tipaimukh Dam on the Barak River will affect the virgin haor ecosystem {{the same way as the}} Ganges basin over a certain time scale. Indiaâs river networking plan is going to create a widespread ecocide in the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin. Water, if not the most, is one of the most important components in an ecosystem. Living being cannot survive without it. Ecocide occurs in its absence. Obstruction to the downstream natural flow of rivers by the upstream country unilateral actions is tantamount to violations of human rights which is a crime. With the dilapidated ecosystem, Bangladeshâs national security is at stake. Bangladeshâs internal immunity is not strong enough to face the threats of climate change events. Bangladesh government should take a tough stand for the countryâs interests. Since she has failed to save her interests on a bilateral basis with India, she should take immediate steps for fair share of the pirated river water under the UN supervision. Also, she should approach the UN for getting back the river shoals captured by India. Bangladesh should have a master plan of dredging rivers and canals for water storage and inland distribution to the depleted surface water bodies to reestablish the wetland ecosystem. This will help, to some extent, in the gradual mitigation of all the problems including groundwater arsenic contamination, fish scarcity, erratic climate. It is due for Bangladesh to charge the upstream country for the dredging cost of the rivers and canals since upstream countryâs water piracy has regionally silted her rivers and canals. Since the <b>saving</b> of the <b>biodiversity</b> is an international slogan of the time, Bangladesh should ask the UN to enforce strict international laws to stop any means of upstream water piracy including new constructions of dams, barrages, reservoirs, link canals upon international rivers to save the downstream biodiversity. Sanctions should be put in place for the violators of the law. Bangladeshâs approach to international court may be an option, too...|$|R

This approach has been adopted to assess the relevance of bio-refineries supplied from lignocellulosic biomass and implementing emerging technologies such as pyrolysis process in an olive-growing area (Sierra Mágina). Sierra Mágina is vulnerable to climate change because of its high level of specialization in olive growing and the burning in loco of pruning waste (several kilos per tree) contributes to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Therefore this territory has been selected for the OLIZERO project. The OLIZERO bio-refinery concept is part of an interdisciplinary thinking which aims to optimize the use of biomass available in a specific territory by analyzing local and integrated production of finished and/or intermediate products and higher added-value molecules (from solvents to aroma, flavors and products of medical interest). The final objective is to develop innovative methods for recovering chemicals from the most difficult valuable fractions (lignocellulosic fractions).

ResultsIn this work, social acceptance of such biorefinery project has been evaluated. This evaluation relied on a field survey, with qualitative inquiries, questionnaires and engaging workshops (Benyei, 2015, unpublished). The burning of pruning waste is currently being partly replaced by chipping and composting chips on the soils, a practice with less emission of GHG, but which generates a potential risk of pest contamination, mostly unknown by farmers. Along with this transition, local stakeholders showed their interest for OLIZERO project, but made suggestions that the team took into consideration within a multi-actor approach. The first suggestion was to fully integrate the carbon balance of the innovation (for example the cost of the transport of the pruning waste), the second concern was the economic viability of the innovation, and the possible return for the farmers (who invested in machines and energy for pruning waste chipping). Moreover, according to farmers, chipping pruning waste and composting on the ground bring benefits for the soil, avoiding erosion and fertilizing it. For this reason, we introduced the return of biochar to compensate the “loss” of the compost due to the project (chips will be used in the pre-fungal and pyrolysis process). Geographic analysis showed that the valorization of pruning wastes {{will have to deal with}} strong spatial heterogeneities, the quantity of biennal pruning waste varying from 1 to 5, according to the location and age of olive-groves. This evaluation relies on a crossed analysis between field data (pruning waste weight in olive trees of different tree crow sizes) and remote sensing analysis of the olive tree cover all over the Sierra Mágina region Bourrand et al. (2015, unpublished). Further, a crossed analysis between farmers’ field survey and geographical data showed that the choice of waste management depends on the distance to the road: above the threshold of 250 meters between a viable road and the grove, farmers continue burning the pruning residue. The road system and the slope will be major issues for spatial optimization of the wastes collection. Basic data still need to be improved to perform such spatial modelling. Analysis of Endophytic fungi present in pruning residues showed that the major species belonged to the genus Alternaria, a group that is known to contain many strains pathogenic to olive trees. Leaving the pruning materials unattended may therefore facilitate the emergence of opportunistic strains able to infect weakened trees, a condition that may become prominent due to climatic change. Pruning residues should therefore be disposed of in a way that would limit fungal growth. We proposed that in replacement to burning, pyrolysis will be able to dispose in a safe way of pruning residues, in addition to produce high-value-biomolecules and fertilizer. Py-GCMS analysis results are presented. The results show recurrent molecules with high intensity peaks. Target molecules for the construction of a bio-refinery are proposed. Ongoing tests at lab scale should clarify if they can effectively be recovered in sufficient amount. From an European perspective, the OLIZERO project helps to understand the added-value and the shortcomings of the different EU instruments ranging from the financial means provided by the Cohesion policy to the standards set by the legal framework related to renewable energies, air pollution and agricultural policies. Focusing on a specific area, OLIZERO offers an insight on how the EU framework affects governance schemes, rural development practices and business models that are instrumental for the surge of innovative biofuels and bioliquids. ConclusionsThe collaboration between social, biological and chemical engineering sciences brought many advantages: first, we chose a territory with a social demand to improve the waste management, along with a capacity of innovation. This encourages us to improve the agronomical and economic benefits of the proposed innovation. Secondly, the analysis of Endophytic fungi showed the potential risks of the changing practices along with the potential benefit of our innovation. Finally, further investigations are needed to address the technical challenges in the production processes and in the design of appropriate separation technologies. However, knowing that potential molecules of interest could be recovered is encouraging for the future developments of OLIZERO.
