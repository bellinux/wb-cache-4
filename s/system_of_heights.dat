50|$|Gen. Sherman's Special Field Order No. 67, section 3, {{ordered the}} chief engineer, Capt. Orlando M. Poe to {{construct}} new defensive works around Atlanta. Capt. Poe first evaluated the existing Confederate fortifications. Finding them too extensive {{for the number}} of troops planned to garrison Atlanta, Capt. Poe designed a new set of fortifications. The new line was less than three miles in length along a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>heights</b> nearer the center of town. This new line passed through the northern part of town rendering the destruction of a great many buildings necessary. Gen. Sherman approved of the plan but instructed Capt.

40|$|One goal {{of modern}} geodesy is the global {{unification}} of vertical datums so that height data from {{them can be}} properly integrated. This thesis studies the unification of the 13 disparate levelling- and tide-gauge-based vertical datums in New Zealand (NZ). It proposes a new NZ-wide single vertical datum based on a gravimetric quasigeoid model to unify the existing local vertical datums. This will also include methods to transform height data {{in terms of the}} existing datums to the new datum and vice versa. After defining and comparing the main types of height system and vertical datum used around to world, the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>heights</b> used in NZ was shown to be normal-orthometric. Consequently, datum unification was achieved using a quasigeoid model, as opposed to a geoid model. The quasigeoid was computed by combining the GRACE-based GGM 02 and EGM 96 global geopotential models with land gravity data (40, 737 observations) and a 56 -m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Marine gravity data came from a least-squares collocation combination of 1, 300, 266 crossover-adjusted ship track observations and gravity anomalies derived from multi-mission satellite altimetry. To ensure that the best quasigeoid was computed for the NZ datasets, a number of computation processes were compared and contrasted. The Hammer chart, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and prism integration methods of computing terrain corrections (TCs) were compared. This showed that the prism integration TC is the most realistic in NZ. The mean Helmert gravity anomalies, required for numerical integration of Stokes’s formula, were computed via refined Bouguer anomalies with the prism TCs, and reconstruction with heights from the DEM used to ‘reconstruct’ more representative mean anomalies. In addition, five deterministic modifications to Stokes’s formula were compared. There was little difference between three of them, so the Featherstone et al. (1998) modification (0 y = 1. 5 °, M = 40) was chosen because it is theoretically better than its predecessors. The global geopotential, gravimetric geoid, sea surface topography and geodetic boundary-value problem approaches to vertical datum unification were then contrasted. As none was likely to be effective in NZ, a new iterative quasigeoid approach was adopted. This procedure computes an initial quasigeoid from existing data on the various local vertical datums to estimate the vertical datum offsets from co-located GPS-levelling data. These offsets were then subsequently applied to the gravity observations by way of additional reductions to the initially computed quasigeoid to reduce gravity anomaly biases caused by the vertically offset datums. These adjusted gravity anomalies were then used to compute a new quasigeoid model, and the process repeated until the computed offsets between the local vertical datums (or equivalently two quasigeoid solutions) converged, which took only two iterations. The computed offsets were then compared with spirit-levelled height differences among adjoining datums, where these were available, giving an average agreement of 7 cm. Since the local vertical datums are effectively unified, the new national vertical datum for NZ will comprise the iteratively computed gravimetric quasigeoid model, accompanied by local vertical datums. This approach is implemented to give a new national vertical datum for NZ. When used with the appropriate offset, this enables the transformation of heights in terms of the national vertical datum to the 13 precise-levelling datums and the ellipsoidal national geodetic datum, NZ Geodetic Datum 2000...|$|E

40|$|A narrow {{system is}} a {{combinatorial}} object introduced by Magidor and Shelah in connection with work on the tree property at successors of singular cardinals. In analogy to the tree property, a cardinal κ satisfies the narrow system property if every narrow <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>height</b> κ has a cofinal branch. In this paper, we study connections between the narrow system property, square principles, and forcing axioms. We prove, assuming large cardinals, both that it is consistent that ℵ_ω+ 1 satisfies the narrow system property and _ℵ_ω, < ℵ_ω holds {{and that it is}} consistent that every regular cardinal satisfies the narrow system property. We introduce natural strengthenings of classical square principles and show how they can be used to produce narrow systems with no cofinal branch. Finally, we show that the Proper Forcing Axiom implies that every narrow <b>system</b> <b>of</b> countable width has a cofinal branch but is consistent with the existence <b>of</b> a narrow <b>system</b> <b>of</b> width ω_ 1 with no cofinal branch.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{numerical}} model {{for use in}} a finite analysis (FEA) <b>of</b> scaffold-shoring <b>systems.</b> The structural model consists of a single set of multiple-story scaffolds with constraints in the out-of-plane direction at every connection joint between stories. Although this model has only two dimensions (termed the 2 -D model), it is derived from the analysis of a complete scaffold-shoring system and represents the structural behavior of a complete three-dimensional <b>system.</b> Experimental testing <b>of</b> scaffolds up to three stories in height conducted in the laboratory, along with an outdoor test of a five-story scaffold system, were used to validate the 2 -D model. Both failure modes and critical loads were compared. In the comparison of failure modes, the computational results agree very well with the test results. However, in the comparison of critical loads, computational results were consistently somewhat greater than test results. The decreasing trends of critical loads with number of stories in both the test and simulation results were similar. After investigations to explain the differences between the computationally and experimentally determined critical loads, it was recommended that the 2 -D model be used as the numerical model in subsequent analysis. In addition, the computational critical loads were calibrated and revised in accordance with the experimental critical loads, and the revised critical loads were then used as load-carrying capacities for scaffold-shoring systems for any number of stories. Finally, a simple procedure is suggested for determining load-carrying capacities <b>of</b> scaffold-shoring <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>heights</b> other than those considered in this study...|$|R
