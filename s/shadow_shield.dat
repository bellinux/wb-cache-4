40|$|The Electro-Physics Branch of the NASA Glenn Research Center {{investigates the}} effect of atomic oxygen, {{environmental}} durability of high performance power materials and surfaces, and low earth orbit. One of its current projects involves the analysis of ion thrusters. Ion thrusters are devices that initiate a beam of ions to a target area. The type of ion thruster that I {{have been working with}} this Summer of 2004 emits positively charged Xenon (Xe(+)) atoms through two grids, the screen grid and the accelerator grid, after it enters an ionization chamber. Insulators are used to mechanically hold and separate these two grids. A propellant isolator, an instrument that closely resembles insulators, is placed in front of the ionization chamber. Both the insulator and isolator are made with a ceramic compound and filled with insulating beads. The main difference between the two devices is that the propellant isolator allows gas to flow through, in this case, the gas is Xe(+) and the insulators do not. In order to avoid carbon deposits and other contaminating chemicals to settle on the insulators and propellant isolator, a metal <b>shadow</b> <b>shield</b> is placed around them. These shadow shields function as a protectant and can be shaped in numerous configurations. Part of my job responsibility this summer is to investigate the effectiveness of different shadow shields that are utilized on three different ion engines: the NSTAR (NASA Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Application Readiness), JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), and NEXIS (Nuclear Electric Xenon Ion System). Using calculus and other mathematical tactics, I was asked to find the total flux of carbon contamination that was able to pass the protectant <b>shadow</b> <b>shield.</b> I familiarized myself with the software program, MathCad 2004, to help perform some mathematical computations such as complex integration.

40|$|ANSTOâ€™s Instrument Calibration Facility (ICF) {{provides}} {{calibration services}} to radiation monitors, used in radiation protection applications. The facility {{has a large}} calibration room that accommodates the neutron source rig and the monitor table, which is remotely controlled. The room also hosts the gamma calibration services. Determination of the free field (direct) and scattered components of neutron field in a calibration room was essential to obtain an accurate response of the neutron monitor under testing. The free field fluence response and the fractional room return scatter, caused by the interaction of neutron fluence with the room structure, were determined. The fluence response was 1. 210 x 10 - 4 Î¼Sv/h per n/m 2; and the neutron field has a fractional room scatter of 0. 044 at 1 m and increases linearly versus square of distance. The standard calibration methods, described by ISO- 10647, IAEA-TR 285, NCRP- 112 and NPL-RS(EXT) 5, were utilized in this characterisation and gave comparable results. The shadow-shield (truncated cone) were found more suitable to describe the neutron field compared with the other methods e. g. the polynomial fitting, semi-empirical {{due to the fact}} of the size, shape of the ICF room and source/monitor positions. Nevertheless; all methods resulted in good response curves with correlation coefficients of fitting greater than 0. 97. The <b>shadow</b> <b>shield</b> consisted of two stacked conical sections. The first section was made from iron of 200 mm height and the second section was a hollow and made from aluminium of 350 mm height. The hollow section was then filled with neutron-moderating/absorbing materials i. e. water solution of LiBr 24 % w/w. A performance test was conducted on the shield and gave a very satisfactory result e. g. the readings of fluence response to the free field neutron did follow the inverse square law with correlation >= 0. 999. It is worth noticing that at the completion of this characterisation and report, the calibration results with the Physikalische-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany became available. As a result, the neutron characterisation at ICF calibration room did agree with the BTP calibration within five percent. Consequently, the neutron field in ICF rig calibration room is now traceable to BTP standard laboratory in Germany. Also, this agreement confirms the integrity of the current neutron source e. g. anisotropy stability, which should save substantial cost and efforts in replacing the source or sending it overseas for re-certification...|$|E
40|$|Shadow {{shielding}} is a {{novel and}} practical concept for waste heat rejection from lunar surface spacecraft systems. A <b>shadow</b> <b>shield</b> is a light shield that shades the radiator from parasitic thermal radiation emanating from the sun or lunar surface. Radiator size and mass can reduce if the radiator {{is not required to}} account for parasitic heat loads in addition to system energy rejection requirements. The lunar thermal environment can be very harsh towards radiative heat rejection. Parasitic heat loads force the radiator to expand in size and mass to compensate. On the Moon, there are three types: surface infrared, solar insulation, and albedo. This thesis tests shadow shielding geometry and its effect on the radiator and nuclear reactor in a reactor-powered Carnot heat engine. Due to the nature of cooling by radiative heat transfer, the maximum shaft work a Carnot system can produce and the minimal required radiator area occurs when the Carnot efficiency is 25 %. First, a case for shadow shielding is made using an isothermal, control radiator model in Thermal Desktop. Six radiator temperatures and three latitudes are considered in the tests. Test variables in this section include radiator shapes and shade geometry. The simulations found that shadow shielding is best suited for a low-temperature radiator at the lunar equator. Optimized parabolic shade geometry includes a focus right above or {{at the top of the}} radiator and full to three-quarters shade height. The most useful rectangular radiator shape for shadow shielding is that which has a low height and long width. All simulations were conducted using a shade with a 10 kg/m 2 area mass. A sensitivity study was conducted for different shade area masses using high and low values found in the literature. The shade is the most useful when the shade's area mass is less than or equal to that of the radiator. If the shade mass is below this threshold, the shade would be applicable to all radiator temperatures tested. Optimized shade and radiator geometry results were then factored into a second model where the radiator is comprised of heat pipes which is similar to radiators from actual system designs. Further simulations were conducted implementing the SAFE- 4001 fast fission nuclear reactor design. The study found that shadow shielding allowed the system to use a low-temperature radiator where other configurations were not viable because shadow shielding drastically improves radiative heat transfer from the radiator, but at the consequence of raising radiator mass...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} 22. 033 / 22. 33 Nuclear Systems Design project, {{this group}} {{designed}} a 100 kW[subscript e] Martian/Lunar surface reactor system to work for 5 EFPY in support of extraterrestrial human exploration efforts. The reactor design was optimized over the following criteria: small mass and size, controllability, launchability/accident safety, and high reliability. The Martian Surface Reactor was comprised of four main systems: the core, power conversion system, radiator and shielding. The core produces 1. 2 MW[subscript th] and operates in a fast spectrum. Li heat pipes cool the core and couple to the power conversion system. The heat pipes compliment the chosen pintype fuel geometry arranged in a tri-cusp configuration. The reactor fuel is UN (33. 1 w/o enriched), the cladding and structural materials in core are Re, and a Hf vessel encases the core. The reflector is Zr[subscript 3]Si[subscript 2], chosen for its high albedo. Control is achieved by rotating drums, using a TaB[subscript 2] shutter material. Under {{a wide range of}} postulated accident scenarios, this core remains sub-critical and poses minimal environmental hazards. The power conversion system consists of three parts: a power conversion unit, a transmission system and a heat exchanger. The power conversion unit is a series of cesium thermionic cells, each one wrapped around a core heat pipe. The thermionic emitter is Re at 1800 K, and the collector is molybdenum at 950 K. These units, operating at 10 [superscript +]% efficiency, produce 125 kW[subscript e] DC and transmit 100 kW[subscript e] AC. The power transmission system includes 25 separate DC-to-AC converters, transformers to step up the transmission voltage, and 25 km of 22 gauge copper wire for actual electricity transmission. The remaining 900 kWth then gets transmitted to the heat pipes of the radiator via an annular heat pipe heat exchanger that fits over the thermionics. This power conversion system was designed with much redundancy and high safety margins; the highest percent power loss due to a single point failure is 4 %. The radiator is a series of potassium heat pipes with carbon-carbon fins attached. For each core heat pipe there is one radiator heat pipe. The series of heat pipe/fin combinations form a conical shell around the reactor. There is only a 10 degree temperature drop between the heat exchanger and radiator surface, making the radiating temperature 940 K. In the radiator, the maximum cooling loss due to a single point failure is less than 1 %. The shielding system is a bi-layer <b>shadow</b> <b>shield</b> that covers an 80 Âº arc of the core. The inner layer of the shield is a boron carbide neutron shield; the outer layer is a tungsten gamma shield. The tungsten shield is coated with SiC to prevent oxidation in the Martian atmosphere. At a distance of 11 meters from the reactor, on the shielded side, the radiation dose falls to an acceptable 2 mrem/hr; on the unshielded side, an exclusion zone extends to 14 m from the core. The shield is movable to protect crew no matter the initial orientation of the core. When combined together, the four systems comprise the MSR. The system is roughly conical, 4. 8 m in diameter and 3 m tall. The total mass of the reactor is 6. 5 MT...|$|E

It was found that in the zone of the <b>shadow</b> region dominates, <b>shielding</b> is relatively insensitive to variations of such parameters as Mach Number and spacing ratio, but in the zone in which diffraction dominates; shielding is more sensitive to variations in Mach Number, jet temperature and spacing ratio...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{engineering}} difficulties, {{the requirement that}} ALSEP operate successfully even when thermal-control surfaces are 100 percent "dust " covered is reviewed. Recent evidence indicates that lunar dust is less cohesive, thus less of a potential problem, than originally believed. Since uncertainties still exist, however, only a partial relaxation of the specification is recorn-mended and only for "hardship " cases. The recommendation is that, first, vertical and then other non-horizontal surfaces be consi-dered dust free. Horizontal surfaces should retain a 100 percent dust cover specification. Operational methods of reducing the problem are conceived. They include: supplying the astronauts pith a "dust-cloth, ing ALSEP in an area which has been s deploy-descent plume and/or which is away fr & the ascent plume impinge-x 5 t clean of dust by the ment area, and utilizing lunar topogr&phic <b>shadowing</b> to <b>shield</b> ALSEP against the LM ascent engine blast...|$|R
30|$|As it was {{outlined}} in Section 1, detection, localization and tracking {{of human beings}} by UWB sensors in emergency situations have attracted researchers and industry during the last decade. Experiments with handheld UWB sensors usually equipped with one transmitting and two receiving antennas {{have shown that the}} proposed solutions are capable of providing quite good localization and tracking of a single person. However, in so-called multiple moving person scenarios, the obtained results are not as good as in the single person scenarios. This finding can be explained as the impact of mutual <b>shielding</b> (<b>shadowing)</b> of persons located in the monitored area.|$|R

Balloon results were obtained on July 29, 1987 during the ARGO 87 experiment. A ray tracing program was develped to study the primary mirror enlightment, taking into account reflections and <b>shadowing</b> by the <b>shield.</b> It is suggested that a careful shield design is necessary for day-time operation, and that the line of sight must be kept at distances larger than 90 deg from the sun. Furthermore, night-time operation may be feasible at the level required by cosmic-background-radiation anisotropy measurements using a simple shield configuration...|$|R
40|$|Low thrust trajectories {{utilizing}} {{electric propulsion}} and photovoltaic power sources are derived {{for the transfer}} of a large spacecraft from assembly in low earth orbit to operation at geosynchronous orbit. Conventional silicon photovoltaic devices are assumed. A 1 MeV equivalent electron flux model is used. The solar panel mass and size are taken from Advanced Photovoltaic Solar Array design concepts with 3 -mil <b>shielding.</b> <b>Shadowing</b> of the vehicle and low earth orbit atmospheric drag are also modeled. The power system is sized so that end of life output is 30 percent of initial output. Steering of the thrust vector is defined by a three term series in which the coefficients are varied as controls to minimize the total power loss with cumulative exposure in the Van Allen region...|$|R
40|$|Background Gonad {{shielding}} {{is one of}} {{the fundamental}} methods by which to protect reproductive organs in patients undergoing conventional radiological examinations. A lack of or inadequate shielding of the gonads may increase the exposure of these organs and result in malignancies future generations. Objectives The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the prevalence of gonad shielding in patients undergoing conventional radiological examinations and the availability of gonad shields and gonad shielding protocols in radiology departments. Materials and Methods A retrospective, observational cross-sectional study on the application of gonad shielding, the availability of gonad shields and the existence of gonad shielding protocols in radiology departments was performed in five different hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran. Results The highest application of gonad shielding was 6. 6 % for the pediatric hospital. The prevalence of gonad shielding was less than 0. 2 %. In 64. 3 % of the radiography rooms, at least one flat-contact gonad shield of a large size was available. Only large-sized gonad shields were available. Curved-contact and <b>shadow</b> gonad <b>shields</b> did not exist. Gonad shielding protocols were not existence in any of the fourteen radiography rooms investigated. Conclusions Comprehensive protection programs with on-the-job training courses for staff members are strongly recommended, as well as, the provision of radiological shields and gonad shielding protocols in radiology departments to reduce the patientâ€™s radiation dose during radiological examinations...|$|R
