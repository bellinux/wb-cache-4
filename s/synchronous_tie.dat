40|$|The Bighorn Basin {{of northwestern}} Wyoming {{preserves}} {{one of the}} most complete records of middle Paleocene to lower Eocene continental biota. The geochronology of this important interval depends partly on numerical calibration of the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS), but the middle and late Paleocene parts of the GPTS have been poorly constrained radioisotopically. A new volcanic ash from the northern Bighorn Basin provides the first radioisotopic age for upper middle Paleocene strata (upper Selandian) and is an important calibration point for the base of polarity Chron C 26 n and the Selandian-Thanetian stage boundary in the GPTS. Sanidine from the ash has a weighted mean age of 59. 00 ± 0. 30 (2 σ) Ma, based on twenty-three 40 Ar/ 39 Ar bulk laser-fusion analyses. The ash corroborates the revised age estimate for the base of Chron C 26 n in the most recent geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS- 04) and confirms that C 26 n is older than depicted in the 1995 GPTS. We place Paleocene mammalian biozones in the Bighorn Basin into a refined geochronologic framework. These biozones are the primary basis for biostratigraphic correlation of middle and upper Paleocene continental deposits in North America. New paleomagnetic data provide <b>synchronous</b> <b>tie</b> points for correlation among three stratigraphic sections in the northern Bighorn Basin and to the GPTS. Paleomagnetic correlation, study of new fossil material, review of known faunas, and refined stratigraphy enable us to reevaluate several biozones. We define three new zones based on first occurrences of taxa: the Phenacolemur (Ti- 4 b), Probathyopsis (Ti- 5 a, revised), and Copecion (Cf- 3, revised) zones. The Phenacolemur zone includes some faunas previously placed in the Plesiadapis churchilli and Plesiadapis fodinatus zones (Ti- 4 and Ti- 5 a, respectively). The Probathyopsis zone replaces the P. fodinatus zone and the Copecion zone replaces the Phenacodus-Ectocion acme zone (Cf- 3). Seven of the biozones considered here are subdivisions of the Tiffanian land mammal age. The Tiffanian was originally typified by the Mason Pocket fauna in southwestern Colorado, but it is now much better known from faunas in the northern Bighorn Basin. Biostratigraphic evidence and new paleomagnetic data from the Bighorn Basin indicate that Mason Pocket is considerably older than was previously recognized and occurs in Chron C 26 r, rather than C 25 r. The geochronologic framework presented here helps to constrain the temporal ranges of species that occur in the middle and late Tiffanian, and it allows the Bighorn Basin record to be better compared to other faunal, floral, and paleoclimate records, both regionally and globally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Large {{fans and}} {{terraces}} are frequent in the Khumbu Himal within the high Himalayan valleys south of Mt. Everest. These features {{are composed of}} massive matrix- and clast-supported diamicts that were formed from both hyperconcentrated flows and coarse-grained debris flows. Cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) exposure ages for boulders on fans and terraces indicate that periods of fan and terrace formation occurred at c. 16, c. 12, c. 8, c. 4 and c. 1. 5 ka, and are broadly coincident with the timing of glaciation in the region. The dating precision is insufficient to resolve whether the surfaces formed before, during or after the correlated glacial advance. However, the sedimentology, and morphostratigraphic and geomorphological relationships suggest that fan and terrace sedimentation {{in this part of}} the Himalaya primarily occurs during glacier retreat and is thus paraglacial in origin. Furthermore, modern glacial-lake outburst floods and their associated deposits are common in the Khumbu Himal as the result of glacial retreat during historical times. We therefore suggest that Late Quaternary and Holocene fan and terrace formation and sediment transfer are probably linked to temporal changes in discharge and sediment load caused by glacier oscillations responding to climate change. The timing of major sedimentation events in this region can be correlated with fans and terraces in other parts of the Himalaya, suggesting that major sedimentation throughout the Himalaya is <b>synchronous</b> and <b>tied</b> to regional climatic oscillations. Bedrock incision rates calculated from strath terrace ages average c...|$|R
