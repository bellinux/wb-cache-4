This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) are a common feature of intermediate-age <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Magellanic Clouds. The eMSTOs are also found in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of young-age <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b> The origin of the eMSTOs is still an open question. Moreover, asteroseismology shows that the value of the overshooting parameter δ_ ov of the convective core is not fixed for the stars with an approximatelly equal mass. Thus the MSTO of <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> may be affected by the overshooting of the convective core (OVCC). We calculated the effects of the OVCC with different δ_ ov on the MSTO of young- and intermediate-age <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b> If δ_ ov varies between <b>stars</b> in a <b>cluster,</b> the observed eMSTOs of young- and intermediate-age <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> can be explained well by the effects. The equivalent age spreads of MSTO caused by the OVCC are related to the age of <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> and are in good agreement with observed results of many clusters. Moreover, the observed eMSTOs of NGC 1856 are reproduced by the coeval populations with different δ_ ov. The eMSTOs of <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> may be relevant to the effects of the OVCC. The effects of the OVCC are similar to that of rotation in some respects. But the effects cannot result in a significant split of main sequence of young <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> at m_U≲ 21.

5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} debate {{as to the}} star's actual distance from Earth. The debate revolves around the different methodologies to measure distanceparallax being the most central, but photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding valuable insights as well. Before the Hipparcos mission, the estimated distance for the Pleiades <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> was around 135 parsecs or 440 light years. However, when the Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997, the new parallax measurement indicated a much closer distance of about 119 ± 1.0 pc (388 ± 3.2 ly), triggering substantial controversy among astronomers. If the Hipparcos estimate were accurate, some astronomers contend, then stars in the cluster {{would have to be}} fainter than Sun-like starsa notion that would challenge some of the fundamental precepts of stellar structure. Interferometric measurements taken in 2004 by the Hubble Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors and corroborated by studies from Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory showed the original estimate of 135 pc or 440 ly to be the correct figure. However a recent study published in 2009 has argued otherwise, publishing a new parallax measurement of 8.32 mas with a very tight error factor of 0.13 mas yielding a distance of 120.2 ± 1.9 pc or 392.0 ± 6.0 ly. Which distance estimate future astrometric calculations will corroborate remains to be seen, although the upcoming Gaia mission with its expected launch in late 2012 could well prove to be the ultimate arbiter in this debate.|$|E
