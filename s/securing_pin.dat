50|$|Japanese plane (kanna 鉋), is most {{commonly}} a wooden block, or dai (台) containing a laminated blade, sub-blade, and <b>securing</b> <b>pin.</b> This {{is similar in}} respects to the archaic type of European wooden plane, in which the blade is fixed in place by tapping down upon a wooden wedge. In the Japanese plane, the blade is fixed in position primarily by {{the confines of the}} plane's throat opening. Unlike a western plane, the support bed for the blade is not a flat surface in a Japanese plane - rather it is convex. The blade itself is tapered both in thickness and in width so as to wedge tightly into the dai when tapped down into place. Japanese planes are operated by pulling rather than pushing, and much work is done in the seated position or alongside a planing beam.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after {{clearing}} {{the mouth of}} Loch Ryan, the ship turned west towards Larne and exposed her stern to {{the worst of the}} high seas. Huge waves damaged the low stern doors, allowing water to enter the car deck. The crew struggled to close the doors again but they proved to be too badly damaged and water continued to flood in from the waves. The scuppers {{did not seem to be}} allowing the water to drain away. The ship took a list to starboard and at this point Captain Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Loch Ryan by going astern and using the bow rudder. This proved to be impossible, because the extreme conditions prevented the deckhands from releasing the <b>securing</b> <b>pin</b> on the bow rudder, and the Captain then made a decision to try to reach Northern Ireland by adopting a course which would keep the stern of the craft sheltered from the worst of the elements. At 09:46 AM, two hours after leaving Stranraer a message was transmitted in Morse code (the Princess Victoria did not have a radio telephone) by radio operator David Broadfoot to the Portpatrick Radio Station: [...] "Hove-to off mouth of Loch Ryan. Vessel not under command. Urgent assistance of tugs required". With a list to starboard exacerbated by shifting cargo, water continued to enter the ship. At 10:32 AM an SOS transmission was made, and the order to abandon was given at 14:00.Possibly the first warship in the area was HMS Launceston Castle, commanded by Lt. Cdr J M Cowling, a frigate which was en route to Derry. Searches were carried out but Launceston Castle was forced to leave when her condensers were contaminated by salt.Upon the upgrade of the assistance message to an SOS, the Portpatrick Lifeboat the Jeannie Spiers was dispatched, as was the destroyer HMS Contest. Contest, commanded by Lt Commander HP Fleming, left Rothesay at 1109hrs but, although she came close to her position at 1330hrs, poor visibility prevented the crew from seeing the sinking ship. The destroyer had been trying to maintain a speed of 31 kn to reach the listing ferry but, after sustaining damage from the seas, Captain Fleming was forced to reduce speed to 16 kn.|$|E

40|$|The knee {{anterior}} cruciate ligament which connects the femur to the tibia is often torn during sudden twisting motions resulting in knee instability with surgery being an effective treatment where the torn ligament is replaced with a graft. This study provides qualitative stress information on a restored knee which has been repaired using a novel device.

The device as well as the intact knee have been modelled in 3 D and studied using finite elements to assess the mechanical behaviour of the device under different loads. Results are evaluated and compared to equivalent published works. They showed that high stresses appear where tendons wrap around objects like the <b>securing</b> <b>pin</b> of the knee ligament repair device, while the highest stresses are away from the repair device components indicating that the device design does not affect the graft.

40|$|Pinned element {{connections}} in aluminium trusses are investigated experimentally [2]. Forces in the connections are transferred through shear and bearing. Because the inner cylinder and the <b>securing</b> <b>pins</b> are conical, {{there is no}} play in the connection when it is assembled. <b>Securing</b> the <b>pins</b> with springs allows for fast assembly and disassembly. In practice also nuts are used for <b>securing</b> the <b>pins.</b> The parameters investigated in the research are the boundary conditions (hinged or fixed in clamps of the test bench) {{and the way the}} <b>pins</b> are <b>secured</b> (with springs or with nuts). The mean maximum load at structural failure is 136 kN. This load was not influenced by the parameters investigated. The maximum elongation at structural failure is influenced by the way the <b>pins</b> are <b>secured.</b> The use of nuts (series II) results in more elongation (sample mean 14. 7 mm) compared to the use of springs (series I, sample mean 13. 1 mm). The load at maximum elastic deformation is influenced by the boundary conditions in the test bench. The clamped specimens show a mean elastic load limit of 39. 7 kN, which is approximately 12 kN lower than the hinged specimens which show a mean elastic load limit of 51. 4 kN. This {{can be explained by the}} additional stresses in the fixed connections resulting from the prevention of rotations, leading to a lower limit for elastic loading. The elastic connection stiffness is dependent on the way the <b>pins</b> are <b>secured.</b> The stiffness using springs is 56. 9 kN/mm, which is considerably higher than the stiffness using nuts which is 39. 3 kN/mm...|$|R

5000|$|Drain rods are {{plumbing}} equipment used {{to attempt to}} unblock drains and sewers. The set normally consists of several stiff, but flexible, rods, each approximately one meter long, which may be screwed together end-to-end. The material is often polypropylene heavy gauge tubing. Jointing of the plastic to metal is done in hydraulic presses and these joints are the achilles heel of this rod type. Often, when subjected to force, the joint breaks. Better quality ends have <b>securing</b> <b>pins</b> through the differing materials. More expensive rods are high tensile steel. End connections are often brass or steel, the better steel type having cadmium plating for corrosion resistance. Two types of threaded end can be purchased. Cheaper ones simply screw together, male to female but have the disadvantage of needing one-way rotation in use to prevent unscrewing. Better quality rods have their ends formed into a square peg, mating in a matching square hole in the adjacent rod. A captive threaded nut then screw locks both lengths together making a firm joint. A spanner tightens the joint firmly.|$|R
