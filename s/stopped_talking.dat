5|$|Immediately {{after his}} arrest, Abdulmutallab talked to {{authorities}} about the plot for about 50 minutes, without having been informed of his Miranda rights. After emerging from surgery, he was informed of his rights and <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to investigators for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E

5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but {{the well-to-do}} widow {{encouraged}} him and provided for {{him with her}} substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St. Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family did not approve of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.|$|E
5|$|Uma {{decides to}} go on a fast and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, {{explains}} his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Tsarnaev was {{questioned}} without being read his Miranda rights, because the Justice Department invoked Miranda's public-safety exception. He {{was to be}} questioned by a federal High-Value Interrogation Group, a special counterterrorism group created to question high-value detainees, which included members of the FBI, CIA, and Department of Defense. Later, after being read his Miranda rights, Tsarnaev <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> and declined to continue {{to cooperate with the}} investigation.|$|E
25|$|The Giants' {{front office}} {{operations}} were complicated by a long-standing feud between Wellington Mara and his nephew, Tim Mara. Jack Mara {{had died in}} 1965, leaving {{his share of the}} club to his son Tim. Wellington and Tim's personal styles and their visions for the club clashed, and eventually they <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to each other. Commissioner Rozelle intervened and appointed a neutral general manager, George Young, allowing the club to operate more smoothly. The feud became moot on February 20, 1991, when Tim Mara sold his shares in the club to Preston Robert Tisch.|$|E
25|$|Remi Cadoret {{wrote in}} the American Journal of Psychiatry that the typical age for the {{children}} to start talking about past-life memories (and often violent deaths) was two to four years, and generally they had <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> about them by the age of eight years. The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E

25|$|When locals {{heard of}} the group's plans for {{starting}} a new society in the Americas, rumours were spread and criticism was lodged against Pantisocracy. This was compounded when Southey's aunt, with whom he was living, found out about both the idea and Southey's intention in marrying Edith Fricker, a person that his aunt felt was below his station. His aunt immediately <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to him and kicked him out of her house. When Coleridge left for London, his thoughts about Pantisocracy began to change and he backed off {{his role in the}} matter. This was partly to blame for the intervention by Mary Evans and his brother George, and partly about Southey advocating for a master class and a servant class in their new society, all of which upset Coleridge. The idea did not completely collapse until Southey abandoned the plans in August 1795 in order to become a lawyer.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} teams {{stood on}} the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge. Olmec began the round by telling the remaining teams the episode's legend of the featured artifact, which became the theme {{for the remainder of}} the episode. The legend centered on an artifact which the winning team searched for in the final round. At the end of the legend, Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found. After finishing, he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory. Each multiple-choice question had three possible answers. A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on a button on their step, causing the front of the step to illuminate (if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question, he <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> immediately). A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level. If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time (three seconds after being called upon), the other teams were given a chance to answer. The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the bottom level advanced to the next round.|$|E
25|$|In the 1908 election, Taft easily {{defeated}} the Democratic nominee, three-time candidate William Jennings Bryan. Taft promoted a progressivism that stressed {{the rule of}} law; he preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually {{proved to be a}} less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers, he <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting Payne-Aldrich tariff of 1909, signed into law early in President Taft's tenure, was too high for most reformers, and Taft's handling of the tariff alienated all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft to be his own man.|$|E

500|$|In July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's eponymous tenth {{album was}} {{released}} to great commercial success, reaching No. 1 in the U.S. in 1976. The record's biggest hit single, [...] "Rhiannon", gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboard player and vocalist Christine McVie, bass guitarist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After {{six months of}} non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending eight years of marriage. The couple <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975's Fleetwood Mac, after guitarist Bob Welch had left—were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, {{had an affair with}} his best friend.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, when Maya Keyes was 20 years old, {{she came}} out as a lesbian. There were reports her family threw {{her out of the}} house and <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to her. In an {{interview}} with Metro Weekly, a Washington, D.C., LGBT newspaper, Maya confirmed that her father [...] "cut off all financial support." [...] In the same report Maya said, [...] "It doesn't make much sense for him to be [...] supporting someone who is working against what he believes in." [...] Alan Keyes contradicted reports about his having disowned his daughter in October 2007. Keyes said that he loves his daughter and that she knows she has a home with him. He asserted that he never cut her off and never would, because it would be [...] "wrong in the eyes of God." [...] He also said he would not be coerced into [...] "approving of that which destroys the soul" [...] of his daughter. He contended that he must [...] "stand for the truth [...] represents" [...] even if it breaks his heart.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2011, Dmitry Medvedev said: [...] "The {{moment of}} truth for me, as I {{realized}} later while analyzing those events in hindsight over and over again, came with the visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice." [...] "Following that visit, my Georgian colleague simply dropped all communication with us. He simply <b>stopped</b> <b>talking</b> to us, he stopped writing letters and making phone calls. It was apparent that he had new plans now. And those plans were implemented later." [...] Medvedev {{also said that he}} decided to attack Georgia without consulting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and that the two did not have a conversation until the following day.|$|E
2500|$|At a party held at Simmons' {{residence}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles {{to celebrate the}} success of The Robe, Burton met Elizabeth Taylor for the first time.

I seem to remember that he never <b>stopped</b> <b>talking,</b> and I had given him the cold fish eye." [...] Hamlet was a challenge that both terrified and attracted him, as it was a role many of his peers in the British theatre had undertaken, including Gielgud and Olivier. He shared his anxiety with de Havilland whilst coming to terms with her. Bogart too, didn't make it easy for him when he retorted: [...] "I never knew a man who played Hamlet who didn't die broke." ...|$|E
