50|$|In normal fatigue-testing {{of smooth}} specimens, about 90 percent {{is spent in}} crack {{nucleation}} and only the remaining 10 percent in crack propagation. However, in corrosion fatigue crack nucleation is facilitated by corrosion; typically, about 10 percent of life is sufficient for this stage. The rest (90 percent) of life is spent in crack propagation. Thus, it is more useful to evaluate crack-propagation behavior during corrosion fatigue. Fracture mechanics uses pre-cracked specimens, effectively measuring crack-propagation behavior. For this reason, emphasis is given to crack-propagation velocity measurements (using fracture mechanics) to study corrosion fatigue. Since fatigue crack grows in a stable fashion below the critical <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> for fracture (fracture toughness), the process is called sub-critical crack growth. The diagram on the right shows typical fatigue-crack-growth behavior. In this log-log plot, the crack-propagation velocity is plotted against the applied stress-intensity range. Generally there is a threshold stress-intensity range, below which crack-propagation velocity is insignificant. Three stages may be visualized in this plot. Near the threshold, crack-propagation velocity increases with increasing stress-intensity range. In the second region, the curve is nearly linear and follows Paris' law(6); in the third region crack-propagation velocity increases rapidly, with the stress-intensity range leading to fracture at the fracture-toughness value. Crack propagation under corrosion fatigue may be classified as a) true corrosion fatigue, b) stress corrosion fatigue or c) a combination of true, stress and corrosion fatigue.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{application}} of the Biot’s theory to the diffraction problem of plane harmonic dilatational waves (P-waves) of the first kind and the second kind by a line crack or geometric discontinuity of finite width embedded in a saturated two-phase medium is presented in this paper. The crack surfaces are assumed impermeable, and the integral transform method is utilized to reduce the mixed boundary-value problem to a single Fredholm integral equation. The magnitudes of {{the intensity of the}} stress fields near the crack tips measured by Mode I dynamic <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> (dimensionless) are computed and displayed graphically against dimensionless circular frequency (ω) for several dimensionless material property values, namely, viscosity-to-permeability and mass density ratios. In the case of the normally incident P-waves of the first kind, the results in terms of <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> are also compared with the corresponding values of dry elastic material. All the <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> curves are shown to exhibit a similar character in that they rise to the peaks at certain frequency values and then decay with increasing frequencies. At certain frequency ranges and material property values, amplification in the dynamic <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> can be substantially larger than those encountered in dry elastic materials. The <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> is found to be more affected by the changes in the ratio of viscosity-to-permeability at lower mass density ratio. With fluid mass density 10 % of the bulk mass density, the viscosity-to-permeability ratio of 0. 01 gives the highest increase of about 32 % in the magnitude of <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> compared to the dry material counterpart value, while a decrease of about 9 % is observed for the viscosity-to-permeability ratio of 100. It is also found that change in mass density ratio has significant effect upon the magnitude of <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> at lower ratio of viscosity-to-permeability. As for the normally incident P-waves of the second kind, the presence of the pore fluid affects both the magnitude and character of the <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor.</b> Large variations in the magnitude of <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> are observed as viscosity-to-permeability ratio changes from 1 to 100. At the ratio of viscosity-to-permeability of 1. 0, the <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> curves increase gradually with frequency and exhibit the peaks in curves for mass density ratio of 0. 3 and higher. As the viscosity-to-permeability ratio is raised to 100, the <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> curves increase monotonically with frequency at a much faster rate throughout the frequency range of interest (ω= 0 – 2), and the change in mass density ratio is shown to have little effect on the <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor,</b> especially within the low frequency ranges.

This paper presents a theoretical study of the effect of phase-transformation-induced volume contraction on the fracture properties of superelastic SMAs. A simple model is employed to account for the forward and reverse phase transformation with pure volume change, which is then applied to numerically study the transformation field near the tip of a tensile crack. The results reveal that during steady-state crack propagation, the transformation zone extends ahead of the crack tip due to forward transformation while partial reverse transformation occurs in the wake. Furthermore, as a result of the volume contraction associated with the austenite-to-martensite transformation, the induced <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factor</b> is positive.

40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of two papers {{generated}} from a study on probabilistic meshless analysis of cracks. In this paper (Part I), a Galerkin-based meshless method is presented for predicting first-order derivatives of <b>stress-intensity</b> <b>factors</b> with respect to the crack size in a linear-elastic structure containing a single crack. The method involves meshless discretization of cracked structure, domain integral representation of the fracture integral parameter, and sensitivity analysis in conjunction with a virtual crack extension technique. Unlike existing finite-element methods, the proposed method does not require any second-order variation of the stiffness matrix to predict first-order sensitivities, and is, consequently, simpler than existing methods.
