New {{generation}} fly ashes are a {{produced during}} coal combustion in fluidized bed furnaces with simultaneous sulphur removal from the gas. This process is held at temperature of about 850 degrees of Celsius. The generated ashes basically {{differ in their}} physicochemical properties from traditional silica ashes. Fluidal ashes produced during lignite combustion consist of active puzzolana {{in the form of}} dehydrated clayey minerals and active components activating the process of hydration of, e. g. CaO, anhydrite II and CaCO 3 ashes.

The provincial parlements resisted in their turn; the most recalcitrant, the parlement of Rouen, did not unreservedly register the Edict until 1609.|$|R

Originally, the pack-in stickers were called “Dokkiri Seal” (どっきりシール, “Shocking Seal). Each seal featured a realistic image on a clear background, with the intention of using them for pranks or gags (broken glass, clothing tears, fake wall switches, etc.) By the 1980s, the Seals began featuring individual gag-based characters with a theme that united a particular <b>set</b> of <b>Seals.</b> These style of stickers would remain for the first 9 <b>sets</b> of <b>Seal</b> releases.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} November 1923 when the {{government}} finally gave its approval {{for a number of}} officially recognised medium wave stations.All stations operated under a unique <b>Sealed</b> <b>Set</b> system under which each <b>set</b> was <b>sealed</b> to the frequency of one station. Part of the price of the set went to the government via the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), with money also going to the broadcaster. Apart from extremely limited advertising, this was the broadcasters' only source of income. From the outset problems with the system came to the fore. Many young people built their own sets, which could receive all the stations. The <b>sealed</b> <b>set</b> system was devised by broadcasting pioneer Ernest Fisk of AWA - Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia).|$|R
