In 1890, Willoughby Island in Glacier Bay was the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meeting of the miners, which {{was followed by the}} establishment of the Berry mining district.

5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos.

The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges.|$|E

5|$|Britain had {{remained}} neutral throughout the first {{stages of the}} war. Although unsympathetic to the violence and upheaval of the French Revolution, Britain's Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was unwilling {{to go to war}} alongside the absolutist monarchies of Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy had made extensive preparations for war should it occur, starting with the Spanish Armament of 1790. The French Atlantic Fleet however was in poor condition: the principal fleet base at Brest in Brittany had been the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> significant mutiny in 1790 and by 1791 desertion rates among French naval officers were running at more than 80%. Despite its strong republican politics and command difficulties, the fleet itself was very strong, having been expanded and improved during the 1780s – indeed the tax rises to pay for the French Navy {{had been one of the}} causes of the original Revolution in 1789.|$|E
5|$|Calais was {{virtually}} razed {{to the ground}} during World War II. In May 1940, it was a key objective of the invading German forces and became the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> last-ditch defence—the Siege of Calais—which diverted a sizable amount of German forces for several days immediately prior to the Battle of Dunkirk. 3,000 British and 800 French troops, assisted by Royal Navy warships, held out from 22 to 27 May 1940 against the 10th Panzer Division. The town was flattened by artillery and precision dive bombing and only 30 of the 3800-strong defending force were evacuated before the town fell. This may have helped Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk, as 10th Panzer would have been involved on the Dunkirk perimeter {{had it not been}} busy at Calais. Between 26 May and 4 June 1940, some 330,000 Allied troops escaped from the Germans at Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|Cassel (from Flemish; Kassel {{in modern}} Dutch spelling) is a commune in the Nord départment in {{northern}} France. Built on a prominent hill overlooking French Flanders, {{the town has}} existed since Roman times. It {{was developed by the}} Romans into an important urban centre and was the focus of a network of roads, which are still in use today, that converge on the hill. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fierce three-day battle between British and German forces which resulted in much of the town being destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot {{injury in the}} Broncos Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. The Broncos denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a bystander.|$|E
5|$|In 1451 {{during the}} Wars of the Roses Taunton was the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{skirmish}} between Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon, and Baron Bonville. Queen Margaret and her troops passed through in 1471 to defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury. In the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 {{most of the}} Cornish gentry supported Perkin Warbeck's cause and on 17 September a Cornish army some 6,000 strong entered Exeter before advancing on Taunton. Henry VII sent his chief general, Giles, Lord Daubeney, to attack the Cornish and when Warbeck heard that the King's scouts were at Glastonbury he panicked and deserted his army. Henry VII reached Taunton on 4 October 1497 where he received the surrender of the remaining Cornish army. The ringleaders were executed and others fined a total of £13,000.|$|E
5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, was the <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built {{in place of the}} makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.|$|E
