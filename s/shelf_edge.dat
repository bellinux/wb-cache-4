25|$|Barkley Canyon {{extends from}} the {{continental}} <b>shelf</b> <b>edge</b> at 400 m down the continental slope to the canyon axis at 985 m water depth. Located {{at the leading edge}} of the Cascadia subduction zone, this site supports the study of the accretionary prism, where the sediments pile along the continental slope as they are scraped off the subducting or descending tectonic plate. This is also a location where pressure, temperature, gas saturation, and local biological and chemical conditions are just right for exposed gas hydrates to be stable on the seafloor. Gas hydrates have gas molecules, typically methane in marine environments, trapped within “cages” of water molecules. This gives them a crystalline structure that resembles ice and can appear as white to yellow mounds covered by sediment on the seafloor.|$|E

25|$|The {{blue runner}} is {{primarily}} an inshore fish {{throughout most of}} its range, however it is known to live on reefs in water depths greater than 100 m. Throughout much of its Central American range, it is quite rare inshore, instead more commonly sighted on the outer reefs. The blue runner is primarily a semi-pelagic fish, inhabiting both inshore reefs and the outer <b>shelf</b> <b>edges,</b> sill reefs and upper slopes of the deep reef. Those individuals on shallower reefs often move between reef patches over large sand expanses. Juvenile fish are also known to inhabit the shallow waters of inshore lagoons, taking refuge around mangroves or in seagrass amongst coral reef patches. Fishermen have also taken the species in the Mississippi delta, indicating it can tolerate lower salinities in almost estuarine environments.|$|R
2500|$|There {{have been}} found cold seeps also in the Amazon deepsea fan. High-resolution seismic {{profiles}} near the <b>shelf</b> <b>edge</b> show evidence of near-surface slumps and faulting [...] in the subsurface and concentrations (about [...] ) of methane gas. Several studies (e.g., Amazon Shelf Study—AMASEDS, LEPLAC, REMAC, GLORIA, Ocean Drilling Program) indicate that there is evidence for gas seepage on the slope off the Amazon fan based on the incidence of bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs), mud volcanoes, pock marks, gas in sediments, and deeper hydrocarbon occurrences. The existence of methane at relatively shallow depths and extensive areas of gas hydrates have been mapped in this region. Also, gas chimneys have been reported, and exploratory wells have discovered subcommercial gas accumulations and pock marks along fault planes. A sound geological and geophysical understanding of the Foz do Amazonas Basin is already available and used by the energy companies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{generally}} {{assumed that the}} extreme life history traits of pelagic seabirds, such as low fecundity or slow growth of chicks, result from the difficulties obtaining energy at sea from unpredictable and patchily distributed resources. However, little information on seabird prey distribution and availability exists to sustain this widely accepted hypothesis. Using tracking studies of 68 sub-populations of flying seabirds, I examine whether {{it is possible to}} gain information on the predictability of their marine resources. Because prey are clustered from fine to large scale in nested unities, from swarms to patches and concentrations of patches, it is important to take into account spatial scale. In temperate and polar regions, at large and meso-scales, seabirds appear to have a good knowledge of the location and concentrations of patches and generally use a commuting type of trip to reach foraging zones. Predictability appears to be high at large and meso-scales, with individuals from each sub-population heading in a particular direction from the colony to reach favoured habitats of known enhanced productivity such as <b>shelf</b> <b>edges,</b> frontal zones, upwellings. Within these mesoscale features, the animals use an area-restricted search behaviour to search for patches and swarms at finer scales. Using information on foraging site fidelity of individual birds, I show that differences in predictability at coarse scales are related to the distance and time spent foraging, and in particular to the specific types of foraging habitat. Some habitats appear to be more predictable than others: birds return consistently to the same coarse-scale sectors on <b>shelf</b> <b>edges,</b> whereas predictability is low in oceanic waters, even in frontal zones. Preliminary results on tropical species suggest that the environment here is less predictable in tropic than in temperate or polar zones. This review highlights that patchiness and predictability of marine resources are complex notions: predictability is dependent on the spatial and temporal scale considered, and especially on the marine habitat of foraging interest. I discuss the potential consequences of these results for the breeding success and life history of seabirds...|$|R
40|$|Risso’s {{dolphins}} [Grampus griseus (Cuvier 1812) ] are a {{pelagic species}} of squid-eating odontocetes that are typically found in deep, temperate and tropical waters near continental <b>shelf</b> <b>edges</b> and submarine canyons (Leatherwood et al., 1980). Young animals have dark grey bodies while older animals appear nearly white due to accumulated scratches. Each time a Risso’s dolphin receives a scratch or a wound, the dark grey pigment does not return and the healed wound leaves a whitish mark. As a result, adult animals appear scratched and mottled.

50|$|During {{the late}} Neogene, the Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf {{drainage}} system flowed across Prydz Bay in an ice stream that reached the <b>shelf</b> <b>edge</b> {{and built a}} trough mouth fan on the upper continental slope. The fan consists mostly of debris flow deposits derived from the melting out of subglacial debris at the grounding line at the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>edge.</b> Ocean Drilling Program Site 1167 indicates that thick debris flow intervals are separated by thin mudstone horizons deposited when the ice had retreated from the <b>shelf</b> <b>edge.</b> The bulk of the trough mouth fan was deposited prior to ~780,000 years ago with as few as three debris flow intervals deposited since then.|$|E

The modelling software package COMSOLMultiphysics was employed in representing these phenomena for a set of five vials located at the borderof the shelf, close to the metallic guardrail. Model predictions of heat fluxes were validated against experimentalmeasurements conducted over a broad range of shelf temperatures and chamber pressures representativefor pharmaceutical freeze-drying. Conduction through low-pressure water vapour appearedas the dominant mechanism explaining the additional heat transfer to border vials compared to centralones.

The channel seafloor is disrupted by a fault complex and pockmarks. Motion along the faults split the sea floor into a series of undulations separated by narrow V-shaped notches.
