He himself, or his relatives if a minor, would generally inform the king's chancery that the death had occurred, and this would prompt the production of a writ by the chancery under the king's great seal addressed to the various escheators of the counties in which the deceased held lands, known as a writ diem clausit extremum. This writ, the earliest identified example of which dates from 1254, informed the escheator that the king had been informed (quia datum est nobis intelligi ("because it has been given to us to know")) that the tenant-in-chief named had [...] "closed his last day", as the Latin phrase by which the writ has become known may be translated, and that he was ordered to hold an inquisition post mortem, and to send the resultant report back to the chancery, with his seal and with the writ diem clausit extremum sewn onto it.

It offers data for metabolic pathways and as a novelty also for signalling reactions. Until recently, the database solely has been compiled through manual data mining of published papers and merging the kinetic data excerpt with information collected from other databases. We have designed the novel XML-based schema SabioML for exchanging experimentally derived kinetic data and corresponding metadata between programs or databases. The schema is tailored to SABIO-RK, however also could serve for transferring data between other resources. It comprises the description of kinetic laws with their parameters and relevant metadata in a structured and standardised format applying controlled vocabulary, {{as well as the}} possibility to assign annotations complying with the MIRIAM <b>standard</b> (Minimum <b>Information</b> <b>Required</b> In the Annotation of Models). Based on this data description format we have developed a submission interface that allows transfer of reaction kinetics data directly from the experimental instrument to the SABIO-RK database. The data can be accessed by the submitting researcher and, after release by the submitter and curation to ensure completeness of the data, also by the public, either manually via a web-based user interface or automated via web-services, both supporting the export of the data together with its annotations in SBML (Systems Biology Mark-up Language). |$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to document the impact of biomedical journal title changes on medical libraries and to increase awareness of the reasons titles are changed. The study consisted of two parts: a survey of academic health sciences libraries in the United States and Canada and an analysis of title changes from two different years. The survey response rate was 83 %. The majority of respondents commented on difficulties in identifying and processing title changes, often resulting in the delay or loss of information. The analysis revealed that a third of title changes were not justified by the journal. The study results substantiate the need to standardize title change reporting by publishers. A standard developed by the National <b>Information</b> <b>Standards</b> Organization <b>requires</b> publishers to conform to standardized practices for notification. This standard precisely reflects the concerns reflected in both the survey and the study of title changes, and librarians are urged to ensure that the standard is implemented by publishers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis is a {{follow-up}} paper of “Liberating the dimension for function approximation”, where we studied approximation of infinitely variate functions by algorithms that use linear information consisting of finitely many linear functionals. In this paper, we study similar approximation problems, however, now the algorithms can only use <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> consisting of finitely many function values. We {{assume that the}} cost of one function value depends on the number of active variables. We focus on polynomial tractability, and occasionally also study weak tractability. We present non-constructive and constructive results. Non-constructive results are based on known relations between linear and <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> for finitely variate functions, whereas constructive results are based on Smolyak’s construction generalized to the case of infinitely variate functions. Surprisingly, for many cases, the results for <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> are roughly the same as for linear information...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{potential}} benefits of colorectal cancer screening are limited by low uptake. This study tested whether providing narrative accounts of the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening experience positively affected beliefs about CRC screening and intention to be screened. Methods 4125 adults aged 45 - 59. 5  years, from three general practices in England, were randomised to be sent the <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> on CRC screening or the <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> plus a narrative-based leaflet describing CRC screening experiences. Both groups {{were asked to complete}} and return a questionnaire on beliefs about CRC screening after reading the study materials. Between-group differences on responses were assessed with t-tests. A mediation analysis then addressed the mediating role of CRC screening beliefs on the group and intention relationship. Results Relative to the <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> group (n[*]=[*] 590), the <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> plus narrative leaflet group (n[*]=[*] 631) showed higher perceived vulnerability to CRC, higher perceived test response efficacy, a stronger belief that the screening test would provide peace of mind and less disgust with the test procedure. There were no between group differences on perceived self-efficacy or the understanding that the screening test should be done in the absence of symptoms. Respondents who received the additional narrative leaflet reported significantly higher CRC screening intentions than respondents who received the <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> only. Controlling for the CRC screening beliefs reduced the effect of group on intention to non-significance. Conclusions An additional narrative leaflet had a positive impact on beliefs about CRC screening which led to stronger screening intentions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study {{approximating}} multivariate functions from a reproducing ker-nel Hilbert {{space with}} the error between the function and its approximation measured in a weighted L 2 -norm. We consider functions with an arbitrarily {{large number of}} variables, d, and {{we focus on the}} randomized setting with algorithms using <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> consisting of function values at randomly chosen points. We prove that <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> in the randomized setting is as powerful as linear information in the worst case setting. Linear information means that algorithms may use arbitrary continuous linear functionals, and by the power of information we mean the speed of convergence of the nth minimal errors, i. e., of the minimal errors among all algorithms using n function evaluations. Previously, it was only known that <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> in the randomized setting is no more powerful than the linear information in the worst case setting. We also study (strong) tractability of multivariate approximation in the randomized setting. That is, we study when the minimal number of function evaluations needed to reduce the initial error by a factor ε is polynomial in ε− 1 (strong tractability), and polynomial in d and ε− 1 (tractability). We prove that these notions in the randomized setting for <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> are equivalent to the same notions in the worst case setting for linear information. This result is useful since for a number of important applications only <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> can be used and verifying (strong) tractability for <b>standard</b> <b>information</b> is in general difficult, whereas (strong) tractability in the worst case setting for linear information is known for many spaces and is relatively easy to check. We illustrate the tractability results for weighted Korobov spaces. In particular, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for strong tractability and tractability. For product weights independent of d, we prove that strong tractability is equivalent to tractability. We stress that all proofs are constructive. That is, we provide randomized algo-rithms that enjoy the maximal speed of convergence. We also exhibit randomized algorithms which achieve strong tractability and tractability error bounds. 1...|$|R
