In the Philippines, some schools already use RFID in IDs for borrowing books and also gates in those particular schools have RFID ID scanners for buying items at a school shop and canteen, library and also to sign in and <b>sign</b> <b>out</b> for student and teacher's attendance.|$|E

2500|$|Canada's largest bike share {{system is}} the BIXI Montréal system. [...] The system was {{developed}} by PBSC Urban Solutions. Started in May 2009, it ha s expanded to over 5000 bicycles at 450 stations. The Bixi system was implemented in June 2009 in Ottawa/Gatineau as Capital Bixi, and in May 2011 in Toronto, Ontario as Bixi Toronto. From 2001 to 2006, BikeShare, operated by the Community Bicycle Network (CBN) in Toronto, was for a time the most popular community bicycle sharing program in North America. BikeShare was intended to overcome some of the theft issues by requiring yearly memberships to <b>sign</b> <b>out</b> any of the 150 refurbished yellow bikes locked up at 16 hubs throughout central Toronto. At its height, over 400 members could <b>sign</b> <b>out</b> a bike from any hub {{for up to three}} days. The hubs were located at stores, cafes and community centres where the staff would volunteer their time to sign bikes out and in. Despite steadily increasing administrative, implementation, and maintenance costs, CBN could only charge users around 20 percent of actual costs, as users were unlikely to spend more than $50 per year for a membership. Without sufficient funds in the form of private and government grants, CBN was forced to discontinue BikeShare in 2006.|$|E

While the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) provides several warnings before resorting to legal sanctions, allegations that it has abused its powers has led to charges of racism and harassment. The OQLF took action against stores retailing imported kosher goods that did not meet its labelling requirements, an action perceived in the Jewish community as an unfair targeting that coincided with a high-profile case against the well-known Schwartz's delicatessen, the owner of which was subjected to failed legal action by the OQLF due to the apostrophe in his sign, which remains.

2500|$|On 3 August 1987, two sailors {{were killed}} aboard Otama. At 09:00, the {{submarine}} left [...] {{to test a}} new towed hydrophone array. Extreme weather forced the cancellation of the test, and two sailors were sent into the fin at around 10:20 to retrieve and stow the array. At 10:35, the submarine was prepared for diving, and she submerged four minutes later, with the two men still in the fin. The submariners, on noticing their vessel diving underneath them, climbed up the fin to the bridge and opened the voicepipe in an unsuccessful attempt to contact the control room before being washed overboard. Their absence was not noticed until around 11:00, despite post-dive checks and a rotation of duty stations in the interim, and was not confirmed {{for at least another}} half-hour. A search for the submariners was conducted, and one of the bodies was spotted, but could not be recovered. Estimated survival time in the prevailing conditions was only five minutes, and the submariners were not required to wear lifebelts. A naval board of inquiry recommended that action be taken against two officers, although the Navy Office did not take action, as there were multiple factors leading into the incident, and court martialing the two officers could find one or both held solely responsible for the deaths. In addition to the rejection of the board's findings, several officers involved in the incident (including the two singled out by the inquiry), were promoted. A coronial inquiry followed (one of the first heard by the new office of the State Coroner of New South Wales), to which there was some opposition by the RAN, including advising personnel not to cooperate with the task force gathering evidence for the inquiry, and attempting to fend off a request by the coroner for a trip on the submarine replicating the events of the day. Following two separate weeks of hearings in October and November 1988, the state coroner concluded that the incident was the sum of multiple moderate-to-minor breaches of operating procedure and careless negligence (including that notices indicating personnel were outside the submarine were not posted, and key personnel were not informed) aboard a submarine operating in non-standard conditions (such as the testing of new equipment, along with observers and trainees aboard, and a high rotation of personnel between stations {{in a short period of}} time). The coroner singled out Otamas commanding officer for allowing so many rules and procedures to be ignored under his command, but did not find sufficient cause to recommend charges against any individual. Several changes were made to casing operational procedures at sea, including making lifebelts compulsory and requiring the senior petty officer on duty to <b>sign</b> <b>out</b> and sign back in personnel working outside. The fatalities aboard Otama were two of the only three deaths aboard Australian Oberons.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Borderline prostatic lesions, with {{insufficient}} histomorphologic features, to be definitely {{diagnosed as}} prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) are often <b>signed</b> <b>out</b> as “atypical glands suspicious for carcinoma” or atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP). These findings that eventually warrant either immunohistochemical (IHC) studies or a repeat biopsy, {{prove to be}} more burdensome to patients in developing countries (such as the Philippines), where health care is not as progressive nor is it an utmost priority. At the same time, in countries like the Philippines, {{there is a shortage}} of urological pathologists. Methods: In this study, we compared the transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate (TRUS) biopsies <b>signed</b> <b>out</b> by general surgical pathologists in St. Luke's Medical Center Quezon City from 2008 – 2010, and the TRUS Biopsies primarily <b>signed</b> <b>out</b> by a urologic pathologist in both St. Luke's Medical Center Quezon City and Global City from July 2013 to July 2014, and from September 2013 to July 2014, respectively. Results: From 2008 to 2010, 30. 6 % (129 of 421) of the cases were <b>signed</b> <b>out</b> as atypical. Of these, 79 underwent IHC staining, 21 (26. 6 %) of which were eventually <b>signed</b> <b>out</b> as PCa. Compared to those <b>signed</b> <b>out</b> in 2013 to 2014 by our genitourinary pathologist, only 16. 6 % (39 of 235) of the cases were <b>signed</b> <b>out</b> as atypical. Of these, 16 underwent IHC staining, with 15 (93 %) of them being definitively diagnosed as PCa. Among the 21 cases wherein a repeat biopsy was recommended, only three followed and two of these had findings of PCa on repeat biopsy. Looking at our 16. 6 % rate of atypicals and subtracting those that were eventually established as PCa after IHCs, our atypicals would be down to 10 % (24 / 235) in 2013 – 2014 compared to 25. 7 % (108 / 421) in 2008 – 2010. Conclusions: These results highlight the critical role a specialist has in the field of urological pathology, especially in developing countries. It is in the diagnosis of PCa in needle biopsies that a urological pathologist impacts the use of an atypical diagnosis, by ensuring its judicious use. This ultimately benefits the patients, by lessening unwarranted expenses through the decreased dependence on IHC staining and if necessary, a repeat biopsy...|$|R
