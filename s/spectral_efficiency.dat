25|$|DAB is {{not more}} {{bandwidth}} efficient than analogue measured in programmes per MHz of a specific transmitter (the so-called link <b>spectral</b> <b>efficiency),</b> but it is less susceptible to co-channel interference (cross talk), which {{makes it possible to}} reduce the reuse distance, i.e. use the same radio frequency channel more densely. The system <b>spectral</b> <b>efficiency</b> (the average number of radio programmes per MHz and transmitter) is a factor three more efficient than analogue FM for local radio stations. For national and regional radio networks, the efficiency is improved by more than an order of magnitude due to the use of SFNs. In that case, adjacent transmitters use the same frequency.|$|E

25|$|For its {{transmission}} speed, RTTY has low <b>spectral</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The typical RTTY signal with 170Hz {{shift at}} 45.45 baud requires around 250Hz receiver bandwidth, {{more than double}} that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter {{does not need to}} use a linear amplifier, which is required for many digital transmission modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.|$|E

2500|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Menzel (1975) {{described}} the morphology and spectral {{sensitivity of the}} honey bee eye that underlie their color vision. He examined color-coding in the honey bee retina by marking individual cells with a fluorescent dye and recording from these cells as single units. From this analysis he determined {{that there are three}} types of receptors in the honey bee eye: 1) UV receptors, 2) blue receptors, and 3) green receptors The three receptors contain three rhodopsin-like pigments which have maximal absorbance at wavelengths of 350nm, 440nm, and 540nm. Menzel also found that most of the cells he studied had secondary sensitivities that corresponded to wavelength regions at which the other two receptor types were maximally active. He used <b>spectral</b> <b>efficiency</b> experiments to suggest that these secondary sensitivities result from electric coupling between the receptors.|$|E
2500|$|Numerical example: Analog FM {{requires}} 0.2MHz per programme. The {{frequency reuse}} factor {{in most countries}} is approximately 15, meaning that {{only one out of}} 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with co-channel interference, i.e. cross-talk. [...] Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2MHz over the Band II spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a system <b>spectral</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26MHz per audio programme. The frequency reuse factor for local programmes and multi-frequency broadcasting networks (MFN) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz. [...] This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.|$|E

2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a sub-carrier spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NÎ”f = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} baseband bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high <b>spectral</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E

We also present a training-based iterative detection/channel estimation scheme for such large STBC MIMO systems. Our simulation results show that excellent bit error rate and nearness-to-capacity performance are achieved by the proposed multistage likelihood ascent search (M-LAS) detector in conjunction with the proposed iterative detection/channel estimation scheme at low complexities.
