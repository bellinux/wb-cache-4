Three propellers, which ranged in diameter from 8. 4 to 11. 25 feet, were tested at {{the front end of}} a <b>streamline</b> <b>body</b> incorporating spinners of two diameters. The tests covered a blade angle range from 20 deg to 65 deg. The effect of spinner diameter and propeller cuffs on the characteristics of one propeller was determined. Test were also conducted using a propeller which incorporated aerodynamically good shank sections and using one which incorporated the NACA 16 series sections for the outer 20 percent of the blades. Compressibility effects were not measured, owing to the low testing speeds. The results indicated that a conventional propeller was slightly more efficient when tested in conjunction with a 28 inch diameter spinner than with a 23 inch spinner, and that cuffs increased the efficiency as well as the power absorption characteristics. A propeller having good aerodynamic shanks was found to be definitely superior from the efficiency standpoint to a conventional round-shank propeller with or without cuffs; this propeller would probably be considered structurally impracticable, however. The propeller incorporating the NACA 16 series sections at the tims were found to have a slightly higher efficiency than a conventional propeller; the take-off characteristics appeared to be equally good.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{vorticity}} for any fluid element is constant if the fluid is non-viscous and the change of state of the fluid is isentropic. When a solid body is placed in a uniform stream, the flow far ahead of the body is irrotational. Then if the flow is further assumed to be isentropic, the vorticity will be zero over the whole field of flow. In other words, the flow is irrotational. For such flow over a solid body, it is shown by Theodorsen that the solid body experiences no resistance. If the fluid has a small viscosity, its effect will be limited in the boundary layer over the solid body and the body will have a drag due to the skin friction. This type of essentially isentropic irrotational flow is generally observed for a streamlined body placed in a uniform stream, if the velocity of the stream is kept below the so-called "critical speed. " At the critical speed or rather at a certain value of the ratio of the velocity of the undisturbed flow and the corresponding velocity of sound, shock waves appear. This phenomenon is called the "compressibility bubble. " Along a shock wave, the change of state of the fluid is no longer isentropic, although still adiabatic. This results in an increase in entropy of the fluid and generally introduces vorticity in an originally irrotational flow. The increase in entropy of the fluid is, of course, the consequence of changing part of the mechanical energy into heat energy. In other words, the part of fluid affected by the shock wave has a reduced mechanical energy. Therefore, with the appearance of shock waves, the wake of the <b>streamline</b> <b>body</b> is very much widened, and the drag increases drastically. Furthermore, the accompanying change in the pressure distribution over the body changes the aerodynamic moment acting on it {{and in the case of}} an airfoil decreases the lift force. All these consequences of the breakdown of isentropic irrotational flow are generally undesirable in applied aerodynamics. Its occurrence should be delayed as much as possible by modifying the shape or contour of the body. However, such endeavor will be very much facilitated if the cause or the criterion for the breakdown can be found first...|$|E

On the basis of studying technology of clearing of secondary waters it is carried out the analysis of research of process of gravitational sedimentation of particles at the constrained movement.

Realizing the highly demanding computer power, the way to solve the flow problems is by adopting some sort of simplification of Navier-Stokes equation according to physical flow phenomena consideration. Such approach gives, for instance, to the case of flow past through a <b>streamline</b> <b>body</b> at high and at low Reynolds number to moderate angle of attack, the Navier-Stokes equation can be simplified by ignoring viscous effects resulting a new governing equation of fluid motion named Euler equation. However, this equation is still belongs to the class of non-linear partial differential equation, while result in numerical approach is required. The main features of compressible flow are the presence of discontinuity flow phenomena due to shock wave and a contact surface. Such flow phenomenon is always found if the flow in transonic or supersonic flow regimes. As a result, all the aircrafts designed to fly at transonic or supersonic speed will face such flow phenomenon. It is therefore, all numerical schemes designed to be a tool for aerodynamics analysis or aerodynamics design tool must be able to predict the presence of such discontinuity flow phenomena accurately. The present work focused on the development of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) aerodynamics analysis tool by solving the compressible Euler equation through a finite difference method (FDM) as well as a finite volume method (FVM). The FDM used the method developed based on Davis-Yee TVD scheme. While that, the FVM was developed by using Roe scheme. In view of TVD scheme, there were various methods in involving a limiter functions. The use of various limiter functions as part of the development of CFD software is also carried out in the present work. To validate the developed software, these two types of CFD code are applied for solving the high Mach number flow past through airfoil.

Through results comparison for these two different airfoils operated at various angles of attack, it had been found that the developed CFD code based on Davis-Yee TVD scheme are able to produce the result close to the experimental result compared with the result produced by ANSYSFLUENT software or the code developed based on Roe finite volume scheme...|$|E
