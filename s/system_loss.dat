40|$|Modern doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) wind turbines have significant reactive power control capability, even during low wind speed conditions. This can improve system security by providing terminal voltage control at buses in the system. Generally, such control employs {{the full range}} of reactive power production from the turbine which can lead to increased <b>system</b> <b>losses.</b> By utilizing optimal power flow analysis, and limiting the range of reactive power production at certain wind farms, <b>system</b> <b>losses</b> can be minimized. If the reactive power of the wind farms are optimized to achieve the minimum <b>system</b> <b>losses</b> this may adversely affect the voltage security of the system.

5000|$|If {{there are}} two or more {{components}} in cascade {{as is often the}} case, the resultant mismatch loss is not only due to the mismatches from the individual components, but also from how the reflections from each component combine with each other. The overall mismatch loss cannot be calculated by just adding up the individual loss contributions from each component. The difference between the sum of the mismatch loss in each component and total mismatch loss due to the interactions of the reflections is known as mismatch error. Depending on how the multiple reflections combine, the overall <b>system</b> <b>loss</b> may be lower or higher than the sum of the mismatch loss from each component. Mismatch error occurs in pairs as the signal reflects off of each mismatched component. So for the example in Figure 3, there are mismatch errors generated by each pair of components. The mismatch uncertainty increases as the frequency increases, and in wide-band applications. The phasing of the reflections makes it particularly harder to model.|$|E
5000|$|The Allee {{effect may}} lead to a higher {{extinction}} probability by causing a crash in the population if the population is subject to unstable fluctuations in size. [...] Because the Allee effect can arise from variability in the numbers of males versus females, sex ratio {{plays an important role in}} extinction probability in the Persian fallow deer’s population. Having more females than males increases the chances of species survival because one male can fertilize multiple females, so fewer males are needed. However, having too many female deer {{may lead to}} more intense polygynous mating behaviors. Because males in a polygynous mating system are each responsible for fertilizing multiple females, the loss of a single reproducing male would reduce the reproductive output of several females in a given breeding season; in a comparable monogamous <b>system,</b> <b>loss</b> of a single male only affects the reproductive capacity of one female. For this reason, the population growth rate of a polygynous system is subject to more fluctuations from year to year than in a monogamous system, and such variation in growth rate could lead to higher chances of extinction. The optimal balance in sex ratio is an important component of the reintroduction of the Persian fallow deer.|$|E
