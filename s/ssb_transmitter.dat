25|$|SSTV uses analog {{frequency}} modulation, {{in which}} every different value of brightness in the image gets a different audio frequency. In other words, the signal frequency shifts up or down to designate brighter or darker pixels, respectively. Color is achieved by sending the brightness of each color component (usually red, green and blue) separately. This signal can be fed into an <b>SSB</b> <b>transmitter,</b> which in part modulates the carrier signal.|$|E
25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an <b>SSB</b> <b>transmitter</b> to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E

50|$|Systems {{incorporated}} into the airport include VHF and HF <b>SSB</b> <b>transmitters</b> and receivers, a voice communication control system, an automatic terminal information system (ATIS), and an aeronautical fixed telecommunications network. The air traffic control tower {{is equipped with a}} variety of radar and navigation systems.|$|R
25|$|Conventional amplitude-modulated signals can be {{considered}} wasteful of power and bandwidth because they contain a carrier signal and two identical sidebands. Therefore, <b>SSB</b> <b>transmitters</b> are generally designed to minimize the amplitude of the carrier signal. When the carrier {{is removed from the}} transmitted signal, it is called suppressed-carrier SSB.|$|R
2500|$|The first U.S. {{patent for}} SSB {{modulation}} {{was applied for}} on December 1, 1915 by John Renshaw Carson. The U.S. Navy experimented with SSB over its radio circuits before World War I. SSB first entered commercial service on January 7, 1927 on the longwave transatlantic public radiotelephone circuit between New York and London. [...] The high power <b>SSB</b> <b>transmitters</b> were located at Rocky Point, New York and Rugby, England. [...] The receivers were in very quiet locations in Houlton, Maine and Cupar Scotland.|$|R

50|$|Transmitters must be FCC {{certified}} {{and may not}} be modified, including {{modifications to}} increase output power or to transmit on unauthorized frequencies. Output power is limited to 4 watts for AM transmitters and 12 watts peak envelope power for single sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The antenna may not be more than 20 feet (6.1 m) above the highest point of the structure it is mounted to, or the highest point of the antenna must not be more than 60 feet (18.3 m) above the ground (47 CFR 95.408(c)) if installed in a fixed location.|$|R
40|$|It is shown, that Noise Power Ratio (NPR) {{testing of}} {{multichannel}} Single Sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{should be performed}} loading all channels with identical white, gaussian, zero-mean noise signals {{in order to obtain}} the worst case result. A theoretical analysis of bichannel equipment under the two different input conditions: (a) statistically independent noise signals, and (b) statistically dependent noise signals; shows that the intermodulation distortion on the output of the transmitter is the same for either case. This result is extended for an arbitrary number of channels to the point of showing that the test results obtained for statistically dependent noise inputs will be either equal to or worse than those obtained for statistically independent noise inputs. The theoretical conclusions made for a bichannel transmitter are verified by means of practical measurements performed on such a transmitter...|$|R
5000|$|The 74A4 and KWS-1 are {{an amateur}} radio {{receiver}} and transmitter pair {{made by the}} Collins Radio Company of Cedar Rapids, Iowa that were introduced in 1955. They were designed to operate using the then new single-sideband (SSB) voice modulation as well as CW and AM modes. They were influential in popularizing <b>SSB.</b> The KWS-1 <b>transmitter</b> along with the 75A-4 receiver, together, cost over $2500 when new (equivalent to over $20,000 in 2012 dollars). Collins products {{at the time were}} considered 'top of the line'. Ham radio enthusiasts nicknamed the pair [...] "The Gold Dust Twins," [...] as they were unaffordable to most amateur radio enthusiasts when first introduced.|$|R
