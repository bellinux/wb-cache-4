5|$|In 1902, Warner {{played one}} {{professional}} football {{game for the}} Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football at Madison Square Garden. In the first professional indoor football game, Syracuse defeated the heavily favored New York team. During the series, Warner was seriously cut on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Although he laughed it off at first, the injury {{turned out to be}} more serious and he was replaced with Blondy Wallace for the rest of the series. For the tournament, Warner and the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers did {{not appear}} for JAPW again until late 2005, again in a tables, ladders, and chairs match for the tag team title, this time against the teams of Teddy Hart and Homicide, the Backseat Boyz, and The S.A.T.. The match, which took place at JAPW's 8th Year Anniversary Show, was won Hart and Homicide. At the next show, Fall Out, the S.A.T. {{defeated}} them and thus became number one contenders to the tag team championship. More recent JAPW appearances came in early 2006, losing along with the Outcast Killers to the S.A.T. once again at Wild Card II in a tag team title match, and then at Brotherly Love to the team of Sabu and Sonjay Dutt, a match they also lost. In October 2008, the Briscoes competed at JAPW's 11th Anniversary Show against LAX (Homicide and Hernandez). During a brawl outside the ring, Mark suffered a large gash on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ferocity of}} the fight {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was a paucity of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. In the gathering darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets. Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Though Cleeve was by {{no means}} a wealthy house, the monks were able to make {{significant}} investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period. In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome tiled floors (an expensive and high status product) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken. A wooden shelter was constructed over the tiled floor in 2016. Abbot David Juyner (r.1435–87) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery. He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor. This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling (carved with angels) was the equal of the hall of any contemporary secular lord. Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments. These were probably used by corrodians, pensioners of the abbey. Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects. Some of these wall paintings survive. As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and the man has an angel on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right. Work continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution. The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion. As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.|$|E
25|$|Identification of the Romanovs {{was made}} {{based on the}} {{clothing}} worn and by papers found in their pockets.

25|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding Williams' death caused the Williams family {{to suspect that}} some form of foul play was the actual cause of Williams' death.

25|$|Outside of {{professional}} wrestling, Ferraro is a real-life performing strongman. His demonstrations have included bending steel bars and breaking iron bars over his head, and headbutting and snapping a Louisville slugger in half with his skull. His specialty, however, is using {{his head to}} break various hard or heavy objects. He has had cinder blocks jack-hammered off his head, concrete blocks set on fire and broken over the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> using a sledge hammer, and having 16lb bowling balls dropped on his head from heights up to 15 feet. Ferraro has also used his forehead to drive spikes through 2x4s wrapped in sheet metal. Ferraro first discovered this ability as a teenager when, while chasing younger brother around the house during an argument, crashed head first into a large oak door.|$|E
25|$|Minsc is a {{supporting}} {{character in the}} 2000 novelization of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn by Philip Athans. He is depicted as a well-built man with long red hair, a patchy orange beard, and a jagged scar along the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He {{is no longer a}} warrior, and is physically smaller than the novel's protagonist, Abdel. In contrast, Boo is unchanged, and is still referred to by Minsc as his miniature giant space hamster. Held prisoner alongside Abdel {{at the start of the}} novel, Minsc is set free and accompanies Abdel until they reach an inn, where he decides to work. Abdel repeatedly shows discomfort for his presence, using Minsc's employment as an excuse to leave him behind and steal his sword, though he later returns for his help in securing travel aboard a ship. After Abdel returns to kill his employers, Minsc realizes the inn will close permanently; he and Boo leave to find another place to work.|$|E
500|$|The rioters removed Blakelock's {{protective}} helmet, {{which was}} never found. Rose {{writes that the}} pathologist, David Bowen, found 54 holes in Blakelock's overalls, and 40 cutting or stabbing injuries, eight of them to his head, caused by a machete, sword or axe-type instrument. A six-inch-long knife was buried in his neck up to the hilt. His body was covered in marks from having been kicked or stamped on. His hands and arms were badly cut, and he had lost several fingers trying to defend himself. There were 14 stab wounds on his back, one {{on the back of}} his right thigh, six on his face, and his jawbone had been smashed by a blow that left a six-inch gash across the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Bowen said the force of this blow had been [...] "almost as if to sever his head," [...] which gave rise to a rumour that an attempt had been made to decapitate him (according to Rose, the autopsy photographs did not support this).|$|E

500|$|Stevens and the Devils {{once again}} had success in 2002–03, {{finishing}} {{first in the}} division. In addition, he was named as captain of the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time, and finished the season with the fewest penalty minutes over a full season in his career. The Devils played well in the playoffs, knocking off Boston, Tampa Bay, and Ottawa to face the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the Finals. Stevens and the Devils had a minor scare in Game 3 of the semifinals against Tampa Bay when a slapshot from Pavel Kubina hit the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and forced {{him to leave the}} game. [...] Although there was uncertainty whether he would return for Game 4, Stevens in fact returned, and did not miss a game throughout the remainder of the playoffs. In Game 2 of the Finals, he set the record for most playoff games by a defenceman, breaking the record by his former coach, Larry Robinson. Stevens added to his list of playoff hits when he hit [...] Ducks forward Paul Kariya in Game Six. [...] However, Kariya came back shortly thereafter much to everyone's surprise and led the Ducks to a victory, forcing a seventh game. The Devils kept the Ducks scoreless in Game Seven, 3-0, to win their third Stanley Cup in nine years. [...] Stevens' appearance in Game Seven tied Patrick Roy's record for appearances in Game Sevens, with 13. Despite the play of Stevens, Martin Brodeur, Jamie Langenbrunner, and Jeff Friesen, the Conn Smythe Trophy went to Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère. [...] Some speculated that there were too many worthy Devils candidates for the trophy, resulting in a split vote among sportswriters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first step}} to {{diagnosing}} a headache is {{to determine if the}} headache is old or new.

2500|$|Although {{descriptions}} {{said that}} Siegel {{was shot in}} the eye, he was actually hit twice on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The death scene and postmortem photographs show that one shot penetrated his right cheek and exited through {{the left side of his}} neck; the other struck the right bridge of his nose where it met the right eye socket. The pressure created by the bullet passing through Siegel's skull blew his left eye out of its socket. A Los Angeles' Coroner's Report (#37448) states the cause of death as cerebral hemorrhage.

2500|$|On May 2, 1957, Vito Genovese ordered Gigante {{to murder}} Genovese family Boss Frank Costello, {{a close friend}} and {{successor}} of Lucky Luciano the best-known underworld figure in the United States.

Just as Gigante fired his [...]38-caliber handgun, Costello moved, causing the bullet to graze the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Because Costello fell down, Gigante thought the mob boss was dead and sped away in a black Cadillac. Costello refused to identify his attempted assassin, leading Gigante to thank Costello in court, but the doorman at 115 Central Park West did. When tried for the shooting, his defense team effectively challenged the credibility of the doorman, and Gigante was acquitted in 1958 on charges of attempted murder.|$|E
