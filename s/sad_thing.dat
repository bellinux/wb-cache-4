500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and the <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E

Joyce was named on 53% of ballots, 19 ballots ahead of second-place Tim McClelland. One player was quoted as saying, [...] "The <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> about the Galarraga game is, Jim Joyce is seriously one of the best umpires around... He always calls it fair, so players love him. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's terrible that this happened to him." [...] Furthermore, the players in this poll overwhelmingly endorsed (86%) Selig's decision not to overturn the call, and were overwhelmingly against (77%) instituting replay for calls on the bases.|$|E

The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in full frame. The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact. Upon Inside Mans theatrical release, he regretted the video game sequence in the film, saying, [...] "The <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is somebody is probably gonna make a game out of it and take that as inspiration." ...|$|E

The dedication ceremony included 50,000 friends and well-wishers, as well as former Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush and their wives. The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California in November 1991. Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected, [...] "I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady", and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, [...] "There was one <b>sad</b> <b>thing.</b> Pat Nixon did not look well at all.

"Go Big or Go Home" [...] was {{the first}} {{original}} episode since [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] in May 2010, and executive producer Michael Schur said while he believed it was a strong episode, there were fears the hiatus would hurt {{the momentum of the}} series: [...] "Of course, any time you're not on the air, {{you run the risk of}} people forgetting about you; that's the <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> about the mid-season show." [...] The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said the long hiatus made an ironic sort of sense for the script, since at the beginning the characters have [...] "taken too much time off and we've all gone a little crazy". While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] marked the first episode in a new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, [...] "'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor."

500|$|Barrowman's {{television}} {{career began}} with several appearances in short-lived prime-time soap operas. Barrowman first starred as Peter Fairchild in Central Park West (1995) a show American film critic Ken Tucker calls [...] "a tale of ritzy, ditsy New York City careerists—some {{struggling to make}} it, others plotting to retain their status and power." [...] Television critic David Hiltbrand called Barrowman's character a [...] "Prince Charming ... a virtuous, hardworking assistant DA who keeps getting distracted by women who swoon in his path." [...] Tucker noted Barrowman's character of Peter Fairchild to be [...] "physically an eye-widening cross between John Kennedy Jr. and Hugh Grant". The show lasted for two seasons on CBS, from September 1995 to June 1996. Barrowman then appeared as Peter Williams in Titans (2000). According to writer Joanna Bober, in Titans, Barrowman plays a [...] "ruthless mogul" [...] who gains [...] "control of the family's private aviation company (a fleet of 'Titans') from his semi-retired father" [...] while increasing the profitability of the company amidst a series of soap opera intrigues. Titans was cancelled after airing eleven episodes. Barrowman was also considered {{for the role of}} Will in Will and Grace, but the producers reportedly felt he was [...] "too straight" [...] and the role eventually went to Eric McCormack instead. [...] Commenting on the decision, Barrowman remarked, [...] "The <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is it's run by gay men and women." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{and authors}} have also commented on these changes. Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is [...] "convinced {{that the new}} Robert Zemeckis movie {{treatment}} sacrifices {{the power of the}} original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie—the mother of the monster he has just slain. What man doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' ... 'For me, the <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is the movie returns to…a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems to me you could do so much better now. And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'" [...] Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.|$|E
