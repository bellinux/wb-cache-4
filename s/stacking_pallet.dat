Selbst im unguenstigsten Fall koennen nur relativ geringe Thoriumoxalat-Mengen aus den Behaeltern freigesetzt werden. Zu beachten ist, dass fuer die Halterung der Behaelter im Palettenverbrand brandfeste Materialien (z. B. keine Schrumpffolie) {{verwendet}} werden, so dass auch bei gleichzeitigem Brand ein Umfallen oder Herausfallen von Behaeltern sicher vermieden wird. Die Gefahr des Berstens intakter Behaelter im Brand aufgrund der Volumenveraenderung des Inhalts durch Umwandlungsprozesse besteht nicht. Das in allen Versuchen beobachtete fruehzeitige Versagen der Deckeldichtung verhindert den Aufbau eines hoeheren Druckes. Dabei kann zwar kein Thorium freigesetzt, aber natuerlich die Thorium-Emanation abgeblasen werden. (orig. /HP) The {{tests have}} shown that the steel containers give considerable protection against mechanical impacts from the top if emplaced as a stack (3 containers in a vertical stack, on a <b>stacking</b> <b>pallet).</b> Even in the worst case, only relatively low amounts of thorium oxalate will escape from the casks. Care has to be taken that the material used for fixing the casks on the pallet is fire resistant (non-shrinking subject to heat for example), so {{that in the case of}} mechanical plus fire impacts, the containers in the stack will not turn over or tip out of the stack. There is no danger of containers bursting under fire impacts due to volume increase of contents as a result of transformation processes. The early, design-based failure of the container lid sealing observed in all tests will prevent the buildup of pressure. No thorium will be released, but the thorium emanation can be blown out.

50|$|Hand trucks (including {{carts and}} dollies), the {{simplest}} type of industrial truck, cannot transport or <b>stack</b> <b>pallets,</b> is non-powered, and requires the operator to walk. A pallet jack, which cannot <b>stack</b> a <b>pallet,</b> uses front wheels mounted inside {{the end of}} forks that extend to the floor as the pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. A counterbalanced lift truck (sometimes {{referred to as a}} forklift truck, but other attachments besides forks can be used) can transport and <b>stack</b> <b>pallets</b> and allows the operator to ride on the truck. The weight of the vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); the front wheels act as a fulcrum or pivot point. Narrow-aisle trucks usually require that the operator stand-up while riding {{in order to reduce the}} truck’s turning radius. Reach mechanisms and outrigger arms that straddle and support a load can be used in addition to the just the counterbalance of the truck. On a turret truck, the forks rotate during stacking, eliminating the need for the truck itself to turn in narrow aisles. An order picker allows the operator to be lifted with the load to allow for less-than-pallet-load picking. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are industrial trucks that can transport loads without requiring a human operator.|$|R

40|$|Butter {{keeping quality}} and pallet {{physical}} stability during {{transport and storage}} are dependent on the temperature distribution through the product. Understanding these temperature changes are of vital importance for the dairy industry with regard to butter manufacture, storage and shipping. Three dimensional mathematical models of heat transfer were developed to predict thawing and freezing in butter products. These models require accurate thermophysical data as an input. Specific heat capacity and enthalpy of butter with different composition was measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The specific heat capacity of butter differs for cooling and heating operations due to significant supercooling and delayed crystallization of the fat fraction of butter at temperatures well below the equilibrium phase change temperature during cooling. This reduces the heat capacity for cooling relative to that for heating. Thawing of individual blocks of butter was accurately predicted by the conduction only model (no mass transfer limitations) with equilibrium thermal properties giving accurate predictions when the butter was completely frozen before thawing. For partially frozen butter the conduction model with the measured temperature dependent specific heat capacity data for unfrozen butter including melting {{of some of the}} fat fraction gave accurate predictions. For freezing it was observed that water in the butter supercools many degrees below its initial freezing point before freezing due to its water in oil structure. Experiments suggested that during freezing release of latent heat observed as a temperature rebound is controlled as much by the rate of crystallisation of water in each of the water droplets as by the rate of heat transfer. A conduction only model including water crystallization kinetics based on the Avrami Model predicted freezing in butter successfully. Simple models with equilibrium thermal properties and nucleation only kinetics (based on homogenous nucleation theory) or the sensible heat only model (no release of latent heat) gave poor predictions. The models for individual blocks were extended to predict heat transfer in butter pallets. A butter pallet contains product, packaging material and the air entrapped between the packaging and butter cartons. Measurements were made for freezing and thawing of full and half pallets at a commercial storage facility and in the University laboratory. Thawing and freezing in wrapped tightly <b>stacked</b> <b>pallets</b> was predicted accurately by the conduction only model with effective thermal properties (incorporating butter, packaging and air) estimated by the parallel model. For unwrapped tightly stacked or loosely <b>stacked</b> <b>pallets</b> there is potential for air flow between the adjacent cartons of butter. An alternative approach was developed which consisted of modeling the pallet on block by block basis using effective heat transfer coefficients for each surface. Different heat transfer coefficients were used on different faces of the blocks depending on the location of the block in the pallet. This approach gave good predictions for both unwrapped tightly stacked and loosely <b>stacked</b> <b>pallets</b> using the estimated effective heat transfer coefficients from the measured data. Further experimental and/or modelling work is required in order to develop guidelines for estimating effective heat transfer coefficient values for internal block face for industrial scenarios...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a method, using Microsoft Excel 1, to optimise {{the placement of}} a brick-yard. Eventually, this will yield lower expenses by saving time, fuel and space. An algorithm was developed that takes all permutations of an entered schedule, consisting of a type of brick, an amount of pallets and a distribution point. All of these permutations are processed by an-other algorithm, which finds {{the distance from the}} specified distribution point to the nearest available location and <b>stacks</b> the <b>pallets</b> there, taking into account that different pallets have different dimensions and constraints. The dis-tance to be driven will decrease if multiple pal-lets are stacked on the same location. All per-mutations are compared and the smallest total distance is chosen as the optimal solution. A major improvement on the placement was ob-tained on manually deciding where to <b>stack</b> the <b>pallets.</b> However, due to computer restrictions, it is not able to function as an optimising place-ment algorithm for larger schedules. ...|$|R
