The Birds of Prey Centre now also incorporates The Northern School of Falconry and Associated Studies, which runs a number of falconry and bird handling courses.|$|E
50|$|Plant {{communities}} in the park are of high conservation value due to the occurrence of geographically significant species endemic to the island and not protected by reserves or parks elsewhere in Tasmania. Much of the park's vegetation comprises dry sclerophyll communities such as eucalypt woodland as well as heathland and coastal communities. There are also small patches of wet eucalypt forest and temperate rainforest. Common coastal plants include she-oaks and casuarinas (Allocasuarina), which have a high tolerance to salt spray and wind. The national park contains several rare, endemic orchid species including the endangered chestnut leek orchid (Prasophyllum castaneum) and the pretty leek orchid (Prasophyllum pulchellum), {{both of which are}} of high ecological significance due to their rare occurrence. These species generally occur in heathland communities which are greatly diverse and are of high conservation significance. The pretty leek orchid thrives in damp heathland and is so rare that the largest of the five known populations consists of fifty individuals. Several other heath species are classified as rare and vulnerable including the juniper wattle (Acacia ulicifolia), variable <b>smoke</b> <b>bush</b> (Conospermum hookeri), and the yellow onion orchid (Microtis atrata).|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{practice}} of food prohibition or food taboo has existed {{among the various}} local indigenous sects {{of the world for}} several generations. Such practices are usually attached to some myths or beliefs among the practicing population. The myths or beliefs are passed from generation to generation by means of stories, folklores, legends and even religious practices. The Urhobo people are found in the Southern part of Nigeria and they are found in a region that is surrounded by an evergreen forest. The people enjoy a lot of unique delicacies such as “Ukhodo ” (yam and unripe plantain dish), starch meals, banga soup (from palm kernel), and oghwevwri soup (made with dried or <b>smoked</b> fish, <b>bush</b> meat, unique spices and oil palm). But then, the people practice some food prohibition with various reason attached to these acts that have various health implications for the local population...|$|R
40|$|In {{this note}} the authors report {{the first case}} of naturalization of the Malagasy <b>smoke</b> <b>bush</b> within Italian territory. Along with a {{description}} of the abiotic and biotic characteristics of the invaded site, the current demographic and dynamic trends of the detected population by means of growth-ring analysis was also assessed. Moreover, an overview on the history of its introduction in Europe is provided, underlining the key role played by the Mediterranean cities with respect to the acclimatization and spread of alien tropical and subtropical plants. Due to its low frequency under cultivation, the Malagasy <b>smoke</b> <b>bush</b> should not behave as an invader in the future; on the other hand, its ability to cover and smother neighbouring trees in very short times, make its spread within the whole Mediterranean area worth regular monitoring...|$|E
60|$|Had Braddock {{been a man}} of {{judgment}} and temper, {{the fortunes of the}} day might yet have been retrieved, for the Virginians could have checked the Indians until the English troops were rallied and prepared to meet the difficulty; but, to Braddock, the idea of men fighting behind trees was at once cowardly and opposed to all military discipline, and he dashed forward on his horse, and with fierce oaths ordered the Virginians to form line. A body of them, however, under Captain Waggoner, made a dash for a huge fallen tree, far out towards the lurking places of the Indians, and, crouching behind it, opened fire upon them; but the regulars, seeing the <b>smoke</b> among the <b>bushes,</b> took them for the enemy and, firing, killed many and forced the rest to return.|$|R
60|$|For a {{time all}} was silent. Presently Wilfrid's rifle spoke out, and a yell {{testified to the}} fact that the quick aim he had taken at a dark figure {{stealing}} among the bushes had been true. It was followed quickly by a general discharge of their pieces by the natives. The bullets rattled thickly against the rock, and cut leaves from the bushes behind which Wilfrid was lying, but he had drawn himself back a foot or two the moment he fired, and the balls passed harmlessly over him. Not so the missive despatched by Mr. Atherton in the direction of a puff of <b>smoke</b> from a <b>bush</b> some forty yards away, for the figure behind it remained still and immovable while the fray went on. For upwards of an hour the exchange of shots continued, and then the assailants were joined by fifteen other natives, who had been attracted to the spot by the sound of firing.|$|R
5000|$|A desert {{planet with}} no natural precipitation, in Dune it is {{established}} that Arrakis had been [...] "His Imperial Majesty's Desert Botanical Testing Station" [...] before {{the discovery of}} melange, {{for which it is}} the only natural source in the universe. Melange (or, [...] "the spice") is the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe, as it extends life and makes safe interstellar travel possible (among other uses). The planet has no surface water bodies, but open canals called qanats are used [...] "for carrying irrigation water under controlled conditions" [...] through the desert. The Fremen collect water in underground reservoirs to fulfill their dream of someday terraforming the planet, and pay the Spacing Guild exorbitant fees in melange to keep the skies over Arrakis free of any satellites which might observe their efforts. As indicated by its large salt flats, Arrakis once had lakes and oceans; Lady Jessica also notes in Dune that wells drilled in the sinks and basins initially produce a [...] "trickle" [...] of water which soon stops, as if [...] "something plugs it."Paul Atreides recalls that the few plants and animals on the planet include [...] "saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense <b>bush,</b> <b>smoke</b> tree, creosote <b>bush</b> ... kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse ... many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis."

This was a wet planet then. They proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them. Sandtrout encysted the available free water, made this a desert planet ... and they did it to survive. In a planet sufficiently dry, they could move to their sandworm phase.|$|R
6000|$|He {{afterwards}} fancied that {{he spent}} most of the day crawling between the fire and the thicket, but was never very sure of anything he did just then. Nor did he feel hungry, though now and then he clawed up and sucked a handful of snow, but he remembered that he was lying in the <b>smoke</b> when the <b>bush</b> grew dimmer and the red blaze more brilliant as darkness crept down. Presently he fancied that something broke through the monotone of the river, and after listening to it vacantly groped for the rifle. He clutched it, and raising himself a trifle with difficulty, blinked at the darkness that hemmed in the fire until footsteps came out of it. They were not furtive, but apparently those of somebody coming straight towards the light in haste.

500|$|Initially the Australians {{had used}} their APCs {{to secure the}} landing zone at the jungle's edge, however with the {{infantry}} in trouble they were subsequently dispatched as a relief force. Three M113s from 2 Troop under Sergeant Frank Graham entered the rainforest shortly after 17:15; however, lacking clear directions to B Company's position [...] away, they fumbled around in the dense vegetation before locating A Company instead. Instructed by Mackay {{to head for the}} white <b>smoke</b> of the <b>bush</b> fire, in error the APCs then set out towards the most obvious smoke further to the south-east of B Company. A Viet Cong 75mm recoilless rifle subsequently engaged the lead vehicle twice at close range, though both rounds missed, exploding in the trees nearby. Still unsure of B Company's location, Graham was unwilling to engage the Viet Cong position with heavy machine-guns for fear of hitting his own men, and the cavalry subsequently withdrew. Later it was discovered that the cavalry had likely been engaged by elements defending the Viet Cong headquarters. Meanwhile, due to the threat posed by the Viet Cong anti-tank weapons the remainder of 2 Troop then arrived under the command Second Lieutenant David Watts to provide added protection; in total 12 vehicles. A further attempt to reach B Company by the cavalry also failed however, after the A Company guide became disorientated in the thick vegetation. Mackay then threw coloured smoke, while Sioux helicopters arrived overhead to guide the vehicles to their position. B Company's casualties now amounted to seven men killed and 19 wounded.|$|R
