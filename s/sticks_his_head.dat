25|$|Both the {{temperature}} and the moisture content of the mound are critical to the survival {{and development of the}} eggs, so both are carefully regulated for {{the entire length of the}} breeding season (which may last for as long as eight months), principally by the male. Ornithologists believe that megapodes may use sensitive areas in their mouths to assess mound temperatures; each day during the breeding season, the male digs a pit into his mound and <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in. If the mound's core temperature is a bit low, he adds fresh moist material to the mound, and stirs it in; if it is too high, he opens the top of the mound to allow some of the excess heat to escape. This regular monitoring also keeps the mound's material from becoming compacted, which would inhibit oxygen diffusion to the eggs and make it more difficult for the chicks to emerge after hatching. The malleefowl, which lives in more open forest than do other megapodes, uses the sun to help warm its nest as wellâ€”opening the mound at midday during the cool spring and autumn months to expose the plentiful sand incorporated into the nest to the sun's warming rays, then using that warm sand to insulate the eggs during the cold nights. During hot summer months, the malleefowl opens its nest mound only in the cool early morning hours, allowing excess heat to escape before recovering the mound completely. One recent study showed that the sex ratio of Australian brushturkey hatchlings correlated strongly with mound temperatures; females hatched from eggs incubated at higher mean temperatures.|$|E
500|$|During his {{coaching}} career, Rymkus was renowned for his strictness. While with the Oilers, he repeatedly threatened to whip his players. He {{could also be}} melodramatic. He once repeated a speech Leahy gave at Notre Dame before a practice in a blizzard. He told his players during a hot August in Houston to be [...] "like the Great Northern Buffalo, whose coat is shaggy and whose muscles are strong. The Great Northern Buffalo <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the wind and braves the cold, not like the puny Southern Buffalo, who turns {{his back to the}} storm." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the maid}} moves about {{there is a}} loud knock at the {{cardboard}} door of the apartment. A man in official clothes <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in. He is evidently a postal special messenger because he is all in postal attire with a postal glazed hat.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes, when attacked, Unk Wunk {{covers his}} face with this weapon. More often he <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> under a root or into a hollow log, leaving his tail out ready for action. At the first touch of his enemy the tail snaps right and left quicker than thought, driving the hostile head and sides full of the deadly quills, from {{which there is no}} escape; for every effort, every rub and writhe of pain, only drives them deeper and deeper, till they rest in heart or brain and finish their work.|$|E
60|$|Th' Ascidian tadpole, {{young and}} gay, Doth Life with one bright eye survey, His {{consciousness}} has easy play. He's sensitive to grief and pain, Has tail, and spine, and bears a brain, And everything that fits the state Of creatures we call vertebrate. But age comes on; with sudden shock He <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> against a rock! His tail drops off, his eye drops in, His brain's absorbed into his skin; He does not move, nor feel, nor know The tidal water's ebb and flow, But still abides, unstirred, alone, A sucker sticking to a stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} could have been wrong with her health. She had a {{beautiful}} colour, and a deuce of a lot of fair hair. She didn't care a rap for wind, or rain, or spray, or sun, or green seas, or anything. She was a blue-eyed, jolly girl of the very best sort, but the way she cheeked my big brother used to frighten me. I always expected it to end in an awful row. However, nothing decisive happened till after we had been in Sydney for a week. One day, in the men's dinner hour, Charley <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into my cabin. I was stretched out on my back on the settee, smoking in peace.|$|E

5000|$|Dr Taylor added, [...] "He's shown {{all of us}} that Islam is {{interesting}} enough to be taken seriously. He's refused to <b>stick</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in the sand and play blind about the problems or internal tensions that all thinking Muslims know are there." ...|$|R

Morgan's cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out the window. Me! Well, I'm in trainin' down the Street. The old man's goin' to put a seat on the Stock Exchange in my stockin' my next birthday. But it all sounds like a lemon to me. What I like is golf and yachtin' and--er--well, say a corkin' fast ten-round bout between welter-weights with walkin' gloves." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{could hear}} her {{pounding}} along, but we didn't see her good till she was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we {{said she was going}} to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.|$|E

5000|$|Foghorn changes {{tactics and}} tries to bribe the dog to be Banty's {{sparring}} partner, but {{it is really a}} ruse to torment the dog again. The dog then tells Banty that he cannot spar with him but promises to find him another partner.

Foghorn falls for the scheme and <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in the trunk but nothing is there except a small hole above him. Foghorn muses that the hole is some kind of [...] "peep show" [...] and <b>sticks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> inside, but the dog has set up a miniature boxing ring on top of the tree trunk where Banty is ready to spar, and thanks to the dog's scheme Banty has the perfect-sized partnerâ€”Foghorn's head.|$|E
