40|$|Travelling Waves (TWs) are {{electro-magnetic}} transients {{that are}} generated {{when there is}} a sudden change of voltage in the network, such as when a fault occurs. Fault locators based on TWs have recently emerged as an alternative to typical impedance fault locators thanks to their higher precision in most cases. The development of new algorithms based on TWs is improved by the understanding of their behaviors, in particular with the analysis of high frequency records of faults. Such records are not readily available. We performed a measurement campaign in the Belgian transmission network to acquire records of TWs generated when faults occur. This paper reports the experience acquired during the campaign, and discusses fault location algorithm improvements to account for the unique topology of the monitored line. The algorithm improvement reduces the error caused for non-homogeneous lines, which can be significant for big lines. The records analysis showed three important factors that influence the shape of the recorded TWs: the discontinuity in the line caused by a T-junction, the bandwidth of the measurement transformers, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>cables</b> connected to the current transformers. Therefore, those effects should be carefully considered when developing new algorithms based on TWs. info:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R

This paper studies current travelling wave transmission characteristics in <b>secondary</b> control <b>cable</b> based on Alternative Transient Program (ATP). Valuable transmission characteristics of control cable have been got from the simulation results: current travelling waves which pass the control cable will be distorted and some interfering current travelling waves will be generated; duration of interfering current travelling waves depends on the length of the control cable; the original fault generated current travelling wave wave-front is delayed and smoothed by the control cable; magnitude of fault generated current travelling wave wave-front has been varied by the control cable. And these transmission characteristic of control cable provide useful references to the protection algorithms based on fault generated current travelling waves...|$|R

30|$|Concerning the {{substations}} adopting EM type {{instrument transformers}} and <b>secondary</b> <b>cable</b> wiring, the transformer of current (TA) <b>secondary</b> <b>cable</b> is relatively {{long and the}} secondary load is heavy, which will easily induce saturation. Long <b>secondary</b> <b>cable,</b> large distribution area, complicated routes, large capacitance to ground, and serious interference and insulation problems bring about high fault probability in electrical secondary circuits, thus affecting the system reliability, in addition, the design, construction, debugging, maintenance, examination and repair, and reconstruction and expansion of the secondary circuit of traditional substations involve {{a large amount of}} work.|$|E
30|$|The {{current and}} voltage signals on the {{secondary}} side of electromagnetic instrument transformers are {{transferred to the}} protection device through the <b>secondary</b> <b>cable.</b> Accordingly, the increase of the secondary equipment requires an increasing of <b>secondary</b> <b>cable</b> for connecting instrument transformer. The interlocking and blocking signals between secondary equipments, and the commands and signals between protection and circuit breaker are also transferred in one-to-one characteristics through <b>secondary</b> <b>cable</b> wiring. The relay protections and secondary circuits are configured according to bays. Each bay is naturally and physically independent, {{so that it is}} relatively easy to realize the isolation of faulty secondary equipment and circuits, hence the system will have relatively high reliability. On the other hand, it is relatively difficult to realize information intercommunication among all bays, repeated utilization of current and voltage quantities, interlocking and blocking information, as well as operation information. In order to realize the protection functions using multi-bay information, many secondary cables shall be added, thus the implementation is relatively difficult, which will restrict the functional improvement, optimization and supplementation of existing protection system.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} wind {{sensitive}} structures {{must take into}} account many sources of uncertainty related to: (a) the basic environmental parameters that describe the wind field at the site, like mean wind velocity, turbulence intensity, wind direction, etc.; (b) the structural and mechanical properties, like stiffness and damping; (c) the parameters that influence the interaction phenomena (aerodynamic coefficients, flutter derivates, Strohual number, etc.). Roughly, three categories of uncertainty can be distinguished: the aleatoric uncertainty, related to the natural variability of the parameters and their unpredictability; the epistemic uncertainty related both to the lack of information and to the errors of experimental measures; the model uncertainty related to the choice of the models of wind action, structural response and interaction phenomena. In this paper, specific reference is made to the optimal design of a long span suspension bridge: the effects of the three types of uncertainty on the Aeolian risk assessment of the bridge are evaluated. The attention is focused on the minimum information needed to characterize satisfactorily the wind field, since the data available today (essentially, turbulence spectra and maps of expected wind speeds) are rather limited. The influence of model uncertainty is investigated with reference to buffeting, by implementing in time domain different formulations of the aeroelastic forces. The relevance of epistemic uncertainty is investigated in evaluating the flutter instability, by a parametric analysis that assumes different values of the aerodynamic coefficients. Finally, the relevance of aleatoric uncertainty that characterize the mean wind velocity is considered in assessing the fatigue life of the <b>secondary</b> suspension <b>cable</b> system under buffeting effects. The final aim of these studies is the development of procedures for Performance-Based Wind Engineering...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} of criminal enforcement of digital copyrights. I argue that an international prohibition regime to govern intellectual property rights (IPR) has emerged through systems {{of international trade and}} law enforcement. The regime, or international system of norms and decision-making procedures, is supported primarily by the United States, the European Union, and multinational intellectual property industries, and these stakeholders are consistently creating measures to strengthen intellectual property (IP) enforcement to include criminal sanctions. The question guiding the research is how the governance of IP enforcement through the international prohibition regime affects the legitimacy of intellectual property law enforcement. I engage the research question through case study analysis that adopts a critical legal methodology and relevant stakeholder analysis. The case studies occur in the European Union, where the standardization of copyright among member states takes place to strengthen the European Union?s common market. I conduct the case research through a critical legal analysis of policy documents, court cases, diplomatic <b>cables,</b> <b>secondary</b> sources and previous research on the cases. The two cases include the international police raid of the file sharing website OiNK?s Pink Palace and the formation of and protest against Spain?s Ley Sinde, a law created under U. S. pressures to strengthen Spanish copyrights. Two major findings are revealed: First, despite the difficulty of establishing digital copyright laws that legitimize criminal enforcement, police agencies are increasingly involved in the governance of intellectual property; second, the legitimacy of IP policy is contested by political actors when governance occurs through the mechanisms of a global prohibition regime. As a result of these conclusions, I recommend that Access to Knowledge (A 2 K) advocates and policy proposals confront the expansion of police enforcement of digital copyrights, and recommend further study into the phenomenon of criminal enforcement of copyright...|$|R

40|$|PP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{synthetic}} textiles. It is a synthetic polymer for the production of textile products. It is widely used because of its cheap production expenditures, universal utilization, easy recycling, and good mechanical features. In addition, polypropylene is flexible and firm, but in a low temperature it can become very fragile. Polypropylene is not resistant to aging – features deteriorate, it decomposes from light exposure, dampness, and warmth. 	PP materials are commonly used in various spheres: agriculture, chemistry, food industry, manufacturing, and others that may require firm and reliable packaging; initial and secondary carpet production, <b>secondary</b> fabrics, geotextile, <b>cable</b> and rope production. Thanks to their durability, light weight and usage simplicity, they are popularly used for pre-packing and transporting such goods as: flour, sugar, composite forage, grains and seeds, fertilizer, manufacturing materials, wood granules, second-hand clothes, cement. 	Three different drawing ratio (A- 6, 002, B- 6, 502, and C- 6, 869) polypropylene tape yarn were used for the research. In the centre of the analysis is tape yarn drawing ratios influence on their structure and stretch characteristics. The width, thickness and weight of PP tape yarn was measured, additionally, the statistical calculations were made: calculation of mean, absolute error, relative error, and variation coefficient. The stretch test was carried out until the absolute yarn breakage. Experimental results were analyzed in detail. After the analysis of PP tape yarn, it was concluded, that the yarn and product weight, as well as the strength features, were dependant on the drawing ratio. 	The features of textile products that were made from polypropylene (affected by mechanical forces and environmental factors) get worse, the elasticity contracts, the level of fragility and breakage rises, rigidity appears. Because of these factors, products tend to lose firmness, and there is a higher chance of cracking and tearing. 	To achieve precision, three different drawing ratios were used for the polypropylene tape yarn strength feature test. Tests showed that on the lowest drawing ration (A- 6, 002), polypropylene tape yarn is the thickest, widest, heaviest, and has the biggest height density, but from the perspective of consumption, it is a big flaw. The conducted conclusion is that for consumption purposes it is best to use the biggest drawing ratio yarn (C- 6, 869). 	The achieved results are important from the scientific and economical perspective: we can predict the economically significant indicators, and reach an objective that the usage of products made out of polypropylene yarn would be even more diverse, and the mean of production- more economical...|$|R
