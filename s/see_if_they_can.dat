The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. The Voice is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to American Idol, the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include The X Factor, America's Got Talent, Rising Star and The Sing-Off.|$|E

The characteristic vascular pattern of this tumor hasn’t been established. We found a scarcely reported vas-cular pattern, which can be useful to distinguish this tumor from malignant ones and propose a new nomenclature to these vessels due their similarity with the common calla flower and cherry blossoms tree. Observations: We study 10 proven Mexican cases of eccrine poroma and nearly half of them presented irregu-lar linear and branched vessels with semi-elliptical, circu-lar or semicircular endings, we called them “chalice-form” and “cherry-blossoms ” vessels. The structureless pink-white areas were the most common finding and some vascular pat-terns reported in other studies were barely found.

40|$|Efficient {{thermoelectric}} materials should present large Seebeck coefficient, high {{electrical conductivity}} and low thermal conductivity. An enhanced Seebeck coefficient {{can be obtained}} from materials where the Fermi level can be aligned with a large and narrow peak of the density of states, particularly when a substantial band valley degeneracy occurs. A high electrical conductivity comes as a consequence of large conductive hopping paths between the atoms of the material. Both physical quantities can be decoupled and optimized independently if their origins can be ascribed to different sets of bands. Based on these assumptions, double perovskites A$_ 2 $BB'O$_ 6 $ with $d^ 0 /d^ 6 $ filling for the B and B' metal cations, respectively, have been considered. They provide a desirable band structure with degenerate B-$t_{ 2 g}$ / B'-$e_g$ bands above the Fermi level together with a low thermal conductivity. We have carried out first-principles simulations for various of these nonmagnetic double perovskites and showed that all of them present a large Seebeck coefficient (consequence of the localized and empty $t_{ 2 g}$ states of the B-cation), and large electrical conductivity due to the more spread unoccupied $e_{g}$ band of the B' cation. We have <b>seen</b> that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be optimally doped, they could show a figure of merit comparable or even higher than the best $n$-type thermoelectric oxides, such as SrTiO$_{ 3 }$. Different mechanisms to tune the band structure and enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit are explored, including epitaxial strain, hydrostatic pressure, chemical pressure, and external doping. A fully relaxed structure has also been studied, showing that a realistic calculation is necessary to make accurate predictions, but also proving that the main trends shown throughout the paper remain unchanged.

In this paper we present a study of linear and persistent processes wrt to the kind of system <b>they</b> <b>can</b> model. We choose π-calculus, perhaps the main representative of process calculi, as a framework to conduct our study. We consider four fragments of the π-calculus, each one focusing on a fundamental aspect of calculi found in the literature. The first one is fragment of the asynchronous π-calculus fragment πA. The second is the persistent-output π fragment, denoted by π!O, which is like πA except that all outputs are replicated. The persistent-input π!I is defined analogously but with all inputs replicated. Finally, persistent π, denoted by π!, is πA but with both inputs and outputs replicated. We shall provide translations from πA into π!O and π!I capturing the behaviour of πA processes with π!O and π!I ones, respectively. Furthermore, we show that, under some reasonable conditions, there cannot be such a translation from πA into π!. Our results say that with one source of linearity (i. e., either senders or receivers) we can simulate the behaviour of πA processes, but this is no longer possible in the absence of both linear senders and linear receivers. ...|$|R

Wavelets allow for an adaptively smoothed solution: smoothed more in uninteresting regions, less at geologically important transitions. (cont.) A third issue is also addressed, somewhat separate from the first two: the correct manipulation of discrete geophysical data. The theory of fractional splines is introduced, which allows for optimal approximation of real signals on a digital computer. Using splines, it can be shown that a linear operation on the spline can be equivalently represented by a matrix operating on the coefficients of a certain spline basis function. The form of the matrix, however, depends completely on the spline basis, and incorrect discretization of the operator into a matrix can lead to large errors in the resulting matrix/vector product. by Jonathan A.

He is {{referring}} to his now lost treatise, On the Art of War, and stamping his authority and expertise on the subject as he embarks on a sequel. But thereafter in his Strategemata, a collection of examples of successful military strategy which he claims was designed to complement and complete the De Re Militari, Frontinus absents himself from the bulk of the text, refusing to act as an internal commentator or authoritative guide (in the style, for example, of Valerius Maximus, with whom Frontinus invites comparison). In so doing, he cedes authority (at least temporarily) to the material he presents, to the generals who fill his pages and the ‘wisdom’ which their deeds embody; he claims credit merely as a compiler of their stratagems, as the facilitator who is making their expertise available to others. This manoeuvre promotes the idea that one merely has to read to learn (and, in due course, do); but the reading and learning experience which this text offers proves significantly more challenging than that. In fact, the text seems to problematize the act of learning-from-reading right from the start. Its opening section exposes the trickiness of texts, serving up a series of exempla which teach aspiring generals not to believe all that they read. They will also search in vain for a stratagem which was inspired by a book; instead, they will be bombarded with example after example of native cunning, innate wisdom and natural intelligence. And the array and (carefully ordered, but also subtly disorientating) arrangement of exempla in the Strategemata, and the emphasis which the whole collection places on spontaneity and surprise, threaten to undermine not just this but other military treatises, in particular theoretical works which set out hard and fast rules for engagement. For if this ‘handbook’ teaches readers anything, it teaches them that no book – no matter how many theories or exempla it may contain – can prepare a general for every eventuality: generalship is not exactly a science. This text, in other words, toys not only with its author’s but also with its own authority, and with the authority of other such works (including Frontinus’ own De Re Militari), by raising questions about the nature and transferability of military ‘expertise’. The twist in the tale is that Frontinus turns up within the Strategemata as an exemplum himself – twice – acquiring authority as a doer not (just) as a writer. His own journey from deed to book makes the challenge he has set his readers – to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>can</b> make that leap, but the other way around – all the more pressing. In exploring these themes, this chapter will investigate textual and authorial authority in the exempla tradition more widely; the currency and exchange of different kinds of knowledge/learning in the military sphere; and the political (Domitianic) context, which (I will argue, via comparison with other texts) may have influenced the ways in which Frontinus presents his own – and other commanders’ – expertise and authority.
