25|$|Chloramine can {{be removed}} from tap water by {{treatment}} with <b>superchlorination</b> (10ppm or more of free chlorine, such as from a dose of sodium hypochlorite bleach or pool sanitizer) while maintaining a pH of about 7 (such as from a dose of hydrochloric acid). Hypochlorous acid from the free chlorine strips the ammonia from the chloramine, and the ammonia outgasses {{from the surface of}} the bulk water. This process takes about 24 hours for normal tap water concentrations of a few ppm of chloramine. Residual free chlorine can then be removed by exposure to bright sunlight for about 4 hours.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is used to}} dechlorinate {{tap water}} {{including}} lowering chlorine levels for use in aquaria and swimming pools and spas (e.g., following <b>superchlorination)</b> and within water treatment plants to treat settled backwash water prior to release into rivers.

50|$|Bartow saw {{service in}} World War I with the Sanitary Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces from 1917 to 1918. He was {{originally}} commissioned {{as a major}} and was promoted to lieutenant colonel {{before the end of}} his service. He directed the work of 80 officers and enlisted men who were responsible for providing safe drinking water and proper sanitation for U.S. forces. He devised a system of <b>superchlorination</b> of Seine River water followed by dechlorination with sulfur dioxide. In addition, he established a system of eleven analytical laboratories and several mobile units to keep the quality of drinking water for service men under control. He received the Medaille d'Honneur des Epidemies d’Argent from the French government for his work preventing serious disease outbreaks.|$|E
5000|$|Shock {{chlorination}} is {{a process}} used in many swimming pools, water wells, springs, and other water sources to reduce the bacterial and algal residue in the water. Shock chlorination is performed by mixing {{a large amount of}} sodium hypochlorite, which can be {{in the form of a}} powder or a liquid such as chlorine bleach, into the water. Water that is being shock chlorinated should not be swum in or drunk until the sodium hypochlorite count in the water goes down to three ppm or less. Commercial sodium hypochlorite should not be mixed with commercial calcium hypochlorite, as there is a risk of explosion. Although a verb for <b>superchlorination,</b> [...] "shock" [...] is often misunderstood (through marketing and sales language) to be a unique type of product.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorine {{reacting}} with urea in {{urine and}} other nitrogen-containing wastes from bathers can produce chloramines. Chloramines typically occur when an insufficient amount of chlorine {{is used to}} disinfect a contaminated pool. Chloramines are generally responsible for the noxious, irritating smell prominently occurring in indoor pool settings. A common way to remove chloramines is to [...] "superchlorinate" [...] (commonly called [...] "shocking") the pool with a high dose of inorganic chlorine sufficient to deliver 10 ppm chlorine. Regular <b>superchlorination</b> (every two weeks in summer) helps to eliminate these unpleasant odors in the pool. Levels of chloramines and other volatile compounds in water can be minimized by reducing contaminants that lead to their formation (e.g., urea, creatinine, amino acids and personal care products) {{as well as by}} use of non-chlorine [...] "shock oxidizers" [...] such as potassium peroxymonosulfate.|$|E
30|$|The torch of the {{scientific}} quest along with the traditional technologies has now been {{handed over to the}} nanotechnologists of the twenty-first century, to whom a major challenge is to transform this into the field. Nanotechnology refers to technologies involving particles on the approximate size scale of a few to hundreds of nanometers in diameter. The elevated surface area to mass ratio, a common characteristic of nanoparticles, makes it promising. In terms of applicability, three approaches are there, viz. individual nanoparticles (Watlungton 2005), binding the nanoparticles to a powder/granule form and nanoparticles onto membranes/polymers. As individual zero valent iron particles (Can-Bao and Zhang 1997), palladium-coated iron particles and palladium-coated gold nanoparticles (Michael et al. 2005) are very promising in terms of permeable reactive barriers and photocatalysts. The nanoscopic materials such as carbon nanotubes and alumina fibers embedded in zeolite filtration membranes (Valli et al. 2010), TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 membranes (Zhang et al. 2006), carbon nanotubes, wrapped around a carbon block filter structure (Cooper et al. 2007) have the capacity to remove the impurities from water. Nanoreactive membranes are able to decompose pollutants such as 4 -nitrophenol (Dotzauer et al. 2006) and bind metal ions (Hollman and Bhattacharya 2004) in water solution. Polysulfone membranes impregnated with silver nanoparticles are found to be effective in bacteria and virus removal (Zodrow et al. 2009). <b>Superchlorination</b> is another advanced technique to get clean and disinfected water. It signifies that extra dose of chlorine oxidize organics kill and remove algae and pathogens from the water within the short-contact time. HOCl is the active chemical that provides sanitation as well as shows reactivity towards organic pollutants. When there is sufficient HOCl, the pollutants are easily oxidized. But in case of low level of HOCl compared to organic pollutants combined chlorine is formed. These combined chlorine compounds can be oxidized by increasing the level of HOCl level in water. The point at which all the organic impurities are oxidized is called the break point (Bahadori et al. 2013). To avoid the flaws (viz. corrosion, bleaching of hair and skin, foul smelling), sometimes <b>superchlorination</b> followed by dechlorination is necessary before the use of water. <b>Superchlorination</b> is practiced after the sunset as there are no possibilities to react with UV-rays from the sun.|$|E
40|$|Environmental Health {{of reports}} of illness among family members from four {{families}} who stayed {{at a hotel}} in Freeport August 9 through 11, 2002. Thirty-one of 36 individuals reported high fever, headache, and muscle aches. Based on preliminary findings, exposure to the swimming pool, spa, and the swimming pool/spa enclosure were found to be common among the ill guests. The hotel voluntarily closed the swimming and spa facilities pending further investigation by SCHD, the Department’s regional environmental health staff and the Rapid Response Team. On August 14, 2002, Department staff initiated an environmental investigation of the hotel. Several 100 ml water samples were taken, including spa filter backwash water taken prior to <b>superchlorination...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa was {{isolated}} from seven commercial and two residential whirlpools that {{were treated with}} halogens. None of the commercial whirlpools was constantly maintained at appropriate disinfection levels. <b>Superchlorination</b> or the draining, cleaning, disinfection, and refilling of whirlpools markedly reduced densities of P. aeruginosa in whirlpool water, but the bacterial populations were rapidly reestablished (less than 10 (3) cells per ml) when disinfectant concentrations decreased below recommended levels (chlorine, 3. 0 ppm [3. 0 micrograms/ml]; bromine, 6. 0 ppm). P. aeruginosa in the water was replenished from various sources, such as hoses used to fill the whirlpool and the biofilm in the filter and piping of the whirlpool systems. Daily monitoring and adjustment of chemical characteristics (regardless of bather load) were essential for controlling densities of P. aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|Resistance of {{pathogenic}} Naegleria to drying, low {{and high}} temperature, and two halogens was studied. Dying made trophozoites nonviable instantaneously and cysts nonviable in less than 5 min. Trophozoites degenerated in hours at temperatures below 10 degrees C and in minutes when frozen; cysts survived according to the equation th - t 0 /theta 1, 440 / 1. 122 T (t 0 is survival at 0 degrees C; Tis temperature between 0 and 10 degrees C), but 1. 5 h at [...] 10 degrees C to 1 h at [...] 30 degrees C. At 51, 55, 58, 63, and 65 degrees C, trophozoites survived about 30, 10, 5, 1 and less than 0. 5 min, respectively, cysts survived {{three to four times}} longer at 51 degrees C and six to seven times longer at 55 to 65 degrees C. Cyst destruction rates by heat indicated first-order kinetics with 25, 400 cal/ 1 degree C for energy of activation. Cyst destruction rates by free chlorine and I 2 also conformed to first-order kinetics. Concentration-contact time curves yielded concentration coefficient values of 1. 05 for free chlorine and 1. 4 for I 2 and point to <b>superchlorination</b> as an effective means of destroying the cysts if free residuals are used as a guide and allowance is provided for low temperature and/or high pH waters...|$|E
