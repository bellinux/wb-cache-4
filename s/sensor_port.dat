SpaceX has initiated and funded a multimillion-dollar reusable launch system development program to pursue this objective. As part of this program, SpaceX built, and flew eight times in 2012-2013, a first-generation booster-test-vehicle with a large fixed landing gear {{in order to test}} low-altitude vehicle dynamics and control for vertical landings of a near-empty orbital first stage. [...] A second-generation larger booster test vehicle was built with extensible landing gear.

The Engine E 10001 began hot fire testing in June 2011 and testing will continue with subsequent engines. The J - 2 X engine main combustion chamber contains both acoustic cavities and baffles. These stability aids are intended to dampen the acoustics in the main combustion chamber. Verification of the engine thrust chamber stability is determined primarily by examining experimental data using a dynamic stability rating technique; however, additional requirements were included to guard against any spontaneous instability or rough combustion. Startup and shutdown chug oscillations are also characterized for this engine.

40|$|A new {{hardware}} abstraction layer {{was created}} for the EV 3. This includes drivers for UART, timers, interrupt controller, SPI and I 2 C peripherals. This was documented using Doxygen; an in-code documenting tool. Doxygen was used to create an off-line reference manual for the abstraction layer as a PDF (generated with LaTeX). Using the new drivers for the timer and interrupt controller, FreeRTOS was implemented on the EV 3 using the timer interrupt as an RTOS tick interrupt for the FreeRTOS scheduler. A new port file for the RTOS was created that {{is compatible with the}} Texas Instruments AM 1808 MCU in the EV 3, and Doxygen was then configured to extract the FreeRTOS code structure such that the RTOS layer interface documentation was added to the reference manual. The robot was built using a previously built AVR-based robot as a reference. EV 3 Large Servo Motors were used for wheel movement and to control the sensor tower. Given the remaining <b>sensor</b> <b>ports</b> on the EV 3 only fits four sensors and there is no access to the GPIO pins in the AM 1808 in the EV 3 directly, there is not enough room for the remaining sensors to be implemented on the robot without an additional hardware card to interface with the sensors. The sensors needed for the SLAM application are four IR sensors, one gyro, one electronic compass and a BLE dongle. Plans were made to use a card developed for a similar problem on a Lego NXT robot, but due to time constraints, the card was not produced in this thesis. Finally, the application was ported to the EV 3 and with FreeRTOS running almost no changes to the code was needed to get implemented, only a few minor EV 3 specific hardware calls to the motors needed to be changed...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) Venturi sensor {{is being}} developed as a compact, rugged means of measuring wind vectors having magnitudes {{of as much as}} 300 mph (134 m/s). This sensor also incorporates auxiliary sensors for measuring temperature from - 40 to + 120 F (- 40 to + 49 C), relative humidity from 0 to 100 percent, and atmospheric pressure from 846 to 1, 084 millibar (85 to 108 kPa). Conventional cup-and-vane anemometers are highly susceptible to damage by both high wind forces and debris, due to their moving parts and large profiles. In addition, they exhibit slow recovery times contributing to an inaccurately high average-speed reading. Ultrasonic and hot-wire anemometers overcome some of the disadvantages of the cup and-vane anemometers, but they have other disadvantageous features, including limited dynamic range and susceptibility to errors caused by external acoustic noise and rain. In contrast, the novel 3 D Venturi sensor is less vulnerable to wind damage because of its smaller profile and ruggedness. Since the sensor has no moving parts, it provides increased reliability and lower maintenance costs. It has faster response and recovery times to changing wind conditions than traditional systems. In addition, it offers wide dynamic range and is expected to be relatively insensitive to rain and acoustic energy. The Venturi effect in this sensor is achieved by the mirrored double-inflection curve, which is then rotated 360 to create the desired detection surfaces. The curve is optimized to provide a good balance of pressure difference between <b>sensor</b> <b>ports</b> and overall maximum fluid velocity while in the shape. Four posts are used to separate the two shapes, and their size and location were chosen to minimize effects on the pressure measurements. The 3 D Venturi sensor has smart software algorithms to map the wind pressure exerted on the surfaces of the design. Using Bernoulli's equation, the speed of the wind is calculated from the differences among the pressure readings at the various ports. The direction of the wind is calculated from the spatial distribution and magnitude of the pressure readings. All of the pressure port sizes and locations have been optimized to minimize measurement errors and to reside in areas demonstrating a stable pressure reading proportional to the velocity range...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Low-cost {{weighing}} lysimeters {{have been}} demonstrated with accuracies better than 0. 1 mm. However, these low-cost lysimeters lack full-time vacuum drainage systems; and they lack access to the lysimeter tank for installation and maintenance of a vacuum system. Without frequent manual drainage, such lysimeters can become waterlogged. We designed, implemented, and characterized the performance of an automatic vacuum drainage system that {{can be added to}} a low-cost lysimeter externally (provided that drainage filters were installed in the lysimeter and plumbed to the outside). The system consists of a buried vertical cylindrical vacuum chamber, inside of which a drainage collection tank is suspended from a load cell.

40|$|Gravitational waves (GW) are {{propagated}} perturbations of the space-time geometry, {{and they}} show up locally as tides, i. e., local gravity gradients which vary with time.
