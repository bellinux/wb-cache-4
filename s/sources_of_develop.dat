Without a separate study, it cannot be known how great a difference there would be to the figures that would be gathered from industrial processes in developing countries. The level of manual work is supposedly higher, but the implementation of environmentally friendly manufacturing technologies is presumably lower. Therefore, in this study, it has been assumed that the positive environmental gains from manual work are offset by the emissions of less environmentally friendly industrial processes.|$|R

To seek candidate compounds that inhibit the growth of liver cancer, components of Chloranthus serratus were tested. Here, we report that shizukaol D, a dimeric sesquiterpene from Chloranthus serratus, exerted a growth inhibition effect on liver cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We demonstrated that shizukaol D induced cells to undergo apoptosis. More importantly, shizukaol D attenuated Wnt signalling and reduced the expression of endogenous Wnt target genes, which resulted in decreased expression of β-catenin. Collectively, this study demonstrated that shizukaol D inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells by modulating Wnt pathway...|$|R

30|$|Eccentrically loaded {{reinforced}} concrete columns are commonly exist in practice {{due to the}} existence of some bending moments. The eccentricity of the supported beams as well as the unavoidable imperfections of construction are the main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> the <b>developed</b> bending moments in the columns under gravity loads. In addition, lateral loads due to wind or earthquake loading are another <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the <b>developed</b> bending moments on the columns. Therefore, the strength of the columns is controlled by the compressive strength of concrete, the tensile strength of the longitudinal reinforcements and the geometry of the column’ cross-section (Park and Paulay 1975; Nilson 2004; McCormac 1998; Yalcin and Saatcioglu 2000; MacGregor and Wight 2009).

40|$|To assess {{competition}} for photoassimilates among developing inflorescences, fruitlets and vegetative shoots in avocado (Persea americana Mill.), {{the distribution of}} recent photoassimilates was examined before and during flowering, fruit set, and the transition from sink to <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> vegetative shoots. Mature leaves, located proximal to developing reproductive organs, and developing leaves, located distal to those organs, were exposed to a one-hour pulse of “COz. Translocation of radiolabeled assimilates was monitored over time and among organs. Overall distribution of assimilates was depen-dent on dry mass of tissues regardless of organ type. Flowers and fruitlets did not demonstrate greater sink strength than non-autotrophic leaves. Organs receiving assimilates were in phyllotactic alignment with source leaves. Photoassimilates were never limiting, although flower and fruitlet abscission occurred during and long after this competitive period.

40|$|While {{developing}} Asia {{has recovered}} strongly {{from the global}} crisis, the region faces the medium- and long-term challenge of sustaining growth beyond the crisis. The central objective {{of this paper is}} to empirically investigate the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> economic growth in 12 developing Asian economies during 1992 - 2007 via a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, we estimate total factor productivity growth (TFPG) and account for the relative importance of labor, capital, and TFPG in growth. In the second stage, we examine the effect of fundamental determinants of growth such as human capital on both economic growth and TFPG. Our most significant finding is that TFPG is becoming relatively more important as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> Asia's growth. Our results also confirm the relevance of supply-side factors, in particular human capital and openness to trade, for developing Asia's medium- and long-term growth. The overarching implication for policy makers is that supply-side policies that foster productivity growth will be vital for sustaining developing Asia's future growth in the postcrisis perio...|$|R

It is thought that microbial and gut-derived excretions constitute the major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> N and C for adult dung beetles, while developing larvae, which have retained the mouthparts of their saprophagous ancestors, digest larger particles in the brood ball and rely on symbionts present in the brood ball to provide breakdown products for their nutrition. Stable isotope {{analysis was used to}} trace the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> larval N and C. Nitrogen and carbon contents, as well as C: N ratios, were used to assess the nutritional quality of this finite food source and to track the changes in these values during the course of development.

40|$|The fish kidney {{provides}} a unique model for investigating renal injury, repair, and development. Like mammalian kidneys, fish kidneys have the remarkable ability to repair injured nephrons, designated renal regeneration. This response {{is marked by}} a recovery from acute renal failure by replacing the injured cells with new epithelial cells, restoring tubule integrity. In addition, fish have the ability to respond to renal injury by de novo nephron neogenesis. This response occurs in multiple fish species including goldfish, zebrafish, catfish, trout, tilapia, and the aglomerular toadfish. New nephrons develop in the weeks after the initial injury. This nephrogenic response can be induced in adult fish, providing a more abundant <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> renal tissue compared with fetal mammalian kidneys. Investigating the roles played by different parts of the nephron during development and repair can be facilitated using fish models with differing renal anatomy, such as aglomerular fish. The fish nephron neogenesis model may also help to identify novel genes involved in nephrogenesis, information that could eventually be used to develop alternative renal replacement therapies.
