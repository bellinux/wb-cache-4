5|$|Between 1843 and 1927, the King George III Museum was {{a museum}} within King's College London which housed the {{collections}} of <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments</b> of George III and eminent nineteenth-century scientists (including Sir Charles Wheatstone and Charles Babbage). Due to space constraints within King's, much of the museum's collections were transferred on loan to the Science Museum in London or kept in King's College London Archives.|$|E

5|$|Telescopium {{is a minor}} {{constellation}} in {{the southern}} celestial hemisphere, one of twelve named in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments.</b> Its name is a Latinized form of the Greek word for telescope. Telescopium was later much reduced in size by Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of Mercator's income came from the sales of his {{terrestrial}} and celestial globes. For sixty years they {{were considered to be}} the finest in the world, and they were sold in such great numbers that there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving making the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments,</b> particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.|$|E
5|$|Granat was a three-axis-stabilized {{spacecraft}} and {{the last}} of the 4MV Bus produced by the Lavochkin Scientific Production Association. It was similar to the Astron observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989; for this reason, the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2. It weighed 4.4 metric tons and carried almost 2.3 metric tons of international scientific instrumentation. Granat stood 6.5m tall and had a total span of 8.5 m across its solar arrays. The power made available to the <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments</b> was approximately 400W.|$|E

5|$|MRO {{contains}} {{a host of}} <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments</b> such as cameras, spectrometers, and radar, which are {{used to analyze the}} landforms, stratigraphy, minerals, and ice of Mars. It paves the way for future spacecraft by monitoring Mars' daily weather and surface conditions, studying potential landing sites, and hosting a new telecommunications system. MRO's telecommunications system will transfer more data back to Earth than all previous interplanetary missions combined, and MRO will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Flemish school of {{cartography}} and is widely considered as the most notable representative of the school in its golden age (16th and 17th centuries). In his own day he was the world's most famous geographer but, in addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics and magnetism as well as being an accomplished engraver, calligrapher and maker of globes and <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once the Space Telescope {{project had}} been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments</b> and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.|$|E

5|$|Several other Venus flybys {{took place}} in the 1980s and 1990s that {{increased}} the understanding of Venus, including Vega 1 (1985), Vega 2 (1985), Galileo (1990), Magellan (1994), Cassini–Huygens (1998), and MESSENGER (2006). Then, Venus Express by the European Space Agency (ESA) entered orbit around Venus in April 2006. Equipped with seven <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments,</b> Venus Express provided unprecedented long-term observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded that mission in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|The G {{mission was}} {{achieved}} on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at the Sea of Tranquility at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969. They spent {{a total of}} 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2 hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft, walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments,</b> while continuously sending black-and-white television back to Earth. The astronauts returned safely on July 24.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{constructed}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It has 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing instruments to keep the probe's radio antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments {{are part of the}} Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments</b> to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space.|$|E

5|$|When {{added to}} glass, thorium dioxide helps {{increase}} its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments.</b> The radiation from these lenses can darken them {{and turn them}} yellow {{over a period of}} years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|The target fleet {{included}} four obsolete U.S. battleships, two aircraft carriers, two cruisers, eleven destroyers, eight submarines, numerous auxiliary and amphibious vessels, {{and three}} surrendered German and Japanese ships. The ships carried sample amounts {{of fuel and}} ammunition, plus <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments</b> to measure air pressure, ship movement, and radiation. The live animals {{on some of the}} target ships were supplied by the support ship , which brought 200 pigs, 60 guinea pigs, 204 goats, 5,000 rats, 200 mice, and grains containing insects to be studied for genetic effects by the National Cancer Institute. Amphibious target ships were beached on Bikini Island.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 21½ total {{hours on the}} lunar surface, they had left behind <b>scientific</b> <b>instruments</b> that {{included}} a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of {{the leadership of the}} US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management. (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.|$|E
