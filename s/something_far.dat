25|$|Allen gave {{vaudeville}} {{itself a}} timeline of 1875–1925 in Much Ado About Me, but he actually left vaudeville {{a few years}} earlier, moving to work in such Shubert Brothers stage productions as The Passing Show in 1922. The show played well in its runup to Broadway but lasted only ten weeks at the Winter Garden Theatre. Allen did, however, take <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more lasting from the show: one of the show's chorus girls, Portland Hoffa, who became his wife in 1927 and remained with him until his death.|$|E

Many Americans in the Philippines viewed the locals as racial inferiors, but Taft wrote soon before his arrival, [...] "we propose to banish this idea from their minds". Taft did not impose racial segregation at official events, and treated the Filipinos as social equals. Nellie Taft recalled that [...] "neither politics nor race should influence our hospitality in any way".|$|E
500|$|The Year of the Sex Olympics {{has been}} praised for its foreshadowing {{of the rise}} of reality {{television}} programmes such as Big Brother (1999–present) and Celebrity Love Island (2005–2006). The critic Nancy Banks-Smith wrote in 2003 that: [...] "In The Year of the Sex Olympics [...] foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome... This is satire from a TV insider, but it mutates into <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more desolate and disorientating." [...] The island locations scenes for the production were filmed on the Isle of Man, Kneale's homeland.|$|E

They had been delayed by rain and a rising river, but Tamsen Donner wrote to a friend in Springfield, [...] "indeed, if I do not experience <b>something</b> <b>far</b> worse than I have yet done, I shall say the trouble is all in getting started."

500|$|The lyrical {{reference}} points in [...] are all quite interesting—if {{you consider the}} youth-obsessed reference collaborators {{of the first two}} singles and how uncomfortable it all feels. 'Superstar' offers a glimpse of <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more comfortable in its own skin. All the {{reference points}} will mean very little to your average 17-year-old. We suppose the idea is that they're icons whose imagery transcends generations blah blah blah but after all the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it's great to hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song. The lyrics about being in love are a bit soppy but love makes you go a bit soppy sometimes.|$|E
500|$|Holy Wood {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics {{at the time}} of its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 14 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews", and is the 88th best-reviewed album of the year. The record was praised by several publications as being the band's finest work: Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as their definitive record; a writer for Entertainment Weekly called it their [...] "most potent effort yet", and April Long of NME said it was [...] "by far the best thing Manson has ever set his warped mind to, [...] ultimately inspires <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more potent than fear or hatred—respect." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{people in}} the {{community}} wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest <b>something</b> <b>far,</b> infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, [...] "We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints... and I suspect that rosaries are rattling under aprons." ...|$|E
500|$|Technologically, the Covenant are {{described}} in [...] and [...] to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research. Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted {{that there may be}} something more to the Covenant's weaponry, saying [...] "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more dangerous, arcane, and destructive." [...] A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of [...] "homing in" [...] on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E
500|$|Brook Farm was {{initially}} based {{mostly on the}} ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment meant {{to serve as an}} example {{for the rest of the}} world, established on the principles of [...] "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity". Many in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest <b>something</b> <b>far,</b> infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. He wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, [...] "labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified".|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore of The Seattle Times showed mixed {{feelings}} in his review: [...] "Rare is the thriller that goes as completely and utterly wrong as The Call does at almost precisely the one-hour mark. Which is a crying shame, because {{for an hour}} this is a riveting, by-the-book kidnapping." [...] Moore explained {{what he saw as}} the highs and lows: [...] "Brad Anderson turns this...serial-killer hunt...into a real edge-of-your-seat thriller. Given...a half-decent tale of horror, guilt, problem-solving and redemption, Anderson couldn't go far wrong," [...] but, Moore states, [...] "It's only when our Oscar-winning heroine puts down the phone and sets out to do some sleuthing of her own that The Call disconnects, turning into <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more generic and far less exciting." [...] The Los Angeles Times turned in a similar review: [...] "The semi-fresh thriller, set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles, puts a tech slant on a damsel-in-distress setup. It buzzes along for a while, the promising plot innovations inviting suspension of disbelief, before by-the-numbers implausibility, over-the-top valor and unsavory contrivances take over and the line goes dead." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wind It Up" [...] {{received}} generally negative reviews {{by contemporary}} pop music critics. Entertainment Weeklys Michael Slezak found the bassline [...] "rubbery" [...] and criticized the song for lacking a melody {{as well as}} its reference to Stefani's own clothing line. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that The Neptunes had forced the sampling [...] "into one of their typical minimalist tracks, over which Gwen spouts off clumsy material-minded lyrics touting her fashion line and her shape". Bill Lamb of About.com rated the song three and a half stars, giving it [...] "high marks for entertainment value", but commented that it sounded like a retread of [...] "Rich Girl" [...] from Stefani's debut album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine was mixed on the track, writing that [...] "it's preventing <b>something</b> <b>far</b> less interesting from getting played." [...] John Murphy from musicOMH panned the track as [...] "just horrible, and possibly the worst start to an album this year". Spence D. from IGN characterized the song as [...] "a bugged out Sound Of Music bhangra blitz that sounds like part M.I.A. and part Julie Andrews".|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian who {{compared}} the singer's performance with Tina Turner praised the show's [...] "bombastic" [...] opening and wrote that [...] "there's something powerful and relentless" [...] about it. He concluded [...] "while onstage Beyoncé feels weirdly unassailable". [...] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times noted, [...] "What left the deepest impression was <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more elemental: Beyoncé's {{ability to make}} self-aggrandizement seem like an expression of humility... ambition seemed in proportion with her fans' expectations; she came by the sense of scale honestly." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire highlighted the art direction of the show as [...] "nothing short of breathtaking, making awesome and repeated use of silhouette, of great white blocks of video screens, of live dancers interacting with video". She praised the singer's [...] "fierce" [...] tireless dancing and concluded, [...] "But for all the hauteur here, in couture and bearing, Beyoncé delivers genuine warmth at close range." [...] Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph found [...] "air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony... of an expensive revue show" [...] in the concert. Although she felt that the choreographies often outshined the music, McNulty concluded: [...] "Yet Beyonce was never less than compelling to watch, and often blistering in her vocal attack".|$|E

500|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is {{considered}} one of the greatest—and most controversial—of horror films, and a major influence on the genre. In 1999 Richard Zoglin of Time commented that it had [...] "set a new standard for slasher films". The Times listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as [...] "cheap, grubby and out of control", Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times declared that it [...] "both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture". In his book Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film, David Hogan called it [...] "the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity." [...] According to Bill Nichols, it [...] "achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal". Leonard Wolf praised the film as [...] "...an exquisite work of art" [...] and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} written in the first-person, from Clay's perspective. Clay, who [...] "felt betrayed by Less Than Zero", uses Imperial Bedrooms to make a stand or a case for himself, though {{ultimately}} [...] "reveals himself to be far worse than the author of Less Than Zero ever began to hint at." [...] Clay still bears similarities to the earlier character in Less Than Zero; according to one reviewer, [...] "not all that much is changed. Clay is a cipher, an empty shell who is only able to approximate interactions and experiences through acts of sadism and exploitation." [...] He is also, in many ways, a new character, because {{the opening of the}} book presents that the Clay of Less Than Zero had merely been [...] "just a writer pretending to be him". When asked why he [...] "changed" [...] Clay from [...] "passive" [...] to [...] "guilty", Ellis explained he felt Clay's inaction in the original novel made him equally as guilty; it had [...] "always bothered" [...] Ellis that Clay didn't do anything to save the little girl being raped in the first novel. The Independent notes [...] "his passivity [...] has hardened into <b>something</b> <b>far</b> more culpable, and nefarious." [...] According to Ellis, [...] "In LA, over time, the real person you are ultimately comes out." [...] He also speculates [...] "maybe the fear turned him into a monster". Ellis remarks that he finds the developments in Clay [...] "so exciting". One reviewer summarized the character's development, [...] "The nascent narcissist of Less Than Zero... is now left in a [...] "dead end". The novel is Ellisdeeply pessimistic presentation of human nature as assailable... an unflinching study of evil." ...|$|E

2500|$|Törley was {{apparently}} successful from the start.
