50|$|As in many windmills, The Lily {{features}} {{two sets}} of gears between the sails and the millstones. The first one is between the brake wheel and the wallower which have 63 and 29 teeth respectively. The second gear is formed by the great spur wheel and the stone nut which have 66 and 23 teeth respectively. The number of teeth in each gear {{has been designed to}} be coprime to ensure even wear and smooth running of these gears. Both gears together provide a <b>speed</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>gear</b> ratio between sails and millstone of ≈6.2. This means that one complete revolution of the sails causes approximately 6.2 revolutions of the (top) millstone.|$|E
40|$|TutorialWherever a {{variable}} speed gas compression train {{is needed for}} Oil & Gas upstream applications {{as well as for}} gas storage applications the primary decision has to be made between a gas turbine driver and an electric motor controlled by {{a variable}} frequency drive (VFD). A second decision has to be made between a high speed direct driven train and a low speed driver (gas turbine or motor) driving the compressor via a <b>speed</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>gear.</b> Finally it has to be decided whether a classical, oil lubricated train arrangement shall be used or if a high speed, oil-free, magnetic bearing levitated train configuration shall be chosen. With these three major decisions a variety of different train configurations are possible. They differ from each other in many technical aspects and therefore have strengths and weaknesses which can be rated in order to facilitate the evaluation of the optimum equipment configuration for a certain application. This paper specifically concentrates on the comparison of rotordynamic key figures like the logarithmic decrement (damping) of the lowest bending mode, the presence of overhung coupling modes within the speed range or the presence of torsional critical speeds which can be excited within the speed range and which therefore might adversely affect the integrity of the train components. The evaluated configurations include modern hermetically sealed, oil-free, magnetic bearing levitated compressor designs. Based on these key figures this paper will benchmark the rotordynamic robustness as well as the operational safety of the investigated train configurations...|$|E
40|$|PaperPg. 10 - 25. The {{operation}} and maintenance of centrifugal compressors varies considerably depending upon the size, speed, horsepower, and type of driver. Typical centrifugal compressors vary from high speed, low flow applications to very large flow, low speed machines. Each has its own operating and maintenance problems. Centrifugal compressors are normally driven by electric motors and <b>speed</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>gears</b> for the low flow, low horsepower applications. The middle size ranges are usually motor-gear, steam turbine or gas turbine direct connected combinations. The very large flow, large horsepower machines are practically all steam turbine driven with a few being driven by gas turbine where natural gas fuel is available. Centrifugal compressors can be designed and built with {{operation and}} ease of maintenance practices in mind. Specific items such as off-design operation, bearings and seals, casing design and mounting, and lubrication systems are discussed...|$|R

The study specifies factors influencing the garlic peeling process and recommends a design options for garlic peeling machine. These {{are based on a}} systematic study of the garlic peeling process. For which we consider literatures reviews & some of them are explained. In the present investigation, in the recent past human powered flywheel motor concept has been used for chaff cutter, bricks making, wood turning, cloth washing and turmeric polishing. The machine uses bicycle technology, with <b>speed</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>gearing</b> and a flywheel, which drive the process unit through a spiral jaw clutch and torque <b>increasing</b> <b>gearing.</b> Pedal power is used transmit this power to run the machine by the operator. Power can be transmitted through crank chain to free wheel to the working unit. This human powered flywheel motor concept (HPFM) provide new era in the human powered agriculture processing, harvesting, post harvested operations equipments. Considering social, cultural and environmental factor as well as in many rural operations utilizing unskilled worker and in Vidharbha region there is more problem of electricity so this kind of HPFM concept is helpful in driving various rural machines. The machine is economically viable, can be adopted for human powered process units which could have intermitted operation without affecting the end product.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the documentation}} of the design and development of a sustainable wind energy conversion system to be employed as a stand-alone electrical energy generator for isolated communities and dwellings. As our global population increases at an exponential rate and our consumerism grows with it, a sustainable source of energy needs to be developed to meet our power requirements. At this stage wind energy conversion systems (WECS) cannot produce power to the same scale as coal or gas fuelled power stations, but they do however offer the ability to operate as stand-alone power generation systems, reducing the need for long distance power transmission lines. Stand alone WECS are suitable electricity suppliers for isolated communities, island communities or applications where the cost of grid connection exceeds the installation and maintenance cost of a WECS. Small WECS can be configured to: - Feed into an existing grid - Supply charge to a battery bank - Directly power an appliance The prototype design incorporates: - 3 bladed aerofoil rotor - Adjustable blade pitch - Self governing speed regulation - <b>Speed</b> <b>increase</b> <b>gear</b> box - AC-induction generator – DC conversion circuit. - Steel tower The mechanical design was complimented by a functioning prototype of the Hub and rotor demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} power extraction mechanism. The turbine design was rated as having a power output capacity of 2 kW and is designed to be used in a shunt regulated battery charging circui...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of agricultural tractors {{under field conditions}} results from the interaction between tire and wheel affected by displacement speed. This work was developed to assess the {{performance of}} an agricultural tractor under different seeder's tire inflation pressure (518; 483 and 414 kPa) and in two different gears providing speeds of 3. 0 and 6. 0 km h- 1. The experiment was performed at Jaboticabal Campus of São Paulo State University (UNESP). The experimental design used was entirely randomized in a 2 -factor factorial design (3 x 2) with four replications. The draft force {{was influenced by the}} gear {{as well as by the}} required power; however, tire inflation pressure in the seeder did not change these parameters. Also, fuel consumption was influenced only by the tractor gear. Energy consumption was greater as <b>speed</b> <b>increased,</b> caused by <b>gear</b> shifting. The displacement speed was greater for the 518 kPa pressure due to a lesser slippage in the seeder under this pressure. Tractor slippage did not change...|$|R
