It also replaced <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and cesspool systems near {{the middle and upper}} slough with sanitary sewers. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed {{that by the end of}} this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli, the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were nearly always being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower slough. Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E

In the Sixth Dimension, they speak to an old Jewish man who tells them how to help Frenchy escape, but they soon are captured by Bust Rod. Doris interrogates Flash and Gramps and then lowers them into a large <b>septic</b> <b>tank.</b> She then plots her revenge against Frenchy, relocating all the denizens of Cell 63 to a torture chamber. She leaves the Princess to oversee Frenchy's torture and execution, but when a fuse is blown, the torture is put on hold and the prisoners from Cell 63 are relocated to keep the King from finding them.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E

40|$|To provide {{evidence}} of septic system failure by comparing two faecal indicator bacteria, enterococci and Escherichia coli, from defective <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> and adjacent creeks. A biochemical fingerprinting method was used to type and compare enterococci and E. coli strains from 39 <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> with creek water samples. Phenotypic diversity of enterococci (0 · 5 ± 0 · 3) and E. coli (0 · 5 ± 0 · 3) in <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> were significantly lower than those found in water samples. Among 1072 enterococci isolates tested from <b>septic</b> <b>tanks,</b> 203 biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) were found of which 98 BPTs from 33 <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> were identical to several water samples. Similarly, among 621 E. coli isolates tested from <b>septic</b> <b>tanks,</b> 159 BPTs were found of which 53 BPTs from 26 <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> were also identical to water samples. The number of the latter bacteria was significantly (P = 0 · 01) higher in water samples collected from downstream {{compared with that of}} upstream in the study area.

Biochemical fingerprinting of faecal indicator bacteria is a useful and rapid method to provide direct evidence for septic system failure.
