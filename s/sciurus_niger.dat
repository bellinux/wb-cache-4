25|$|Sciurus carolinensis is {{native to}} the eastern and midwestern United States, and to the southerly {{portions}} of the eastern provinces of Canada. The native range of the eastern gray squirrel overlaps {{with that of the}} fox squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>niger),</b> with which it is sometimes confused, although the core of the fox squirrel's range is slightly more to the west. The eastern gray squirrel is found from New Brunswick to Manitoba, south to East Texas and Florida. Breeding eastern gray squirrels are found in Nova Scotia, but whether this population was introduced or came from natural range expansion is not known. It has also been introduced into Ireland, Britain, Italy, South Africa, and Australia (where it was extirpated by 1973). Eastern grey squirrels in Europe are a concern because they have displaced some of the native squirrels there.|$|E

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{is often}} considered {{a major threat}} to biodiversity; however, our understanding of how fragmentation impacts populations is poor. Identifying appropriate models for such studies is difficult. Tree squirrels are dependent on mature forests for food, cover and nests; these are habitats that are being fragmented rapidly and that are easily defined by humans. Squirrels represent excellent models for study of fragmentation. The literature on tree squirrels was reviewed to glean data on density and home-range size in forest fragments. Sufficient data were available on four species (<b>Sciurus</b> carolinensis, S. <b>niger,</b> S. vulgaris, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Density was negatively related to fragment size for S. carolinensis and S. niger and marginally so for T. hudsonicus. Sciurus vulgaris did not exhibit this relationship. Home-range size was analysed for three species of Sciurus and was positively related to forest fragment size for S. carolinensis and S. niger. Again, only S. vulgaris did not to show this relationship. Sciurus vulgaris is rarely found in small forest fragments and is believed to be especially sensitive to fragmentation; other tree squirrels appear to be sensitive to fragmentation in more subtle ways. Home range compaction provides a mechanism by which densities may increase in small fragments. The demographic consequences resultant from the high densities of squirrels found in small woodlots are not known but may explain the forest damage, avian nest predation and reduced diversity often cited to occur in woodland fragments...|$|R
40|$|I studied {{ecological}} factors affecting transmission dynamics of Baylisascaris procyonis, the common large roundworm of raccoons (Procyon lotor) to intermediate hosts. Infective eggs of B. procyonis are present at raccoon latrines, and these sites {{may be important}} in the transmission of this parasite to small vertebrates in forested areas. I found that raccoon latrines exhibited characteristics generally associated with treefall gaps, and that B. procyonis eggs were present at 14 % of the raccoon latrines sampled. ^ Seventeen mammal and 19 bird species visited latrines during October–November 1994 – 1997. Small granivorous mammals, including white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and tree squirrels (<b>Sciurus</b> carolinensis, S. <b>niger,</b> Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were the most common visitors to latrine sites. Active foraging among raccoon feces was documented for five vertebrate species and accounted for 10 % of all recorded events. Type of seed present in experimentally manipulated feces only affected visitation rates of white-footed mice, which increased when corn was present. This suggests that transmission of B. procyonis to white-footed mice is increased in agricultural areas. ^ Among white-footed mice, prevalence of larval B. procyonis, intensity of infection, and larval load were significantly higher in a highly fragmented agricultural landscape than in a predominantly forested landscape. Within the agricultural landscape, regression models successfully predicted probability of infection, intensity of infection, and larval loads as increasing functions of forest patch area and isolation. ^ The role of latrines in transmission of B. procyonis to white-footed mice was studied in ten 500 m 2 enclosures. Levels of ambient food availability and length of exposure were varied among trials to develop predictive models of risk of infection and of mortality due to central nervous system (CNS) disease. Fifty percent of experimental mice acquired B. procyonis infections, and 43 percent of infected mice developed CNS disease. Regression models successfully predicted probability of infection {{as a function of}} trial length and frequency of latrine visitation, and probability of mortality due to CNS disease as a function of food availability and frequency of visitation. I conclude that transmission of B. procyonis occurs at raccoon latrines where many species of vertebrates visit and forage among feces. ...|$|R

50|$|Listed as extirpated in some California areas, {{the western}} gray {{squirrel}} in southern California is generally {{found only in}} the mountains and surrounding foothill communities. Local rehabilitation experts recount the Eastern Fox Squirrels were released in urban regions of Los Angeles throughout the 20th Century. Fox squirrels (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>niger)</b> were introduced to the Los Angeles area in about 1904. Civil War and Spanish-American War veterans residing at the Sawtelle Veterans Home on Sepulveda and Wilshire Boulevards brought fox squirrels as pets to this site from their homes in the areas surrounding the Mississippi Valley (possibly Tennessee). Other introductions of fox squirrels to the Los Angeles area may have taken place during more recent times but detailed records are not available. These aggressive cousins drove the more reclusive western grays back into the mountains, where competition was not so strong.

Much larger tree squirrels such as western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus) and fox squirrels (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>niger),</b> both weighing about 800 g, are taken occasionally in North America. Ground squirrels are also important prey species, mostly in North America, 25 of 44 of squirrel species found in the diet are ground squirrels. Particularly widely reported as a secondary food staple from Oregon, Wyoming, California and Arizona was the 187 g golden-mantled ground squirrel (Callospermophilus lateralis). In Nevada and Idaho’s Sawtooth National Forest, the 285 g Belding's ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi) fully dominated the food spectrum, comprising up to 74.3% of the prey by number and 84.2% by biomass. Even much bigger ground squirrels such as prairie dogs and marmots are attacked on occasion. Several hoary marmots (Marmota caligala) were brought to nests in southeast Alaska but averaged only 1894 g, so were young animals {{about half of the}} average adult (spring) weight (albeit still considerably heavier than the goshawks who took them). In some cases, adult marmots such as alpine marmots (Marmota marmota), yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) and woodchucks (Marmota monax) have been preyed upon when lighter and weaker in spring, collectively weighing on average about 3500 g or about three times as much as a female goshawk although are basically half of what these marmots can weigh by fall. About a dozen species of chipmunk are known to be taken by goshawks and the 96 g eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were the second most numerous prey species at nests in central New York and Minnesota.

50|$|Hunting {{activity}} {{tends to}} peak between 8:30 pm and 12:00 am {{at night and}} then can pick back up from 4:30 am to sunrise. Hunting activity tends to be most prolonged during winter by virtue of prey being more scarce. Those owls seen hunting by day over the dazzling light of snowbound fields were probably motivated {{to do so by}} great hunger. However, apparently great horned owls can learn to target certain prey during daylight in the afternoon when it is more vulnerable, such as eastern fox squirrels (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>niger)</b> while they're building their leaf nests and chuckawallas (Sauromalus ater) apparently caught lazily sunning themselves on desert rocks. Owls hunt mainly by watching from a snag, pole or other high perch. During hunting forays, they often fly about 50 to 100 m from perch to perch, stopping to survey for food at each, until they sense a prey item below. From such vantage points, owls dive down to the ground, often with wings folded, to ambush their prey. Effective maximum hunting distance of an owl from an elevated perch is 90 m. Due to their short but broad wings, great horned owls are ideally suited for low speed and maneuverability. Despite reports that they do not hunt on the wing, they also sometimes hunt by flying low over openings on the ground, scanning below for prey activity. Great horned owls can fly at speeds of more than 65 km/h in level flight. Hunting flights are slow, often quartering low above the ground where prey is likely to occur in open country or open woodland. Brief hovering flight (for about 6-18 seconds) have been described, especially in windy areas. On occasion owls may actually walk on the ground in pursuit of small prey or, rarely, inside a chicken coop to prey on the fowl within. Rodents and invertebrates may be caught on foot around the base of bushes, through grassy areas, and near culverts and other human structures in range and farm habitat. The great horned owl is generally a poor walker on the ground; it walks like a starling, with a pronounced side-to-side gait. They have even been known to wade into shallow water for aquatic prey, although this has been only rarely reported. Owls can snatch birds and some arboreal mammals directly from tree branches in a glide as well. The stiff feathering of their wings allows owls to produce minimal sound in flight while hunting.|$|E
50|$|While eastern screech owls {{have lived}} for over 20 years in captivity, wild birds seldom, if ever, live that long. Mortality rates of young and {{nestling}} owls {{may be as}} high as 70% (usually significantly less in adult screech owls). Many losses are due to predation. Common predators at screech owl nests including Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), American minks (Neovison vison), weasels (Mustela ssp.), raccoons (Procyon lotor), ringtails (Bassariscus astutus), skunks, snakes, crows (Corvus ssp.), and blue jays. Eastern fox squirrels (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>niger)</b> may raid the tree holes being used by eastern screech owls, not only destroying or consuming the eggs but also displacing the adult owls from the hole to use the hole for themselves. Adults have fewer predators but larger species of owl do take them, since they have similar periods of activity. Larger owls known to have preyed on eastern screech owls have included great horned owls, barred owls (Strix varia), spotted owls (Strix occidentalis), long-eared owls (Asio otus), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) and snowy owls (Bubo scandianus). Diurnal birds of prey may also kill and eat them, including Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii), northern harriers (Circus cyaenus), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaciensis), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) and rough-legged hawks (Buteo lagopus). Most prolific by far of the eastern screech owl's avian predators is the great horned owl, which can destroy up to 78% of a local population, but locally Cooper's hawks and barred owls are almost as serious of a threat. A most dramatic case illustrating the owl food chain involved a barred owl, which up examination after being shot in New England contained a long-eared owl in its stomach that, in its own stomach, contained an eastern screech owl. All other common owls in this species range also live off of similar rodent prey but direct competition is obviously disadvantageous to the screech owl. One exception is the even smaller northern saw-whet owl, on which eastern screech owls have been known to prey. In rural Michigan, 9 different species of owl and diurnal raptor including the screech owl fed primarily on the same four species of small rodent from the Peromyscus and Microtus genera. Eastern screech owls have had nesting attempts fail due to biocide poisoning, which causes the thinning of eggs and failure of nests, but seemingly not to the overall detriment of the species. Collisions with cars, trains and windowpanes kill many screech owls, the earlier especially while feeding on road-side rodents and road-kills.|$|E

Laboratory trials with wild-caught western gray squirrels indicated that squirrels were competent reservoir hosts of the Lyme disease bacterium and infected up to 86 % of feeding Ixodes pacificus larvae. Infections were long-lasting (up to 14 months), which demonstrated that western gray squirrels can maintain B. burg-dorferi trans-seasonally.

40|$|Mammalian {{distributions}} {{are constantly}} changing. Some distributional shifts reflect habitat change, climate change, and human transplantations; thus, such shifts {{are due to}} actual expansions or contractions of populations. However, other species ranges that appear to shift {{as the result of}} new records being added to known distributional limits actually might reflect populations that previously were undetected {{due to a lack of}} past surveys or species that are difficult to detect. In 2013, multiple techniques were employed to document mammalian distributional records in southwestern Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma. We discovered three new county records in Morton County, Kansas (Crawford’s Desert Shrew, Notiosorex crawfordi; American Beaver, Castor canadensis; and Eastern Fox Squirrel, <b>Sciurus</b> <b>niger),</b> with Crawford’s Desert Shrew also representing the first records of the species in Kansas. We documented five new county records in Cimarron County, Oklahoma (Least Shrew, Cryptotis parva; American Parastrelle, Parastrellus hesperus; Wapiti, Cervus canadensis; White-tailed Deer, Odocoileus virginianus; and Eastern Fox Squirrel, <b>Sciurus</b> <b>niger).</b> The Eastern Fox Squirrel and Least Shrew likely are expanding their distribution in this region along the Cimarron River, whereas the Wapiti, White-tailed Deer, and American Beaver likely are recolonizing the area after extirpation during the last century. Occurrence of Eastern Fox Squirrels in Elkhart, Kansas, and Boise City, Oklahoma, might represent human introductions. The American Parastrelle and Crawford’s Desert Shrew likely have gone undetected at those sites and have not recently experienced range expansions. Our results demonstrate the importance of continued surveys using various methods to document mammals. Both counties have been intensively surveyed for mammals, indicating that targeted surveys and various techniques are important to document distributional shifts as well as rare or difficult to capture species. Understanding the species present in an area is requisite for managing habitats and wildlife and will allow biologists to better elucidate future changes in distributions...|$|E
