40|$|Highly filled {{polypropylene}} (PP) composites {{have been}} produced by extrusion of polypropylenes with <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> <b>fillers.</b> The aim is to include the highest proportion of filler that can provide hardness and high density, without undue brittleness. Modification of the filler surface provided significant enhancement of the processing properties that have been studied with parallel plate rheometry. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} viscoelastic behavior of melt flow of highly filled polypropylene composites significantly depended on the following properties of the fillers: aspect ratio, specific surface area and particle size in talc, calcium carbonate and barium sulfate filled polypropylene composites. Traditional surface modifiers such as stearic acid are useful, but titanates and in particular small amounts of silicones have provided the greatest rheological modification...|$|R
40|$|New {{material}} formulations {{to be used}} in Additive Manufacturing {{machines are}} one of the major interests in this fast growing field. The possibility to tune functional and mechanical properties, by the addition of reinforcements to a polymeric matrix, is hindered by the low provisional capability of the additive manufactured composite. The inherent anisotropy of layer manufacturing combines with mechanisms of filler dispersion and of filler/matrix adhesion in a complex scenario. The paper entails a critical evaluation of mechanical properties measured for several polymeric composites produced by Powder Bed Fusion, in the perspective of provisional models commonly accepted for composite materials. The models are reviewed versus experimental and literature data. The provisional effectiveness is generally good, except for the case of nanometric or <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> <b>fillers,</b> or of specific anisotropic microstructures obtained by layer manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Topographic and phase imaging in tapping mode atomic force {{microscopy}} (TMAFM) {{has been}} performed to investigate the effect of unmodified and modified dual phase fillers on the morphology of and the microdispersion of the filler particles in the rubber matrix. The above fillers were modified using acrylate monomer (trimethylol propane triacrylate, TMPTA) or a silane coupling agent (triethoxysilylpropyltetrasulphide, Si- 69) followed by electron beam modification at room temperature. Both unmodified and <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> <b>fillers</b> were incorporated in a styrene-butadiene rubber. The phase images of the above composites show three levels of contrasts that correspond to matrix, filler aggregates, and bound rubber around the filler aggregates. Also, the images further elucidate the aggregated nature of the filler due to modification, which is more pronounced {{in the case of}} electron beam modified acrylated filler loaded rubber. The corresponding topographic images have been characterized by various statistical quantities like roughness parameters and one- and two-dimensional power spectral densities (1 D-PSD and 2 D-PSD). As compared to the control, significant increase in surface roughness is observed {{in the case of the}} modified dual phase filler loaded composites. The higher fractal value of these vulcanizates confirms the above fact. AFM study also suggests that the electron beam modification of the above fillers significantly increases the filler-filler and filler-polymer interactions...|$|R

40|$|When {{listeners}} hear {{a speaker}} become disfluent, {{they expect the}} speaker to refer to something new. What is the mechanism underlying this expectation? In a mouse-tracking experiment, listeners sought to identify images that a speaker was describing. Listeners more strongly expected new referents when they heard a speaker say um than when they heard a matched utterance where the um was replaced by noise. This expectation was speaker-specific: it depended on what was new and old for the current speaker, not just on what was new or old for the listener.

40|$|Abstract. The {{separator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts in PEM fuel cells. Stainless steels are widely used as separator for its good mechanical properties and mass production. However, for a good chemical compatibility, stainless steels need to have high chromium content or surface treatment, which makes separator high cost. Low cost of separator is important for commercial use. In this study, conventional low carbon steel is used as base metal of separator. Low carbon steel is low at cost, but has poor chemical properties for separator. For a good corrosion resistance, low carbon steel needs to be <b>surface</b> <b>treated.</b> To make a uniform <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> layer on low carbon steel, chromium is conventionally electroplated on the steel and thermally nitrided. <b>Surface</b> <b>treated</b> low carbon steel is investigated using microstructure and element analysis tools.

40|$|Surface {{treatment}} of wood {{can be done}} with different coatings, and the choice of the appropriate system of processing depends on several factors, such as technological, aesthetic, economic and ecological.

40|$|Abstract Fly ash, an {{inorganic}} alumino silicate {{has been}} used as filler in epoxy matrix, but it reduces the mechanical properties due to its poor dispersion and interfacial bonding with the epoxy matrix. To improve its interfacial bonding with epoxy matrix, surface treatment of fly ash was done using surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate and silane coupling agent glycidoxy propyl trimethoxy silane. An attempt is also made to reduce the particle size of fly ash using high pressure pulverizer. To improve fly ash dispersion in epoxy matrix, the epoxy was modified by mixing with amine containing liquid silicone rubber (ACS). The effect of <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> fly ash with varying filler loadings from 10 to 40 % weight on the mechanical, morphological and thermal properties of modified epoxy composites was investigated. The <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> fly ash was characterized by particle size analyzer and FTIR spectra.
