5000|$|Sprinklers - Fire {{sprinklers}} offer a {{layer of}} protection because the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>can</b> respond to fire while it is still small. Fire sprinklers [...] respond only the sprinkler closest to the heat source. Smoke alone will not set a fire sprinkler to discharge.|$|E
50|$|The bulb breaks as {{a result}} of the thermal {{expansion}} of the liquid inside the bulb. The time it takes before a bulb breaks is dependent on the temperature. Below the design temperature, it does not break, and above the design temperature it breaks, taking less time to break as temperature increases above the design threshold. The response time is expressed as a response time index (RTI), which typically has values between 35 and 250 m½s½, where a low value indicates a fast response. Under standard testing procedures (135 °C air at a velocity of 2.5 m/s), a 68 °C sprinkler bulb will break within 7 to 33 seconds, depending on the RTI. The RTI can also be specified in imperial units, where 1 ft½s½ is equivalent to 0.55m½s½. The sensitivity of a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>can</b> be negatively affected if the thermal element has been painted.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} and evaluates Sprinkler, {{a reliable}} high-throughput broadcast facility for geographically dispersed datacenters. For scaling cloud services, datacenters use caching throughout their in-frastructure. <b>Sprinkler</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} broadcast update events that inval-idate cache entries. The number of recipients can scale to many thousands in such scenarios. The Sprinkler infrastructure consists of two layers: one layer to disseminate events among datacenters, and a second layer to dis-seminate events among machines within a datacenter. A novel garbage collection interface is introduced to save storage space and network band-width. The first layer is evaluated using an implementation deployed on Emulab. For the second layer, involving thousands of nodes, we use a discrete event simulation. The effect of garbage collection is analyzed using simulation. The evaluation shows that <b>Sprinkler</b> <b>can</b> disseminate millions of events per second throughout a large cloud infrastructure, and garbage collection is effective in workloads like cache invalidation...|$|E

5000|$|ESFR (early {{suppression}} fast response) {{refers to}} both a concept and {{a type of}} sprinkler. [...] "The concept is that fast response of <b>sprinklers</b> <b>can</b> produce an advantage in a fire if the response is accompanied by an effective discharge density — that is, a sprinkler spray capable of fighting its way down through the fire plume in sufficient quantities to suppress the burning fuel package." [...] The sprinkler that was developed for this concept was created for use in high rack storage.|$|R
40|$|Sprinkler {{systems are}} a common fire {{protection}} strategy used in shopping malls, {{whether there is an}} atrium or not. Because of the typically high headroom in an atrium, {{it is often difficult to}} activate a sprinkler due to a fire at the floor level. Further, flooding the atrium floor with excessive water from a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>can</b> affect evacuation and can cause serious property damage. Sprinkler systems do not satisfy the water conservation criterion for green or sustainable buildings. Alternative systems using less water should be designed for a 'green or sustainable' shopping mall with an atrium. The alternative active fire protection systems proposed in this paper are: Water gun in atrium spaces; Intelligent fire detection systems in atria; Water mist fire suppression systems in shops adjacent to an atrium. An atrium in a 'green or sustainable' shopping mall is taken as an example. The feasibility of using the above fire protection systems is discussed. The potential advantage of less water use for green or sustainable buildings will be pointed out. Further, designing static smoke exhaust with roof vents for protecting the atrium with minimum use of electric power will beoutlined, bearing in mind that a smoke management system is also regarded as an active fire protection system in some countries.

40|$|Oxyfluorfen is a pre-emergent and post-emergent {{broadleaf}} and grassy weed herbicide and is {{registered for}} use {{on a variety of}} field, fruit, and vegetable crops, ornamentals as well as non-crop sites. Oxyfluorfen is formulated for agricultural uses as an emulsifiable liquid concentrate and as a granular product, although it is most frequently used in a liquid formulation for food crops and as a granular formulation for ornamental nursery crops. There are also several ready-to-use products and a liquid concentrate available for residential use. Residential formulations contain 0. 25 % to 0. 70 % oxyfluorfen by volume and are packaged in a ready-to-use (RTU) sprinkler jug, a RTU trigger sprayer or as a liquid to be mixed in a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>can</b> or tank sprayer (EPA 2000). Oxyfluorfen is formulated with other active ingredients including oryzalin, glyphosate, pendamethalin, and Imazapyr. Oxyfluorfen is registered for residential use. An endangered species risk assessment is developed for federally listed Pacific salmon and steelhead. This assessment applies the findings of the Office of Pesticide Program’s Environmental Risk Assessment developed for non-target fish and wildlife as part of the reregistration process to determine the potential risks to the 26 listed threatened and endangered Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) of Pacific salmon and steelhead. The use of oxyfluorfen will have no direct or indirect effect from loss of food supply or loss of cover in the 26 ESUs of Pacific salmon and steelhead when used according to labeled application directions...|$|E

Automatically moving wheeled systems known as traveling sprinklers may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these utilize a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This type of system is known to most people as a [...] "waterreel" [...] traveling irrigation sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and land application of waste water.|$|R
50|$|Underground {{sprinklers}} function through {{means of}} basic electronic and hydraulic technology. This valve {{and all of}} the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone. Upon activation, the solenoid, which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center. By doing this, the activated (or raised) plunger allows air to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located {{in the center of the}} valve. Water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm. This pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes, usually made of PVC (higher pressure commercial systems) or polyethylene pipe (for typically lower pressure residential systems). At the end of these pipes and flush to ground level (typically) are pre measured and spaced out <b>sprinklers.</b> These <b>sprinklers</b> <b>can</b> be fixed spray heads that have a set pattern and generally spray between 1.5-2m (7-15 ft.), full rotating <b>sprinklers</b> that <b>can</b> spray a broken stream of water from 6-12m (20-40 ft.), or small drip emitters that release a slow, steady drip of water on more delicate plants such as flowers and shrubs. use of indigenous materials also recommended.|$|R
50|$|Fire <b>sprinklers</b> <b>can</b> be {{automatic}} or open orifice. Automatic fire sprinklers {{operate at}} a predetermined temperature, utilizing a fusible element, {{a portion of}} which melts, or a frangible glass bulb containing liquid which breaks, allowing the plug in the orifice to be pushed out of the orifice by the water pressure in the fire sprinkler piping, resulting in water flow from the orifice. The water stream impacts a deflector, which produces a specific spray pattern designed {{in support of the}} goals of the sprinkler type (i.e., control or suppression). Modern sprinkler heads are designed to direct spray downwards. Spray nozzles are available to provide spray in various directions and patterns. The majority of automatic fire sprinklers operate individually in a fire. Contrary to motion picture representation, the entire sprinkler system does not activate, unless the system is a special deluge type.|$|R

25|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{involves the}} installation {{of a series of}} sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The <b>sprinklers</b> <b>can</b> be set on an electronic timer and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than flood irrigation, like furrow irrigation the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row of vines in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual dripper. With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|R

40|$|Heat stress reduces milk production, feed intake, and {{reproductive}} efficiency each summer in Kansas. Without heat abatement procedures, milk production may decline 20 - 30 % {{during the summer}} months. Research has shown that supplemental fan cooling in combination with low pressure feedline <b>sprinklers</b> <b>can</b> reduce the effects of heat stress on milk production and feed intake. One critical issue in heat stress abatement is the location of fans in a 4 -row freestall barn. Research conducted {{during the summer of}} 2000 on a northeast Kansas dairy found that locating fans over both the feedline and head-to-head freestalls increased milk production 5. 8 lb/cow/d and reduced respiration rates in the morning and at night compared to mounting fans only over the feedline. Pen feed intakes also tended to be greater when fans were located in both areas. Economic analysis showed that after accounting for cost associated with ownership, operation, and increased feed intake, net farm income was estimated to be increased by $ 3, 600 - 6, 600 for a pen of 84 cows. A 100 -cow Kansas dairy could increase farm profits by $ 8, 000 if these heat abatement techniques were utilized. Location of fans over both the feedline and freestalls in combination with a low pressure feedline sprinkling system is an effective heat stress abatement strategy in 4 - row freestall barns...|$|R
