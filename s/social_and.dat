Moreover, adult education, <b>social</b> inclusion <b>and</b> <b>social</b> capital are positively related among adults. Therefore, this questionnaire study examines how adults who are engaged in online and blended learning perceived change in <b>social</b> inclusion <b>and</b> <b>social</b> capital. We conceptualised social inclusion as <b>social</b> participation <b>and</b> <b>social</b> connectedness, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> capital as bonding and bridging ties. In the case of blended adult learners, our results show positive perceptions of <b>social</b> inclusion <b>and</b> <b>social</b> capital. Those perceptions are less positive among the online adult learners. In both cases, non-natives experience a higher increase in <b>social</b> inclusion <b>and</b> <b>social</b> capital than natives. Hence, online and blended learning holds advantages for adults particularly non-natives: it enhances <b>social</b> inclusion <b>and</b> <b>social</b> capital. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R
