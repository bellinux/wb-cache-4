40|$|Summary The main {{objectives}} of the present work were focused on method development and application of vibrational spectroscopy (IRS, NIRS and Raman-S) for the quality evaluation of selected plant raw materials, in process control of the technological extraction and in processing of these raw materials. In this context, three taxonomically very different model organisms, fennel, sage and yew were investigated. Using the example of fennel showed that FTIR spectroscopic techniques discriminated the different chemotypes of fennel as well as <b>sweet</b> and bitter <b>fennel</b> according to Pharmacopoeia specifications. This discrimination succeeded for the first time, both on individual fruits using ATR-FTIR, {{as well as with}} larger sample weights by NIRS. Raman spectroscopy was successful for discrimination of extracts (CCl 4) of fennel fruits. Besides, a new, not previously described fennel chemotype was found. This contains a high level of -asarone and because of its toxicity this chemotype is not in use as a drug. Nevertheless, in literature -asarone is described to possess antifungal and allelopathic properties and extracts of this chemotype could therefore be applied as bio-pesticides, which however should be evaluated in further studies. Because of the relatively high content of essential oil components (EOCs) in drugs a rapid analysis of EOCs content and composition directly on the dried raw material using ATR-FTIR could be developed. In addition to the total content of EOCs, also predictive models for the major EOCs of good to very good quality could be established. Also, a rapid identification of dried sage leaves at different growth stages (young leaves of the sizes up to 15 / 30 mm calculated on dry weight) and harvest time (main differences are in the composition of vegetable matrix) could be done by principal component analysis. These non-destructive procedures take, according to the developed protocol, only a few minutes and do not require laborious sample preparation. These are good prerequisites to carry out this method also on intact fresh leaves, which will be an essential part of further investigations. In the third work package the possibilities and limitations of the use of IR and Raman spectroscopy for routine quality control in process-related analytics in the technological processing of plant raw materials and extracts have been extensively studied on the basis of yew needles. The very low concentration of the valuable target substance 10 -deacetylbaccatin III (DAB) in the plant raw material, the yew needles, is below the detection limit of the spectroscopic techniques used here and therefore did not allow a direct quantification of DAB. Using NIRS, diverse technological parameters with relevance for the extraction process, such as residual moisture and purity of the material and botanical contamination, were successfully determined and corresponding prediction models were developed. These are significant for preparing the drug for extraction and calculating of required amount of solvents, extraction time at various stages etc. Thus especially NIRS was found to be a powerful tool in the incoming goods inspection in the quality control of herbal raw material and an improvement the procedure, which is very often based only on visual inspections. In the next stages of the process, e. g., during different extraction stages (percolation, maceration), valid predictive models for the determination of water content (ATR-FTIR) and 10 -DAB concentration (RS) in extracts have been developed by means of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy and finally the enrichment of the target component tracked through the process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{benefits}} {{promoted by}} natural products {{on human health}} have motivated industry to search for alternative separation systems in order to purify active compounds present in renewable sources. Amongst natural products of current interest for food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and chemical industries is methyl chavicol (MC). MC is a natural ingredient found in several herbs as tarragon, sweet basil, <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel,</b> and their essential oils, and its widest application is in food industry as flavoring agent. In this work, basil essential oil was used as raw material to study MC concentration through a hybrid evaporation system. The evaporative system was constituted of a cylindrical evaporator, an internal condenser located concentrically to the evaporator, and an external condenser. It generates 3 outside streams: distilled, side, and residue, which were recovered {{at the bottom of}} external condenser, internal condenser, and evaporator, respectively. From experimental results, it was verified that higher MC concentration was reached at the side stream because its intermediate volatility when compared with other substances present in basil essential oil. Central composite experimental design using 2 factors and 4 replicates at central point was considered in this work to determine the effect of operating conditions on methyl chavicol separation. Response variables were methyl chavicol concentration (%MCside) at side stream, distilled (%D) and side (%S) streams amounts. The factors studied in this work were: evaporator temperature (Tevap) and feed flow rate (FFR).

40|$|The rise in multi-drug {{resistant}} Vibrio cholerae strains is a {{big problem}} in treatment of patients suffering from severe cholera. Only a few studies have evaluated the potential of natural compounds against V. cholerae. Extracts from plants like ‘neem’, ‘guazuma’, ‘daio’, apple, hop, green tea and elephant garlic have been shown to inhibit bacterial growth or the secreted cholera toxin (CT). However, inhibiting bacterial growth like common antimicrobial agents may also impose selective pressure facilitating development of resistant strains. A natural compound that can inhibit virulence in V. cholerae is an alternative choice for remedy. Recently, some common spices were examined to check their inhibitory capacity against virulence expression of V. cholerae. Among them methanol extracts of red chili, <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel</b> and white pepper could substantially inhibit CT production. Fractionation of red chili methanol extracts indicated a hydrophobic nature of the inhibitory compound(s), and the n-hexane and 90 per cent methanol fractions could inhibit > 90 per cent of CT production. Purification and further fractionation revealed that capsaicin {{is one of the major}} components among these red chili fractions. Indeed, capsaicin inhibited the production of CT in various V. cholerae strains regardless of serogroups and biotypes. The quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR assay revealed that capsaicin dramatically reduced the expression of major virulence-related genes such as ctxA, tcpA and toxT but enhanced the expression of hns gene that transcribes a global prokaryotic gene regulator (H-NS). This indicates that the repression of CT production by capsaicin or red chili might be due to the repression of virulence genes transcription by H-NS.

I investigated efforts to control three invasive plant species (Carduus pycnocephalus Italian thistle, Centaurea solstitialis yellow star thistle, and Foeniculum vulgare <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel)</b> at three sites in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. In all three cases, weed control efforts initially reduced the cover of invasive species targeted for eradication. Native cover was evaluated at one site, but it showed no differences in any year following treatment. Following eradication of Italian thistle in a fuels-reduction area, I planted disturbance-adapted native plants belonging to three life-history strategies (annuals, herbaceous perennials, and perennial grasses). I evaluated the ability of these natives to resist re-establishment of the invasive thistle. Unfortunately, this experiment was done during a drought. As replacement vegetation, perennial grass and herbaceous perennial cover was low and native annuals did not recruit. Italian thistle showed little difference in cover regardless of which native plant life-history strategy it occurred with. However, several months following planting, thistle grown with perennial grasses were smaller than thistle grown in plots that had been designated to receive annual plants (annuals that never grew). Although perennial grasses did not reduce the cover of thistle, they did reduce its size.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of mixed flowers bouquets {{has increased in}} the cut flower industry. The longevity of mixed flowers bouquets {{is limited by the}} individual life of each flower in the bunch. Various factors have been studied for their effect on the individual life of each flower in mixed flowers bouquets. The results indicate that the differences in vase life of each flower in mixed bouquets may come from the influence of their phenotype. In cut rose flowers, there were various contents of fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol in all cultivars. However, levels of sugars contents were not related to the long-lived cultivars. For cut lily flowers, the contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose were measured in the primary and the secondary bud of ‘Tiber’ lilies. Differences in the contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose between the primary and secondary bud, did not relate to the longevity of individual bud life. However, this experiment found increases in sucrose contents in both positions before the time of opening. This increase in sucrose may relate {{to the role of the}} carbohydrate energy source for bud opening. Bacteria found in this study seemed to be largely specific to different flower types. Also, species of bacteria found in the vase water of mixed flowers were less than in that of single varieties. Difference in species of bacteria may be due to differences between plants, and the conditions they exert in the vase water. In general bacterial numbers were high at the beginning of all the experiments, indicating a strong inoculum effect from stems, although there was no straightforward relationship between stem numbers and inoculum size, in all cases. Experiments of single varieties were studied using ‘Tiber’ lily, ‘Akito’ rose and ‘Valentino’ rose. The results indicated that the addition of stems did not result in higher numbers of bacteria, but vase life was reduced, especially for the roses. The effect of number of stems in mixed flowers was investigated in distilled water and liquid flower food. The result of the addition of stems was to reduce the vase life of both ‘Tiber’ lily and ‘Akito’ rose. However, the effect of more stems of ‘Akito’ roses had a greater effect on vase life, fresh weight and water uptake than in ‘Tiber’ lilies. This indicated that ‘Akito’ roses had a greater response to high bacteria populations than lilies. The role of chemical exudates on flowers was not clear in the present study as they only had an effect during the early part of the vase life. The vase lives of ‘Tiber’ lilies and ‘Akito’ roses in all treatments were not significantly different. Perhaps treatment effects caused by the presence of chemical exudates may have been ‘masked’ by the presence of micro-organisms. The screening of 12 essential oils (West Indian bay, cinnamon leaf, clove bud, clove leaf, Chinese ginger, lemongrass, mandarin, rosemary, sage, spearmint, <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel,</b> and thyme) showed that thyme oil and lemongrass oil are effective against more bacterial species over other essential oils. The comparison of the minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) of thyme oil and lemongrass oil showed that the average MBC for thyme oil was lower than that of lemongrass. However, the thyme oil failed to extend the vase life of ‘Tiber’ lily and ‘Akito’ rose. Thyme oil was effective against bacteria for a very short time and could not extend vase life, especially that of the ‘Akito’ rose. Overall, thyme oil treatment appeared to reduce vase life. The efficacy of nine weak organic acids was studied in vivo for their effect on six bacterial species. Bacterial samples were inoculated on trypticase soya agar (TSA) pH 4 and 7. At pH 7, the TSA was prepared by using distilled water. All six bacteria species grew well under these conditions. The results of weak organic acids studied at pH 7 showed that Trans-cinnamic acid was the only weak organic acid that could act against some bacteria. At pH 4, only L 8 (Bacillus spp.) could grow, and Trans- cinnamic acid was effective against this bacteria. The initial result of testing Trans- cinnamic acid against bacteria offered some promise for it to be applied successfully to the vase water of cut flowers, in combination with buffer systems...|$|E
