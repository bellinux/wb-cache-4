50|$|By that time, 21 {{species of}} trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some {{combination}} of overharvesting/overhunting, rat predation, and climate change. The island was largely deforested, {{and it did not}} have any trees more than 3 metres (10 feet) tall. Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities. One theory regarding the deforestation that caused such ecological and social damage was that the trees were used as rollers to move the statues to their place of erection from the quarry at Rano Raraku. Deforestation also affected agricultural production on Rapa Nui. At first, the native tropical forests provided ideal <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> for soil. But with many of the native forest being destroyed, the topsoil became eroded causing a sharp decline in agricultural production. This was further exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a potential source of food. By the 18th century, residents of the island were largely sustained by farming, with domestic chickens as the primary source of protein.|$|E

40|$|Reptiles with temperature-dependent sex {{determination}} {{may be particularly}} threatened by climate change, as increasing temperatures could lead to skewed sex ratios. A potential compensatory mechanism is nest-site choice, with females selecting nest sites to match incubation conditions to climatic conditions. I studied nest-site choice in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) {{to determine the extent}} to which behavioral plasticity in nest-site choice can compensate for the effects of climate change. In a common-garden experiment, gravid females from five populations across the species 2 ̆ 7 range were collected and nest-site choice was compared among populations to evaluate variation in nesting phenology, <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> over the nest, nest depth, incubation regime, and offspring sex ratio. Populations differed in nesting phenology and nest depth, but not in <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> over nests; thus, when exposed to novel climatic conditions, females from transplanted populations chose nest-sites with similar <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> to those of local females, thereby producing similar offspring sex ratios. The performance of hatchlings produced in this experiment declined with decreasing mean temperature of the mother 2 ̆ 7 s site of origin, and nests with greater variation in daily temperature range produced hatchlings that performed faster and more readily than nests with less variable incubation temperatures. Therefore, selection of shadier nest-sites may be a mechanism by which female turtles could compensate for climatic warming, and the increase in temperature fluctuations predicted by climate change models may result in the production of faster hatchling turtles with enhanced righting ability. In an experiment manipulating nest depth, I found that nest depth affected the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuation, but neither mean nest temperature nor sex ratio were affected by depth. The adjustment in nest depth that would be required to affect sex ratio in this species is biologically unfeasible, and therefore female adjustment of nest depth is unlikely to compensate for climate change. Finally, I compared used vs. available nesting habitat between a southern and central population of painted turtles. Compared to the central population, turtles from southern population were more limited in the available range of accessible <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> under which to nest. As <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> is an easily-manipulated feature, land managers can adjust the range of <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> available to nesting turtles in order to preserve populations in the face of climate change.

40|$|How are organisms {{responding}} to climate change? The rapidity with which climate is changing suggests that, in species with long generation times, adaptive evolution {{may be too}} slow {{to keep pace with}} climate change, and that alternative mechanisms, such as behavioural plasticity, may be necessary for population persistence. Species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be particularly threatened by climate change, because altered temperatures could skew sex ratios. We experimentally tested nest-site choice in the long-lived turtle Chrysemys picta to determine whether nesting behaviour can compensate for potential skews in sex ratios caused by rapid climate change. We collected females from five populations across the species′ range and housed them in a semi-natural common garden. Under these identical conditions, populations differed in nesting phenology (likely due to nesting frequency), and in nest depth (possibly due to a latitudinal cline in female body size), but did not differ in choice of <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> over the nest, nest incubation regime, or in resultant nest sex ratios. These results suggest that choice of nest sites with particular <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> may be a behaviourally plastic mechanism by which turtles can compensate for change in climatic temperatures during embryonic development, provided that sufficient environmental variation in potential nest microhabitat is available...|$|E

For this reason, a <b>shade</b> <b>covered</b> coffee plantation may survive economic setbacks by the farmer where an unshaded plantation would not.

40|$|Abstract. We compare species ricliness of birds, fruit-feeding {{butterflies}} and ground-foraging ants along a coffee intensification gradient {{represented by a}} {{reduction in the number of}} species of shade trees and percentage of <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> in coffee plantations. We sampled the three taxa in the same plots within the same period of time. Two sites were selected in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in species richness with the decrease of <b>shade</b> <b>cover,</b> birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of biodiversity in coffee plantations, i...|$|E

40|$|Shade-grown coffee has {{received}} much attention for providing bird habitat in tropical regions. Within shade coffee production, canopy management can vary greatly, and this variation may produce {{changes in the}} availability of food resources for forest-associated birds. To evaluate food availability and habitat quality in two farms with different shade management styles, bird foraging behavior was analyzed in terms of prey attack rates and foraging substrates utilized. These behaviors were examined in two species, the Yellow-green Vireo (Vireo flavoviridis) and the White-winged Tanager (Spermagra leucoptera). Measurements of individual body condition, including fat reserves, mass, and blood hematocrit levels were compared to provide an additional index of habitat quality. Significant differences were encountered between farm types both in the variety of shade trees used as foraging substrates {{and the rate of}} prey attack, indicating a decreased availability of food resources for birds foraging in the low shade coffee farm. A confounding factor in comparing these farms is that in addition to differences in the amount of <b>shade</b> <b>cover,</b> there is a vast difference in the diversity of trees present. To control for this, foraging behaviors were also compared within common shade tree genera between farms, which led to similar results as those found in the aggregate data. These results suggest that the shade management style [...] both shade tree diversity and amount of <b>shade</b> <b>cover</b> [...] affects the availability of food for forest-associated birds, and this likely contributes to the high avian diversity observed in high shade coffee farms. i...|$|E
