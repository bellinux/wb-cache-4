5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named {{in the manner of a}} traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North <b>Stand</b> <b>and</b> South Stand for the ends, East <b>Stand</b> <b>and</b> West Stand for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the stand named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E
