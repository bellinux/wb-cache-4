5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf <b>stars</b> <b>is</b> that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E

In the Shang Dynasty of the 2nd millennium BCE, Chinese thought regarded the Big Dipper as a deity, while during the Han Dynasty, {{it was considered}} a qi path of the circumpolar god, Taiyi.|$|E
5|$|Each {{mission has}} a timed {{duration}} that the player must beat, with two tiers of time bonus.

5|$|Multiple X-ray {{sources have}} since been {{detected}} in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory.

5|$|<b>Stars</b> <b>is</b> a wood {{engraving}} print; that is, it {{was produced by}} carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image.

Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets and subsequently falls in love with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient, played by Elgort.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G2V star, with G2 {{indicating}} {{its surface}} temperature of approximately 5,778K (5,505°C, 9,941°F), and V that it, like most <b>stars,</b> <b>is</b> a main-sequence star. The average luminance of the Sun is about 1.88gigacandela per square metre, but as viewed through Earth's atmosphere, this is lowered to about 1.44Gcd/m2. However, the luminance is not constant across the disk of the Sun (limb darkening).|$|E
5|$|The disks of most {{stars are}} much too small in angular size to be {{observed}} with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of <b>stars</b> <b>is</b> through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that most visible <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> binary: they have a nearby {{companion}} star, and these two stars orbit around each other. Based on this fact, until recently, astronomers believed that, in general, most <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> binary. A few years ago, a surprising paper showed that while most bright <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> indeed binary, most dim <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> single. In this paper, we provide a simple qualitative explanation for this empirical fact...|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The reason that stars such as Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most <b>stars,</b> <b>is</b> largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} of cool <b>stars</b> <b>is</b> difficult due to {{the formation}} of diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of <b>stars</b> <b>is</b> very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E
50|$|In pairs {{where the}} two <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> of equal brightness, they are also of the same {{spectral}} type.In systems where the brightnesses are different, the fainter <b>star</b> <b>is</b> bluer if the brighter <b>star</b> <b>is</b> a giant <b>star,</b> and redder if the brighter star belongs to the main sequence.|$|R

50|$|A binary <b>star</b> <b>is</b> a <b>star</b> system {{consisting}} of two stars orbiting around their common center of mass. The brighter <b>star</b> <b>is</b> called the primary and the lesser <b>is</b> its companion <b>star,</b> or secondary. A binary <b>star</b> <b>is</b> one kind of double star : a star that resolves visually into two separate <b>stars</b> that <b>are</b> very close together {{as seen from the}} Earth; the other type of double <b>star</b> <b>is</b> an optical double, {{consisting of}} stars of significantly differing distances or velocities which merely appear near each other in the sky but are dynamically unrelated.|$|R
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope {{has been}} used to provide convincing {{observational}} evidence of this stellar mass-sorting process in globular clusters. Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster's periphery. The globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, which is made up of about 1 million <b>stars,</b> <b>is</b> one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey, which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars. Precise velocities were obtained for nearly 15,000 stars in this cluster.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{core radius}} is about 8 light years and tidal radius is about 43 light years. The cluster {{contains}} over 1,000 statistically confirmed members, although this figure excludes unresolved binary stars. Its light {{is dominated by}} young, hot blue stars, up to 14 {{of which can be}} seen with the naked eye depending on local observing conditions. The arrangement of the brightest <b>stars</b> <b>is</b> somewhat similar to Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The total mass contained in the cluster is estimated to be about 800 solar masses and is dominated by fainter and redder stars.|$|E

The story is told {{from the perspective of}} Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.|$|E
