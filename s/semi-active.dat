5|$|The AN/APG-68, an {{evolution}} of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for <b>semi-active</b> radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.|$|E

25|$|The missile was {{designed}} to be single-staged, inertial guidance, radio control mid-course update and terminal <b>semi-active</b> radar homing.|$|E
25|$|The ABM-1 was {{introduced}} during the 1960s with mechanically steered <b>semi-active</b> radar guidance. It contained a high-yield nuclear warhead, {{comparable to the}} U.S. Nike Zeus.|$|E
25|$|A variant called Blue Dolphin or Blue Jay Mk. V, was proposed, using <b>semi-active</b> radar homing for {{capability}} {{similar to}} the AIM-7 Sparrow, but this was cancelled in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Sea-based radar systems, <b>semi-active</b> radar homing, active radar homing, weather radar, {{military}} aircraft, and {{radar astronomy}} {{rely on the}} Doppler effect to enhance performance. This produces information about target velocity during the detection process. This also allows small objects to be detected in an environment containing much larger nearby slow moving objects.|$|E
25|$|As built, the AAM-N-5 Meteor was a {{two-stage}} missile, utilizing <b>semi-active</b> radar homing; {{the first}} stage consisted of a solid-fueled rocket booster, with the main sustainer stage utilizing liquid fuels. It had a range of , and reached speeds of over Mach 2, with some sources claiming {{a top speed of}} Mach 3. Control was provided by cruciform fins.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} with 9M38M1, the 9M317 has a larger defeat area, which {{is up to}} 45km of range and 25km of altitude and of lateral parameter, and a larger target classification. Externally the 9M317 differs from the 9M38M1 by a smaller wing chord. It uses the inertial correction control system with <b>semi-active</b> radar homing, utilising the proportional navigation (PN) targeting method.|$|E
25|$|In 1955 Xu {{was one of}} ten {{officers}} {{awarded the}} rank of Senior General, or Da Jiang (大将), {{the first time that}} the rank of Senior General was established. Xu maintained his employment within the People's Liberation Army, but was only <b>semi-active</b> due to his medical condition. Xu was the chief editor of a book, the Military History of the Red 25th Army.|$|E
25|$|The Mark II {{avionics}} were digitally integrated microprocessor systems, some of {{the first}} used by the USAF, offering tremendous capability, but substantial problems. The Rockwell Autonetics digital bombing-navigation system included inertial navigation system, AN/APQ-130 attack radar system and Doppler radar. It also included digital computer set and multi-function displays (MFDs). The terrain-following radar was the Sperry AN/APQ-128. The attack radar featured a Doppler beam-sharpening, moving target indication (MTI), and Continuous-wave radar for guiding <b>semi-active</b> radar homing missiles.|$|E
25|$|The RIM-101 missile {{was planned}} to be a tube-launched weapon, a small ejector charge being used to propel the missile from its {{launching}} tube before ignition of a solid-fueled rocket sustainer, based on that of the FIM-43 Redeye SAM. Midcourse guidance of the new missile was {{planned to be}} of the <b>semi-active</b> radar homing type, using an I-band radar system, while terminal guidance would be provided by an infrared seeker. However, the RIM-101 project was cancelled early in the design-and-development stage, before any hardware had been built.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} F-89H, which entered {{service in}} 1956, had an E-9 fire control system {{like that of}} the early F-102 and massive new wingtip pods each holding three Falcons (usually three <b>semi-active</b> radar homing GAR-1s and three infrared GAR-2s) and 21 FFARs, for a total of six missiles and 42 rockets. Problems with the fire control system delayed the -H's entry into service, by which time its performance was notably inferior to newer supersonic interceptors, so it was phased out of USAF service by 1959.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{occupies the}} <b>semi-active</b> craters of the Furnas and Povoação volcanoes, circled by forests, mountains and river valleys to the north, west and east, while the Atlantic coast to the south. From 100,000 to 95,000 years ago, the Povoação crater, {{associated with the}} volcano, consists of volcanic products that were emitted from this volcano of the same name, that overlay the Volcanic Complex of Nordeste. Corresponding basaltic lava flows and other volcanic ejectants, {{the top of this}} formation is covered by materials involved in explosive eruptions from the Furnas volcano.|$|E
25|$|Based on an air-to-air missile, the beam-riding Kh-66 {{had been}} the Soviet Union's first {{air-to-ground}} missile for tactical aircraft, entering service in 1968. However it proved difficult to use in practice as the launch aircraft had to dive towards the target. A version with radio-command guidance, the Kh-23, was first tested in 1968 but problems with the guidance system meant {{that it would not}} enter service for another five years. So in 1971 work began on a version with a <b>semi-active</b> laser seeker, which became the Kh-25. This was initially known in the West as the Kh-23L. State testing began on 24 November 1974, and the Kh-25 entered production in 1975.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{following}} a requirement established by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) {{for a new}} gun capable of firing <b>semi-active</b> laser guided projectiles (SAL GP), the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division worked on the Major Caliber Lightweight Gun (MCLWG) program, testing capability of destroyer-sized ships to provide shore bombardment support with the range previously available from decommissioned cruisers. The 8"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun, a single gun version of the 8"/55 Mark 16 caliber gun was mounted aboard the [...] However, after at-sea technical evaluation in 1975 and operational testing that followed through 1976, The Operational Test and Evaluation Force determined inaccuracy made the gun operationally unsuitable. The lightweight 8"/55 was concluded {{to be no more}} effective than the 5"/54 with Rocket Assisted Projectiles. Program funding was terminated in 1978.|$|E
500|$|The Israeli Army {{introduced}} a new round known as the Laser Homing Anti-Tank (LAHAT) projectile. Using a <b>semi-active</b> laser homing guidance method, the LAHAT can be guided by the tank's crew or by teams on the ground, while the missile's trajectory can be selected to either attack from the top (to defeat enemy armor) or direct attack (to engage enemy helicopters). Furthermore, the missile can be fired by both [...] and 120mm tank guns. The LAHAT has been offered as an option for the Leopard 2, and has been marketed by both Israel Military Industries and Rheinmetall to Leopard 2 users. Israeli Merkavas make use of a round known as the APAM, which is an anti-personnel munition designed to release fragmentation at controlled intervals to limit the extent of damage. Fragments are shaped to have enough kinetic energy to penetrate body armor.|$|E
500|$|The Su-25T (Tankovy) is a {{dedicated}} antitank version, {{which has been}} combat-tested with notable success in Chechnya. The design of the aircraft {{is similar to the}} Su-25UB. The variant was converted to one-seater, with the rear seat replaced by additional avionics. [...] It has all-weather and night attack capability. In addition to the full arsenal of weapons of the standard Su-25, the Su-25T can employ the KAB-500Kr TV-guided bomb and the <b>semi-active</b> laser-guided Kh-25ML. [...] Its enlarged nosecone houses the Shkval optical TV and aiming system with the Prichal laser rangefinder and target designator. It can also carry Vikhr laser-guided, tube-launched missiles, which is its main antitank armament. For night operations, the low-light TV Merkuriy pod system can be carried under the fuselage. Three Su-25Ts prototypes were built in 1983–86 and 8 production aircraft were built in 1990. With the introduction of a definitive Russian Air Force Su-25 upgrade programme, in the form of Stroyevoy Modernizirovannyi, the Su-25T programme was officially canceled in 2000.|$|E
500|$|In Japan, {{the launch}} of Lexus was {{complicated}} by Toyota's existing four domestic dealership networks {{at the time of}} its introduction. The Toyota Crown and Toyota Century were exclusive to Toyota Store locations. During the LS 400's development, local dealers' requests for a Japanese domestic market version had grown, and a right-hand-drive Toyota Celsior-badged version was introduced shortly after the LS 400's U.S. debut, and introduced 9 October 1989 and only available at Toyopet Store locations. The Celsior, named after the Latin word for [...] "supreme", was largely identical to the LS. Models came in either basic [...] "A", upgraded suspension [...] "B", or fully equipped [...] "C" [...] trim specifications. The Crown and the Crown Majesta, which appeared later in 1991, were only available at Toyota Store locations which carried Japan-only Toyota luxury models, like the Century. The Celsior introduced two world firsts: high-performance twin-tube shock absorbers and an air suspension combined with an upgraded version of Toyota's <b>semi-active</b> dampers Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension, called Piezo TEMS. This was ahead of its time, Mercedes-Benz first introduced a similar electronically controlled air suspension on the 1999 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220) (Airmatic).|$|E

2500|$|... 3D Short Range Radar for the Indian Air Force – ASLESHA: The ASLESHA radars have a {{range of}} {{approximately}} 50km against small fighter-sized targets and will be able to determine their range, speed, azimuth and height. This radar will enable the Indian Air Force Air Defence units to accurately track low level intruders. The radar is a <b>semi-active</b> phased array with a 1-metre square aperture. The DRDO was in discussions with the Indian Navy to mount these systems on small ships.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the main weapon for the Anzacs was a United Defense 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 Mod 2 dual purpose gun. The forward-mounted gun is capable of firing [...] shells {{at a rate of}} 20 rounds per minute, to a {{distance}} of [...] The barrel can elevate to 65 degrees. This was supplemented by an eight-cell Lockheed Martin Mark 41 Mod 5 vertical launch system for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles as a point-defence system. The Sea Sparrow is a <b>semi-active</b> radar homing missile, with a [...] warhead, a range of , and a top speed of Mach 2.5. Two [...] machine guns were fitted for close defence.|$|E
2500|$|The JA 37 fighter interceptor, {{introduced}} in 1979, featured the Ericsson PS 46/A radar, which {{was capable of}} guiding the medium-range <b>semi-active</b> radar homing RB 71 Skyflash air-to-air missiles. Both the RB 71 and the PS 46/A radar were designed to provide the Viggen with a look-down/shoot-down capability and to engage targets at beyond visual range distances. [...] The JA 37 could carry up to two RB 71s on the fuselage pylons; in a typical air defense loadout, these would typically had been combined with four RB 24J/RB 24J air-to-air missiles, a more capable and newer version of the Sidewinder missile than employed on earlier Viggen variants.|$|E
2500|$|The 9M38 uses a {{single-stage}} X-winged design {{without any}} detachable parts; its exterior design {{is similar to}} the American Tartar and Standard surface-to-air missile series, which led to the half-serious nickname of Standardski. The design had to conform to strict naval dimension limitations, allowing the missile to be adapted for the M-22 SAM system in the Soviet Navy. Each missile is [...] long, weighs [...] and carries a relatively large [...] warhead which is triggered by a radar proximity fuze. In the forward compartment of the missile, a <b>semi-active</b> homing radar head (9E50, [...] ), autopilot equipment, power source and warhead are located. The homing method chosen was proportional navigation. Some elements of the missile were compatible with the Kub's 3M9; for example, its forward compartment diameter (33cm), which was less than the rear compartment diameter.|$|E
2500|$|The F-101B was {{stripped}} of the four M39 cannons and carried four AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles instead, arranged two apiece on a rotating pallet in the fuselage weapons bay. The initial load was two GAR-1 (AIM-4A) <b>semi-active</b> radar homing and two GAR-2 (AIM-4B) infrared-guided weapons with one of each carried {{on each side of}} the rotating pallet. After the first two missiles were fired, the door turned over to expose the second pair. Standard practice was to fire the weapons in SARH/IR pairs to increase the likelihood of a hit. Late-production models had provision for two 1.7-kiloton MB-1/AIR-2 Genie nuclear rockets on one side of the pallet with IR-guided GAR-2A (AIM-4C) on the other side. [...] "Project Kitty Car" [...] upgraded most earlier F-101Bs to this standard beginning in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the F-102, the F-106 was {{designed}} without a gun, or provision for carrying bombs, but it carried its missiles in an internal weapons bay for clean supersonic flight. It was armed with four Hughes AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles, {{along with a}} single GAR-11/AIM-26A Falcon nuclear-tipped <b>semi-active</b> radar homing (SARH) missile (which detected reflected radar signals), or a 1.5 kiloton-warhead AIR-2 (MB-2) Genie air-to-air [...] rocket intended to be fired into enemy bomber formations. Like its predecessor, the F-102 Delta Dagger, it could carry a drop tank under each wing. Later fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle carried missiles recessed in the fuselage or externally, but stealth aircraft would re-adopt the idea of carrying missiles or bombs internally for reduced radar signature.|$|E
2500|$|The Tornado ADV's {{differences}} {{compared to}} the IDS include a greater sweep angle on the wing gloves, and the deletion of their kruger flaps, deletion of the port cannon, a longer radome for the Foxhunter radar, slightly longer airbrakes and a fuselage stretch of 1.36m to allow the carriage of four Skyflash <b>semi-active</b> radar homing missiles. The stretch {{was applied to the}} Tornado front fuselage being built by the UK, with a plug being added immediately behind the cockpit, which had the unexpected benefit of reducing drag and making space for an additional fuel tank (Tank '0') carrying [...] of fuel. The artificial feel of the flight controls was lighter on the ADV than on the IDS. Various internal avionics, pilot displays, guidance systems and software also differed; including an automatic wing sweep selector not fitted to the strike aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} F-102A had the Hughes MG-3 {{fire control}} system, later upgraded {{in service to}} the MG-10. It had a three-segment internal weapons bay under the fuselage for air-to-air missiles. Initial armament was three pairs of GAR-1/2/3/4 (Later re-designated as AIM-4) Falcon missiles, which included both infrared homing and <b>semi-active</b> radar homing variants. [...] The doors of the two forward bays each had tubes for 12 FFARs (for a total of 24) with initially 2in (5.1cm) being fitted and later 2.75in (70mm) replacing them. The F-102 was later upgraded to allow the carrying of up to two GAR-11/AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon missiles in the center bay. The larger size of this weapon required redesigned center bay doors with no rocket tubes. Plans were considered to fit the MB-1 Genie nuclear rocket to the design, but although a Genie was test fired from a YF-102A in May 1956, it was never adopted.|$|E
2500|$|Armed with a 120mm rifled gun, the Arjun is {{believed}} to be capable of firing APFSDS (kinetic energy penetrator) rounds, HE, HEAT, High Explosive Squash Head (HESH) rounds at the rate of 6-8 rounds per minute and the Israeli developed <b>semi-active</b> laser guided LAHAT missile. The LAHAT is a gun-launched missile and is designed to defeat both enemy armour and enemy combat helicopters. In addition, the Arjun is armed with a 12.7mm AA machine gun and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun. The Arjun can carry 39 rounds in special blast-proof canisters. The Arjun uses a manual loader and has a crewman to reload the gun. Although the Arjun was planned to be equipped with the Israeli LAHAT missile, plans to fit it to the tank were later dropped; the missile has an effective range of 6,000 meters, but it could not meet the Indian Army's requirements of engaging targets at less than 1,200 meters. [...] An indigenously-developed anti-tank missile will now have to be created for the Arjun. Indigenously developed missile with a range of 5km was test fired successfully from Arjun against a tank target.|$|E
2500|$|The OFC (Optical Fire Control) -3 {{electro-optical}} {{fire control}} {{system is a}} modular design that consists of a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can {{be replaced by a}} laser designator (for the laser beam riding SAM), the TV camera can be replaced by a night vision camera, and the IR camera can be replaced by an ImIR, at higher cost. Development to incorporate the dual band IR, night vision camera, and the color TV camera has been successfully completed, but it is unclear if these newly developed versions will be [...] installed on any of the ships. [...] The OFC-3 optronics is designed by the Central China Optronic (electro-optical) Research Institute. [...] Although the advanced versions have been [...] successfully tested, only the most basic version have been installed on board Type 052C class, as acknowledged by the developer, and domestic Chinese media rumored the main reason was to reduce the cost. [...] However, the adaptation of the most basic version of OFC-3 results in great decrease in the performance and effectiveness of the main gun, because without the laser designator needed, laser beam riding and <b>semi-active</b> laser guided projectiles can not be deployed for the Type 210 100 mm naval gun.|$|E
2500|$|Jugan began refereeing {{matches in}} the Pittsburgh-area for the WWF during the mid-1980s.
