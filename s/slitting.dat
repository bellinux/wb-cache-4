40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the axon guidance proteins <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 co-operate to establish the optic chiasm in its correct position at the ventral diencephalic midline. This is based on the observation that, although both <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 are expressed around the ventral midline, mice defective in either gene alone exhibit few or no axon guidance defects at the optic chiasm whereas embryos lacking both <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 develop a large additional chiasm anterior to the chiasm’s normal position. Here we used steerable-filters to quantify key properties of the population of axons at the chiasm in wild-type, <b>Slit</b> 1 −/−, <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− embryos. Results We applied the steerable-filter algorithm successfully to images of embryonic retinal axons labelled from a single eye shortly after they have crossed the midline. We combined data from multiple embryos of the same genotype and made statistical comparisons of axonal distributions, orientations and curvatures between genotype groups. We compared data from the analysis of axons with data on the expression of <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2. The results showed a misorientation and a corresponding anterior shift in the position of many axons at the chiasm of both <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− mutants. There were very few axon defects at the chiasm of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− mutants. Conclusions We found defects of the chiasms of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− mutants similar to those reported previously. In addition, we discovered previously unreported defects resulting from loss of <b>Slit</b> 2 alone. This indicates the value of a quantitative approach to complex pathway analysis and shows that <b>Slit</b> 2 can act alone to control aspects of retinal axon routing across the ventral diencephalic midline. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slits,</b> {{a family}} of {{secreted}} proteins, are crucial for axon guidance during {{the development of the}} central nervous system. In rats, <b>Slit</b> 1, <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3 mRNA are expressed in midline glial populations surrounding the developing corpus callosum (Marillat et al., 2002). A previous study has shown that mice lacking the <b>Slit</b> 2 gene have an acallosal phenotype (Bagri et al., 2002). However, the role of <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 3 {{in the development of the}} corpus callosum is unknown. In the present study expression analysis of <b>Slit</b> 1, <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3 mRNA performed on mice, showed that these molecules were expressed around the developing corpus callosum. To understand the role each <b>Slit</b> might play in the development of the corpus callosum, 4 <b>Slit</b> mutant mouse strains, <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-, <b>Slit</b> 2 -/-, <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- and <b>Slit</b> 3 -/- mice were analysed. This study confirmed that <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice displayed dysgenesis of the corpus callosum across its rostro-caudal extent. Mice lacking the <b>Slit</b> 1 gene did not exhibit an acallosal phenotype, however, <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice displayed a more severe phenotype compared to mice deficient in <b>Slit</b> 2 alone, indicating a role for <b>Slit</b> 1 in corpus callosum development. A subset of the <b>Slit</b> 3 -/- mice displayed an axon guidance defect in the corpus callosum, where the callosal axons in the dorsal region of the tract failed to cross the midline. This defect was observed in embryonic as well as postnatal ages. The callosal axon guidance defects in <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- and <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice were also observed at earlier stages during the development of the cingulate pioneering axons of the corpus callosum. Apart from axon guidance <b>Slit</b> 1, <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3 were involved in the development of the glial populations at the midline of the cerebral cortex. <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- and <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice exhibited a positional defect where the indusium griseum glia was ventrally displaced. The glial-positioning defect in <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice was more severe compared to <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice. No positional defect was observed in <b>Slit</b> 3 -/- mice, however the development of the indusium griseum glia was affected. To compare the axon guidance phenotype of the <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice, and the knockout of its known receptor Robo 1 -/- mice, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and tractography was performed on <b>Slit</b> 2 -/-, and Robo 1 -/- mice. These experiments showed that the axon guidance defect in <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice is similar, but more severe compared to Robo 1 -/- mice. The axons of the CC are displaced rostrocaudally in both <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- and Robo 1 -/- mice. In Robo 1 -/- mice only the pre-crossing axons are affected while in <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice both the pre-crossing as well as post-crossing axons are affected. These results suggest a possible role for <b>Slit</b> in the development of the telencephalic midline, where it is first involved in the proper positioning and development of the midline glial populations and then acts as an axon guidance molecule for the crossing of callosal axons to their homotypic targets in the contralateral hemisphere...|$|R

Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped off her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by <b>slitting</b> his throat with a khukuri on 28 July 1839. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1939, at the age of 64. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals.

In this study, we characterized the cellular distribution and processing of mammalian <b>Slit</b> 3 gene product, the least evolutionarily conserved of the vertebrate <b>Slit</b> genes, in kidney epithelial cells, using both cellular fractionation and immunolabeling. <b>Slit</b> 3, but not <b>Slit</b> 2, was predominantly localized within the mitochondria.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Slit</b> {{molecules}} are chemorepulsive ligands {{that regulate}} axon guidance at the midline of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In mammals, {{there are three}} <b>Slit</b> genes, but only <b>Slit</b> 2 has been studied in any detail with regard to mammalian brain commissure formation. Here, we sought to understand the relative contributions that <b>Slit</b> proteins make {{to the formation of}} the largest brain commissure, the corpus callosum. <b>Slit</b> ligands bind Robo receptors, and previous studies have shown that Robo 1 −/− mice have defects in corpus callosum development. However, whether the <b>Slit</b> genes signal exclusively through Robo 1 during callosal formation is unclear. To investigate this, we compared the development of the corpus callosum in both <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and Robo 1 −/− mice using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. This analysis demonstrated similarities in the phenotypes of these mice, but crucially also highlighted subtle differences, particularly with regard to the guidance of post-crossing axons. Analysis of single mutations in <b>Slit</b> family members revealed corpus callosum defects (but not complete agenesis) in 100 % of <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− mice and 30 % of <b>Slit</b> 3 −/− mice, whereas 100 % of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/−; <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− mice displayed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. These results revealed a role for <b>Slit</b> 1 in corpus callosum development, and demonstrated that <b>Slit</b> 2 was necessary but not sufficient for midline crossing in vivo. However, co-culture experiments utilising Robo 1 −/− tissue versus <b>Slit</b> 2 expressing cell blocks demonstrated that <b>Slit</b> 2 was sufficient for the guidance activity mediated by Robo 1 in pre-crossing neocortical axons. This suggested that <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 3 might also be involved in regulating other mechanisms that allow the corpus callosum to form, such as the establishment of midline glial populations. Investigation of this revealed defects in the development and dorso-ventral positioning of the indusium griseum glia in multiple <b>Slit</b> mutants. These findings indicate that <b>Slits</b> regulate callosal development via both classical chemorepulsive mechanisms, and via a novel role in mediating the correct positioning of midline glial populations. Finally, our data also indicate that some of the roles of <b>Slit</b> proteins at the midline may be independent of Robo signalling, suggestive of additional receptors regulating <b>Slit</b> signalling during development...|$|R

In this thesis, we have expanded this knowledge by examining several in vitro and in vivo functions of <b>Slit</b> 2 and its homolog, <b>Slit</b> 1, in axon guidance and NC migration. We have found that: (1) <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 act as chemorepellents for cultured embryonic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons; (2) Over-expression of a truncated form of the <b>Slit</b> receptor Robo 1, Robo 1 -Δ- 67, blocks the activities of <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 in cultured RGC neurons; (3) <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 act as chemorepellents for migrating NC cells in vitro, and (4) Mis-expression of <b>Slit</b> 2 inhibits NC migration, resulting in smaller-sized dorsal root ganglia (DRG).
