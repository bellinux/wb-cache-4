There {{is no way to}} <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.|$|E

[...] If the delta function is already understood as a measure, then the Lebesgue integral of a test function against that measure supplies the necessary integral.|$|E

500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that [...] " [...] will inevitably {{have a significant impact on}} the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> result of that will be." [...] He added: [...] "t is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what [...] "all the fuss" [...] was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E

Fisk reports further on this incident: [...] "The Israelis did not <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> soldier was doing ... I discovered that he was visiting one of Haddad's artillery positions (Christian militia) and that the mine could have been lain [...] {{as long ago as}} 1978, perhaps even by the Israelis themselves".|$|E

2500|$|The Fringe's own {{position}} on this debate may be summed up by Michael Dale (Fringe Administrator 1982–1986) in his book Sore Throats & Overdrafts, [...] "No-one can <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> quality will be like overall. It does not much matter, actually, for {{that is not the}} point of the Fringe ... The Fringe is a forum for ideas and achievement unique in the UK, and in the whole world ... Where else could all this be attempted, let alone work?". Views from the middle ground of this perennial debate point out that the Fringe is not complete artistic anarchy. Some venues do influence or decide on the content of their programme, such as the Traverse and Aurora Nova, who used to run their own venue but are now just a production group.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012 a Parisian {{auction house}} {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text. In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an [...] "ambassador of the human spirit". The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: [...] "I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling'," [...] he says. Saint-Exupéry's text does not <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> word is, but experts believe it could be [...] "guerre" [...] (or [...] "war"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as {{a key factor in}} military confrontations between nations.|$|E

When the great French conductor Roger Désormière was paralysed by a stroke in 1952 Boulez sent scripts to French Radio in Désormière's name so that his mentor could collect the fee. The writer Jean Vermeil, who observed Boulez in the 1990s in the company of Jean Batigne (founder of the Percussions de Strasbourg), discovered [...] "a Boulez asking about the health of a musician in the Strasbourg orchestra, about another player's children, a Boulez who knew everyone by name and who reacted to each person's news with sadness or with joy." [...] In later life, he was known for his charm and personal warmth. Of his humour, Gerard McBurney wrote that it [...] "depended on his twinkling eyes, his perfect timing, his infectious schoolboy giggle, and his reckless compulsion always to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other person would not expect." [...] His close friends included Daniel Barenboim and Patrice Chéreau.|$|E
