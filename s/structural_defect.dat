5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common <b>structural</b> <b>defect</b> in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with {{different}} indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E

25|$|Surgery may {{be carried}} out if {{conservative}} measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no <b>structural</b> <b>defect,</b> or only limited EAS <b>structural</b> <b>defect,</b> or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.|$|E

25|$|During construction, {{questions}} were publicly {{raised about the}} stability of the building's foundations in light of the water table on the site and the presence of a subterranean stream. Liebe conferred with the architect and engineers before developing a revised design which featured drains to divert running water. Liebe presented the modified plans to Molloy and proceeded with them, assuming that he had the consent of Molloy. Construction progressed, and the building was completed on schedule. When the time finally came for Molloy to pay Liebe for the construction, a dispute arose as to who should be liable for the extra Â£17,000 incurred in remedying the <b>structural</b> <b>defect.</b> Molloy was reputed {{to be one of the}} most litigious businessmen in Perth, and refused to pay higher than the original agreed price, on the basis that the contract required his written approval for extra work to be carried out. Liebe pursued him through the courts all the way to the High Court and Privy Council. The Privy Council eventually ruled in favour of Liebe, however the legal costs he had incurred were exorbitant.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{this mode}} is misleading: it is given because in graphite, this mode is usually the second strongest after the G mode. However, it is {{actually}} the second overtone of the defect-induced D mode (and thus should logically be named D'). Its intensity is stronger {{than that of the}} D mode due to different selection rules. In particular, D mode is forbidden in the ideal nanotube and requires a <b>structural</b> <b>defect,</b> providing a phonon of certain angular momentum, to be induced. In contrast, G' mode involves a [...] "self-annihilating" [...] pair of phonons and thus does not require defects. The spectral position of G' mode depends on diameter, so it can be used roughly to estimate the SWCNT diameter. In particular, G' mode is a doublet in double-wall carbon nanotubes, but the doublet is often unresolved due to line broadening.|$|E

40|$|It is {{critical}} to understand the behavior of metallic impurities in polycrystalline silicon used for solar cells.

2500|$|There are a {{broad range}} of {{psychological}} and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience. One competing theory has radically stated that macropsia may be an entirely psychological pathological phenomenon without any <b>structural</b> <b>defect</b> or definite cause. He or she may be in an irritable or angry state, or in contrast, a euphoric state. There is evidence that those who experience Alice in Wonderland Syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail. There may be no evidence of psychiatric disturbance and, as a result, no psychiatric therapy may be required. Psychological conditions often arise from macropsia, but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia. Those afflicted may experience extreme anxiety both during and after episodes {{as a result of the}} overwhelming nature of his or her distorted visual field. Due to the fear and anxiety associated with the condition, those who have previously suffered an episode hesitate to recount the episode, although retain the ability to do so. Psychologically, a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family. This feeling of dissociation has mostly been noted in child or adolescent patients. [...] The patient may feel that he or she must unfairly contend with hostile and aggressive forces due to the gigantic nature of the surrounding environment. The defense against said forces is usually expressed verbally. The patient may falsely present an outgoing or flamboyant persona, while remaining fearful of people internally. He or she, in an attempt to balance the size distortion, may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior. The psychological impact of macropsia on long time sufferers who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies. An alternate interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots. Thus, when a patient reaches for an enlarged object, he or she is overcoming that physiological contraction [...] However, this theory has been under much scrutiny.|$|E
60|$|Young {{people and}} unseasoned people, Benham argued, {{are apt to}} imagine that if fear is {{increased}} and carried to an extreme pitch it becomes unbearable, one will faint or die; given a weak heart, a weak artery or any such <b>structural</b> <b>defect</b> and that may well happen, {{but it is just}} as possible that as the stimulation increases one passes through a brief ecstasy of terror to a new sane world, exalted but as sane as normal existence. There is the calmness of despair. Benham had made some notes to enforce this view, of the observed calm behaviour of men already hopelessly lost, men on sinking ships, men going to execution, men already maimed and awaiting the final stroke, {{but for the most part}} these were merely references to books and periodicals. In exactly the same way, he argued, we exaggerate the range of pain as if it were limitless. We think if we are unthinking that it passes into agony and so beyond endurance to destruction. It probably does nothing of the kind. Benham compared pain to the death range of the electric current. At a certain voltage it thrills, at a greater it torments and convulses, at a still greater it kills. But at enormous voltages, as Tesla was the first to demonstrate, it does no injury. And following on this came memoranda on the recorded behaviour of martyrs, on the self-torture of Hindoo ascetics, of the defiance of Red Indian prisoners.|$|E
