40|$|Background: The {{foundation}} {{of health and}} medical research is data. Data sharing facilitates the progress of research and strengthens science. Data sharing in research is widely discussed in the literature; however, there are seemingly no evidence-based incentives that promote data sharing. Methods: A systematic review (registration: doi. org/ 10. 17605 /OSF. IO/ 6 PZ 5 E) of the health and medical research literature was used to uncover any evidence-based incentives, with pre- and post-empirical data that examined data <b>sharing</b> <b>rates.</b> We were also interested in quantifying and classifying the number of opinion pieces {{on the importance of}} incentives, the number observational studies that analysed data <b>sharing</b> <b>rates</b> and practices, and strategies aimed at increasing data <b>sharing</b> <b>rates.</b> Results: Only one incentive (using open data badges) has been tested in health and medical research that examined data <b>sharing</b> <b>rates.</b> The number of opinion pieces (n[*]=[*] 85) out-weighed the number of article-testing strategies (n[*]=[*] 76), and the number of observational studies exceeded them both (n[*]=[*] 106). Conclusions: Given that data is the {{foundation of}} evidence-based health and medical research, it is paradoxical {{that there is only one}} evidence-based incentive to promote data sharing. More well-designed studies are needed in order to increase the currently low <b>rates</b> of data <b>sharing...</b>|$|R

The transfer prices between different echelons in the supply chain influence the total supply chain profits. The study aims to explore various transfer pricing heuristics on the supply chain coordination in terms of the supply chain profits and their interactions with the revenue <b>sharing</b> <b>rate.</b> A model is proposed for formulating the collaborative production and distribution planning in a decentralized supply chain with the revenue sharing mechanism. Experiment results indicate that the transfer price and the revenue <b>sharing</b> <b>rate</b> affect significantly the coordination.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on incentives and Chinese economic reform. In the first essay, I collect a unique dataset of Chinese municipalities from 1978 to 2007 to evaluate {{the impact of a}} Special Economic Zone experiment with incentives including property rights protection, tax breaks and a preferential land policy for foreign investors. Guided by a theoretical model, I find the SEZ policy: 1) increases per capita foreign direct investment by 58 %; 2) does not crowd out domestic investment and 3) increases TFP growth rate by 0. 6 percentage points. The results suggest that SEZs not only bring capital, but also more advanced technology. In the second essay, I evaluate the fiscal incentive - the marginal <b>sharing</b> <b>rate</b> of fiscal revenue faced by Chinese provincial governments. In 1994, China engaged in a fiscal reform which set marginal <b>sharing</b> <b>rates</b> of budgetary taxes across provinces to a uniform level. Exploiting heterogeneity in the pre-reform budgetary <b>sharing</b> <b>rate,</b> I find that provinces with lower pre-existing rates collect more budgetary taxes; at the same time less extra-budgetary revenue after 1994 relative to those with higher starting level. The results suggest that Chinese provincial governments treat the budgetary tax and extra-budgetary revenue as substitutes. The third essay studies the impact of Chinese municipal governments' fiscal <b>sharing</b> <b>rate</b> on the local economy. The fiscal regime change in 2002 largely reduced the local <b>sharing</b> <b>rate</b> of enterprise income tax. I find that municipal governments respond to this change by allocating more resources including land and capital into the real estate sector, leading to social conflicts between local governments and farmers whose lands were taken with low compensation. The results imply that regional decentralization has to be matched with well-designed incentives to benefit {{the majority of the population}} within the jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} control protocol (TCP) is the major trans- port layer protocol in the Internet today. TCP and its vari- ants have the drawback of not knowing the explicit <b>rate</b> <b>share</b> of flows at bottleneck links. The Rate Control Proto- col (RCP) is a major clean slate congestion control protocol which has been recently proposed to address these draw- backs. RCP tries to get explicit knowledge of flow shares at bottleneck links. However, RCP under or over estimates the number of active flows which it needs to obtain the flow fair <b>rate</b> <b>share.</b> This causes under or over utilization of bot- tleneck link capacity. This in turn can result in very high queue length and packet drops which translate into a high average file completion time (AFCT). In this paper we present the design and analysis of a Network congestion Control Protocol (NCP). NCP can give flows their fair <b>share</b> <b>rates</b> and hence resulting in the minimum AFCT. Unlike RCP, NCP can also use accurate formula to calculate the number of flows sharing a network link. This enables NCP to assign fair <b>share</b> <b>rates</b> to flows without over or under-utilization of bottleneck link capacities.

30|$|Roughly speaking, the {{proposed}} approach to predictability assessment involves determining how probable {{it is to}} reach the SSI from a CSS and deciding if these reachability properties are compatible with the prediction goals. If a system’s reachability characteristics are incompatible with the given prediction question – if, say, “hit” and “flop” states in the online market example are both fairly likely to be reached from the CSS – then the situation is deemed unpredictable. This setup permits the identification of candidate predictive measurables: these are the measurable states and/or parameters for which predictability is most sensitive (see Appendix Two). Continuing with the online market example, if trajectories with positive early market share rates r(A) {{are much more likely}} to yield market share dominance for A than are trajectories with negative early r(A), then the situation is unpredictable (because the outcome depends sensitively on r(A) and this quantity is not measured). Moreover, this analysis suggests that market <b>share</b> <b>rate</b> is likely to possess predictive power, so it may be possible to increase predictability by adding the capacity to measure this quantity.|$|E
