50|$|The {{sibilant}} <b>sirystes</b> (<b>Sirystes</b> sibilator) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It was formerly considered conspecific with the western <b>sirystes,</b> the white-rumped <b>sirystes,</b> and Todd's <b>sirystes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sirystes</b> is a genus {{of birds}} in the tyrant flycatcher family, Tyrannidae. They used to be all {{considered}} conspecific. Vocal differences primarily separated the superspecies into four distinct taxa.|$|E
50|$|The rufous mourner (Rhytipterna holerythra) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family. It breeds from southwestern Mexico to northwestern Ecuador. It was formerly {{believed to be a}} cotinga, but well-supported anatomical evidence has shown it to be related to tyrant flycatchers of the genera Myiarchus, <b>Sirystes</b> and Casiornis.|$|E
5000|$|The cherry-throated tanager {{moves through}} its habitat singly, in pairs (especially during {{breeding}} season) {{or in small}} flocks led by a dominant bird. If undisturbed, it utilizes regular [...] "tracks" [...] to visit feeding sites {{over the course of}} the day; these tracks vary according to season. It is apparently a resident bird; there is no indication even for altitudinal migrations. The species, like many tanagers, joins mixed-species feeding flocks. Those in which N. rourei was observed to participate were usually led by <b>Sirystes</b> and contained chestnut-crowned becards and rufous-headed tanagers as [...] "core" [...] species. The food of adult birds at least seems to consist entirely or nearly entirely of small invertebrates such as caterpillars, butterflies, ants, and other arthropods; Eucalyptus flowers are visited though it is not clear whether to feed on nectar or on nectar-feeding insects. Food is taken by gleaning and clambering through branches to look under leaves as typical for tanagers (Isler & Isler 1987); the birds do not hang down from branches like titmice.(Bauer et al. 2000, Venturini et al. 2005) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sirystes</b> {{was for a}} {{long time}} treated as a {{monotypic}} genus with several subspecies, one of which was recently proposed for species rank. Vocal differentiation in the genus was studied using quantitative methods and the determination of primary, secondary and other kinds of vocalizations for different populations. The widely recognized split of Western <b>Sirystes</b> S. albogriseus of the Chocó (Panama, Colombia and Ecuador) from the more widespread Eastern <b>Sirystes</b> S. sibilator is strongly supported by differences in vocal repertoire and quantitative vocal differentiation. Eastern <b>Sirystes</b> is itself a superspecies comprised of three allopatric species which are vocally differentiated (quantitatively and in repertoire) {{to such an extent that}} species rank would be afforded under a modern biologica...|$|E
