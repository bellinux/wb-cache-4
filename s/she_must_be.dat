Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam).

Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window.

The therapist tells Bree <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> more patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective of a life in which he needs {{to ask for help}} in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|She is then tasked {{to escort}} Dr. Otto Schenker, an East German scientist, to England. Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker {{fly back to}} England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the bowels of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E

25|$|To Antonino Votto, Callas wasThe {{last great}} artist. When {{you think this}} woman was nearly blind, and often sang {{standing}} a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. <b>She</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E

Don Quixote de la Mancha enters, reading a book. He {{goes to the}} bookcase and, not finding it, believes it has been stolen by evil magicians. Then he settles into an armchair and continues reading. He delights in stories of brave knights, fabulous giants and other fantastical creatures, {{but most of all}} Don Quixote dreams of his beloved Dulcinea, a woman that he believes to be so lovely and noble that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> divinity. Gradually he nods and falls asleep to dream of their romantic adventures. Darkness falls.|$|E
25|$|Medusa, Singularity, and an {{infected}} Dazzler are overrun by bugs and regroup {{with the others}} just as Bloodstone infects Danvers.

Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers. When the commotion is over, Danvers and Minoru continue to disagree over each other's actions but agree to visit She-Hulk together in the hospital.|$|E

After Lü Bu's defeat and death, Cao Cao was curious about why Guan Yu wanted Lady Du so badly and he guessed that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> very beautiful, so he had her brought to him. Cao Cao broke his promise to Guan Yu, as he took Lady Du as his concubine and adopted her son Qin Lang (whom she had with Qin Yilu).|$|E
