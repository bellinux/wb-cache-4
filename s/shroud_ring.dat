5000|$|New planes {{outdated}} the Torpedo Mark 13, but drag {{rings and}} stabilizers renewed its usefulness. Throughout 1943 torpedo performance remained poor, but {{the following year}} witnessed {{a revolution in the}} behavior of the Mark 13. Minor changes to the propeller blades and a reduction in gyro damage helped, but the greatest improvement resulted from the stabilizing effects of two appendages--the drag ring and the shroud ring.The first assembly, known familiarly as the pickle barrel, was readied for use by 1944. Early experiments with parachutes attached to aircraft torpedoes had demonstrated that a drag had a beneficial effect on the airflight characteristics of the weapon. While parachutes did not appear be the solution to the problem, discovery of the principle involved {{led to the development of}} the drag ring. Constructed of plywood, the ring was attached to the head of a torpedo and served as a stabilizer for the period that the weapon was airborne. Oscillations were reduced and the ring effected a 40 percent deceleration in air speed, then acted as a shock absorber when the torpedo struck water. Better water entry, a byproduct of air stabilization, reduced damage so substantially that pilots were able to increase the heights and speeds at which torpedoes were released.The drag ring went a long way toward making the Mark 13 a reliable torpedo, but underwater performance still called for improvement. By midsummer 1944, however, the <b>shroud</b> <b>ring</b> developed by the California Institute of Technology completed the torpedo revolution that had seemed so remote the year before. Almost an exact duplicate of an assembly developed by Newport in 1871, the <b>shroud</b> <b>ring</b> was made to fit over the tail blades of the torpedo. Known to pilots as the ring tail, it produced a steady water run by reducing hooks and broaches and eliminating much of the water roll which characterized the Mark 13. Speed and range were reduced but slightly. Early tests showed that ring-tailed torpedoes took too deep an initial dive, but readjustments of controls soon remedied that last obstacle. Hot, straight, and normal runs approached 100 percent, and the once critical battle reports soon became enthusiastic in praise of the Mark 13. Even psychologically, the appendages contributed to success,since the external design of the torpedo equipped with a pickle barrel and ring tail and the improved appearance of its underwater travel caught the fancy of the airmen.To speed the availability of the modified torpedo the Bureau built tail assemblies with the <b>shroud</b> <b>ring</b> attached, then sent them to the fleet as substitutes for the equipment on hand. By the fall of 1944 the revamped weapon had a wide distribution. As a result of the new improvements, torpedo drops at altitudes up to 800 feet and at speeds up to 300 knots were authorized. Experience soon indicated that these limits could be extended even further. On one occasion in early 1945, 6 Mark 13 torpedoes were released from altitudes between 5000 and 7000 feet; 5 out of the 6 were observed to run hot, straight, and normal. Combat use increased rapidly and the new effectiveness seemed out of all proportion to the changes made. On one air strike on April 7, 1945. Mark 13's sent to the bottom the 45,000 ton (sic) battleship Yamato, a light cruiser, and several destroyers. Months before the end of the war the Mark 13 was universally accepted as the best aircraft torpedo owned by any nation.|$|E

For this reason, many {{of the components of}} the expanders are life limited. Operation beyond the design or useful life of a component can lead to inservice component failures. The determination of when the various components require replacement has been a difficult one for the operators of the equipment since the effects of high temperature operation often are not readily detectable via visual or conventional non-destructive techniques. The life of components (casings, nosecone, <b>shroud</b> <b>rings,</b> rotor blades, rotor discs, etc.) is dependent upon the individual component's operating conditions and consideration must be given to both steady and transient operation.

These two torpedoes are both 21 inches in diameter, made up with heads and afterbodies having the same external shape, and both are equipped with identical fin and rudder assemblies. The only difference between their external shapes, therefore is due to the different lengths of cylindrical mid-sections, and resultant different over-all lengths. (The Mk 1. 4 - 1 is 20. 5 ft long, and the Mk 1. 5 - 1 is 24 ft long). The tests were made on 2 -inch diameter models (model scale 1 : 10. 5). In addition to providing a general picture of the pressure distribution as affected by the different variables the data presented herein are useful in determining the best locations and arrangements for the pressure intakes to the immersion mechanism and to the depth and roll recorder, and also as a check on cavitation measurements. Because the pressures on the fins themselves were not measured in these tests, the data cannot be used to calculate the over-all forces acting on the complete torpedo The main observations and conclusions are summarized in the following paragraphs: 1. Within the range of these tests the pressure, distribution, as presented in terms of p/q was found to be independent of variations in velocity and static pressure or submergence. That is, the difference between the pressure at any station on the body and the static pressure of the undisturbed water is independent of the static pressure and is directly proportional to the velocity head. 2. The addition of the <b>shroud</b> <b>ring</b> around the fins of these torpedoes has no measurable effect on the pressure distribution. 3. The pressure distributions around the head and afterbody of the Mk 1. 5 i- 1 ere found to be practically identical with those of the Mk 14 - 1. That is, increasing the length of the cylindrical mid-section does not, in this case affect the pressure distribution on the head or afterbody. 4. The pressure on the surface of these torpedoes equals the static pressure of the undisturbed water at two positions, one on the projectile nose and one on the afterbody (See Figures 12, 18, 24, and 30).

40|$|Underhood Thermal Management {{has become}} an {{important}} topic {{for the majority of}} automotive OEM’s. To keep combustion engines cool and manage waste heat efficiently is an important part in the design of vehicles with low fuel consumption. To be able to predict cooling performance and underhood airflow with good precision within a virtual design process, it is of utmost importance to model and simulate the cooling fan efficiently and accurately, and this {{has turned out to be}} challenging. Simulating the cooling fan in a vehicle installation involves capturing complex fluid dynamic interaction between rotating blades and stationary objects in the vicinity of the fan. This interaction is a function of fan rotation rate, fan blade profile, upstream and downstream installation components. The flow is usually highly turbulent and small geometry details, like the distance between the blade tip and the fan shroud, have strong impact on the fan performance characteristics. Fan installations therefore have a large influence on cooling performance which the fan data from the supplier cannot capture. Improved simulation capabilities in this area are critical for optimizing the design of energy efficient vehicles since the performance of these fans, which provide airflow to the heat exchangers used for engine cooling and HVAC system operation, have a big impact on the vehicles' overall energy efficiency. This paper presents a comparison of two methodologies for simulating fan air flows. Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) and Sliding Mesh (SM) techniques are applied for a typical heavy duty truck fan. Simulation results are compared to experimental data obtained in a fan test rig with representation of a typical truck fan installation, including fan <b>shroud,</b> <b>ring,</b> seal and an engine silhouette downstream. Results of MRF simulations are known to be sensitive to the MRF domain, which is highly constrained in tight fan installations.

40|$|Today CFD is an {{important}} tool for engineers in the automotive industry who model and simulate fluid flow. For the complex field of Under hood Thermal Management, CFD has become a very important tool to engineer the cooling airflow process in the engine bay of vehicles. To model the cooling airflow process accurately in CFD, it is of utmost importance to model all components in the cooling airflow path accurately. These components are the heat exchangers, fan and engine bay blockage effect. This paper presents CFD simulations together with correlating measurements of a cooling airflow system placed in a test rig. The system contains a heavy duty truck louvered fin radiator core, fan <b>shroud,</b> fan <b>ring</b> and fan. Behind the cooling module and fan a 1 D engine silhouette is placed to mimic the blockage done by a truck engine behind the fan.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental method of selecting the optimum slenderness ratio {{of a body}} with cylindrical midsection. Whether such a body is a large submarine or its arch enemy, the depth charge, the problem rem a ins to find a slenderness ratio which will permit the fastest possible velocity consistent with the power or sinking weight available. Considerable {{research has been done}} to determine the hydrodynamic characteristics of nose shapes both alone and combined with various afterbodies. In one of our reports we have pointed out that any one of several different nose shapes could be used on a particular body with little change in the total drag coefficient, and tests for certain afterbody shapes would probably bring similar results. Due to practical considerations, most bodies have a cylindrical midsection. Therefore, a typical underwater body of axial symmetry consists of arbitrarily selected nose and afterbody shapes separated by a cylindrical midsection. For dynamic stability, any underwater body must have fins which increase the surface area and, to some degree, the residual drag. We must necessarily consider the effect of such fins on slenderness ratio. In the following discussion of a particular concrete example, the emphasis has been placed on a body with a nose and afterbody with fins, of the same geometrical shape as the MK 13 - 1 torpedo (less <b>shroud</b> <b>ring).</b> The MK 13 - 1 torpedo is dynamically stable, has a cylindrical midsection, and has been tested with other nose shapes. After examination of the factors affecting the optimum slenderness ratio, it is found that a reasonably large variation from the theoretical optimum value will have little practical effect on the velocity of the body. Because of practical factors involved in the design of an undersea body, it may be desirable from the designer's point of view to have a relatively large slenderness ratio. This investigation shows that as far as drag per unit volume is concerned, the designer will will pay very little, if any, penalty if he disregards the drag factor and bases his selection of slenderness ratio entirely on such items as tactical requirements of maneuverability, structural design and utilization of internal space...|$|E
40|$|Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes, {{prevalent}} in the rocket engine turbomachinery industry, necessitates data of sufficient quality and quantity to benchmark computational codes. Existing data bases for typical rocket engine configurations, in particular impellers, are limited. In addition, traditional data acquisition methods have several limitations: typically transducer uncertainties are 0. 5 % of transducer full scale and traditional pressure probes are unable to provide flow characteristics in the circumferential (blade-to-blade) direction. Laser velocimetry circumvents these limitations by providing + 0. 5 % uncertainty in flow velocity and + 0. 5 % uncertainty in flow angle. The percent of uncertainty in flow velocity {{is based on the}} measured value, not full range capability. The laser electronics multiple partitioning capability allows data acquired between blades as the impeller rotates, to be analyzed separately, thus providing blade-to-blade flow characterization. Unlike some probes, the non-intrusive measurements made with the laser velocimeter does not disturb the flow. To this end,, and under Contract (NAS 8 - 38864) to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), an extensive test program was undertaken at Rocketdyne. Impellers from two different generic rocket engine pump configurations were examined. The impellers represent different spectrums of pump design: the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) impeller was designed in the 1 1970 's the Consortium for CFD application in Propulsion Technology Pump Stage Technology Team (Pump Consortium) optimized impeller was designed with the aid of modern computing techniques. The tester configuration for each of the impellers consisted of an axial inlet, an inducer, a diffuser, and a crossover discharge. While the tested configurations were carefully chosen to be representative of generic rocket engine pumps, several features of both testers were intentionally atypical. A crossover discharge, downstream of the impeller, rather than a volute discharge was used to minimize asymmetric flow conditions that might be reflected in the impeller discharge flow data. Impeller <b>shroud</b> wear <b>ring</b> radial clearances were purposely close to minimize leakage flow, thus increasing confidence in using the inlet data as an input to CFD programs. The empirical study extensively examined the flow fields of the two impellers via performance of laser two-focus velocimeter surveys in an axial plane upstream of the impellers and in multiple radial planes downstream of the impellers. Both studies were performed at the impeller design flow coefficients. Inlet laser surveys that provide CFD code inlet boundary conditions were performed in one axial plane, with ten radial locations surveyed. Three wall static pressures, positioned circumferentially around the impeller inlet, were used to identify asymmetrical pressure distributions in the inlet survey plane. The impeller discharge flow characterization consisted of three radial planes for the SSME HPFTP impeller and two radial planes for the Pump Consortium optimized impeller. Housing wall static pressures were placed to correspond to the radial locations surveyed with the laser velocimeter. Between five and thirteen axial stations across the discharge channel width were examined in each radial plane during the extensive flow mapping. The largely successful empirical flow characterization of two different impellers resulted in a substantial contribution to the limited existing data base, and yielded accurate data for CFD code benchmarking...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to the use of a vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment as a passive stall control technique in a multistage axial-flow compressor. The focus of the research was to determine whether such a treatment could delay the initiation of stall at lower mass flow rates as well as providing the most beneficial improvement in flow characteristics without sacrificing compressor efficiencies. Specific objectives of this study were to examine possible improvements or deterioration in the flow characteristics including stall margin, peak pressure rise coefficients and maximum efficiency in a multistage axial flow compressor. A casing treatment in addition to several spacer rings was developed from two initial designs and tested on the first stage of a low speed three-stage axial-flow compressor with a (0. 7) hub to tip diameter ratio. The treatment configuration consisted of three parts: an outer casing ring, with a tubular shaped passage on the inside diameter, a set of 120 evenly spaced curved vanes, and a <b>shroud</b> or inner <b>ring.</b> The casing treatment was positioned following the inlet guide vanes upstream and partly covering the tip of the rotor blades. The main parts of the casing treatment including the recessed vanes in addition to some of the spacer rings were manufactured from high quality acrylic. Eight additional spacer rings of various shapes and geometry were added. The first ring held and partly covered the IGVs, in front of the casing treatment. The rotor tip exposure ratio was thought to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the casing treatment. Therefore the other seven rings were used to provide the desired uncovered region of the rotor tip axial chord of about 10 % in order to provide a range of exposures of (23. 2 %, 33. 3 %, 43. 4 %, 53. 5 %, 63. 6 %, 73. 7 %, and 83. 8 %). The results showed significant improvements in stall margin in all treated casing configurations along with insignificant efficiency sacrifices in some compressor builds. About (28. 56 %) of stall margin improvement in terms of corrected mass flow rate was achieved using a casing treatment with a (33. 3 %) rotor tip exposure. The compressor build with (0. 535) rotor exposure ratios was the best configuration in terms of efficiency gain and loss characteristics. This build was able to provide the highest values of the maximum efficiencies in comparison with the performance achieved from the solid casing. An improvement of (1. 81 %) in the maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 54 %) stall margin improvement in terms of the corrected mass flow rates were achieved by the application of this treatment configuration. The improvement in the peak pressure rise coefficients in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (2. 33 %). The compressor configuration using a casing treatment with a (0. 636) rotor exposure ratio was the best build in terms of the pressure rise coefficients. This configuration was able to provide highest value of the peak pressure rise in comparison with the characteristics achieved from the datum build. An improvement of (2. 65 %) in the peak pressure rise coefficient in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 49 %) improvement in stall margin in terms of the corrected mass flow rates was achieved from this casing treatment build. The improvement in maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (1. 03 %). The results suggest that the vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment designed as part of this investigation achieved the objectives, which were established for the research. In the majority of instances it not only produced gains in flow range, pressure rise coefficients and efficiencies, but also enabled the rotating stall, which developed at much lower mass flow rates in the compressor, to become progressive rather than abrupt...|$|R
