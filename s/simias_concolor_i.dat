50|$|The {{island is}} known for its range of primates, {{including}} the Kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), pig-tailed langur (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor),</b> Mentawai langur (Presbytis potenziani) and Mentawai macaque (Macaca pagensis).|$|R
50|$|The park protects four {{endangered}} endemic primate species: Kloss's gibbon (Hylobates klossii), Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), Siberut langur (Presbytis potenziani ssp. siberu) and {{pig-tailed langur}} (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor</b> ssp. siberu). Among the 31 species of mammals {{in the park}} there are four endemic species of squirrel.|$|R
50|$|Around 40 {{primates}} from 200 primate {{species in}} the world found in Indonesian forests. Four Indonesian primates were included among the 25 most endangered primates in the world; they are the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), the Siau Island tarsier (Tarsius tumpara), the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) and the pig-tailed langur (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor).</b>|$|R
50|$|Homo, Lemur, and Vespertilio {{have survived}} as generic names, but Simia has not. All the species {{have since been}} moved to other genera, and in 1929, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled in its Opinion 114 that Simia be suppressed. The genus Simias is {{distinct}} and remains valid, containing a single species, the pig-tailed langur (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor).</b>|$|R
50|$|Siberut {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the mainland Sunda shelf since the Mid-Pleistocene. This isolation {{has led to a}} much biodiversity, with about 900 species of vascular plants and 31 mammal species. Sixty-five percent of mammals and fifteen percent of other animals are endemic at some taxonomic level, making Siberut unique. Of the 134 bird species found on Siberut, 19 are endemic at some taxonomic level.There are four endemic primates: the bokkoi (Macaca pagensis), lutung Mentawai/joja (Presbytis potenziani siberu), bilou (Hylobates klossii) and simakobu (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor</b> siberu).|$|R
50|$|The islands {{have been}} {{separated}} from Sumatra since the mid-Pleistocene period, which has allowed at least twenty endemic species to develop amongst its flora and fauna. This includes five endemic primates: the Mentawai or kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), Mentawai macaque (Macaca pagensis), Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu), Mentawai leaf monkey (Presbytis potenziani), and pig-tailed langur (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor).</b> They are highly endangered due to logging, unsustainable hunting, and conversion of rainforest to palm oil plantations. Some areas of the Mentawai Islands rainforest ecoregion are protected, such as the Siberut National Park. Red junglefowl, the Asian palm civet and crab-eating macaque are also native.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pig-tailed langur}} (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor),</b> {{monotypic}} in genus Simias, {{is a large}} Old World monkey, endemic to several small islands {{off the coast of}} Sumatra in Indonesia. Its face is black, its fur is blackish-brown and it has a relatively short tail. It is a diurnal species, feeding in small groups in the rainforest canopy on leaves, and to a lesser extent, fruit and berries. Little is known of its natural history, but it is heavily hunted, its populations have been declining rapidly and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "critically endangered". It has been included on a list of the World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.|$|R
30|$|Primate species {{richness}} on Mentawai is unusually high. On a land {{surface area of}} only 6, 549  km 2, Mentawai harbors five endemic primate species (Fuentes 1997 / 1997), the Kloss gibbon (Hylobates klossii), the Mentawai langur (Presbytis potenziani), the pig-tailed langur or pig-tailed snub-nosed monkey (<b>Simias</b> <b>concolor),</b> the Pagai island macaque (Macaca pagensis) and the Siberut macaque (Macaca siberu). Whereas the first three species occur on all four islands, M. pagensis only occurs on the three southern islands, and M. siberu exclusively on Siberut. All Mentawaian primates {{are included in the}} IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2012). They are threatened by habitat loss due to legal and illegal logging, conversion of the forest into oil palm plantations, forest clearing, extraction of forest products (such as rattan), hunting and pet trade (Whittaker 2006). In Siberut, forest cover has decreased to 60 % (by 2005; Whittaker 2006), but part of it is protected by the national park, which includes 465  km 2 of protected “no-use” sanctuary zone where no hunting and logging is allowed (WWF 1980; Fuentes 1997 / 1997;Whittaker 2006).|$|R
30|$|Of {{all four}} {{sympatric}} primate species on Siberut, Siberut macaques {{have the largest}} group size and {{by far the largest}} home range size (see Table  1 for data and references). The size of home range increases with the percentage of fruit in the diet across species, with Siberut macaques being the most frugivorous species. At similar proportions of fruit and leaves in the diet, Kloss gibbons spend twice as much time feeding on arthropods, and Siberut macaques included more other food items instead, thus having a broader diet (Table  1). The amount of frugivory also seems {{to be related to the}} daily travel distance, with both folivorous colobine species (Presbytis potenziani and <b>Simias</b> <b>concolor)</b> traveling the shortest distances, Kloss gibbons being intermediate and Siberut macaques having 3 - 4 times the travel distances of the two colobine species; the same pattern emerges for travel time (Table  1). For the forest strata use we find a niche differentiation. Whereas Siberut macaques mainly used the lower strata (0 - 10  m) of the forest, the sympatric colobine species mainly stayed within heights of 11 to 20  m (Table  1). For Kloss gibbons, no data are available for the same study site but data collected in Central Siberut indicate that the gibbons spent 94 % of their time in the middle and upper canopy (Whitten 1982 c).|$|R
40|$|Kloss’s gibbon Hylobates klossii is {{endemic to}} the Men-tawai Islands off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia. Because of long {{isolation}} from mainland Sundaland, this archipelago exhibits a high level of endemism, including four primate species (H. klossii, <b>Simias</b> <b>concolor,</b> Presbytis potenziani and Macaca pagensis; Whitten et al., 2000). The only protected area in the Mentawai Islands is Siberut National Park, which at 1, 926 km 2 includes nearly half of Siberut, the largest island (Fig. 1). Gazetting of additional reserves has been advocated for South Pagai (Tenaza, 1988), North Pagai (Fuentes, 1996 / 1997) and in the Peleonan forest of north Siberut (Kobold et al., 2003). Kloss’s gibbon is currently categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2004), but populations have not been surveyed since 1980, when extrapolation from a single study site suggested the Siberut population comprised 36, 000 individuals (WWF, 1980). Because of logging, hunting and the pet trade, population numbers have probably decreased. Thus, {{in the course of a}} study to assess the extent of genetic variation in H. klossii, I made efforts to evaluate the current status of the species on all four islands. Surveys were conducted throughout the Mentawai Islands at sites encompassing a range of forest types and disturbance (numbers correspond to sites in Fig. 1) : (1) Peleonan forest, North Siberut; research area logged c. 20 years ago with low hunting levels. (2) Simabugga...|$|R
40|$|The Mentawai Archipelago (West-Sumatra, Indonesia) {{harbours}} {{a wealth}} of endemic animals and plants including six unique primate species, all threatened by habitat loss and hunting. Although hunting {{is known to be}} widespread, little systematic work has been carried out to examine its scale and impact on Mentawai´s primate populations. Here we report an island-wide survey carried out on Siberut, the archipelago’s largest island, to assess hunting behaviour with respect to the four locally-occurring primate species, as well as the attitudes of indigenous inhabitants to resource utilization. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in mid- 2012 with 390 respondents from 50 villages using a structured questionnaire. Overall, ca. one quarter of the respondents (24 %) are still active hunters, generally targeting <b>Simias</b> <b>concolor</b> (77 %), Macaca siberu (71 %) and Presbytis siberu (68 %); Hylobates klossii is rarely hunted (3 %). Mostly, a single animal is captured per hunt, with average numbers per three months ranging from 1. 9 - 2. 3 individuals (for S. concolor, M. siberu and P. siberu). We found that in many aspects our data did not differ between the protected area (Siberut National Park) {{and the rest of the}} island, although hunting was significantly more prevalent within the protected area’s boundaries. Our approximation of annual offtake leads us to conclude that no less than 4, 800 primates are taken every year (min. 6. 4 % of the population). We provide recommendations on how to reduce hunting as a driver for population decline. </a...|$|R
40|$|Primate loud calls {{have the}} {{potential}} to encode information about the identity, arousal, age, or physical condition of the caller, even at long distances. In this study, we conducted an analysis of the acoustic features of the loud calls produced by a species of Asian colobine monkey (simakobu, <b>Simias</b> <b>concolor).</b> Adult male simakobu produce loud calls spontaneously and in response to loud sounds and other loud calls, which are audible more than 500 m. Individual differences in calling rates and durations exist, but it is unknown what these differences signal and which other acoustic features vary among individuals. We aimed to describe the structure and usage of calls and to examine acoustic features that vary within and among individuals. We determined the context of 318 loud calls and analyzed 170 loud calls recorded from 10 adult males at an undisturbed site, Pungut, Siberut Island, Indonesia. Most calls (53 %) followed the loud call of another male, 31 % were spontaneous, and the remaining 16 % followed a loud environmental disturbance. The fundamental frequency (F 0) decreased while inter-unit intervals (IUI) increased over the course of loud call bouts, possibly indicating caller fatigue. Discriminant function analysis indicated that calls were not well discriminated by context, but spontaneous calls had higher peak frequencies, suggesting a higher level of arousal. Individual calls were distinct and individuals were mainly discriminated by IUI, call duration, and F 0. Loud calls of older males had shorter IUI and lower F 0, while middle-aged males had the highest peak frequencies. Overall, we found that calls were individually distinct and may provide information abou...|$|R
40|$|The {{projected}} {{growth in}} human population, rapid urbanization, {{and expansion of}} structures like highways and canals pose {{a major threat to}} the future survival of wildlife, particularly large terrestrial mammals. In many cases, wild animal populations have been restricted to fragmented habitat islands due to anthropogenic developments, endangering them to local extinction. Current and future wildlife conservation and management strategies are leading to the implementation of mitigation measures such as creation of wildlife habitat corridors. In this light, novel and interdisciplinary research methods such as approaches in the field of landscape genetics are proving to be increasingly useful and necessary for assessing the status of wildlife populations and furthering efficacy of conservation programs and management efforts. In this 5 -year research study, I review literature in the field of landscape genetics, highlighting studies and their applications toward wildlife conservation over the past decade (2005 - 2014). I then use a landscape genetic approach to understand the potential impact of natural and human-made barriers in and around the northern Sonoran Desert on one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, the mountain lion (Puma <b>concolor).</b> <b>I</b> employ recently developed genetic tools to assess the current population genetic status of mountain lions in this region and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools to relate observations to landscape features through interpretive maps. I further investigate the utility of GIS and expert-based models in connectivity conservation and suggest validating them with information on genetic relatedness and functional connectivity among mountain lions. Lastly, in many parts of this document, I emphasize the use of these methods and data sharing in conservation planning as well as wildlife management...|$|R
