5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her.

Bart brings the picture to school and gives a copy of it to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other <b>students</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> copy of the picture. It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy of the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{the city}} gained a {{reputation}} as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, {{as well as the}} student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group <b>Students</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.|$|E

5|$|On March 4, 1969 the FSU {{chapter of}} <b>Students</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Democratic Society, an {{unregistered}} university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently {{decided not to}} allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets. The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis. Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled. Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.|$|E
5|$|While the {{vocational}} proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools {{for gifted students}} or those wishing to study a specific subject. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk to prepare <b>students</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, {{and by the time}} he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to restructure the <b>Student</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Day Program {{in order to provide}} a more {{meaningful}} campus visitation <b>for</b> <b>students</b> admitted to Ball State University. This existing admitted student program was evaluated and modified to provide students with more personal attention, a better representation of campus experiences, and more connections to Ball State University. The purpose of Kellie and Tara's involvement was to give them the opportunity to redesign, implement, and evaluate a Student Affairs program. In the fall semester of 1999, evaluations from the previous year's <b>Student</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Day Program were reviewed, and areas that needed improvement were identified. Changes were made to the program to address these problem areas. Five <b>Student</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Day Programs were held during the spring semester. At the conclusion of the final program, evaluations from each program were tallied and reviewed. Program areas that were evaluated by admitted students each received equal or higher ratings than the previous year's program. Ninety-three percent of participants indicated that they felt more comfortable with college life after attending the <b>Student</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Day Program.
