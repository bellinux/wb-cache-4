This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a <b>simple</b> <b>task</b> that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E

5|$|Toyo Miyatake, who {{was born}} in Kagawa, Shikoku, Japan, in 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1909. He settled in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles, and was incarcerated at Manzanar along with his family. A photographer, Miyatake smuggled a lens and film holder into Manzanar and later had a {{craftsman}} construct a wooden box with a door that hid the lens. He took many now-famous photos of life and the conditions at Manzanar. His contraband camera was eventually discovered by the camp administration and confiscated. However, camp director Ralph Merritt later allowed Miyatake to photograph freely within the camp, even though he was not allowed to actually press the shutter button, requiring a guard or camp official to perform this <b>simple</b> <b>task.</b> Merritt finally saw no point to this technicality, and allowed Miyatake to take photos.|$|E

Installation of the under-wing gun pods was a <b>simple</b> <b>task</b> that could be quickly performed by the unit's armourers, and the gun pods imposed a reduction of speed of only 8km/h (5mph). By comparison, the installed weight of a similar armament of two 20mm MG 151/20 cannon inside {{the wings of the}} FW 190A-4/U8 was 130kg (287lb), without ammunition.|$|E

Under the uncertain leadership of Alexander Kerensky, however, the Provisional Government mismanaged Russia's continuing involvement in the war, prompting angry reactions from the Petrograd workers, who drifted further and further to the left. The Bolsheviks, a communist group led by Vladimir Lenin, seized the political opportunity from this confusion and launched a second revolution in Russia during the same year. The communists violently overthrew the fragile liberal-socialist order in October, after which Russia witnessed several years of civil war between communists and conservatives wishing to restore the monarchy.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of each arch is aesthetically appealing in its simplicity, but also structurally clever {{in that it}} takes maximum advantage of wood as a building material while overcoming its inherent structural shortcomings. From a structural perspective, the arch design utilizes the mechanical properties of the material. Wood is strongest {{along the length of}} the grain and weakest along the end grain. The use of short arch components with shallow radii minimized the amount of weaker-end grain exposed to structural forces. The assembly of the arch with several small pieces of wood, the shapes of which are identical from arch to arch, was efficient. It allowed the fabricator to set machines with guides and templates so that cutting the multiple-arch components was a <b>simple</b> <b>task.</b> Furthermore, the design required little material, since each individual arch component has only a shallow radius. Moreover, by using relatively narrow widths of lumber, the chance of warping was minimized. Finally, there was an efficiency realized in transportation, as the small size of the arch components allowed them to be easily stored and shipped.|$|E

Recently, we showed that the number of sessions required for a rat to completely learn a task differed between the FN and <b>simple</b> discrimination <b>tasks,</b> and there was a difference in hippocampal theta activity between these tasks. These results suggest that solving the FN task relies on a different strategy than the <b>simple</b> discrimination <b>task.</b> In this study, we provide supportive evidence that solving the FN and <b>simple</b> discrimination <b>tasks</b> involve different strategies by examining changes in performance and hippocampal theta activity in the FN task after transfer from the <b>simple</b> discrimination <b>task</b> (A+, B- → A+, AB-). The results of this study showed that performance on the FN task was impaired and there was a difference in hippocampal theta activity between the <b>simple</b> discrimination <b>task</b> and FN task. Thus, we conclude that solving the FN task uses a different strategy than the <b>simple</b> discrimination <b>task.</b> <br/...|$|R
