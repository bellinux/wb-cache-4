5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 11th century {{dispute over}} the cathedral {{graveyard}} had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be granted to the cathedral. A panel met to agree exactly how the land should be divided, concluding that the division should run <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the bailey; the far side was returned to the cathedral, making {{the remainder of the}} castle unusable from a military perspective. Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of these}} works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had {{previously}} run <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south {{had to leave the}} main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching {{the southern end of the}} walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important symbols of the de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.|$|E

5|$|The major Prussian {{offensive}} {{was organized}} in 1271 together with Linka, {{leader of the}} Pogesanians. The Bartian infantry and Pogesanians besieged a border castle, but were fended off by the Knights from Christburg. The Prussians who managed to escape joined their cavalry while the Knights set up a camp on the opposite bank of the Dargune River (Dzierzgoń River), blocking the route home. When Christians retired for the night, {{one half of the}} Prussian army crossed the river in a distance, in order to attack the Knights from the rear, while the other half charged <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the river. The Knights were encircled. The Battle of Paganstin saw twelve knights and 500 men killed. The Prussians immediately assaulted Christburg and almost captured it. The Prussians were still looting the surrounding area when cavalry from Elbing arrived. Many of the Prussian infantry perished while cavalry escaped. Despite these losses, Diwane was soon back and blocked roads leading to Christburg hoping to starve the castle. Diwane was killed during a siege of a small post at Schönsee (Wąbrzeźno) in 1273.|$|E
5|$|Chetwode {{opened his}} advance XX Corps {{headquarters}} at 17:00 at el Buqqar, and a half-hour later the infantry approach marches began. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division advanced along the Tel el Fara-to-Beersheba road {{led by the}} 229th Brigade, with one brigade following {{to the north and}} another to the south of the road. The 60th (London) Division advanced from Abu Ghalyun, Bir el Esani and Rashid Bek in three brigade groups, the 181st Brigade (on the left) advanced north and south of the Wadi es Saba, while the 179th Brigade (on the right) advanced towards the Khalasa-to-Beersheba road. Their advance guard, the 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment, was attacked as they crossed the Wadi Halgon. Behind the 179th Brigade, the 180th Brigade in reserve advanced <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> from Esani. The XX Corps Cavalry Regiment, the Westminster Dragoons concentrated to the south-east, covering the corps' right flank with orders to connect with the Desert Mounted Corps south of Beersheba. In the rear, the 53rd (Welsh) Division dug in along the Wadi Hanafish; the XX Corps artillery, the last to move, approached from el Buqqar to the Wadi Abushar, arriving at 03:15 on 31 October. Reconnaissance had established that the Tel el Fara-to-Beersheba track (via Khasif and el Buqqar) could be used by the mechanical transport required to move the heavy gun battery and ammunition into position before the attack. This job was done by 135 lorries in three companies which travelled across the Sinai from Cairo. In addition, ammunition was hauled forward by 134 Holt tractors.|$|E

25|$|Joints {{are used}} in {{continuous}} welded rail when necessary, usually for signal circuit gaps. Instead of a joint that passes <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the rail, the two rail ends are sometimes cut {{at an angle to}} give a smoother transition. In extreme cases, such as at the end of long bridges, a breather switch (referred to in North America and Britain as an expansion joint) gives a smooth path for the wheels while allowing the end of one rail to expand relative to the next rail.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked {{for such things}} as a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going <b>straight</b> <b>across,</b> and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, the {{operations}} {{to cross the}} Rhine in the north began. The British Second and U.S. Ninth Armies took the lead. Ninth Army, on the south flank, {{took part in the}} great encirclement of German forces in the Ruhr. The U.S. First Army on the right crossed the Rhine in early April and then swung left to liberate the north of the Netherlands. Second Army drove <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the North German plain, reaching the Ems on 1 April and the Weser on 4 April. After the closing of the Ruhr pocket on that day, Ninth Army reverted to the command of 12th Army Group.|$|E

25|$|SH 29A was gazetted in 2015 {{and covers}} the former section of SH 29 {{east of the}} {{roundabout}} with SH 36/Route K. SH 29 starts at a roundabout interchange with SH 2. The highway crosses the East Coast Main Trunk Railway and passes Baypark Stadium. From here, SH 29 becomes a four lane dual carriageway until it crosses the Maungatapu Bridge, which crosses Rangataua Bay. The highway travels in a wide cutting through Maungatapu, and Taipari Street crosses it on a bridge. Then SH 29 turns at the signalised roundabout at Maungatapu, so traffic wishing {{to stay on the}} highway must turn either left or right depending on their direction of travel. It then travels <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the signalised roundabout at Welcome Bay, before travelling through four roundabouts within 5km, eventually terminating with SH 29.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 led over the following decades to heavy damage to the Church of the Redeemer. The barrier along {{the border between the}} East German Democratic Republic (GDR) and West Berlin was built <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the lot of the church property and the campanile was used as part of the protective wall of concrete. The church nave stood in the foreland between wall and border. In spite of these circumstances, regular services were still held in the church until Christmas Eve 1961. A few days later, the church's interior, which stood in an area strictly controlled by the GDR border troops, was defiled – almost certainly by the troops. This way the church was made unserviceable. The border authority thus created a reason to seal off the church completely, in order to prevent any escape in that section of the border.|$|E

Nearly all of the attacking Germans had been killed or wounded. McConnell, shot in the shoulder, was the only American casualty.|$|E
500|$|The Causeway {{begins in}} East Perth, at the {{intersection}} of Riverside Drive, Adelaide Terrace, and Hay Street. This intersection is a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout. The road reaches the Swan River's northern foreshore after , and crosses to Heirisson Island via the [...] north-western bridge. The road continues <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> the island for another [...] The road passes over the second, [...] bridge, which links Heirisson Island to Victoria Park. The Causeway ends at a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange, located [...] south-east of the second bridge. The interchange links The Causeway with four other roads: Canning Highway to the south-west, Great Eastern Highway to the north-east, and both Shepperton Road and Albany Highway to the south-east. There is no access to Albany Highway from The Causeway, as Albany Highway is a one-way road leading into the interchange.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Winchester Cathedral {{received}} £86,000 {{from the}} Highways Agency in compensation for increased traffic {{noise from the}} M3. The Rev. Michael Till explained that [...] "the noise comes beaming <b>straight</b> <b>across</b> The Close. It does change life having a perpetual background noise". Also in that year, veterans of a Twyford Down protest threatened a new campaign of direct action in response to 200 new road-building proposals in the government's recently unveiled ten-year transport plan. Rebecca Lush Blum went on to found Road Block in 2005, which {{became part of the}} Campaign for Better Transport (UK) in 2007. Veteran road protester Chris Gillam believes that his efforts in protesting against Twyford Down, where he took an active role in confronting security officers and crawling under razor wire, helped later road schemes, such as the Hindhead Tunnel to be planned with greater consideration about the environment.|$|E
