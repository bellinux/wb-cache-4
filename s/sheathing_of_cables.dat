40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to report 2 {{patients}} (3 eyes) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) who showed marked <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles that was ultimately attributed to calcification following vitrectomy. Cases: Case 1 involved a 65 -year-old female with PDR who underwent bilateral vitrectomy for traction retinal detachment. Postoperatively, bilateral retinal redetachment (reRD) was observed. <b>Sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles was observed at the same time, yet was not apparent preoperatively. Case 2 involved a 71 -year-old female with PDR who underwent vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage. Postoperatively, reRD was observed, and fundus findings showed <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles. In both patients, silicone oil tamponade and retinopexy were performed at reoperation, but <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles persisted postoperatively. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed that retinal blood flow was maintained, and no vessel leakage occurred. In addition, no <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal veins was observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a higher intensity for retinal arterioles with sheathing than for normal retinal arterioles. Conclusion: Vessel sheathing in our 2 patients (3 eyes) differed from the sheathing seen in vasculitis. Based on the hyperintensity on OCT, this sheathing may have been due to retinal artery calcification induced by hypoxia and inflammation associated with reRD...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{stability}} and strength of cold-formed and perforated steel sigma-section columns with steel <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> different thickness. Ceilings with and without steel <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> different thickness are tested to failure in compression on a laboratory machine, which was based on a manual hydraulic jack. Series of 4 experiments with full-scale walls (2. 5 m height) were carried out. Also, for examination of the role of boundary conditions, the sheet in a ceiling is either left free or connected to base with screws. In civil engineering there are many experiments and methodologies for calculating the strength and buckling of ceiling with the <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> various materials, such as oriented strand board and gypsum board. However, for producing superstructures of ships the materials with high plastic properties and strength characteristics are required. For example steel possesses such properties. It was the main reason for conducting a series of experiments and studying the behavior of cold-formed steel columns with steel sheathing. During the experiments the deformation of the cross-section of three equally spaced cross sections was determined, as well as the axial deformation of the central column in the ceiling with steel sheathing. The test results showed the influence of the thickness <b>of</b> <b>sheathing</b> and boundary condition of a sheet on the strength and buckling of ceiling. According to the results of the tests it is necessary to evaluate the impact <b>of</b> the <b>sheathing</b> made <b>of</b> different materials and if necessary to carry out further tests...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} defects <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints always {{accelerate the}} deterioration of insulation, until finally accidents can arise due to {{the explosion of the}} joints. The formation process of this damage often involves changes in the electromagnetic, temperature and stress distribution <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> joint, therefore, it is necessary to analyze the electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical distribution <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints. Aiming at solving this problem, the paper sets up a 3 -D electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical coupling model <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints under crimping process defects. Based on the model, the electromagnetic losses distribution, temperature distribution and stress distribution <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> joint and body are calculated. Then, the coupling fields characteristics in different contact coefficient k, ambient temperature Tamb and load current I were analyzed, and according to the thermal-mechanical characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>cable</b> joint under internal defects, the temperature difference ΔTf and stress difference Δσf <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> surface are applied to evaluate the internal cable joint defects. Finally, a simplified model <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> joint is set up to verify the accuracy of the coupling field model proposed in this paper, which indicates that the model can be used to analyze the coupling fields characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints and the method can be applied to evaluate crimping process defects <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> joints...|$|R
