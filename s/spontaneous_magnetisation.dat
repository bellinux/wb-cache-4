40|$|We have {{investigated}} the temperature evolution of the magnetic structures of HoFeO 3 by single crystal neutron diffraction. The three different magnetic structures werevfound {{as a function of}} temperature for HoFeO 3. In all three phases the fundamental coupling between the Fe sub-lattices remains the same and only their orientation and the degree of canting away from the ideal axial direction varies. The magnetic polarisation of the Ho sub-lattices in these two higher temperature regions, in which the major components of the Fe moment lie along x and y, is very small. The canting of the moments from the axial directions is attributed to the antisymmetric interactions allowed by the crystal symmetry. In the low temperature phase two further structural transitions are apparent in which the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetisation</b> changes sign with respect to the underlying antiferromagnetic configuration. In this temperature range the antisymmetric exchange energy varies rapidly as the the Ho sub-lattices begin to order. So long as the ordered Ho moments are small the antisymmetric exchange is due only to Fe-Fe interactions, but as the degree of Ho order increases the Fe-Ho interactions take over whilst at the lowest temperatures, when the Ho moments approach saturation the Ho-Ho interactions dominate.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is shown}} that the Ising model on the union jack lattice with general {{anisotropic}} and staggered interactions is equivalent to a free fermion model, and from this equivalence explicit expressions for its free energy and a sublattice <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetisation</b> are obtained. The Ising model on the union jack lattice was first considered by Vaks et al (1965) as a system exhibiting a re-entrant transition {{in the presence of}} competing interactions. Vaks ef a 1 considered a union jack lattice with symmetric interactions and, after considerable effort, obtained its free energy and a sublattice two-spin correlation function. A more general version of the model of Vaks et a 1 was discussed later by Sacco and Wu (1975) as a 32 -vertex model on the triangular lattice. In view of the growing interest in Ising systems with competing interactions (see, e. g., Liebmann 1986), it appears useful to present here a simple formulation of the general union jack Ising model which treats the model with anisotropic and staggered interactions in a unified fashion. We show that this general union jack Ising system is equivalent to a free fermion model (Fan and Wu 1970) and from this equivalence we obtain its free energy and a sublattice <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetisation,</b> thus permitting a relatively simple and systematic treatment of an otherwise complicated system.

To check the applicability of the analytical results to much smaller, practically accessible system sizes, we performed several Monte Carlo simulations for the 2 D Ising model with nearest-neighbour couplings on a square lattice at fixed magnetisation M. Thereby, we measured the largest minority droplet, corresponding to the condensed phase, at various system sizes (L= 40, > [...] ., 640). With analytic values for for the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetisation</b> m_ 0, the susceptibility χ and the Wulff interfacial free energy density τ_W for the infinite system, we were able to determine λ numerically in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction. Furthermore, we did simulations for the spin- 1 / 2 Ising model on a triangular lattice and with next-nearest-neighbour couplings on a square lattice. Again, finding a very good agreement with the analytic formula, we demonstrate the universal aspects of the theory with respect to the underlying lattice. For the case of the next-nearest-neighbour model, where τ_W is unknown analytically, we present different methods to obtain it numerically by fitting to the distribution of the magnetisation density P(m).
