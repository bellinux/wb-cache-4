25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A <b>splice</b> <b>loss</b> estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A <b>splice</b> <b>loss</b> under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E

The NTMOF is supposed to be drawn at the output end of the upstream MOF, with no coupling loss between the two. The propagation loss along the NTMOF is calculated using the Finite-Difference Vector Beam Propagation Method (FD-VBPM) versus the shape and the length of the NTMOF. Numerical simulations are conducted in order to optimize the profile and the cross section of the NTMOF. Then, the <b>splice</b> <b>loss</b> between the NTMOF and the downstream fiber is taken into account.
