40|$|Malocclusion is a {{clinical}} symptom, {{in which the}} teeth of maxilla and mandible are not located at the proper location. If malocclusion left untreated, {{it can lead to}} complications in the digestive system, headache, and periodontal disease disorders. Malocclusion problems involving abnormalities of teeth, bones, and muscles around the jaw are obligation <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialists</b> to treat them. The treatments can be varying based on the type of malocclusion, including tooth extraction and tooth braces. To know certain degree of malocclusion experienced by the patient, an assessment method called Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index is usually used by the specialist. To help the works <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialists</b> in Indonesia, a new automated calculation system based on 2 D image of tooth model for PAR Index is being developed. In this paper, the calculation system for over-jet, open-bite, and teeth segmentation is developed.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{if there is any}} significant difference in excess adhesive flash (EAF) with the use of APC PLUS adhesive coated appliance system and Transbond XT and if other variables such as side of the mouth, time taken to bond the brackets, the age <b>of</b> the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialist,</b> or the years of clinical experience affected the amount of EAF. Materials and Methods: Twenty <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialists</b> bonded 20 preadjusted straight wire brackets (Victory, 3 M Unitek) on a typodont with a Class I crowded malocclusion in a split-mouth design, with one-half of the brackets bonded with APC PLUS adhesive system and the other half with Transbond XT. The teeth were sputter coated with gold and an image was taken at 32 × magnification in a scanning electron microscope (Philips XL 30). The resultant tagged image file (TIF) was opened in AnalySIS Pro 3. 1 (Soft Imaging System, Munich, Germany) and the area of EAF was measured. Results: t-Tests demonstrated that: (1) there was no statistically significant difference in EAF between two adhesives when bonding in different quadrants of dentition; and (2) there was no statistically significant difference in EAF between two adhesives overall. Analysis of variance models demonstrated there were no statistically significant differences found regarding the age <b>of</b> the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialists,</b> years <b>of</b> clinical experience, and time in performing the bonding. Conclusions: The addition of a coloring agent to assist in the visualization of the excess adhesive does not reduce the amount of excessive adhesive around orthodontic brackets. 8 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Initially, the WFO Executive Committee {{focused the}} WFO and its {{resources}} towards the importance <b>of</b> recognizing the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialist</b> {{in every corner}} of the globe as an important provider <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> care. Several WFO affiliate organizations recognize different levels of the providers <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> care, but in order for an orthodontic organization to be affiliated with the WFO its bylaws must provide a specific membership category for the “orthodontic specialist” or “orthodontist.” Only an <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialist</b> is eligible to become a WFO Fellow (member). This ensures that all WFO fellows are recognized in their country as having had additional training so as to be entitled to use the term “orthodontist” or “orthodontic specialist.” Each WFO affiliate president certifies this specialty status when he or she signs the membership application of his or her organization’s member to become a WFO Fellow. A WFO Fellow receives the WFO Gazette twice yearly mailed to an office or home as a benefit of membership in the WFO in addition to receiving discounted registration fees to the IOC and several annual meetings of WFO affiliates. A WFO Fellow may also display the WFO certificate of membership and the WFO pin. The WFO website, www.wfo.org provides a directory of its membership so that anyone searching for an orthodontist can be assured that an orthodontist listed in the directory has the necessary training and experience to provide high-quality orthodontic care.|$|R
40|$|Objective : Impaction of {{the third}} molar tooth mandibular is often found in {{patients}} with orthodontic treatment. In orthodontic treatment, extraction cases of impaction {{of the third}} molar tooth are usually performed, but the patients often refuse this extraction. Extraction of premolar has a good effect on the third molar mandibular angulation during treatment. Material and Methods : This study is a retrospective clinical study with descriptive analytic {{to find out the}} effect of the first mandibular premolar tooth extraction to angulation change of the third molar mandibular in orthodontic treatment with a standard edgewise method. Angulation change was performed by comparing the third molar mandibular angulation before and after orthodontic treatment with panoramic radiographs. Angulation of the third molar tooth mandibular was calculated from the angle formed between the long axis of the tooth with the reference line infraorbita. Results : The sample comprised 60 of impacted mandibular third molar region of the left and right regions of 30 patients who had been treated declared cured in clinic <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialist</b> <b>of</b> Dentistry Faculty Padjadjaran University. The sample was divided into three (3) groups of patients before treatment angulation of the third molar tooth mandibular under 300, 300 to 600 and above 60 o, then measured change of angulation and observed whether it increased, fixed or decreased. Results were analyzed by T- test and Wilcoxon test showed that there was a significant change in angulation of the third molar mandibular in orthodontic treatment with the first premolar tooth mandibular extraction. Conclusion : This study is that the first premolar tooth mandibular extraction affects the angulation of the third molar tooth mandibular after orthodontic treatment...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the study}} is codify both a methodological and {{communication}} standard based on teleassistance, and the emergencies that can be treated from a remote location along with the related clinical applications, limitations, medicolegal considerations and the patients' opinion on this new opportunity of assistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To codify a distance communication method, ten young patients aged 10 - 16 years, equipped with a mobile videophone and after clear instructions, asked the advice <b>of</b> the <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialist</b> to deal with minor orthodontic emergencies. Upon completion of the treatment they filled out a questionnaire on satisfaction level and difficulties encountered with the use of this technology. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Most <b>of</b> the <b>orthodontic</b> emergencies can be solved at home: rubber ligature displacement, discomfort due to the appliance, irritation of cheeks. Those patients who used the videophone to handle the orthodontic emergencies considered it an easy and useful method, possibly due to the young age of the subjects involved, who are familiar with the new technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Telecommunications applied to medicine and dentistry is currently a subject of topical interest. The most developed countries are investing resources in order to improve assistance and communication between physicians and patients and among specialists. The possibility of sharing videos and images is particularly useful in the orthodontic field, as minor emergencies can be solved easily at home, reassuring patient and parents on one hand, and limiting visits to the dental office to cases of real need...|$|R

40|$|The main aim {{of these}} studies was to {{evaluate}} the outcome <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> care in Sweden from the professional's and the patient's perspective. A new model for priority-planning and for evaluating the different factors influencing the decision <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> treatment was devised. Treatment desire, followed by treatment need and treatment benefit {{were the most important}} factors to consider when deciding whether or not treatment should be carried out. The model was applied to estimations of 942 19 -year-old individuals with and without previous orthodontic treatment from three Swedish counties. Thirty-seven percent of the individuals in the entire sample had been treated. General practitioners had treated 21 % and specialists 16 % of the individuals. Regardless of differences in the available resources and the structure of the free public orthodontic care, a substantial proportion of the untreated individuals had malocclusions with treatment need, but they had no treatment desire. The standard of the treatments in the counties showed a good correlation with the available resources in terms <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialists</b> and the possibilities there of supervising nonspecialist care and of treating patients in need of specialist treatment. Questionnaires were sent to 27 -year-olds, both to those who had had and to those who had not had previous orthodontic treatment, and their perceptions of their own dental arrangement and any orthodontic care they may have received as a child or an adolescent were analysed. Most of the respondents were satisfied with their earlier decision, whether to choose orthodontic treatment or not. Dental professionals were considered to have had the greatest influence on this decision, which means that the desire for treatment may be guided by the orthodontist. Individuals with malocclusions and treatment need, but who had refiused offered treatment, were in general more discontented with their dental arrangement; {{more than half of them}} now regretted their decision. Individuals treated by specialists were more contented than individuals treated by general practitioners. The influence of perceived treatment difficulty on the outcome of and investment in orthodontic treatments was also studied. About one-fourth of the treatments evaluated were classified as easy, one-fourth as moderately difficult, and one-half as difficult. The perceived treatment difficulty was associated on a group basis with the pretreatment need. The treatment outcome became less favourable and the treatment investment more expensive the greater the perceived difficulty. The outcome measures were in general more favourable for specialist treatments than for treatments provided by general practitioners, despite the specialist treatments on the average being classified as more difficult than those provided by general practitioners. Easy treatments were found to be extremely cost-effective. It was concluded that general practitioners should preferably treat uncomplicated cases, and an increased use of fixed appliances would be desirable in the treatment of moderately difficult cases. Difficult cases should be treated exclusively by specialists. Cases with little need or benefit of treatment or a poor prognosis should be given low treatment priority. Patients and parents should in these cases be informed about the small benefit expected and the risks involved with the treatment. Finally, more information needs to be given to individuals with malocclusions and treatment need and who refuse offered treatment...|$|R

Index <b>of</b> <b>Orthodontic</b> Treatment Need (IOTN) usually was used to assess the needs and demand <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> treatment, eventhough, indices can be used for more than one purpose. Purpose: To determine whether the Index <b>of</b> <b>Orthodontic</b> Treatment Need (IOTN) could be able to evaluate the treatment results as well. Method: Data was obtained by evaluating each of 202 study models from 17 Orthodontic Postgraduate students. The ‘before’ and ‘after’ treatment models were assessed, using the Index <b>of</b> <b>Orthodontic</b> Treatment Need. Result: Using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, the assessment of Dental Health Component (DHC) and Aesthetic Component (AC), before and after orthodontic treatment showed significantly differences from each others (p : 0, 000 <  α : 0. 05). The Null hypothesis were rejected. The grade of DHC and AC were decreasing to a better score. Conclusion: The Index <b>of</b> <b>Orthodontic</b> Treatment Need (IOTN) could be used to assess the orthodontic treatment outcomes, to evaluate before and after <b>orthodontic</b> treatment <b>of</b> the patients. The results of the treatment showed good improvements of dentofacial appearance of the patients which means the successful achievement of the clinical works programs. </span...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyses}} residual {{need and}} demand for orthodontic treatment in 19 -year-olds attending the Swedish Public Dental Service (PDS). The general practitioners (GPs) had selected individuals for <b>orthodontic</b> <b>specialist</b> consultation and some were treated by GPs or specialists or {{not considered to be}} in need for treatment. Altogether 164 individuals were called for clinical investigation at the age of 19 years and also given a questionnaire asking for residual orthodontic treatment demand and satisfaction with information and orthodontic care. Ninety-one per cent of the individuals who had had an orthodontic consultation and 53 per cent of those who had not seen an orthodontist took part in the investigation. The study revealed that half of the 19 -year-olds at the PDS clinic had received orthodontic consultations and one third had received orthodontic appliance treatment. Seven percent of the investigated individuals had a residual subjective demand for treatment. Several individuals with removable appliance treatment had overjet and deep bite and laterally forced cross-bite, but with little remaining subjective demand for treatment. Individuals with fixed appliance treatment showed few malocclusions. Nineteen-year-olds in general were uncertain about their present need for orthodontic treatment. The following conclusions were drawn: the total amount <b>of</b> <b>orthodontic</b> treatment in different areas in Sweden is comparable but the distribution between GP and specialist treatment differs. Interceptive treatment to reduce overjets seemed not successful. Fixed appliances seemed to reduce the majority of the malocclusion traits.
