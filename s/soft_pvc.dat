Factorial {{design of experiment}} was conducted by changing three factors − the ratio of softener and PVC polymer solution, the mass fraction of mineral oil, and the mass fraction of micro-sized glass beads − to study the indentation hardness, compression elastic modulus and friction and cutting forces in needle insertion of 12 types of <b>soft</b> <b>PVC</b> material. The indentation hardness of the <b>soft</b> <b>PVC</b> material ranged from 5 to 50. The elastic modulus of the <b>soft</b> <b>PVC</b> material was from 6 to 45 kPa between 0 - 0. 15 strain. The friction and cutting force during needle insertion also had large ranges, which were from 0. 005 to 0. 086 N/mm and 0. 04 to 0. 36 N respectively. The analysis of variance showed that the ratio of softener and PVC polymer solution had the most significant effect {{on all of the}} four properties of the PVC material. The percentage of mineral oil also had statistical significance on these four properties. The glass beads only had effect on the needle insertion cutting force. A nonlinear regression model was applied to find relationships among mechanical properties and the significant factors. The R 2 values of the regression analysis results were all larger than 0. 9.

40|$|International audienceThin {{and long}} (semi-rigid) needles {{are well known}} to bend during {{percutaneous}} insertions because of needle-tissue interactions. Robotized needle insertions have been proposed to improve the efficacy of Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of kidney tumors. However, the success of treatments and diagnosis depends on accurate prediction of needle deflection. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of merging needle-tissue properties, tip asymmetry and needle tip position updates to assist needle placement. In this paper we proposed a needle-tissue interaction model that matches the observations of transversal and axial resultant forces acting in the system. Analysis of a slope parameter between needle and tissue provides online and offline needle deflections predictions. Online updates of the needle tip position allow adaptive corrections of the slope parameter. Moreover, promising results were observed while evaluating the model's performance under uncertainties conditions such as tissue deformation, tissue inhomogeneity, needle-tissue friction, topological changes of the tissue and other modeling approximations. The system is evaluated by experiments in <b>soft</b> (homogeneous) <b>PVC</b> and multilayer tissue phantoms.

40|$|PVC (polyvinyl {{chloride}} or vinyl) {{is widely}} used in toys and other children’s products. For soft applications, such as toys designed for chewing (“teethers”), softeners or plasticisers are added to give the desired flexibility. Although a range of chemicals are used as softeners, phthalate esters (phthalates) {{are by far the}} most commonly used. Phthalates do not bind to the PVC, remaining present as a freely mobile and l achable phase in the plastic. As a consequence, phthalates are continuously lost from <b>soft</b> <b>PVC</b> over time. Contact and pressure, such as that applied during teething or play, can increase the rates at which these chemicals leach from the plastic. Children in contact with <b>soft</b> <b>PVC</b> toys may, therefore, ingest substantial quantities of phthalates during normal play, especially from toys specifically designed to be chewed. This is of concern as phthalates are known to present a number of hazards. Although acute toxicity appears to be low, phthalates have been shown to cause a range of adverse effects in laboratory animals following longer exposure, including damage to the liver and kidney and, in some cases, effects on the reproductive tract.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phthalates {{are used}} as {{plasticizers}} in soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and in {{a large number of}} consumer products. Because of reported health risks, diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) has been introduced as a replacement for di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in <b>soft</b> <b>PVC.</b> This raises concerns because animal data suggest that DiNP may have antiandrogenic properties similar to those of DEHP. The anogenital distance (AGD) -the distance from the anus to the genitals-has been used to assess reproductive toxicity. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and AGD in Swedish infants. METHODS: AGD was measured in 196 boys at 21 months of age, and first-trimester urine was analyzed for 10 phthalate metabolites of DEP (diethyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate), DEHP, BBzP (benzylbutyl phthalate), as well as DiNP and creatinine. Data on covariates were collected by questionnaires. RESULTS: The most significant associations were found between the shorter of two AGD measures (anoscrotal distance; AGDas) and DiNP metabolites and strongest for oh-MMeOP [mono(4 -methyl- 7 -hydroxyloctyl) phthalate] and oxo-MMeOP [mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate]. However, the AGDas reduction was small (4 %) in relation to more than an interquartile range increase in DiNP exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings call into question the safety of substituting DiNP for DEHP in <b>soft</b> <b>PVC,</b> particularly because a shorter male AGD has been shown to relate to male genital birth defects in children and impaired reproductive function in adult males and the fact that human levels of DiNP are increasing globally...|$|E

In this paper, the authors present a deformable prostate phantom {{for use with}} multimodal imaging (end-fire or side-fire ultrasound, CT and MRI) and more specifically for transperineal or transrectal needle-insertion procedures. It is made of <b>soft</b> polyvinyl chloride (<b>PVC)</b> plastic and includes a prostate, a perineum, a rectum, a soft periprostatic surrounding and embedded targets for image registration and needle-targeting. Its main particularity is its realistic deformability upon manipulation. Methods: After a detailed manufacturing description, the imaging and mechanical characteristics of the phantom are described and evaluated. First, {{the speed of sound}} and stress-strain relationship of the PVC material used in the phantom are described, followed by an analysis of its storage, imaging, needle-insertion force, and deformability characteristics. Results: The average speed of sound in the phantom was measured to be 1380 +/- 20 m/s, while the stress-strain relationship was found to be viscoelastic and in the range of typical prostatic tissues. The mechanical and imaging characteristics of the phantom were found to remain stable at cooler storage temperatures. The phantom had clearly distinguishable morphology in all three imaging modalities, with embedded targets that could be precisely segmented, resulting in an average US-CT rigid registration error of 0. 66 mm. The mobility of the phantom prostate upon needle insertion was between 2 and 4 mm, with rotations between 0 and 2 degrees, about the US probe head. Conclusion: The phantom's characteristics compare favorably with in vitro and in vivo measurements found in the literature. The authors believe that this realistic phantom could be of use to researchers studying new needle-based prostate diagnosis and therapy techniques...|$|R

The higher the recyclate content led to the higher the blend density and the mechanical properties (flexural and impact strength, and hardness).

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) constitutes a group of chemicals, included in many commonly used products, (e. g., PVC flooring), with properties proven or suspected {{to interact with the}} natural hormone system in humans and animals. EDCs are manmade compounds (there are also natural compounds with such properties) that can bind to cell receptors and mimic or block the functions of natural hormones potentially resulting in adverse human health effects. One type of widely concerning EDC is phthalates. Since phthalates create weak chemical bonds when they are added into different products, they readily leach into the surrounding environment. Phthalate metabolites can therefore be frequently measured in human biological samples. Major public health concerns regarding EDCs {{over the past three decades}} have focused on phthalates. According to the World Health Organization, EDCs are suspected to be associated with altered reproductive function in males and females, increased incidence of breast cancer, abnormal growth patterns and neurodevelopmental delays in children, as well as changes in immune function.
