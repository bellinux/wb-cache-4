5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. <b>She</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her column, Michelena wrote occasional articles intended for a wider readership. <b>She</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> October 1916 {{about the history of}} the moving picture industry in a multiple-article series, beginning her account with a retelling of Eadweard Muybridge's action photograph of Governor Leland Stanford's racehorse named Occident. She defined this high-speed image as essential to the development of moving pictures.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. <b>She</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E

Recuperating in Nice and cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in Saint-Tropez in June. <b>She</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call {{in the middle of}} the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.|$|E

5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself.

25|$|Many of the {{incidents}} in the book are actual situations that happened to the Ingalls family {{at that time in}} their lives as told to Laura by her Pa, Ma and sister Mary over the years.

25|$|During the {{serialization}} of Angel Sanctuary, she mistakenly {{titled the}} Gehenna story arc as the Yetzirah arc, and {{was unable to}} correct it as several chapters had already appeared under the title; she corrected it for the tankōban release. As the manga takes place in July 1999, Yuki expressed a goal to complete the series by then. For the conclusion, she originally had planned to use a tragic ending, but decided against it in favor of a happy one, because she thought that it would be too upsetting for the fans to read after twenty volumes. <b>She</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> her final afterword that Setsuna and Sara have reached emotional maturity after their adventures and will live happily together.|$|E
25|$|They met for {{the first}} time in Stockholm in 1913. According to the book <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> 1932, after Krueger's death, he was not {{interested}} in marriage or children, and was very much focused on his business. She broke off the relationship in 1917 and moved to Denmark, where she married a Danish engineer with the name Eberth. They had a daughter in 1919, Grete Eberth (later to be an actress in Stockholm, married name Mac Laury 1919–2002). After some years however, she divorced Eberth and moved back to Stockholm with her daughter, reuniting with Kreuger. Mr. Eberth once kidnapped the daughter in Stockholm and brought her back to Denmark. Shortly thereafter Ingeborg, without notifying the authorities or police, went down to Denmark and brought the daughter back to Sweden by hiring a private fishing boat in Denmark that took them over Öresund to Sweden. The new period with Kreuger lasted until around 1928; after that they just met occasionally. The last time they met was in November 1931, just before Kreuger started on his final trip to America. Eberth received the news about his death in Paris on March 12, 1932 from newspaper headlines the day after.|$|E
