We kind of spent a day saying, 'Can we do this? Is everything going to be okay?' And <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> so we figured that would be a fun, fraught thing to happen between Jack and his mom, especially right before Christmas." ...|$|E

60|$|FERSEN. Oh, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine,</b> now, {{since we}} keep her {{outside in the}} baby carriage, like you tell us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can see her}} quite distinctly. You {{said the}} other day that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> in figure; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid's bow; dark eyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship's cable; and large eyes violety-bluey-blackish." ...|$|E
60|$|FRUST. We-ell! I {{certainly}} thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> Now, you 'phone up Miggs, and {{get right}} along with it. I've only one rule, sir! Give the Public what it wants; and what the Public wants is punch and go. They've got no use for Beauty, Allegory, all that high-brow racket. I know 'em as I know my hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "These are {{the sort}} of things that aren't {{supposed}} to happen. They leave them out of novels--these incompatibilities. Young people ignore them until they find themselves up against them. My wife doesn't understand, doesn't understand now. She despises me, I suppose.... We married, {{and for a time}} we were happy. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> and tender. I worshipped her and subdued myself." ...|$|E

60|$|While {{the girls}} sang {{and went through}} some pretty drills Ware again studied Miss Powell. Her appeal to his {{imagination}} was startling. He searched {{for the cause of}} it. It could not be in her beauty. Certainly <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> and womanly and of splendid physique, but all about her were lovely girls of daintier flesh and warmer color. He reasoned that her power was in her eyes, steady, frank as sunlight, clear as water in a mountain brook. She seemed unconscious of his scrutiny.|$|E
60|$|Ellen did {{not feel}} ready to forgive him for wanting to set her to field- work. There is some {{difference}} between being fine and being refined, and in Ellen's station of life {{it is very difficult}} to hit the right point. To be refined is to be free from all that is rough, coarse, or ungentle; to be fine, is to affect to be above such things. Now Ellen was really refined in her quietness and maidenly modesty, and there was no need for her to undertake any of those kinds of tasks which, by removing young girls from home shelter, do sometimes help to make them rude and indecorous; but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> when she gave herself a little mincing air of contempt, as if she despised the work and those who did it. Lydia Grant, who worked so steadily and kept to herself so modestly, that no one ventured a bold word to her as she tossed her hay, was just as refined as Ellen King behind her white blinds, ay, or as Jane Selby herself in her terraced garden. Refinement is in the mind that loves whatsoever is pure, lovely, and of good report; finery is in disdaining what is homely or humble.|$|E
