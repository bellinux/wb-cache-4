5|$|Financial data of Lexus {{operations}} are not disclosed publicly. However, automotive analysts {{estimate that the}} Lexus division contributes {{a disproportionate share of}} Toyota's profits, relative to its limited production and <b>sales</b> <b>volume.</b> Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on <b>sales</b> <b>volume,</b> vehicle product development cycles, and exchange rates, Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than <b>sales</b> <b>volume,</b> with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately $3 billion annually. In 2009, Interbrand ranked Lexus as Japan's seventh largest brand, between Panasonic and Nissan, based on revenue, earnings, and market value.|$|E
