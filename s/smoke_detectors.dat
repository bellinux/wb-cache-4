5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors.</b> The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are radioactive {{and release}} energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium {{are the most}} abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium {{is used in the}} ionization chambers of most modern <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neptunium accumulates in {{commercial}} household ionization-chamber <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> from decay of the (typically) 0.2 microgram of americium-241 initially present {{as a source}} of ionizing radiation. With a half-life of 432 years, the americium-241 in an ionization smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 20 years, and about 15% after 100 years.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> give-away program, 388 {{adults were}} {{surveyed}} to characterize <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> ownership in a low-income population and to identify those who would acquire a free <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> following their child's visit to the hospital. Factors associated with <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> ownership included higher education, home ownership (vs public housing), knowledge of the city <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> law, {{and the practice of}} other injury prevention measures. Regardless of ownership, the great majority of parents (82 per cent) acquired a free <b>smoke</b> <b>detector,</b> but those previously without a <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> were more likely to do so. These characteristics of <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> usage and acquisition should be considered in targeting future intervention strategies...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is also {{an example}} of hysteresis, not deadband. The <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> at {{the ceiling of the}} kitchen starts the alarm as soon as the level of smoke reaches a certain {{starting}} value, x, then the <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> stays in the alarm position until the level of smoke has been reduced to level y, after which the <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is reset automatically to [...] "normal". The hysteresis here is x minus y.|$|R
5000|$|Information in [...] "bold" [...] is the {{standard}} coverage of the <b>detector.</b> <b>Smoke</b> <b>detector</b> coverage is 60 square metres and temperature <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> coverage is 20 square metres.

5|$|While {{actinides}} {{have some}} established daily-life applications, {{such as in}} <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> (americium) and gas mantles (thorium), they are mostly used in nuclear weapons and use as a fuel in nuclear reactors. The last two areas exploit the property of actinides to release enormous energy in nuclear reactions, which under certain conditions may become self-sustaining chain reaction.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors.</b> In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E

5|$|Americium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors,</b> as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> and thus provided {{a good source of}} royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. <b>Smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical <b>smoke</b> <b>detector,</b> the ionization <b>smoke</b> <b>detector</b> is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|R

25|$|In new construction, minimum {{requirements}} are typically more stringent. All <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> must be hooked {{directly to the}} electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup. In addition, <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> are required either inside or outside every bedroom, depending on local codes. <b>Smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, {{but the sound of}} the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> in stairways, main hallways and garages.|$|E
25|$|The americium-241 in {{ionizing}} <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> poses {{a potential}} environmental hazard, albeit {{a very small}} one. Disposal regulations and recommendations for <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> vary from region to region. The amount of radioactive material contained in ionizing <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> is very small and thus doesn't represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the ionization chamber of the alarm the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A person would have to open the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the risk to be significant. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionic smoke detector is much smaller than natural background radiation under normal operation.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{most state}} and local laws {{regarding}} the required number and placement of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> are based upon standards established in NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. Laws governing the installation of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> {{vary depending on the}} locality. However, some rules and guidelines for existing homes are relatively consistent throughout the developed world. For example, Canada and Australia require a building to have a working smoke detector on every level. The United States NFPA code cited in the previous paragraph requires <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> on every habitable level and within the vicinity of all bedrooms. Habitable levels include attics that are tall enough to allow access. Many other countries have comparable requirements.|$|E

It {{has been found}} that battery-powered <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year.

25|$|A smoke {{detector}} is {{a device that}} detects smoke and issues a signal. Most <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> work either by optical detection or by physical process, {{but some of them}} use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. <b>Smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of Thomas Alva Edison, although {{there is no evidence that}} Edison contributed to this invention.|$|E
25|$|A smoke {{detector}} is {{a device that}} senses smoke, typically {{as an indicator of}} fire.
