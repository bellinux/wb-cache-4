5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} eldest {{surviving}} child of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Archduchess Maria Theresa was born {{early in the}} morning of 13May 1717, at the Hofburg Palace, Vienna, shortly after the death of her elder brother, Archduke Leopold, and was baptised on that same evening. The dowager empresses, her aunt Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg and grandmother Eleonor Magdalene of the Palatinate-Neuburg, were her godmothers. Most descriptions of her baptism <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> infant was carried ahead of her cousins, Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia, the daughters of Charles VI's elder brother and predecessor, Joseph I, before the eyes of their mother, Wilhelmine Amalia. It was clear that Maria Theresa would outrank them, even though their grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, had his sons sign the Mutual Pact of Succession, which gave precedence to the daughters of the elder brother. Her father was the only surviving male member of the House of Habsburg and hoped for a son who would prevent the extinction of his dynasty and succeed him. Thus, the birth of Maria Theresa was a great disappointment to him and the people of Vienna; Charles never managed to overcome this feeling.|$|E

25|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced concrete}} used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing tendons (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E
25|$|This type of inheritance, {{also known}} as {{maternal}} inheritance, applies to genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA.

It is important to <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of mitochondrial disease (particularly when symptoms develop in early life) is actually caused by an underlying nuclear gene defect, and most often follows autosomal recessive inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Turtle racing has {{garnered}} controversy {{at times}} {{due to the}} treatment of turtles and the gambling that occurs at many races. The annual turtle races at the Gala Days in the Canadian village of Ailsa Craig have drawn particular scrutiny. After news of the annual turtle race was popularized in 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources told the organizers to cancel the event. Ministry officials intervened due to wild turtles being caught in a nearby river in order {{to be used in the}} race, threatening to fine anyone who entered a wild animal in the race. A ministry spokesperson cited the danger of spreading disease and disrupting the ecosystem by catching wild turtles and then putting them back. The spokesperson also cited the <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> race caused the turtles. The event later proceeded as planned after turtles were rented from a nearby pet store for use in the race. Many residents had been catching turtles for weeks in order to enter them in the race, and area residents had to release over one hundred turtles.|$|E

25|$|Certain transhumanist {{philosophers}} {{hold that}} since all assumptions about what others experience are fallible, {{and that therefore}} all attempts to help or protect beings that are not capable of correcting what others assume about them no matter how well-intentioned {{are in danger of}} actually hurting them, all sentient beings deserve to be sapient. These thinkers argue that the ability to discuss in a falsification-based way constitutes a threshold that is not arbitrary at which it becomes possible for an individual to speak for themself {{in a way that is}} not dependent on exterior assumptions. They also argue that all beings capable of experiencing something deserve to be elevated to this threshold if they are not at it, typically stating that the underlying change that leads to the threshold is an increase in the preciseness of the brain's ability to discriminate. This includes increasing the neuron count and connectivity in animals as well as accelerating the development of connectivity in order to shorten or ideally skip non-sapient childhood incapable of independently deciding for oneself. Transhumanists of this description <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genetic engineering that they advocate is general insertion into both the somatic cells of living beings and in germ cells, and not purging of individuals without the modifications, deeming the latter not only unethical but also unnecessary due to the possibilities of efficient genetic engineering.|$|E

500|$|Although Hammill {{has written}} the vast {{majority}} of the songs in the band's catalogue, and all of the lyrics, he is keen to <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arrangements of the music comes from all the group's members.

Our professional life in Hollywood has been especially easy, and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair". Ethan has suggested that Lipnick– like the men on which he is based– is in some ways a product of his time. [...] "I don't know that that kind of character exists anymore.

500|$|The third quatrain {{continues}} {{the metaphor of}} the nightingale and seasonal imagery to further <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale is used as a metaphor to explain that just because he doesn't flatter the Fair Youth, doesn't mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, [...] "too much praise ceases to please". The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter and please their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as [...] "pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable". This is a usage of another common proverb; [...] "Too much familiarity breeds contempt." ...|$|E

500|$|The group's albums {{have tended}} to be both lyrically and musically darker in {{atmosphere}} than many of their progressive rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were {{the exception rather than the}} rule, preferring to use Banton's classically influenced organ, and, until his departure, Jackson's multiple saxophones. While Hammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and its members have contributed to his solo albums, he is keen to <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band collectively arranges all its material. Hammill's lyrics frequently covered themes of mortality, due to his love of science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his self-confessed warped and obsessive nature. His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career. It has been described as [...] "a male Nico" [...] and would later on be cited as an influence by Goth bands in the 1980s. Though the group have generally been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several musicians, including John Lydon and Julian Cope.|$|E
500|$|The use of dressed stone {{rather than}} gravel as a surface {{dressing}} was also occasionally {{held to be}} a sign against the causeway being of Roman construction: the majority of Roman roads that were finished with a material other than simple packed earth were dressed in either packed gravel or pebbles. There are other examples of Roman roads paved with stone blocks, including the [...] section of the Via Appia—the oldest major Roman route in Italy—near Albano. Historians Richard A Gabriel and Michael Grant state that of the [...] of known Roman roads, over [...] may have been stone-paved. The Roman writer Ulpian specifically differentiates between via munita, which always had a paved stone surface, and via glareata, which were earthed roads with either gravelled surfaces, or a gravelled subsurface and paving on top. The causeway may well have had a gravel surface dressing originally, which has been removed since through robbing and natural weathering. Another difference in construction detail between Wade's Causeway and a typical Roman road is its lack of a foundation of large stones. Codrington and archaeologist John Ward <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> structure of Roman roads varied greatly depending upon their situation and the materials available, especially within Britain.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} {{development}} process as smooth as possible, Hataya tried {{to work in the}} same environment as Sasaki so that they could exchange data more efficiently. The main tools and software used during development were Digital Performer and Pro Tools, which, according to Hataya, were the standard tools used in music production. In order to <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of Journey of Dreams was centred around surrealism and dreams themselves, Sasaki discarded tying the game's music down to a single genre and took the approach of not having a clear musical policy. Sasaki also ensured that each theme included the exhilaration of [...] "flying in the air", as it was a core element of gameplay. Hataya echoed that the music of the game was produced by focusing on being able to empathise with the feeling of flying, as well as to exemplify the game's atmosphere and characters. Since the team were aware that Journey of Dreams had a greater sense of adventure than the original, the team knew that they could incorporate a larger variety of music into it so that players would enjoy a wider range of emotions. In addition to composing the music itself, Hataya took the responsibility of re-arranging Sasaki's music in different ways so that the theme matched the in-game situation. Hataya said that he and Sasaki produced around 70 percent of the game's music between them; the rest was produced by Sega's sound team.|$|E
