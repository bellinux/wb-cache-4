25|$|On 26 October, one {{day ahead}} of the {{scheduled}} enforcement of Article 155 by the <b>Spanish</b> <b>Senate,</b> {{it was announced that}} Puigdemont had chosen to dissolve the Parliament of Catalonia within the coming hours and call for an emergency snap election on or around 20 December in order to prevent direct rule from Madrid. This move sparked an outcry within pro-independence ranks, as they wished to hold a vote for a unilateral declaration of independence in response to the Spanish government's move to trigger Article 155. In the end Puigdemont chose not to dissolve Parliament, allegedly because of the Spanish government's refusal to call off the Article 155 procedure even though an election was called by Puigdemont. A debate over a possible declaration of independence then went ahead as planned in the Parliament of Catalonia later that day and into the next morning, simultaneous to the <b>Spanish</b> <b>Senate</b> debating the enforcement of Article 155. At the end of the debate, the Catalan parliament voted for a unilateral declaration of independence, by secret ballot, which was backed 70–10, with two MPs casting a blank ballot, with all MPs from Citizens, the Socialists' Party of Catalonia and the People's Party boycotting the vote because of its illegality for violating the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Spain, as the lawyers of the Parliament of Catalonia warned.|$|E

2500|$|The Catalan Republic ( [...] , , [...] ) was a {{proposed}} secessionist unrecognized state that was declared in Catalonia on 27 October 2017. The Parliament of Catalonia unilaterally declared independence from Spain amid a constitutional crisis over the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. Shortly thereafter, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>Senate</b> triggered Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, which allowed Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy {{to dismiss the}} Executive Council of Catalonia, dissolving the Parliament of Catalonia and calling a snap regional election for 21 December 2017. In response, Carles Puigdemont, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, stated that only parliaments could elect or remove governments {{in a democratic society}} and asked Catalans to [...] "democratically oppose" [...] the enforcement of Article 155, without clarifying what his response would be to the Spanish government's orders.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{comparative}} federalism asserts that federations require a second chamber for {{the representation of}} regional interests in central law-making. Yet {{there has been little}} systematic analysis of the contribution of second chambers in parliamentary federations to this task. The main purpose of this book is to demonstrate to what extent the two strongest parliamentary second chambers, the Australian Senate and the German Bundesrat are linked to the federal structures in which they are embedded. The study analyzes the contribution of the members of these second chambers in advancing interests that are linked to the regional constituents whom they represent or to the collective fiscal or administrative interests of a regional government with whom they are associated. The analysis underscores the largely 'executive' character of intergovernmental relations in parliamentary federations, a feature that corresponds with the composition of the German Bundesrat, but not of the Australian Senate. In the concluding chapter some preliminary observations are made as to whether our findings also generate interesting insights for the larger group of parliamentary second chambers in federal or quasi-federal states, such as the Belgian, <b>Spanish</b> and Canadian <b>Senates,</b> the UK House of Lords and the Indian Raiya Sabha. nrpages: 423 status: publishe...|$|R

The proposal {{presented by the}} pro-independence political parties Junts pel Sí and Popular Unity Candidacy was approved with 70 votes in favor 10 against and 2 blank votes. 55 MPs from the opposition refused to be present during the voting after the legal services of the Catalan Parliament advised that the voting could not take place as the law {{in which it was}} based had been suspended by the Constitutional Court. Within hours, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>Senate</b> approved actions proposed by the Spanish government to invoke Article 155 and assume direct control over some of Catalonia's autonomous powers. The measure was passed with 214 votes in favour, 47 against and 1 abstention.
