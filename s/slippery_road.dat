5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the {{afternoon}} of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The combination of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation made it more difficult for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.|$|E
25|$|NAF {{operates}} two conventional <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> course {{tracks in}} Trøndelag, one at Orkanger {{and one at}} Ogndal in Steinkjer. By the late 2000s the Orkanger track no longer met the demands and NAF therefore considered {{what to do with}} the situation. As Lånkebanen met the needs, it was proposed in 2009 that the Orkanger and Ogndal tracks be closed and that Lånkebanen take over the responsibility. After an expansion of the Orkanger venue in 2012, the plans were placed on hold, but resumed the following year.|$|E
25|$|Veracruz was {{the first}} Spanish {{settlement}} founded in what became New Spain, but it endured as the only viable Gulf Coast port, the enduring gateway for Spain to New Spain. But the difficult topography around the port itself affected not only local development, but also affected New Spain as a whole. Going from the port to the central plateau entailed a daunting 2000 meter climb from the narrow tropical coastal plain in over just a hundred kilometers. The narrow, <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> in the mountain mists was treacherous for mule trains, {{and in some cases}} mules were hoisted by ropes. Many tumbled with their cargo to their deaths. Given these transport constraints, only high value low bulk goods continued to be shipped in the transatlantic trade. It stimulated local production of foodstuffs, rough textiles, and other products for a mass market. Although New Spain produced considerable sugar and wheat, these were consumed exclusively in the colony even though there was demand elsewhere. Philadelphia, not New Spain, supplied Cuba with wheat.|$|E

2500|$|When World War I {{began in}} August 1914, Hoover helped {{organize}} the return of around 120,000 Americans from Europe. He led 500 volunteers in distributing food, clothing, steamship tickets and cash. [...] "I did not realize it at the moment, but on August 3, 1914, my career was over forever. I was on the <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> of public life." [...] Hoover liked {{to say that the}} difference between dictatorship and democracy was simple: dictators organize from the top down, democracies from the bottom up.|$|E
2500|$|By 1987 {{the country}} was {{experiencing}} a book of proposals to build motorsport venues, with twenty-five detailed proposals having been issued. The Ministry of Transport and Communications decided that year that Lånkebanen {{would be the only}} such venue to receive investment subsidies. The ministry was concerned that most of the plans would simply make matters worse for other neighboring venues, particularly as many new tracks would take away revenue from existing <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> circuits. The ministry stated that Lånkebanen would be used as a trial to gain experience from state-subsidizing and building of new tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Roadway - The {{speed limit}} is 30 MPH {{in this area}} and the road lanes narrow under the viaduct, leaving little margin for error, {{especially}} when <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> conditions exist. [...] Four roads converge at the Canton Viaduct: Neponset St., Walpole St., Neponset Place and the electrical substation road. [...] There is also a residential driveway adjacent to the viaduct on the east side at the concrete roadway portal and the main entrance to a condominium complex is located on the west side just north of the Neponset St. and Walpole St. convergence (directly across from Canton Viaduct monument), making this area the most complex intersection in town.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the schools}} in the {{mountains}} of Mae Sariang District (185 schools with 27,000 children) are only accessible in the dry season.
