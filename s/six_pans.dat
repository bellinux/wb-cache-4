Avastin, a humanized monoclonal antibody recognizes VEGF, has {{been approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration. To generate potential VEGF-recognizing antibodies with better tumor regression ability than that of Avastin, we have designed a systematic antibody selection plan. From mice immunized with recombinant human VEGF, we generated three phage display libraries, scFv-M 13 KO 7, Fab-M 13 KO 7, and scFv-Hyperphage, in single-chain Fv (scFv) or Fab format, displayed using either M 13 KO 7 helper phage or Hyperphage.

A total of sixty-four antibodies recognizing VEGF were obtained. Based on the results of epitope mapping, binding affinity, and biological functions in tumor inhibition, eight antibodies were chosen to examine their abilities in tumor regression in a mouse xenograft model using human COLO 205 cancer cells. Three of them showed improvement in the inhibition of tumor growth (328 %– 347 % tumor growth ratio (% of Day 0 tumor volume) on Day 21 vs. 435 % with Avastin).

40|$|It is a {{widespread}} assumption that all primate species process faces {{in the same way}} because the species are closely related and they engage in similar social interactions. However, this approach ignores potentially interesting and informative differences that may exist between species. This paper describes a comparative study of holistic face processing. Twelve subjects (<b>six</b> chimpanzees <b>Pan</b> troglodytes and <b>six</b> rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatta) were trained to discrim- inate whole faces (faces with features in their canonical position) and feature-scrambled faces in two separate conditions. We found that both species tended to match the global configuration of features over local features, providing strong evidence of global precedence. In addition, we show that both species were better able to generalize from a learned configuration to an entirely novel configuration when they were first trained to match feature-scrambled faces compared to when they were trained with whole faces. This result implies that the subjects were able to access local information easier when facial features were presented in a scrambled configuration and is consistent with a holistic processing hypothesis. Interestingly, these data also suggest that, while holistic processing in chimpanzees is tuned to own-species faces, monkeys have a more general approach towards all faces. Thus, while these data confirm that both chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys process faces holistically, they also indicate that there are differences between the species that warrant further investigation...|$|R

The {{movement of the}} transverse tarsal joint was further studied in a living foot on a walk-way with a glass plate inserted, and with an underlying mirror. In man the joint is shaped as an asymmetrical sector of one end of an hour-glass shaped surface of revolution with its main axis oriented longitudinally in the foot. The calcaneocuboid joint becomes close packed by a pronation of the forefoot {{in relation to the}} hind foot because of a congruency between the joint surfaces obtained in this position and because the calcaneus overhangs the cuboid dorsally and stops the movement. At low gear push off the foot is inverted and the calcaneocuboid joint loose packed. The stresses are absorbed across the fibular, postaxial border of the foot. At high high gear push off there is a functional pronation of the forefoot with a stabilization of the transverse tarsal joint and a more effective tightening of the plantar aponeurosis. The foot becomes a rigid lever for propulsion. In contrast to the human condition, the anthropoid calcaneus has an anteromedial extension associated with symmetry of the calcaneocuboid joint.

40|$|MOST PAN {{stages in}} Australian {{factories}} use only five or <b>six</b> batch <b>pans</b> {{for the high}} grade massecuite production and operate these in a fairly rigid repeating production schedule. It is common {{that some of the}} pans are of large dropping capacity e. g. 150 to 240 t. Because of the relatively small number and large sizes of the pans, steam consumption varies widely through the schedule, often by ± 30 % about the mean value. Large fluctuations in steam consumption have implications for the steam generation/condensate management of the factory and the evaporators when bleed vapour is used. One of the objectives of a project to develop a supervisory control system for a pan stage is to (a) reduce the average steam consumption and (b) reduce the variation in the steam consumption. The operation of each of the high grade pans within the schedule at Macknade Mill was analysed to determine the idle (or buffer) time, time allocations for essential but unproductive operations (e. g. pan turn round, charging, slow ramping up of steam rates on pan start etc.), and productive time i. e. the time during boil-on of liquor and molasses feed. Empirical models were developed for each high grade pan on the stage to define the interdependence of the production rate and the evaporation rate for the different phases of each pan’s cycle. The data were analysed in a spreadsheet model to try to reduce and smooth the total steam consumption. This paper reports on the methodology developed in the model and the results of the investigations for the pan stage at Macknade Mill. It was found that the operation of the schedule severely restricted the ability to reduce the average steam consumption and smooth the steam flows. While longer cycle times provide increased flexibility the steam consumption profile was changed only slightly. The ability to cut massecuite on the run among pans, or the use of a high grade seed vessel, would assist in reducing the average steam consumption and the magnitude of the variations in steam flow...|$|R

Insertion of the tool into the tube was {{required in order to}} obtain the food item. One of each pair was exposed to a model performing the task successfully,whereas the age-matched peer was not. Following acquisition, subjects were tested with more complex versions of the task to evaluate their comprehension. Age affected acquisition; older individuals learned to solve the task in fewer number of trials than younger chimpanzees. The presence of a model influenced acquisition only in the 3 -and- 4 year-old groups and not in the 2 -year-old group. Moreover,older individuals made fewer errors when faced with tools requiring modification, and the performance of older individuals on these complex tasks improved with limited practice. These results are related to recent findings on cognitive development in chimpanzees indicating that self-recognition emerges between 24 and 30 months and that 4 year-old chimpanzees can imitate novel arbitrary actions. Comparisons with human cognitive developmental data and findings on the same task with older apes point to the link between the emergence of imitation, self recognition, and comprehension of the cause-effect relation present in this task.

Inhibition with an anti-bluetongue virus guinea pig serum resulted in a 30 % decrease in ELISA signal of A 1. No inhibition was obtained with the rest of the scFvs when guinea pig and sheep serum were used. An anti-bluetongue virus chicken IgY inhibited the scFvs by 50 % to 86 %.

40|$|The {{origin of}} Plasmodium falciparum, the {{etiological}} {{agent of the}} most dangerous forms of human malaria, remains controversial. Although investigations of homologous parasites in African Apes are crucial to resolve this issue, studies have been restricted to a chimpanzee parasite related to P. falciparum, P. reichenowi, for which a single isolate was available until very recently. Using PCR amplification, we detected Plasmodium parasites in blood samples from 18 of 91 individuals of the genus <b>Pan,</b> including <b>six</b> chimpanzees (three <b>Pan</b> troglodytes troglodytes, three Pan t. schweinfurthii) and twelve bonobos (Pan paniscus). We obtained sequences of the parasites' mitochondrial genomes and/or from two nuclear genes from 14 samples. In addition to P. reichenowi, three other hitherto unknown lineages were found in the chimpanzees. One is related to P. vivax and two to P. falciparum that are likely to belong to distinct species. In the bonobos we found P. falciparum parasites whose mitochondrial genomes indicated that they were distinct from those present in humans, and another parasite lineage related to P. malariae. Phylogenetic analyses based on this diverse set of Plasmodium parasites in African Apes shed new light on the evolutionary history of P. falciparum. The data suggested that P. falciparum did not originate from P. reichenowi of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), but rather evolved in bonobos (Pan paniscus), from which it subsequently colonized humans by a host-switch. Finally, our data and that of others indicated that chimpanzees and bonobos maintain malaria parasites, to which humans are susceptible, a factor of some relevance to the renewed efforts to eradicate malaria...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the vibration mitigation properties of selected seat cushions and the effects of occupant seating posture during exposure to higher frequency multi-axis vibration associated with military propeller aircraft. Methods A Navy E- 2 C Hawkeye crew seat was mounted onto the Six Degree-of-Freedom Motion Simulator (SIXMODE). <b>Six</b> seat <b>pan</b> cushion configurations were tested during exposure to an E- 2 C vibration signal collected in the field 1. Seat pan cushions 1 - 5 were used with the original E- 2 C seat back cushion. Cushion configuration 6 included seat pan cushion 5 with a prototype seat back cushion. Triaxial accelerometer pads were mounted onto the seat pan and seat back cushions to measure the vibration entering the human. Data were collected for seven subjects seated upright with their backs in contact with the seat (back-on) and not in contact with the seat (back-off). Spectral analysis techniques were used to analyze data at the two dominant frequencies associated with the propulsion system (propeller rotation frequency (PRF) ~ 18. 5 Hz, and blade passage frequency (BPF) ~ 73. 5 Hz). Overall accelerations were also calculated between 1 and 80 Hz. Vibration Total Values (VTVs) were calculated using the weighted seat pan and seat back (back-on only) accelerations and compared to the comfort reactions given in ISO 2631 - 1 : 19972. Results In general, the highest accelerations observed at the seat pan occurred in the fore-and-aft (X) direction at both the PRF and the BPF for all cushions and both postures. The most pronounced effect was at the BPF in the X direction, where all configurations showed significantly lower seat pan accelerations than configuration 1 (original E- 2 C cushion) with the back-on posture. Configuration 5 was the exception with the back-off posture (Fig. 1 A, Repeated Measures ANOVA, P< 0. 05).

Glomerular ZO- 1 protein expressions were significantly increased in the PAN rats as compared to the control group on day 20 (176 %, p< 0. 01). CsA treatment for 20 days in the PAN rats inhibited the increase in ZO- 1 protein expression by 71. 1 % (p< 0. 05). CsA treatment significantly diminished the glomerular ZO- 1 expression in the PAN rats as assessed by immunohistochemistry. CsA treatment significantly reduced proteinuria and the diminished glomerular ZO- 1 expression in a PAN nephrosis rat model. These findings suggest the potential role of the slit diaphragm associated proteins {{in the development of the}} nephrotic syndrome, and CsA decreased the proteinuria probably by a direct action on the expression of these proteins in podocytes. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of slit diaphragm associated proteins in the development of PAN nephrosis...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Activated macrophages {{are made}} up of two broad subsets, M 1 “classically activated” macrophages and the M 2 “alternatively activated” macrophages. These subsets present diverse {{functional}} phenotypes, with M 1 macrophages exhibiting a pro-inflammatory and microbicidal functions while M 2 macrophages possess functional roles in resolution of inflammation and tissue remodeling. An imbalance in M 1 versus M 2 macrophages can contribute to disease progression. In cancer, populations of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) mediate immunosuppression and possess M 2 -like qualities such as poor antigen presentation, promotion of angiogenesis and tissue remodeling and repair. In addition, TAMs may promote the exhausted phenotype of CD 8 + T cells, resulting in their inability to eliminate tumor cells. Not surprisingly, the extent of TAM accumulation within tumors generally correlates with poor disease prognosis. Despite the growing interest in tumor immunotherapy, there continues to be a dearth of TAM-specific targeting agents. In this work, an M 2 -selective peptide was isolated via a subtractive phage biopanning technique against whole cells. The phage biopanning resulted in identification of M 2 pep, a peptide that selectively binds and is internalized by murine M 2 macrophages. Next, M 2 pep was characterized for binding to TAMs extracted from CT- 26 syngeneic tumors as well as accumulation in TAMs in vivo. Administration of a fusion peptide of M 2 pep with KLA, a pro-apoptotic peptide, resulted in delayed tumor growth, increased mouse survival, and selective elimination of TAMs. Unfortunately, M 2 pep did not bind human M 2 macrophages derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and consequently, whole-cell phage display biopanning against human macrophages was performed to obtain a similar human M 2 pep peptide. Despite <b>six</b> separate whole-cell <b>panning</b> attempts against human PBMC-derived M 2 macrophages, no peptide with selective binding to human M 2 macrophages was isolated. In addition, biopanning against Legumain and PD-L 1 immobilized proteins, targets selected for their high expression on tumor-associated macrophages, failed to distinguish peptides with selective binding to their target protein. Work to discover peptides with selective human M 2 macrophage binding properties is ongoing in the lab...|$|R
