40|$|International audienceThis note {{shows how}} to draw {{diagrams}} automatically from the predicate specification of a given set of geometric relations among a set of points in the plane. It is done first in Maple by translating the geometric relations into polynomial equations, decomposing the obtained system of polynomials into irreducible representative triangular sets, and finding an adequate numerical solution from each triangular set. A Java class coding the solution and the polynomials in each triangular set is generated, compiled, and then executed with the main Java programs to draw a diagram. The whole process combining symbolic elimination in Maple with numerical computation, graphic drawing, and letter labeling in Java is fully automatic. The drawn diagrams may be animated and fine-tuned by mouse click and dragging and saved as PostScript files.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{outcomes}} of neuroscientific research are models of Neural Network Structures. Descriptions of these models usually consist of a non-standardized mixture of text, figures, and other means of visual information communication in print media. However, as neuroscience is an interdisciplinary domain by nature, a standardized way of consistently representing models of Neural Network Structures is required. While generic descriptions of such models in textual form have recently been developed, a formalized way of schematically expressing them does not exist to date. Hence, {{in this paper we}} present Neural Schematics as a concept inspired by similar approaches from other disciplines for a generic two dimensional representation of said structures. After introducing Neural Network Structures in general, a set of current visualizations of models of Neural Network Structures is reviewed and analyzed for what information they convey and how their elements are rendered. This analysis then allows for the definition of general items and symbols to consistently represent these models as Neural Schematics on a two dimensional plane. We will illustrate the possibilities an agreed upon standard can yield on <b>sampled</b> <b>diagrams</b> transformed into Neural Schematics and an example application for the design and modeling of large-scale Neural Network Structures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Throughout {{the thesis}} study, design and {{implementation}} of Petri nets, which is an effective mathematical and graphical method used for describing discrete systems, based {{on the principles of}} fuzzy logic are analyzed. Adaption of classical Petri nets to digital circuit systems led to obtain Fuzzy Petri nets that are managed according to the principles of fuzzy logic. Design of FPN modeled railway traffic system in the form of digital circuit and the executability in real life was possible via FPGA. Furthermore, the elements of Petri nets are demonstrated and then the firing properties of the tokens that provide dynamic characteristics are explained by the help of <b>sample</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The mathematical infrastructure of Petri nets are supported with graphical notation. The featured fundamental characteristics of Petri nets are examined. In addition, the basic rules for fuzzy logic, distinguishing features from classical logic, usage areas in application and the relationship between fuzzy logic and Petri nets are discussed. Furthermore, algorithmic modelling with FPN is indicated with examples. Lastly, the relationship between Petri nets that based on fuzzy logic and digital circuits are determined. The essential purpose is to design a comprehensive discrete system with Fuzzy Petri nets. As an application study, the Fuzzy Petri net modelling of a railway traffic system, generation of relevant digital circuit on FGPA is proposed. Keywords- Fuzzy Petri Nets, FPGA I...|$|R

It is difficult to apply statistical theory directly to a random <b>sample</b> of <b>diagrams.</b> Instead, we can summarize the persistent homology with the persistence landscape, introduced by Bubenik, which converts a diagram into a well-behaved real-valued function.

40|$|A new {{reduction}} {{is made of}} the HST photometric data for E galaxies in three remote clusters at redshifts near z= 0. 85 in search for the Tolman surface brightness (SB) signal for {{the reality of the}} expansion. Because of the strong variation of SB of such galaxies with intrinsic size, and because the Tolman test is about surface brightness, we must account for the variation. In an earlier version of the test, Lubin & Sandage calibrated the variation out. In contrast, the test is made here using fixed radius bins for both the local and remote samples. Homologous positions in the galaxy image at which to compare the surface brightness values are defined by radii at five Petrosian eta values ranging from 1. 0 to 2. 0. Sersic luminosity profiles are used to generate two diagnostic diagrams that define the mean SB distribution across the galaxy image. A Sersic exponent, defined by the r^n family of Sersic profiles, of n= 0. 46 fits both the local and remote <b>samples.</b> <b>Diagrams</b> of the dimming of the with redshift over the range of Petrosian eta radii shows a highly significance Tolman signal but degraded by luminosity evolution in the look-back time.
