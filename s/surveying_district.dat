Virtual image or other information that is created by the computer is superimposed with the <b>surveying</b> <b>district</b> which the observer stands is looking at. When the observer is moving in the district, the virtual information is changing correspondingly, just like the virtual information really exists in true environment. The observer can see the scene of aerodrome if he puts on clairvoyant HMD.

In our design studio, students take pictures of a point of interest (POI) in the project district and discuss the design concept of the district based on the photographs. To share the photographs obtained by the students during the field survey along with the attribute information and shooting positions, the present authors have developed a Web-based image archive system as an effective resource for a design studio. This system registers the photographs taken in the <b>surveying</b> <b>district</b> on GoogleMap and simultaneously displays the images on a three-dimensional city model. In this paper, we discuss the development of a Map-based Repository of Image (MRI) system to share the photographs of a city. Moreover, we attempt to evaluate its pedagogical effect in the design studio...|$|E

40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} disorder (IDD) is {{the single}} most important preventable cause of brain damage. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs) refer to all of the consequences of iodine deficiency in a population, which can be prevented by taking adequate amount of Iodine. The objectives was to ascertain the prevalence goitre among 6 - 12 year children by clinical examination in Mahasamund district; 2) to document the iodine uptake status reflected by random urinary excretion levels in a sub-sample of 6 - 12 year children covered for clinical examination, and 3) to evaluate the coverage of iodized salt at community level (i. e. at household and retail shop) on-the-spot test by using rapid salt testing kit. Methods: A cross sectional community based survey was done in Mahasamund district during April 2015 to September 2015. The study population was children in the age group of 6 - 12 years. 30 cluster sampling methodology was applied using PPS sampling technique, based on latest survey guidelines of NIDDCP of Govt. of India. The parameters studied were prevalence of goitre, urinary iodine excretion, and iodine content in salt at community level (i. e. household and shop). Results: A total of 2700 children aged from 6 - 12 years were assessed clinically for goitre. The total goitre prevalence was 4. 29 % (95 % CI: 3. 3 - 5. 27). The median urinary iodine excretion (MUIE) was 106. 67 and # 956;g/L (range 11 - 216. 7 and # 956;g /L) among surveyed children. 37. 4 % of the urinary iodine excretion values were < 100 and # 956;g/L. The households consuming inadequately iodized salt (i. e. iodine content and # 8804; 15 ppm) was 20 % in the <b>surveyed</b> <b>district.</b> Conclusions: Although prevalence of goitre and median urinary iodine excretion among surveyed population was found satisfactory against the norms set by NIDDCP in <b>surveyed</b> <b>district</b> but universal salt iodization (USI) is yet to achieve in <b>surveyed</b> <b>district.</b> [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (8. 000) : 3590 - 3594...|$|R

40|$|India is {{experiencing}} energy crisis and a widening gap between energy supply and demand. The country is, however, endowed with considerable, commercially and technically available renewable resources, from which surplus agro-biomass {{is of great}} importance and a relatively untapped resource. In the policy making process, knowledge of existing biomass use, degree of social reliance, and degree of biomass availability for energy production is unequivocal and pre-conditional. Field observations, documentation, and fill-in sheet tools were used to investigate the potential of biomass resources and the existing domestic, commercial, and industrial uses of biomass in selected Indian states. To do so, a team of field observers/supervisors visited three Indian states namely: Maharashtra (MH), Madhya Pradesh (MP), and Tamil Nadu (TN). Two districts from each state were selected to collect data {{regarding the use of}} biomass and the extent of biomass availability for energy production. In total, 471 farmers were interviewed, and approximately 75 farmers with various land holdings have been interviewed in each district. The existing uses of biomass have been documented in this survey study and the results show that the majority of biomass is used as fodder for domestic livestock followed by in-site ploughing, leaving trivial surplus quantities for other productive uses. Biomass for cooking appeared to be insignificant due to the availability and access to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in the <b>surveyed</b> <b>districts.</b> Opportunities exist to utilize roadside-dumped biomass, in-site burnt biomass, and a share of biomass used for ploughing. The GIS-based maps show that biomass availability varies considerably across the Taluks of the <b>surveyed</b> <b>districts,</b> and is highly dependent on a number of enviromental and socio-cultural factors. Developing competitive bioenergy market and enhancing and promoting access to more LPG fuel connections seem an appropriate socio-economic and environmental approach to reduce the use of biomass for indoor cooking and increasing the share of surplus biomass for energy production...|$|R
