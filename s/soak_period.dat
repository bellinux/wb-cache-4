The materials were taken from smallholder plantation in Jasinga, Bogor. The treatments were arranged factorial in a group randomized block design with two factors. The first factor was 6 levels of quick lime concentration (K) : 0 g/l, 10 g/l, 15 g/l, 20 g/l, 25 g/l, 30 g/l and the second factor was 4 levels of soak periods: 0 minute, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. The experiments had 24 treatments combination with 4 replicates so there were 72 experiment units.

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} evaluated {{a number}} of factors affecting the structure, dynamics and variability in catches from Antillean "Z" traps deployed on fringing coral reefs at Orpheus Island (central Queensland coast). The aim was to develop methodologies to improve the use of traps as a fishing device and a sampling tool for different target species. The effects of trap characteristics (mesh size), presence of bait, bait type and frequency, soak time and the prior residence of individuals in traps were assessed, in terms of total catches and species composition. Using direct diver observations and video technology, the effects of these manipulations on the attractiveness of traps to different species, the number of fish entering the traps and escapement were distinguished. The generality of the patterns observed was assessed repeating experiments at two locations. Cattle Bay (Trial 1) and Pioneer Bay (Trial 2). Catch rates and final catches were consistently higher in large-meshed traps (42 mm hexagonal mesh) compared with small-meshed traps (12. 5 mm square mesh), and for traps baited with pilchards (Sardinops neopilchardus) compared with the use of fish oil. The same pattern was observed during both trials, although overall catches were twice as high at Cattle Bay, compared with Pioneer Bay. During the second trial, baited traps did not perform better than traps with no bait. Also, similar total catches were registered in rebaited traps and traps baited only once, suggesting a minor role of bait on catches at this location. The magnitude of the effects of these different trapping procedures on catch rates and final catches was species-specific. Catches were dominated by four species: Siganus doliatus (Siganidae), Lutjanus carponotatus (Lutjanidae), Plectropomus maculatus and P. leopardus (Serranidae). These were affected differently by the mesh size, with S. doliatus caught almost entirely in large-meshed traps, L. carponotatus caught mainly using pilchards for bait, and the coral trout species not significantly affected by any of the treatments. There appeared to be a trend in the composition of fish families trapped. Herbivorous fish appeared {{at the beginning of the}} <b>soak</b> <b>period</b> when large predatory species were absent. More predatory species could have progressively entered traps to prey on the smaller fish species that are being accumulated over the <b>soak</b> <b>period.</b> Differences in catches were the result of different behavioural responses of fishes to traps at different stages in the trapping process. Diver-observations and video analysis indicated that different catch rates in different treatments were not closely related to the number of fish attracted to the traps, but reflected species-specific differences in the likelihood of fish entering or escaping from traps. An experiment in which the presence of S. doliatus in traps was manipulated, indicated that catches were affected by visual communication between fish inside and outside large-meshed traps. Greater numbers of S. doliatus entered large-meshed traps in which S. doliatus had been placed experimentally. On the other hand, L. carponotatus was more likely to enter traps baited with pilchards, and the presence of small fish in traps at the beginning of the <b>soak</b> <b>period</b> resulted in a greater catchability of coral trout. Knowledge of these species-specific fish-fish and fish-trap behavioural responses provides considerable scope for designing trapping protocols for targeting particular species. High variability in catches may be an unavoidable consequence of species specific behaviour patterns and may limit their utility as a sampling tool for measuring changes in relative populations densities...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method to}} enhance oil {{production}} during cyclic steam injection has been developed. In the Top-Injection and Bottom-Production (TINBOP) method, the well contains two strings separated by two packers (a dual {{and a single}} packer) : the short string (SS) is completed in the top quarter of the reservoir, while the long string (LS) is completed in the bottom quarter of the reservoir. The method requires an initial warm-up stage where steam is injected into both strings for 21 days; then the LS is opened to production while the SS continues to inject steam for 14 days. After the initial warm-up, the following schedule is repeated: the LS is closed and steam is injected in the SS for 21 days; then steam injection is stopped and the LS is opened to production for 180 days. There is no <b>soak</b> <b>period.</b> Simulations to compare {{the performance of the}} TINBOP method against that of a conventional cyclic steam injector (perforated across the whole reservoir) have been made.

40|$|Ice {{nucleation}} in seed of maturing seed corn (Zea mays L.) was not {{influenced by}} the attachment or detachment of leaves or the stalk. Nucleation was {{influenced by the}} absence or presence of the husk. When the husk was removed from the ear, nucleation occurred at lower temperatures so greater damage resulted. The husk appeared to be the site of initial nucleation for the ear. Single seeds supercooled 2 to 3 C lower than seeds attached to the ear;Nucleation of seeds still attached to the ear gave the appearance of randomness. This may have been due to the heat released when the water changed state in the individual seed. The heat was partially passed to adjacent kernels, especially those in the same row because of their larger surface area contact;Nucleation occurring in single seed at - 6 C required an additional exposure of only 15 to 30 minutes for the seed to be injured. It was not possible to injure seed at - 3 C in the growth chamber even though seed in field experiments were damaged at - 2 C;Measurement of the electrical conductivity of soaking water from fresh seed exposed to a frost may be useful in determining damage. Correlations were determined between conductivities from various soak periods and germination. Standard deviations of the individual seed conductivities were also checked for correlation with germination. The conductivity means were more highly correlated with germination than the conductivity standard deviations. The 4 and 8 hour soak periods had the highest correlation with germination.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to compare the performance of cyclic steam injection using horizontal wells based on the analytical model developed by Gunadi against that based on numerical simulation. For comparison, a common reservoir model was used. The reservoir model measured 330 ft long by 330 ft wide by 120 ft thick, representing half of a 5 -acre drainage area, and contained oil based on the properties of the Bachaquero- 01 reservoir (Venezuela). Three steam injection cycles were assumed, consisting of a 20 -day injection period at 1500 BPDCWE (half-well), followed by a 10 -day <b>soak</b> <b>period,</b> and a 180 -day production period. Comparisons were made for two cases of the position of the horizontal well located {{on one side of the}} reservoir model: at mid-reservoir height and at reservoir base. The analytical model of Gunadi had to be modified before a reasonable agreement with simulation results could be obtained. Main modifications were as follows. First, the cold horizontal well productivity index was modified to that based on the Economides-Joshi model instead of that for a vertical well. Second, in calculating the growth of the steam zone, the end-point relative permeability??s of steam and oil were taken into consideration, instead of assuming them to be the same (as in the original model of Gunadi). Main results of the comparative analysis for both cases of horizontal well positions are as follows. First, the water production rates are in very close agreement with results obtained from simulation. Second, the oil production rates based on the analytical model (averaging 46, 000 STB), however, are lower than values obtained from simulation (64, 000 STB). This discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that the analytical model assumes residual oil saturation in the steam zone, while there is moveable oil based on the simulation model. Nevertheless, the analytical model may be used to give a first-pass estimate of the performance of cyclic steam injection in horizontal wells, prior to conducting more detailed thermal reservoir simulation...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{carbon dioxide}} {{emission}} reductions are in progress following the Kyoto Protocol implementation programme to mitigate climate change. More stringent reductions {{are expected to}} follow the present programme which ends in 2012. In addition to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the major climate change mitigation policy is the elimination of waste. This project addresses both aspects, by facilitating the use of biomass and waste fuels in the gas turbines of highly efficient, integrated gasification combined cycle electricity generating units. Gases from the gasification of these fuels contain potentially damaging contaminants which, when combusted in gas turbines, will initiate hot corrosion. To resist hot corrosion, but still maximise gas turbine efficiency, the hot components of gas turbines require protective coatings. Five activities in this project required original research to meet the objectives. Firstly, to identify potentially damaging species in gasifier gases, which could remain after hot gas cleaning and, following combustion, initiate hot corrosion along the gas path of the gas turbine. Thermodynamic assessments, using MTDATA software, identified cadmium and lead species that could initiate hot corrosion in the gas turbine. The second research activity, involved Type II hot corrosion tests of the identified species on superalloys and typical commercial coatings. These tests simulated the same corrosion environment as in industrial high temperature gas turbine operation. Test results confirmed the thermodynamic assessments, with hot corrosion being initiated on all items tested, and was worse with lead and/or cadmium additions. The third research activity was to develop novel hot corrosion protective coatings. The approach was to develop the most economic coatings, which would provide comparable, or superior, hot corrosion performance to that provided by well proven commercial coatings already used with fossil fuel firing. From previous research at Cranfield, published literature, and after aluminising and silicon modified aluminising CVD trials, single-step silicon modified aluminising was adopted {{as the basis for}} novel coating development. The fourth research activity consisted of cyclic oxidation tests and, type II and type I hot corrosion tests, to assess the oxidation and hot corrosion protection provided by the novel coatings on IN 738 LC and CMSX- 4 substrates. Cyclic oxidation tests at 950 C and 1050 C showed the novel coatings produced by CVD, at a soak temperature of 1050 C and <b>soak</b> <b>period</b> of one hour, were superior for both substrates. Microstructurally, TCP phases were formed in CMSX- 4 samples which could reduce mechanical strength in service. The TCP phases were observed in the high silicon containing coatings through a reaction with refractory metals diffusing outward from the CMSX- 4. This was most noticeable in samples cyclically oxidised at 1050 C for long times. Results of hot corrosion tests undertaken at 700 C (type II) and 900 C (type I) showed novel coatings on IN 738 LC samples to be more resistant than commercial coatings. Those on CMSX- 4 samples had similar hot corrosion resistance to commercial coatings. The novel coatings provided high levels of hot corrosion resistance, which could be enhanced by improvements in deposition. The fifth research activity was to carry out EB-PVD TBC trials on an IN 738 LC turbine blade, which demonstrated that the novel coating provided an effective bond for the TBC. It is concluded that the novel, single-step silicon-aluminide coatings developed in this project, with identified improvements in quality, will provide effective hot corrosion resistance for gas turbines burning gasified biomass and waste fuels.

The germination-promoting effect of C 2 H 4 decreased gradually as its application time was delayed during a <b>soaking</b> <b>period,</b> whereas CO 2 was most promotive in application at 5 days of soaking, then its effect declined. CO 2 and C 2 H 4 were additive in earlier <b>soaking</b> <b>periods</b> and synergistic in later periods. Such changes in germination behavior in response to CO 2 and/or C 2 H 4 during a <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> were closely associated with growth responsiveness of the axial tissues, but not of the cotyledonary ones.

40|$|Low {{friction}} lubricant development {{provides a}} worthwhile contribution to vehicle CO 2 emission reduction. Conventional low friction lubricant development focuses on empirical processes using out dated engine technology and old test methods. This strategy is inefficient and restricts the lubricant's potential. A new method {{proposed in the}} present research combines tribological simulations with rig, engine and vehicle tests. This approach provides insights undocumented until now. The contribution to CO 2 emission reduction from individual engine components on vehicle drive cycles that include warm-up is predicted using lubricants down to the new SAE 8 viscosity grade. A bearing model is used to design the lubricant's non Newtonian characteristics to achieve friction reduction. An isoviscous lubricant with a viscosity of 4. 6 cSt is shown to achieve the minimum friction in the bearing. The research shows that by starting with lubricants having kinematic viscosities higher than this value, {{it is possible to}} improve lubricant performance by lowering viscosity index (VI), introducing shear thinning, or reducing the density and pressure viscosity coefficient. Conversely, for lubricants with lower starting viscosities it is shown that higher VI values, more shear-stable lubricants and higher densities and pressure viscosity coefficients are required. The model predicts that high oil film pressures occur in the bearing and cause significant local lubricant viscosity increase (300 %), indicating that the lubricant's pressure viscosity behaviour is important here, despite the contact being conformal. Simulation and motored engine testing establishes lubricant behaviour in the piston-to-bore conjunction. This analysis identifies a poor correlation between measured and predicted values at low engine speeds. A rig-on-liner tribometer shows that this error is attributable to a deficiency in the simulation's characterisation of boundary regime friction. An oil pump test determines how a modern variable displacement oil pump (and its control system) responds to lowering viscosity. The hypothesis that low viscosity lubricants cause the parasitic load from this component to increase is disproven using this component-level rig test. Chassis dynamometer testing compares the CO 2 reduction performance of lubricant thermal management systems to the values achieved by reducing the viscosity grade. CO 2 reductions of between 0. 4 % and 1. 0 % are identified using a cold-start new European drive cycle (NEDC) with a 5 W- 30 preheated to 60 °C and 90 °C respectively. Reductions in CO 2 emissions between 0. 4 % and 1. 2 % are found on the NEDC by lowering the oil fill volume from 5. 1 L to 2. 1 L. For the unmodified case, a 3. 7 % reduction in CO 2 emissions is reported by reducing the viscosity grade from a 5 W 30 to an SAE 8 in the NEDC. The performance of a novel external oil reservoir is simulated to understand its ability to retain oil temperature during the vehicle cool-down procedure. An oil temperature of 65 °C {{at the end of the}} <b>soak</b> <b>period</b> (following a prior test where the oil was assumed to reach 90 °C) is predicted by installing insulation to the reservoir and indicates that a viable method to achieve the CO 2 benefits identified through lubricant preheating tests exists. A full vehicle model combines the outputs from each of these sub-models to predict lubricant performance on the NEDC the new World-wide harmonized light duty test cycle (WLTC). This new approach provides a tool that enables next generation low friction lubricants to be developed. The model predicts that an SAE 8 lubricant can reduce CO 2 emissions by 2. 8 % on the NEDC and 1. 9 % on the WLTC compared to a 5 W- 30. A theoretical experiment, where all lubricant related friction was deleted from the simulation, predicts that lubricant-related CO 2 emissions are 8. 7 % on the NEDC and reduce to 6. 3 % on the WLTC. These results indicate that the planned adoption of the WLTC in September 2017 reduces the potential contribution to CO 2 emission reduction from lubricants by 28 %. </p...|$|E

However,  those two factors significantly (P < 0. 01) affected  the incubation period and the intensity of ginger bacterial wilt disease.    Separation of the means by Duncan test indicated that the higher the bactericide concentration, the longer the incubation period. On the other hand, the disease intensity was lowered by the higher concentration.   The effect of  bactericide concentration 4 g/l was not significantly different from that of 6 g/l.    The analysis of variance was also showed that the length of <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> of ginger seedling in bactericide did not affect the incubation period  nor the disease intensity...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} during long-term soaking of the California Bearing Ratio (CBR), the {{resilient modulus}} and the deformation of compacted Iraqi gypsiferous soil containing about 34 % gypsum was studied. Sixteen (CBR) samples compacted at optimum moisture content and 95 % {{of the maximum}} dry density of the modified AASHTO compaction test were prepared. Two samples each were <b>soaked</b> for <b>periods</b> of 0, 4, 7, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 days with 40 lb (178 N) surcharge load. The tests revealed that the soil swelled initially then it started to settle and the settlement process continued at a slow rate even after 180 days soaking. Directly after soaking and before carrying out the load-penetration test, each sample was subjected to a compressive wave {{as well as to}} a shear wave using the ultrasonic pulse velocity technique. The seismic determination of the shear and compression wave velocities allowed a good estimate of the resilient modulus of the gypsiferous soil tested. After the seismic test, the CBR test was completed and the TSS and gypsum content was determined. The tests revealed a marked drop in CBR {{and to a lesser extent}} in the resilient modulus MR with <b>soaking</b> <b>period.</b> The loss in CBR and MR took place at a high rate within the first week and at a decreased rate thereafter so that the soil strength became almost constant after about six months. The decrease of total soluble salts and gypsum content in soils with a longer <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> is in full agreement with the loss in CBR and MR with soaking. The paper reveals that a <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> of four days can lead to misleading and unsafe results regarding strength, stiffness and deformation of gypsiferous soils...|$|R
30|$|The role of {{molecular}} diffusion in recovering oil from tight and shale oil reservoirs has been examined in previous work (Chen et al. 2014; Sanchez-Rivera et al. 2015; Wan and Sheng 2015). The CME-GEM simulator {{was used to}} examine the possible influential factors that decide the oil response in the huff-n-puff process. The simulation results indicate that longer <b>soaking</b> <b>periods</b> recover less oil than shorter soaking times. They suggested that no <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> is required in the huff-n-puff process in the Bakken shale. This statement is in contradiction with the experimental results mentioned earlier (Gamadi et al. 2013; Yu and Sheng 2016). The disagreement between experimental data and simulation methods indicates that more effort is required in understanding the mechanisms happening in the soaking process. Molecular diffusion effects in the <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> were found to be important in huff-n-puff recovery prediction. The effect {{of molecular}} diffusion in cyclic gas injection on shale oil recovery has been investigated (Wan and Sheng 2015; Wan et al. 2015). Comparison of the laboratory data with the numerical simulation results shows that without the diffusion effect included in the simulation model a lower recovery factor is predicted than experimentally observed. Chen and Gu (2017) used a simulation approach to investigate the optimal injection and production duration in a cycle to achieve the maximum oil recovery. The sensitivity analyses show that short injection and production periods were favorable for CO 2 huff-n-puff performance. A series of sensitivity studies of CO 2 huff-n-puff EOR in shale oil reservoirs was examined (Alfarge et al. 2017 b; Kong et al. 2016; Sheng 2015; Yu et al. 2014). The simulation results show that the most influential variables are injection time, CO 2 injection rate and the number of cycles employed. However, CO 2 soaking, fracture half-length and permeability were listed as less sensitive parameters to simulation output, while they are influential in the experimental EOR process. The <b>soaking</b> <b>period</b> is not a critical factor to improved oil recovery by gas huff-n-puff in shale oil reservoirs (Boosari et al. 2015). CO 2 huff-n-puff is more favorable for reservoirs with high heterogeneity by using long hydraulic fractures (Yu et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Among {{the most}} widely used tests for {{evaluating}} seed vigor, electrical conductivity (EC) stands out {{as one of the most}} promising due to its speed and simplicity. This study aimed to verify if the EC test could be used to evaluate the physiological quality of seed lots of Piptadenia moniliformis Benth. A seed lot, which was classified by seed tegument color and size, was used based on seed retention in round-hole screens, sizes 11 and 15, constituting 10 sub-lots. Prior to germination and the EC test, the seeds were immersed in concentrated sulfuric acid for 20 minutes in order to overcome tegument dormancy. During the EC test, we soaked seeds in 75 mL of water at 25 ºC and tested eight <b>soaking</b> <b>periods</b> (2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h) and two seed quantities (25 and 50) per replicate. The EC test, regardless of the number of seeds or <b>soaking</b> <b>period,</b> was not adequate for evaluating the physiological quality of color- or size-classified seed lots from P. moniliformis Benth. ...|$|R
