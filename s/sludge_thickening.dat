50|$|The {{difference}} {{of these methods}} could be demonstrated with the methods used in waste water processing: in the clarification phase, sludge sinks {{to the bottom of}} the pool and clear water flows over the clear water grooves and continues its journey. The obtained sludge is then pumped into the thickeners, where <b>sludge</b> <b>thickens</b> farther and is then obtained to be pumped into digestion to be prepared into fertilizer.|$|R
50|$|Thickening {{is often}} {{the first step in}} a sludge {{treatment}} process. Sludge from primary or secondary clarifiers may be stirred (often after addition of clarifying agents) to form larger, more rapidly settling aggregates. Primary <b>sludge</b> may be <b>thickened</b> to about 8 or 10 percent solids, while secondary <b>sludge</b> may be <b>thickened</b> to about 4 percent solids. Thickeners often resemble a clarifier with the addition of a stirring mechanism. <b>Thickened</b> <b>sludge</b> with less than ten percent solids may receive additional sludge treatment while liquid thickener overflow is returned to the sewage treatment process.|$|R
50|$|When {{a liquid}} sludge is produced, further {{treatment}} {{may be required}} to make it suitable for final disposal. <b>Sludges</b> are typically <b>thickened</b> and/or dewatered to reduce the volumes transported off-site for disposal. Processes for reducing water content include lagooning in drying beds to produce a cake that can be applied to land or incinerated; pressing, where sludge is mechanically filtered, often through cloth screens to produce a firm cake; and centrifugation where the <b>sludge</b> is <b>thickened</b> by centrifugally separating the solid and liquid. Sludges can be disposed of by liquid injection to land or by disposal in a landfill.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sludge</b> <b>thickening</b> using {{centrifugal}} force is amongst {{the most common}} process used. There {{are two types of}} centrifuge designed for <b>sludge</b> <b>thickening</b> and both methods depends on the same solid-liquid separation principal. The first method is [...] "solid bowl centrifuge", a horizontally-arranged helical screw that admits sludge, removes solid in a countercurrent fashion while allowing liquids to pass through. The moving shaft consists of a set of helical scrolls which push the solid waste against the flow of incoming sludge. As solid content starts to build up, it will become too heavy and then drops down to a collection bin. A video illustrates this process.|$|E
50|$|Permissive {{hypotension}} {{may also}} be contraindicated in patients with cerebrovascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, and compromised renal (kidney) function, where hypotension may induce <b>sludge</b> (<b>thickening</b> of blood) and lead to occlusion of the vessel lumen.

50|$|<b>Sludge</b> <b>thickening</b> by {{gravitational}} settling and dynamic {{is used to}} minimize the volume of sludge. Feed with a content of 0.8% solids, can be thickened to a content of 4% solids, which means a fivefold decrease in sludge volume is obtained.

Two laboratory methods are used for measuring sludge dewatering ratio - capillary suction time (CST) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF).

40|$|Sewage sludge {{contains}} a significant concentration of sulphur (0. 3 - 2. 3 wt%) that hampers sludge (co-) combustion {{as the final}} disposal route due to the formation and emission of gaseous SO 2 and associated acid rain problems. It is therefore of paramount importance to limit the sulphur content of waste-activated sludge (WAS) as much as possible. This paper studies the distribution and transformations of sulphur compounds occurring during the successive steps in the sewage sludge treatment. Data were gathered from sampling and analyzing all relevant water and sludge streams of a full-scale treatment plant during I month. It was seen that sulphates are the predominant compounds in secondary <b>sludge.</b> During <b>thickening,</b> the oxygen level in the sludge decreases due to microbial activity, and the sulphates are gradually transformed into sulphides. The process continues when <b>thickened</b> <b>sludge</b> is stored in the sludge storage tanks. After anaerobic digestion, the ORP of the sludge has decreased {{to such an extent}} that all inorganic sulphur is transformed into sulphides. The experimental results were confirmed by a chemical speciation. To limit the residual sulphur content in the sludge, it is hence beneficial to dewater the sludge when still in aerobic conditions, thus largely releasing soluble sulphates with the sludge water. status: publishe...|$|R

The sludge was exposed to ultrasound fi eld, using ultrasound generator with power of 1500 W, frequency of 20 kHz and amplitude 39. 42 μm (which corresponded to the amplitude of 100 %). Sonication of the sludge was carried out for different amplitudes and sonication times.

40|$|The present {{research}} studies {{the evolution of}} sulphur concentrations during wastewater treatment for various full-scale treatment plants and reveals that {{a significant amount of}} S is released as highly soluble sulphates with the sludge water during <b>sludge</b> <b>thickening</b> when sludge is still in aerobic conditions.

40|$|Elimination of {{the sewage}} sludge from urban {{wastewater}} occurs exclusively by incineration in Switzerland, because recycling as fertilizer in agriculture has been banned since October 2006. Two options exist for elimination, either thermal elimination of a <b>thickened</b> <b>sludge</b> {{in a household}} waste incineration plant, or drying of the <b>thickened</b> <b>sludge</b> to yield a granular material fit for storage and transport. The high organic content of this material makes it a valuable alternative fuel for the cement industry. This elimination route is hampered, however, by the tendency of this material to self-heating and occasional thermal runaway resulting in fire. This research project deals with {{the investigation of the}} characteristics of these dried sewage sludge granules and the possible reasons for the observed self-heating phenomenon. It was found that a cascade of reactions and a series of circumstances are responsible for the thermal runaway, where each of them isolated would not lead to an event. Mainly responsible for triggering the initial temperature raise is the oxidation of Fe(II) compounds, added to the wastewater as FeClSO₄ for phosphate precipitation, and present in this lower oxidation state due to the reducing conditions in the digesters.

Research has demonstrated the abundant treatment and economic opportunities presented by co-digestion of high strength wastewater, but these wastes {{also have the}} potential to cause digester failure. Indeed, based on what is known about the disruption of digesters, if a municipality is considering co-digestion, it needs to know the characteristics of high strength wastewaters that have a predictable potential for disruption. The Metropolitan Council-Environmental Services (MCES) is one such municipality interested in pursuing co-digestion. MCES is interested in expanding current digester use to include co-digestion of high strength waste streams to reduce their energy and sludge disposal costs. The objective of this research was to develop a protocol for MCES to be used in evaluating the feasibility of co-digesting municipal wastewater sludge with other high strength wastes. The protocol involves anaerobic biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays inoculated by source anaerobic digesters and amended with PBS, sludge (TPS/TWAS mixture), waste, or waste combined with sludge. Co-digestion experiments examined well-characterized synthetic wastes (starch, gelatin, tween 80, and cysteine) and wastes of interest to MCES with unknown impacts (dimethylformamide, dairy processing waste, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, <b>thickened</b> primary <b>sludge,</b> <b>thickened</b> waste activated <b>sludge,</b> and scum collected from the primary clarifier at an MCES wastewater treatment facility). These wastes were characterized as degradable, non-degradable, toxic or degradable after an adaptation period. Gelatin, tween 80, dairy processing waste, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol were degradable, while dimethylformamide was non-degradable. Cysteine, a sulfur-rich waste, was found to be toxic at concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. Scum, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol required an adaptation period before being degraded. Additionally, the microbial analysis via qPCR indicated that the abundance of Bacteria and methanogens in the co-digestion experiments were not statistically different from the sludge-only experiments, even when different types of wastes were tested (i. e., degradable, non-degradable, toxic, etc.). The developed method and subsequent guidelines will be useful for MCES and other wastewater treatment facilities when making informed decisions about whether or not to accept potential high strength wastes for co-digestion with sludge...|$|R
