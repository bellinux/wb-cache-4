However, there is little empirical evidence available to indicate whether the use of such services prevents children at risk from moving further into the welfare system. The Department of Community Services (DoCS) Office of Childcare commissioned this project {{to examine the relationship between}} children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> for children under school age in NSW and DoCS child protection function.

40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>service</b> surplus soared {{from near}} zero in 1985 to about $ 60 billion in 1992, {{offsetting}} about {{two thirds of}} the goods trade deficit. Could this merely reflect improvement in data collection? Or does this mean U. <b>S.</b> <b>services</b> industries are more competitive internationally than goods industries? Is the services surplus likely to continue to rise? This paper estimates a forecastable model of U. <b>S.</b> <b>services</b> trade to address the above questions. We find that data improvement actually had a negative net impact on the services surplus, since it affected imports more than exports. Instead, the surge in the services surplus was mainly due to strong foreign growth and, to a lesser extent, dollar depreciation. An increase in either outward or inward foreign direct investment asset (FDIA) has a significant and positive impact on both exports and imports of other private services, but has only a modest net effect on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>services</b> balance. Thus, the outlook for the U. <b>S.</b> <b>services</b> balance largely depends on the growth prospect of foreign economies. Balance of trade; Service industries...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{explanation}} of the development of pre-school children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> (infant welfare, kindergartens and child care) at local government level in Victoria. The critical framework of analysis focuses on three dimensions of public policy: 1) the socio-historical environment; 2) the political processes involved {{in the development of the}} specific children 2 ̆ 7 s service; and 3) the major individuals and groups that exerted pressure for children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>service,</b> The argument is threefold. Firstly it is argued that the political environment of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> has been dominated by the practice of separate spheres of public and private, in which the care of children is primarily the role of women. Secondly, it is argued that the political processes surrounding the development of local children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> have involved all levels of government in what is termed a local state. Thirdly, it is argued that the development of these children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> in local government has resulted mainly from the work of women both individually and collectively. Since the three services of infant welfare, kindergartens and child care all became a normal function of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> at different times, the circumstances that surrounded each development exhibited different aspects of the three major arguments. The periodisation is broken into four phases: 1) the establishment of local government with no children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> in the nineteenth century; 2) the establishment of infant welfare services in local government in the early part of the twentieth century; 3) the incorporation of kindergartens into local government after the second world war; and 4) the incorporation of child care into local government in the 1970 s and 1980 s. The thesis concludes by arguing that the existence of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> in local government in Victoria is testimony to the remarkable work of those women who have pursued the issue both individually and collectively. It has been the identification of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> as a women 2 ̆ 7 s issue in Australian politics that has enabled women 2 ̆ 7 s groups at different times to influence the policy makers in diverse ways. However, while the establishment of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> as a legitimate political concern brings the matter onto the public agenda, the separate spheres still remains a contested issue in the public policies of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: ClinicalTrials. gov reviews have {{evaluated}} research {{trends for}} specific conditions and age groups {{but not for}} specific populations of research participants. No ClinicalTrials. gov reviews have evaluated research with military service member participants. Purpose: Study objectives were (a) to use ClinicalTrials. gov to identify trends in biomedical research from 2005 to 2014 in which U. <b>S.</b> military <b>service</b> members actively participated as research participants and (b) to describe a search strategy for adaptation in future ClinicalTrials. gov reviews of specific participant populations. Methods: A systematic review of ClinicalTrials. gov was performed to identify studies that included U. <b>S.</b> <b>service</b> members as participants, either exclusively or with other groups of participants. Results: U. <b>S.</b> <b>service</b> members were identified as participants in 512 studies. Service members participated together with other groups in 392 studies, while 120 studies included only service members. The top five conditions of interest were post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, amputations, burns, and ocular injuries/disorders.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the problem of achieving “organizational justice” for children within integrated children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services.</b> Justice is understood, following Byers and Rhodes discussion of Levinas as respecting the “unique and indivisible” character of a given child. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical material reported here is drawn from a large study of interagency working in children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> in the UK. Data are taken from Developmental Work Research sessions. Methodological details are outlined in Daniels et al. and Leadbetter et al. Findings – The key finding discussed here is that in order to balance the outcome measures used in children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services,</b> participants use a further abstraction “the outcome of improved outcomes”. The logical and practical consequences of this abstraction are analysed. Originality/value – The paper offers an empirically grounded contribution to conceptual debates about otherness and ethics in organization. In particular, it argues that a concern for the other need not preclude a high level of concrete categorization and minute target setting. The philosophical debate is seen to be “resolved” in practice...|$|R

40|$|Graduate nurses 2 ̆ 7 {{transition}} {{from school to}} the work place is challenging and often leads to burnout. There was no graduate nurse residency program in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> at the practicum facility. As a result, this facility {{had been unable to}} recruit or hire graduate nurses in the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> unit. The purpose of this project was to develop a nurse residency program in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services</b> to address the lack of formal orientation for new graduate nurses at this facility. A graduate nurse residency program will provide further training for nurses to care for a more complicated population of pregnant women. Theoretical support for this project was Duchscher 2 ̆ 7 s, theory of transition, which suggests that allowing graduates time to adjust within a context of support allows them to develop their thinking and practice and helps them move through the stages of professional role transition. The project included a review of literature, development of a nurse residency plan, all materials needed to operationalize the program in the institution, and plans for implementing and evaluating the program over time within the context of institutional challenges, goals, and strengths. Collaboration with institutional stakeholders helped to ensure the contextual relevance of the program and ongoing administrative ownership to provide momentum for the program to move forward following delivery of the products of the DNP project to the institution. In sum, the products of this project comprise a turn-key solution to the institutional need for a graduate nurse residency program in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>services.</b> Social change implications include possible improvement in the recruitment and retention of graduate nurses as well as the consistent development of competent and safe practitioners who will improve maternal and newborn outcomes at the facility...|$|R
