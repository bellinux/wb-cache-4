50|$|A {{winding machine}} or winder is a machine for {{wrapping}} string, twine, cord, thread, yarn, rope, wire, ribbon, tape, etc. onto a <b>spool,</b> <b>bobbin,</b> reel, etc.|$|E
40|$|A {{coil winding}} machine is a {{machine for winding}} coil onto a <b>spool,</b> <b>bobbin</b> and many more. This coil winding machine is one of types of winding machine that {{available}} in industries today. From multi speeded machines to medium, large and extra-large machines, these machines come in various types and categories, performing a range function. The common applications for a coil winding machine are to wind coils for transformer, inductors, motor and chokes. To complete a coil using manual coil winding machine will be inconvenience and waste of time. Therefore, fabrication of coil winding machine will be done in this project which is controlled by two stepper motor using Arduino program. This machine is inexpensive, easy to operate and build in a small-scale size. This project {{also can be used}} for training students in winding of small transformers & relay coils...|$|E
25|$|Silk {{throwing}} (winding). The skeins {{are placed}} on a reel in a frame with many others. The silk is wound onto <b>spools</b> or <b>bobbins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Staveley Mill Yard is {{a former}} <b>bobbin</b> (<b>spool)</b> mill, which is now used {{for a variety of}} {{different}} local industries, shops and other commercial ventures. It is situated in the centre of the village of Staveley, Cumbria, just off the main street.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, they rented {{space in}} an old <b>spool</b> and <b>bobbin</b> mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and started packing their ice cream in pints. In 1981, the first Ben & Jerry's {{franchise}} opened on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont. In 1983, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream was used to build “the world’s largest ice cream sundae” in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighed 27102 lb. That same year, the cows on their cartons were redesigned by local artist Woody Jackson.|$|R
5000|$|In spinning, a lazy kate (also simply {{known as}} a kate) is a device used to hold one or more <b>spools</b> or <b>bobbins</b> in place while the yarn on them is wound off {{from the side of}} the bobbin. Typically, a kate {{consists}} of multiple rods, which allow the bobbins to spin. Tensioned kates have a band that loops over the bobbins to prevent them from spinning freely. Some spinning wheels have built-in kates, although these tend to be more cumbersome to use than free-standing ones.|$|R
25|$|Dyeing: the skeins are scoured again, and {{discoloration}} removed with a sulphur process. This {{weakens the}} silk. The skeins are now tinted or dyed. They are dried and rewound onto <b>bobbins,</b> <b>spools</b> and skeins. Looming, and the weaving process on power looms {{is the same}} as with cotton.|$|R
50|$|Mike Rainville {{first came}} to {{woodworking}} as a hobby when he was 11. At that time, his mother, Pat, told him that, “he needed {{to find something to}} do.” Rainville’s grandparents had a history of working with their hands, specifically woodworking and farming, so there were always materials around to utilize. Rainville made his first items, <b>spools</b> and <b>bobbin</b> holders, in his parents’ basement in Lincoln, Vermont, using some spare wood, a coping saw, and a sanding block. As time progressed, he started making cribbage boards which are still being made today. Local craft fairs provided him with income to purchase new equipment and materials. By 1979, Rainville had established his first wholesale relationship.|$|R
50|$|In {{the textile}} industry, a hank is a coiled or wrapped unit of yarn or twine (as opposed to both other objects like thread or rope {{as well as}} other forms such as in a ball, cone, <b>bobbin,</b> <b>spool,</b> etc). This is often the best form for use with hand looms, {{compared}} to the cone form needed for power looms. Hanks come in varying lengths {{depending on the type of}} material and the manufacturer. For instance, a hank of linen is often 300 yd, and a hank of cotton or silk is 840 yd.|$|R
50|$|Winders have {{a center}} roll (a <b>bobbin,</b> <b>spool,</b> reel, belt-winding shell, etc.) {{on which the}} {{material}} is wound up. Often there are metal bars that travel {{through the center of}} the roll, and are shaped according to their intended purpose. A circular bar facilitates greater speed, while a square bar provides a greater potential for torque. Edge sensors are used to sense how full the center roll is. They are mounted on adjustable slides to accommodate many different widths, as the width increases as the center roll is filled. The sensitivity of the sensor depends on the required speed of operation.|$|R
