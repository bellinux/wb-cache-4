40|$|We {{report a}} {{high dynamic range}} (HDR) image sensor with a linear {{response}} that overcomes some {{of the limitations of}} sensors with pixels with <b>self-reset</b> operation. It operates similar to an active pixel sensor, but its pixels have a novel asynchronous event-based overflow detection mechanism. Whenever the pixel voltages at the integration capacitance reach a programmable threshold, the pixels <b>self-reset</b> and send out asynchronously an event indicating this. At the end of the integration period, the voltage at the integration capacitance is digitized and readout. Combining this information with the number of events fired by each pixel, it is possible to render linear HDR images. Event operation is transparent to the final user. There is no limitation for the number of self-resets of each pixel. The output data format is compatible with frame-based devices. The sensor was fabricated in the AMS 0. 18 - μm HV technology.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel pseudo 4 -phase dual-rail protocol with <b>self-reset</b> logic suited for high speed asynchronous applications. The traditional 4 -phase dual-rail requires the input {{to be of}} alternating valid and empty cycles. However the proposed pseudo 4 -phase involves continuous stream of valid data without a separate empty cycle. The empty phase is generated internally so that the next valid data can be processed. Also <b>self-reset</b> logic for dual-rail protocol has been proposed in which the combinational blocks resets itself whenever its evaluation phase is completed and the data is latched at the pipeline register. The concept of multiple-reset i. e. resetting each of the gates in the combinational block between any two pipeline registers simultaneously has been introduced reducing the reset phase and hence increasing the throughput rate. An asynchronous 8 -bit pipelined carry propagate adder was implemented in 0. 18 μm technology.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of superconducting niobium and niobium nitride {{nanowires}} used as single optical and near-infrared photon detectors. The nanowires are biased in the zero-voltage state with a current just below their critical current and at a temperature well below their critical temperature. In this state, an absorbed photon induces localized heating {{at the point of}} absorption. This suppresses the critical current in that location, creating a resistive region in the nanowire. The resistive region can grow under Joule heating and can <b>self-reset</b> to the zero-voltage state without the dc bias current being reduced. This study is twofold. First, niobium is investigated as an alternate detector material to niobium nitride. This study compares the performance niobium nanowire detectors of several geometries and fabricated in two different ways to the performance of niobium nitride nanowire detectors. Niobium detectors are found to have longer reset times and are more difficult to bias in a regime where they <b>self-reset</b> to the zero voltagestate after detecting a photon. This makes niobium a less suitable material than niobium nitride for these detectors. In the second part of this study, the reset dynamics of these detectors are studied...|$|E

Integrate-and-Fire (I&F) neurons can translate the intensity of a current input into a time domain signal: Strong input current will lead to an early spike output and weak input to a late output.

40|$|An {{asynchronous}} <b>self-reset</b> with residue {{conversion scheme}} for the readout electronics {{of an image}} sensor, further referred to as Fractional Packet Counting (FPC), is proposed. The basic concept of the FPC {{is to increase the}} resolution of the conversion both by using a switched integrator and by quantifying its output {{at the end of the}} signal integration time. A circuit implementing this principle for CT applications is proposed and simulated. In particular, in the proposed circuit a constant relative resolution is used: this means to use floating point representation with a constant number of significant bits. Simulations show that a dynamic range of 117 dB is achieved, working at 2 kHz frequency. The detectable signal range goes from 24 fA to ∼ 400 nA. The simulation results have been used to develop a mathematical model for the SNR accounting the different noise sources.

40|$|Miniaturization and {{integration}} of biosensor platforms is appealing due to smaller reaction volumes, larger numbers of detection sites {{and integration}} of various functionalities. Proper design of integrated biosensors is crucial in such systems due to limitation in resources such as power, chip area and cost. The optimal design involves determining the required sensor metrics and achieving these metrics with minimum use of the available resources. The system-level requirements of various biosensor arrays are discussed in this paper. We will show here, that while in certain applications, the best sensor performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or dynamic range (DR) is desirable, in others, these metrics can be traded off with power, area and ease of design and implementation.

Efficient solutions with zero sneak path current, nondestructive R/W operations, minimum area and low power {{are some of}} the key requirements. Toward this end, we propose a novel crossbar memory scheme using a configuration row of cells for assisting R/W operations. The proposed write scheme minimizes the overall power consumption compared to the previously proposed write schemes and reduces the state drift problem. We also propose two read schemes, namely, assisted-restoring and self-resetting read. In assisted-restoring scheme, we use the configuration cells which are used in the write scheme, whereas we implement additional circuitry for <b>self-reset</b> which addresses the problem of destructive read. Moreover, by formulating an analytical model of R/W operation, we compare the various schemes. The overhead for the proposed assisted-restoring write/read scheme is an extra redundant row for the given crossbar array.
