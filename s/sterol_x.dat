40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{dehydroepiandrosterone}} (DHEA) on the thermotropic and structural properties of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylcholine membranes was investigated by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} and X-ray diffraction. At molar fractions of <b>sterol,</b> <b>X</b> (sterol), less than ∼ 0. 2, DHEA interacts with both types of model membranes, depressing the melting temperature and reducing the enthalpy of melting. At higher concentrations, phase separation of DHEA occurs with appearance of crystallites of the S 2 monohydrate form...|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes two proteins: <b>sterol</b> {{carrier protein}} <b>X</b> (SCPx) and <b>sterol</b> carrier protein 2 (SCP2), {{as a result}} of {{transcription}} initiation from 2 independently regulated promoters. The transcript initiated from the proximal promoter encodes the longer SCPx protein, and the transcript initiated from the distal promoter encodes the shorter SCP2 protein, with the 2 proteins sharing a common C-terminus. Evidence suggests that the SCPx protein is a peroxisome-associated thiolase that is involved in the oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, while the SCP2 protein is thought to be an intracellular lipid transfer protein. Alternative splicing of this gene produces multiple transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms. The full-length nature of all transcript variants has not been determined.|$|R
40|$|Background: The basidiomycetous yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous {{has been}} {{described}} as a potential biofactory for terpenoid-derived compounds due to its ability to synthesize astaxanthin. Functional knowledge of the genes involved in terpenoid synthesis would create opportunities to enhance carotenoid production. A thiolase enzyme catalyzes the first step in terpenoid synthesis. Results: Two potential thiolase-encoding genes were found in the yeast genome; bioinformatically, one was identified as an acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (ERG 10), and the other was identified as a 3 -ketoacyl Co-A thiolase (POT 1). Heterologous complementation assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that the ERG 10 gene from X. dendrorhous could complement the lack of the endogenous ERG 10 gene in S. cerevisiae, thereby allowing cellular growth and <b>sterol</b> synthesis. <b>X.</b> dendrorhous heterozygous mutants for each gene were created, and a homozygous POT 1 mutant was also obtained. This mutant exhibited changes in pigment composition and higher ERG 10 transcript levels than the wild type strain. Conclusions: The results support the notion that the ERG 10 gene in X. dendrorhous is a functional acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase essential for the synthesis of mevalonate in yeast. The POT 1 gene would encode a functional 3 -ketoacyl Co-A thiolase that is non-essential for cell growth, but its mutation indirectly affects pigment productionFONDECYT 	 11121200 1160202 CONICYT 	 2111070...|$|R
40|$|To discuss recent {{insights}} into the measurement and cellular basis of transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) in humans and to explore TICE as a therapeutic target for increasing reverse cholesterol transport. TICE is {{the net effect of}} cholesterol excretion by the enterocyte into the intestinal lumen and is the balance between input and output fluxes through the enterocytes. These fluxes are: cholesterol excretion into the intestinal lumen mainly via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) G 5 / 8, cholesterol absorption from the intestine by Niemann-Pick C 1 like protein 1, the uptake of plasma lipoproteins by enterocytes at the basolateral membrane, and the excretion of cholesterol in chylomicrons into the lymph. Multiple studies have shown that TICE contributes to fecal neutral sterol (FNS) excretion in humans. TICE can be targeted with plant <b>sterols,</b> liver <b>X</b> receptor agonists, bile acids, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors. TICE contributes significantly to FNS excretion in humans, independently of the biliary pathway. Knowledge about its underlying cellular mechanisms surges through in-vivo and in-vitro studies in mice and humans. TICE might be an interesting therapeutic target for increasing cholesterol disposal with the feces. Albeit multiple therapeutic options are available, studies showing clinical benefit are still neede...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} the first known patient with a deficiency of <b>sterol</b> carrier protein <b>X</b> (SCPx), a peroxisomal enzyme with thiolase activity, which {{is required for the}} breakdown of branched-chain fatty acids. The patient presented with torticollis and dystonic head tremor as well as slight cerebellar signs with intention tremor, nystagmus, hyposmia, and azoospermia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed leukencephalopathy and involvement of the thalamus and pons. Metabolite analyses of plasma revealed an accumulation of the branched-chain fatty acid pristanic acid, and abnormal bile alcohol glucuronides were excreted in urine. In cultured skin fibroblasts, the thiolytic activity of SCPx was deficient, and no SCPx protein could be detected by western blotting. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous 1 -nucleotide insertion, 545 _ 546 insA, leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon (I 184 fsX 7) ...|$|R
40|$|Leishmaniasis is {{parasitic}} disease {{that is an}} important problem of public health worldwide. Intramuscularly administered glucantime and pentostam {{are the most common}} drugs used for treatment of this disease, but they have significant limitations due to toxicity and increasing resistance. A recent breakthrough has been the introduction of orally administered miltefosine for the treatment of visceral, cutaneous, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, but the relative high cost and concerns about teratogenicity have limited the use of this drug. Searching for alternative drugs, we previously demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone is active against Leishmania mexicana promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes, acting via disruption of intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis (specifically at the mitochondrion and the acidocalcisomes of these parasites) and through inhibition of the parasite's de novo <b>sterol</b> biosynthesis (<b>X.</b> Serrano-Martín, Y. García-Marchan, A. Fernandez, N. Rodriguez, H. Rojas, G. Visbal, and G. Benaim, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 53 : 1403 - 1410, 2009). In the present work, we found that miltefosine also disrupts the parasite's intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis, in this case by inducing a large increase in intracellular Ca 2 + levels, probably through the activation of a plasma membrane Ca 2 + channel. We also investigated the in vitro and in vivo activities of amiodarone and miltefosine, used alone or in combination, on L. mexicana. It was found that the drug combination had synergistic effects on the proliferation of intracellular amastigotes growing inside macrophages and led 90 % of parasitological cures in a murine model of leishmaniasis, as revealed by a PCR assay using a novel DNA sequence specific for L. mexicana...|$|R
40|$|Dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) are omega-oxidation {{products}} of monocarboxylic acids. After activation by a dicarboxylyl-CoA synthetase, the dicarboxylyl-CoA esters are shortened via beta-oxidation. Although {{it has been}} studied extensively where this beta-oxidation process takes place, the intracellular site of DCA oxidation has remained controversial. Making use of fibroblasts from patients with defined mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation defects, we show in this paper that peroxisomes, and not mitochondria, {{are involved in the}} beta-oxidation of C 16 DCA. Additional studies in fibroblasts from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (SCOX) deficiency, d-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1, together with direct enzyme measurements with human recombinant l-bifunctional protein (LBP) and DBP expressed in a fox 2 deletion mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, show that the main enzymes involved in beta-oxidation of C 16 DCA are SCOX, both LBP and DBP, and <b>sterol</b> carrier protein <b>X,</b> possibly together with the classic 3 -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.

40|$|The SCP gene encodes two proteins, <b>sterol</b> {{carrier protein}} <b>X</b> (SCPx) and SCP 2, that are {{independently}} regulated by separate promoters.

We show here that both SCPx and SCP 2 are upregulated by the daf- 16 -like Forkhead transcription factor FOXO 3 a (also known as FKHRL 1) on the level of promoter activity. It was recently described that Forkheads regulate protection against (oxidative) stress in both Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells.

40|$|<b>Sterol</b> {{carrier protein}} <b>X</b> (SCPx) plays {{a crucial role}} in the peroxisomal {{oxidation}} of branched-chain fatty acids. To investigate whether patients with an unresolved defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation are deficient for SCPx, we developed a novel and specific assay to measure the activity of SCPx in both liver and fibroblast homogenates. The substrate used in the assay, 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy- 24 -keto- 5 beta-cholestanoy l-CoA (24 -keto-THC-CoA), is produced by preincubating the enoyl-CoA of the bile acid intermediate THCA with a lysate from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing human D-bifunctional protein. After the preincubation period, liver or fibroblast homogenate is added plus CoASH, and the production of choloyl-CoA is determined by HPLC. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the finding of a full deficiency in fibroblasts from an SCPx knock-out mouse. In addition to SCPx activity measurements in fibroblasts from patients with a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation of unresolved etiology, we studied the stability and activity of SCPx in fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome, which lack functional peroxisomes. We found that SCPx is not only stable in the cytosol, but displays a higher activity in fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome than in control fibroblasts. Furthermore, in all patients studied with a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation of unknown origin, SCPx was found to be normally active, indicating that human SCPx deficiency remains to be identifie...|$|R
40|$|DHA (C 22 : 6 n- 3) is an {{important}} PUFA implicated {{in a number of}} (patho) physiological processes. For a long time, the exact mechanism of DHA formation has remained unclear, but now it is known that it involves the production of tetracosahexaenoic acid (C 24 : 6 n- 3) from dietary linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n- 3) via a series of elongation and desaturation reactions, followed by beta-oxidation of C 24 : 6 n- 3 to C 22 : 6 n- 3. Although DHA is deficient in patients lacking peroxisomes, the intracellular site of retroconversion of C 24 : 6 n- 3 has remained controversial. By making use of fibroblasts from patients with defined mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation defects, we show in this article that peroxisomes, and not mitochondria, are involved in DHA formation by catalyzing the beta-oxidation of C 24 : 6 n- 3 to C 22 : 6 n- 3. Additional studies of fibroblasts from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (SCOX) deficiency, d-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1, and of fibroblasts from l-bifunctional protein and <b>sterol</b> carrier protein <b>X</b> (SCPx) knockout mice, show that the main enzymes involved in beta-oxidation of C 24 : 6 n- 3 to C 22 : 6 n- 3 are SCOX, DBP, and both 3 -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and SCPx.

40|$|The {{two main}} thiolase {{activities}} present in isolated peroxisomes from normal rat liver were purified to near homogeneity. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the first enzyme preparation displayed a single band of 41 kDa that {{was identified as}} 3 -oxoacyl-CoA thiolase A (thiolase A) by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, The second enzyme preparation consisted of a 58 - and a 46 -kDa band, The 58 -kDa polypeptide reacted with antibodies raised against either sterol carrier protein 2 or the thiolase domain of sterol carrier protein 2 / 3 -oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (SCP- 2 /thiolase), formerly also called <b>sterol</b> carrier protein <b>X,</b> whereas the 46 -kDa polypeptide reacted only with the antibodies raised against the thiolase domain, Internal peptide sequencing confirmed that the 58 -kDa polypeptide is SCP- 2 /thiolase and that the 46 -kDa polypeptide is the thiolase domain of SCP- 2 /thiolase. Thiolase A catalyzed the cleavage of short, medium, and long straight chain 3 -oxoacyl-CoAs, medium chain 3 -oxoacyl-CoAs being the best substrates, The enzyme was inactive with the 2 -methyl-branched 3 -oxo- 2 -methylpalmitoyl-CoA and with the bile acid intermediate 24 -oxo-trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA. SCP- 2 /thiolase was active with medium and long straight chain 3 -oxoacyl-CoAs {{but also with the}} 2 -methyl-branched 3 -oxoacyl-CoA and the bile acid intermediate. In peroxisomal extracts, more than 90 % of the thiolase activity toward straight chain 3 -oxoacyl-CoAs was associated with thiolase A. Kinetic parameters (K-m and V-max) were determined for each enzyme with the different substrates. Our results indicate the following: 1) the two (main) thiolases present in peroxisomes from normal rat liver are thiolase A and SCP- 2 /thiolase; 2) thiolase A is responsible for the thiolytic cleavage of straight chain 3 -oxoacyl-CoAs; and 3) SCP- 2 /thiolase is responsible for the thiolytic cleavage of the 3 -oxoacyl-CoA derivatives of 2 -methyl-branched fatty acids and the side chain of cholesterol...|$|R
40|$|C. elegans has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} for being used in genetic approaches to understanding the aging process. However, currently the worms are being used {{in a variety of}} other approaches, such as drug screening, disease modeling, and environmental manipulations. Collectively all these approaches are likely to provide a unique insight into the aging process. The objective of this thesis was to define the localization of peroxisomal proteins whose deficiency affects the rate of chronological aging and post-embryonic development of C. elegans in various tissues of this organism. The thesis focused homologs of human <b>Sterol</b> Carrier Protein <b>x</b> (hSCPx) in C. elegans, their roles and sub-cellular localization. P- 44, nlt- 1 and dhs- 28 [...] are all members of SCP- 2 sterol transfer family. My data indicate that P- 44 plays vital role in the regulation of dauer formation, delayed egg-laying period, smaller body size, increased lipid accumulation and extended life-span. Nlt- 1 also shows extended lifespan by 40 % compared with wild type. In this thesis, I also report that P- 44, nlt- 1 and dhs- 28 are involved in fatty acid metabolism. All of these are expressed in the intestine and appear to be peroxisomal. Both P- 44 and nlt- 1 seem to be required for catabolism of cyclopropane containing fatty acids. P- 44 deficiency also blocks the catabolism of pristanic acid. dhs- 28 (17 -Ý-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase), on the other hand, only blocks (affects) the pristanic acid pathway. The data reported in this thesis support the view that there is no direct link between the amount of lipid deposits in an organism and a lifespan. This thesis also explored the use of vital lipophilic dye Nile Red (NR) for visualizing fat storage droplets in C. elegans and for elucidating the role of fat regulatory genes in nematode aging. From the data analysis we can conclude that there is no correlation between the levels of triacylglycerols and a specific pattern of NR staining. Thus, NR is not suitable for monitoring body fat in C. elegans. Staining of animals with SBB in combination with the direct assessment of triacylglycerols by TLC is more appropriate for this purpos...|$|R
