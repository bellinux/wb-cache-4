40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} computing inertia <b>sets</b> <b>for</b> graphs. By using tools for combining the inertia sets of smaller graphs we can reduce this problem to understanding the inertia <b>sets</b> <b>for</b> three-connected graphs that are not joins. We term such graphs atoms and give the inertia <b>sets</b> <b>for</b> all atoms on at most seven vertices. This {{can be used to}} compute the inertia <b>sets</b> <b>for</b> all graphs on at most seven vertices...|$|R
