60|$|Caroline was not unhappy that evening--far otherwise; but as <b>she</b> gazed <b>she</b> <b>sighed,</b> and as <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> a hand circled her, {{and rested}} quietly on her waist. Caroline thought she knew who had drawn near; she {{received}} the touch unstartled.|$|R

6000|$|The gods, {{to curse}} Pamela with her prayers, Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares, [...] 50 The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state, And, to {{complete}} her bliss, a fool for mate.

6000|$|In old-world nursery vacant now of children, With posied walls, familiar, fair, demure, And facing southward o'er romantic streets, Sits yet and gossips winter's dark away One gloomy, vast, glossy, and wise, and sly: And at {{her side}} a cherried country cousin. Her tongue claps ever like a ram's sweet bell; There's not a name but calls a tale to mind-- Some marrowy patty of farce or melodram; There's not a soldier but hath babes in view; There's not on earth what minds not of the midwife: [...] "O, {{widowhood}} that left me still espoused!" [...] Beauty <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> o'er, and <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> o'er gold; Gold will buy all things, even a sweet husband, Else only Heaven is left and--farewell youth! Yet, strangely, in that money-haunted head, The sad, gemmed crucifix and incense blue Is childhood once again. Her memory Is like an ant-hill which a twig disturbs, But twig stilled never. And to see her face, Broad with sleek homely beams; her babied hands, Ever like 'lighting doves, and her small eyes-- Blue wells a-twinkle, arch and lewd and pious-- To darken all sudden into Stygian gloom, And paint disaster with uplifted whites, Is life's epitome. She prates and prates-- A waterbrook of words o'er twelve small pebbles. And when she dies--some grey, long, summer evening, When the bird shouts of childhood through the dusk, 'Neath night's faint tapers--then her body shall Lie stiff with silks of sixty thrifty years.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY. Yes. (He {{opens the}} door to the porch and goes out. Miss Gilpin stands for a moment looking after him worriedly. Then <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> helplessly and goes out to the hall. Murray steps noiselessly out on the porch. Eileen is lying {{motionless}} with her eyes closed. Murray stands looking at her, his face showing the emotional stress he is under, a great pitying tenderness in his eyes. Then he seems to come to a revealing decision on what is best to do for he tiptoes to the bedside and bending down with a quick movement, takes her in his arms and kisses her.) Eileen! ...|$|E
6000|$|But few, it seems, are {{admitted}} to that degree. Of all the carriages that leave {{the arch of}} the Opera House, not one turns eastward, and when the little thief is caught in the empty market-place no one in black-and-white or rose-coloured evening dress blocks the way by pausing with a hand upon the carriage door to help or condemn--though Lady Charles, to do her justice, sighs sadly as she ascends her staircase, takes down Thomas a Kempis, and does not sleep till her mind has lost itself tunnelling into the complexity of things. [...] "Why? Why? Why?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>sighs.</b> On the whole it's best to walk back from the Opera House. Fatigue is the safest sleeping draught.|$|E

6000|$|Very {{different}} is the dressing {{of the girl}} who isn't quite pretty, nor at all rich, from the luxurious joy which the beautiful woman takes in her new toilettes. Instead of the faint, shivery wonder as to whether men will realize how exquisitely the line of a new bodice accentuates the molding of her neck, the unpretty girl hopes {{that no one will}} observe how unevenly her dress hangs, how pointed and red and rough are her elbows, how clumsily waved her hair. [...] "I don't think anybody will notice," [...] <b>she</b> <b>sighs,</b> and is contemptuously conscious of her own stolid, straight, healthy waist, while her mother flutters about and pretends to believe that she is curved like a houri, like Helen of Troy, like Isolde at eighteen.|$|E

Ah! This is the last expression of modernity!’ She puts up suddenly her face-à-main and looks towards the end wall. ‘And that—Byzantium itself!

6000|$|This is {{particularly}} humiliating, because {{it happens to}} be true. We certainly do trudge, and are therefore properly, though rather unceremoniously, called trudgers, or [...] "trodgers." [...] But we sink to a lower depth yet, a little further on. We are viewed as objects for pity. It is a fine evening; we stop and lean against a bank by the roadside to look at the sunset. An old woman comes tottering by on high pattens, very comfortably and nicely clad. She sees our knapsacks, and instantly stops in front of us, and begins to moan lamentably. Not understanding at first what this means, we ask respectfully if she feels at all ill? [...] "Ah, poor fellows! poor fellows!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> in answer, [...] "obliged to carry all your baggage on your own backs!--very hard! poor lads! very hard, indeed!" [...] And the good old soul goes away groaning over our evil plight, and mumbling something which sounds very like an assurance that she has got no money to give us.|$|E

[...] By the deep quiet gloom appalled, <b>she</b> <b>sighs,</b> [s4] [...] Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes. [...] She hears, upon the mountain forest's brow, [...] The death-dog, howling loud and long, below; [...] --Breaking th' ascending roar of desert floods, [...] And insect buzz, that stuns the sultry woods, [s5] [...] On viewless fingers [s6] counts the valley-clock, [...] Followed by drowsy crow of midnight cock. [...] --Bursts from the troubled larch's giant boughs [...] The pie, and, chattering, breaks the night's repose. [s7] [...] The dry leaves stir as with the serpent's walk, [...] And, far beneath, Banditti voices talk; [...] Behind her hill, [s8] the Moon, all crimson, rides, [...] And his red eyes the slinking Water hides. [...] --Vexed by the darkness, from the piny gulf [...] Ascending, nearer howls the famished wolf, [s9] [...] While thro' the stillness scatters wild dismay [...] Her babe's small cry, that leads him to his prey.

60|$|Within {{the door}} of the cottage you discern the wife, with her ruddy English cheek. She is singing, doubtless, a psalm tune, at her {{household}} work; or, perhaps <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> at the remembrance of the cheerful gossip, and all the merry social life, of her native village beyond the vast and melancholy sea. Yet the next moment she laughs, with sympathetic glee, at the sports of her little tribe of children; and soon turns round, with the home-look in her face, as her husband's foot is heard approaching the rough-hewn threshold. How sweet must it be for those who have an Eden in their hearts, like Roger Conant and his wife, to find a new world to project it into, as they have, instead of dwelling among old haunts of men, where so many household fires have been kindled and burnt out, that the very glow of happiness has something dreary in it! Not that this pair are alone in their wild Eden, for here comes Goodwife Massey, the young spouse of Jeffrey Massey, from her home hard by, with an infant at her breast. Dame Conant has another of like age; and it shall hereafter be one of the disputed points of history which of these two babies was the first town-born child.|$|E
