Once thermal stress becomes severe enough that fetch gating degrades ILP, DVS is engaged instead to take advantage of its greater ability to reduce power density.

50|$|A {{heat pipe}} is a hollow tube {{containing}} a heat transfer liquid. The liquid absorbs heat and evaporates {{at one end}} of the pipe. The vapor travels to the other (cooler) end of the tube, where it condenses, giving up its latent heat. The liquid returns to the hot end of the tube by gravity or capillary action and repeats the cycle. Heat pipes have a much higher effective thermal conductivity than solid materials. For use in computers, the heat sink on the CPU is attached to a larger radiator heat sink. Both heat sinks are hollow, as is the attachment between them, creating one large heat pipe that transfers heat from the CPU to the radiator, which is then cooled using some conventional method. This method is expensive and usually used when space is tight, as in small form-factor PCs and laptops, or where no fan noise can be tolerated, as in audio production.

Two cooling systems, one water-cooled and the other air-cooled, were designed and implemented, and their performance was evaluated.

Replacing them with electrical machine could have a large impact in the environment. But there is still room for improvement in the electric machines in order to replace the internal combustion engines. The electrical machines that are used in the automotive industry use permanent magnets in their rotors. They have a number of advantages such as very good efficiency and high power density. On the other hand, sensitivity of the magnets in high temperatures and their price is the major drawbacks of permanent magnet machines. The magnets cannot operate in high temperatures because they suffer from demagnetization. To deal with this problem, today, high temperature grade magnets with a lot of segments are used.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} next generation electric and hybrid vehicle technology is the control and management of heat generation and operating temperatures. Vehicle performance, reliability and ultimately consumer market adoption are integrally dependent on successful battery thermal management designs. It will be shown that in the absence of active cooling, surface temperatures of operating lithium-ion batteries can reach as high as 50 °C, within 5 °C of the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature.</b> Even in the presence of active cooling, surface temperatures greater than 45 °C are attainable. It is thus of paramount importance to electric vehicle and battery thermal management designers to quantify the effect of temperature and discharge rate on heat generation, energy output, and temperature response of operating lithium-ion batteries. This work presents a purely experimental thermal characterization of thermo-physical properties and operating behavior of a lithium-ion battery utilizing a promising electrode material, LiFePO 4, in a prismatic pouch configuration. Crucial to thermal modeling is accurate thermo-physical property input. Thermal resistance measurements were made using specially constructed battery samples. The thru-plane thermal conductivity of LiFePO 4 positive electrode and negative electrode materials was found to be 1. 79 ± 0. 18 W/m°C and 1. 17 ± 0. 12 W/m°C respectively. The emissivity of the outer pouch was evaluated to enable accurate IR temperature detection and found to be 0. 86. Charge-discharge testing was performed to enable thermal management design solutions. Heat generated by the battery along with surface temperature and heat flux at distributed locations was measured using a purpose built apparatus containing cold plates supplied by a controlled cooling system. Heat flux measurements were consistently recorded at values approximately 400 % higher at locations near the external tabs compared to measurements taken a relatively short distance down the battery surface. The highest heat flux recorded was 3112 W/m 2 near the negative electrode during a 4 C discharge at 5 °C operating temperature. Total heat generated during a 4 C discharge nearly doubled when operating temperature was decreased from 35 °C to 5 °C, illustrating a strong dependence of heat generation mechanisms on temperature. Peak heat generation rates followed the same trend and the maximum rate of 90. 7 W occurred near the end of 5 °C, 4 C discharge rate operation. As a result, the maximum value of total heat generated was 41. 34 kJ during the same discharge conditions. The effect of increasing discharge rate from 1 C to 4 C caused heat generation to double for all operating temperatures due to the increased ohmic heating. Heat generation was highest where the thermal gradient was largest. The largest gradient, near negative electrode current collector to external tab connection and was evaluated using IR thermography to be 0. 632 °C/mm during 4 C discharge with passive room temperature natural convection air cooling. Battery designs should utilize a greater connection thickness to minimize both electrical resistance and current density which both drive the dominant mode of heat generation, ohmic heating.

With their wide range of <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperatures</b> (i. e. - 10 °C to 50 °C), the Li-ion is preferred over other types of matured battery technologies such as lead acid and nickel-cadmium (NiCd). Nevertheless, operating the Li-ion batteries at cold climate conditions can potentially harm the batteries and lead to issues such as degradation and reduction in their capacity and power density. This paper aims to experimentally investigate {{the behavior of a}} Li-ion cell <b>operating</b> at low <b>temperatures</b> (i. e. - 15 °C to 25 °C) with respect to its charging and discharging behavior. It was observed that at sub-zero temperatures (i. e. - 5 °C, - 10 °C and - 15 °C) the Li-ion cell&# 039;s capacity is reduced due to the impedance effect which then increases the cell&# 039;s internal resistance. Moreover, at such low temperatures the best state of charge (SOC) of the cell (i. e. during charging mode) has reduced to about 7 - 23 % of its maximum initial SOC (i. e. 100 %). To complement the experimental finding, an existing simplified adaptive thermal model was used to obtain the discharge curves at various current rates based on the function of extracted charge (Qout). The discharge curve of equilibrium potential (Eeq) is then extrapolated towards zero current in order to obtained the overpotential heat generation curve based on the discharge current of the cell. The result showed a good agreement to the discharge curves that were obtained experimentally.

40|$|Fabricating and {{operating}} complex systems involves dealing with {{uncertainty in the}} relevant variables. In the case of aircraft, flow conditions {{are subject to change}} during operation. Efficiency and engine noise may be different from the expected values because of manufacturing tolerances and normal wear and tear. Engine components may have a shorter life than expected because of manufacturing tolerances. In spite of the important effect of operating- and manufacturing-uncertainty on the performance and expected life of the component or system, traditional aerodynamic shape optimization has focused on obtaining the best design given a set of deterministic flow conditions. Clearly it is important to both maintain near-optimal performance levels at off-design operating conditions, and, ensure that performance does not degrade appreciably when the component shape differs from the optimal shape due to manufacturing tolerances and normal wear and tear. These requirements naturally lead to the idea of robust optimal design wherein the concept of robustness to various perturbations is built into the design optimization procedure. The basic ideas involved in robust optimal design will be included in this lecture. The imposition of the additional requirement of robustness results in a multiple-objective optimization problem requiring appropriate solution procedures. Typically the costs associated with multiple-objective optimization are substantial. Therefore efficient multiple-objective optimization procedures are crucial to the rapid deployment of the principles of robust design in industry. Hence the companion set of lecture notes (Single- and Multiple-Objective Optimization with Differential Evolution and Neural Networks) deals with methodology for solving multiple-objective Optimization problems efficiently, reliably and with little user intervention. Applications of the methodologies presented in the companion lecture to robust design will be included here. The evolutionary method (DE) is first used to solve a relatively difficult problem in extended surface heat transfer wherein optimal fin geometries are obtained for different <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> base <b>temperatures.</b> The objective of maximizing the <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> base <b>temperature</b> range is in direct conflict with the objective of maximizing fin heat transfer.

40|$|Cooling of {{electronic}} components {{is one of}} the most important issues concerned in the electronic industry for design of equipment. Maintaining the temperature of an electronic device within its <b>safe</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> limits is essential to operate the equipment safely with proper functionality. According to the Arrhenious law of failure rate, for a device with activation energy 0. 65 eV, every 10 °C increase in temperature doubles the failure rate. Recent miniaturisation of components and high device heat dissipation rates lead to high heat fluxes, which cause temperature rise. Hence, there is an increasing need for research to achieve high heat removal rates and optimal design. Several cooling techniques are used for cooling {{of electronic}}s based on the application and cooling rate requirements. Air-cooling of electronics has a wide range of applications due to its greater reliability, simplicity, easy maintenance, low cost, easy availability of coolant (air), and light weight. Air-cooling is also free from boiling and dripping problems. Air-cooling is used in applications such as avionics, cooling of personal computers, cooling of data centers, and in automobile electronics. In a typical electronic cooling application, cooling fluid is driven by the combination of external pressure forces and buoyancy forces. Based on the relative contribution of these forces towards the total driving force, the cooling techniques can be categorized as forced, natural or mixed convection cooling. However, in many of the electronic cooling situations, such as in the applications with very high heat fluxes, tall Printed Circuits Boards (PCBs) with low forced convection velocity, and in large scale applications such as data centers, the contributions of the buoyancy forces and external pressure forces for the total driving force are comparable, which results in a mixed convection situation. In the present study, mixed convection in vertical channels heated with five heating configurations, which represent typical electronic cooling applications, is studied numerically. The five different heating configurations are channels with flush-mounted continuous heater, flush-mounted strip heaters, flush-mounted square block heaters, protruding rib heaters and protruding square heaters. The first three configurations are categorised as flush-mounted heating configurations and the latter two configurations are categorised as protruded heating configurations. One of the channel walls represents the substrate on which the heaters are mounted and the heat sources represent the heat generating electronic components. Heat transfer under steady state conditions is considered in the study. The study includes laminar as well as turbulent heat transfer. For a systematic study of mixed convection, an analytical or semi-analytical formulation is desirable for a simplified model, as it can highlight the effect of relevant non-dimensional parameters on the heat transfer characteristics of a system. The results of a simplified model can be used for benchmarking the results of practical situations. Hence, before numerically solving the governing equations for mixed convection in channels, mixed convection boundary layer flows over a heated vertical plate is considered for study. Perturbation technique is used to solve the boundary layer equations with non-isothermal boundary conditions. The perturbation analysis is carried out for an arbitrarily variation of wall temperature or heat flux. Subsequently, the results are extended to find heat transfer rates in the cases of power-law variation of temperature and heat flux, as special cases. It is always required to design a cooling system to remove maximum possible amount of heat, keeping the device temperature within its safe operating limits. Hence, optimization of heat transfer in boundary layers is attempted, whose results can be used as guidelines to achieve optimal heat transfer in practical situations of channels with continuous as well as discrete heating. Similarity analysis is used for the optimization of heat distribution in boundary layer flows. In the similarity analysis, in the search of optimal heat transfer from the plate, the boundary layer equations are solved for various power-law heat flux variations and the appropriate power-law variation of optimal heat transfer is found. Similarly, the heat flux variation for optimal heat transfer is found for the cases of natural and forced convection, as they are the limiting cases of mixed convection. In the numerical part of the study, the generalised three-dimensional governing equations for the five heating configurations considered for the study are solved numerically with appropriate boundary conditions. Separation of natural, forced and mixed convection regimes is carried out in all the heating configurations using a criterion based on individual contributions of pressure force and buoyancy force towards the total driving force for the fluid movement. Heat transfer characteristics are studied in laminar as well as turbulent regimes in terms of parameters such as Grashof number, Reynolds number, Nusselt number, maximum temperature of heaters, pressure drop across the channel, and so on. The influence of conjugate effects on the heat transfer characteristics is studied by varying the substrate thermal conductivity. A systematic comparison of various effects such as the effect of discrete heating in plain channels, effect of discrete heating in channels with heated ribs, and the effect of three-dimensional protrusions on heat transfer, is achieved. The parameters in the individual configurations, which affect heat transfer, are explored for better cooling solutions. Optimal heat distribution among the heaters to minimise the temperature of the hottest heater for a given total amount of heat generation in the channel is found for all the channel configurations, which are heated either continuously or discretely. In the process of finding the optimal heat distribution among heaters, guidelines are taken from the optimal heat distribution in boundary layer flows. Compared to usual optimization approaches such as genetic algorithm, the present physics based optimisation procedure requires fewer runs to arrive at the optimal distribution. The fluid flow characteristics in all the three configurations with flush-mounted heaters are found to be similar. However, heat transfer characteristics in channels with flush-mounted square heaters differ from those in the other two flush-mounted channel configurations. Hot spots with higher temperatures are found at heater locations in channels with flush-mounted square heaters. The effect of substrate follows the same trend in all the flush-mounted configurations. At lower thermal conductivities, the maximum temperature decreases sharply with increasing thermal conductivity. However, at higher conductivities, the influence reduces. In all the flush-mounted configurations, heat transfer will not be influenced by substrate thermal conductivity increment at conductivities more than 150 times the fluid thermal conductivity. The fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics in channels with protruded heaters differ significantly from those in channels with flush-mounted heaters. The protrusions in the channels interact with the fluid flow and make it different from that of smooth channels. In turn, the protrusions affect heat transfer characteristics in the channels. The influence of the protrusions on the heat transfer and locations of hot spots in the domain is examined. Effect of thermal conductivity in channels with protruded square heaters is similar to that in channels with flush-mounted heaters. However, conductivity in channels with protruded rib heaters affects the heat transfer in a wider range of conductivities than in the other heating configurations. Unlike in the other configurations, at low thermal conductivities, maximum temperature does not drop sharply with increase of conductivity. In channels with protruded square heaters, staggering arrangement of heaters results in higher heat transfer rates than those with in-line heater arrangement. In all the configurations, pressure drop is found to be independent of Grashof number in the range of heat dissipation rates considered in the study. Heat transfer rates in turbulent region are much higher than the heat transfer rates in laminar regime. However, the pressure drops encountered are also high in the turbulent regime. Turbulent heat transfer results in a more uniform temperature distribution in channels. The cooling performances of the individual configurations are compared. For a given pressure drop the cooling performances decreases in the order of flush-mounted strip heating, protruded square heating, flush-mounted square heating, protruded rib heating. For a given inlet fluid flow rate, the cooling performances decreases in the order of protruded rib heating, protruded square heating, flush-mounted square heating, flush-mounted strip heating. However, for a given inlet fluid flow rate, the pressure drop increases in the order of increasing cooling performance...|$|E
