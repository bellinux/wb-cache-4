5000|$|While {{using the}} timer IC in {{monostable}} mode, the main disadvantage {{is that the}} time span between any two triggering pulses must be greater than the RC time constant.

40|$|DE 102007013102 A 1 UPAB: 20081008 NOVELTY - The device has {{a switch}} part, and a cover closing the switch part. The switch part {{includes}} an ohmic <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> (5) for bridging and separating a high frequency signal line and an electrostatic drive (6) including fixed and movable electrodes for {{operation of the}} <b>switching</b> <b>contact.</b> A device for mechanical force intensification is connected between the electrostatic drive and the <b>switching</b> <b>contact.</b> The force intensification device has a lever arrangement (1) with a predetermined transmission ratio. USE - Micromechanical switch device for switching an interrupted high frequency signal line, which is provided on a substrate. ADVANTAGE - The mechanical force intensification device is connected between the electrostatic drive and <b>switching</b> <b>contact,</b> thus providing high contact force {{in relation to the}} chip surface when the <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> is closed. The reliability of switching can be increased and/or the electrode surface, which is necessary for the production of the contacting force, is reduced...|$|R
50|$|Extremely large {{switches}} {{in excess}} of 100,000‑watt capacity often have <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> surrounded by something other than air to more rapidly extinguish the arc.

50|$|Since {{mercury is}} a {{poisonous}} heavy metal, devices containing mercury switches {{must be treated}} as hazardous waste for disposal. Because it is now RoHS restricted, most modern applications have eliminated it. A metal ball and contact wires can directly replace it, but may require additional circuitry to eliminate switch bounce. Low-precision thermostats use a bimetal strip and a <b>switch</b> <b>contact.</b> Precision thermostats use a thermistor or silicon temperature sensor. Low-cost accelerometers replace the mercury tilt switch in precision applications.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "tikker", {{invented in}} 1908 by Valdemar Poulsen, {{was the first}} {{primitive}} device that did this. It consisted of a vibrating <b>switch</b> <b>contact</b> between the receivers detector and earphone, which was repeatedly opened by an electromagnet. It functioned as a crude modulator; it interrupted the signal from the detector at an audio rate, producing a buzz in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. Thus the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code were made audible.|$|E

50|$|When {{the power}} being {{switched}} is sufficiently large, the electron flow across opening <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> {{is sufficient to}} ionize the air molecules across the tiny gap between the <b>contacts</b> as the <b>switch</b> is opened, forming a gas plasma, also known as an electric arc. The plasma is of low resistance {{and is able to}} sustain power flow, even with the separation distance between the <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> steadily increasing. The plasma is also very hot and is capable of eroding the metal surfaces of the <b>switch</b> <b>contacts.</b> Electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts and also significant electromagnetic interference (EMI), requiring the use of arc suppression methods.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of cheap}} {{components}} {{was an important}} contributor to the unit's cost. A common failure mode was with the <b>switch</b> <b>contacts,</b> {{making it impossible to}} switch the calculator off. Due to the use of <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> made of nickel coated with tin, rather than the gold, an oxide layer would be smeared across the insulating barrier after repeatedly using the switch.|$|R
5000|$|Short-period {{bimetallic}} electromechanical timers use {{a thermal}} mechanism, {{with a metal}} finger made of strips of two metals with different rates of thermal expansion sandwiched together; steel and bronze are common. An electric current flowing through this finger causes heating of the metals, one side expands less than the other, and an electrical contact {{on the end of}} the finger moves away from or towards an electrical <b>switch</b> <b>contact.</b> The most common use of this type is in the [...] "flasher" [...] units that flash turn signals in automobiles, and sometimes in Christmas lights. This is a non-electronic type of multivibrator.|$|E
50|$|Solenoid {{voltmeters}} draw appreciable current when operating. This {{makes them}} useful for testing residual-current devices (GFCIs) because the current drawn will trip most RCDs when the solenoid voltmeter is connected between the live and earth conductors. Also, when testing power supply circuits, a high-impedance connection (that is, a nearly open-circuit fault {{such as a}} burned <b>switch</b> <b>contact</b> or wire joint) in the power path might still allow enough voltage/current through to register on a high-impedance digital voltmeter, but it probably will not actuate the solenoid voltmeter. For use with high impedance circuit applications, however, they are not so good, as they draw appreciable current and therefore alter the voltage being measured.|$|E
5000|$|Each HPU on an SRB was {{connected}} to both servoactuators on that SRB. One HPU served as the primary hydraulic source for the servoactuator, and the other HPU served as the secondary hydraulics for the servoactuator. Each servoactuator had a switching valve that allowed the secondary hydraulics to power the actuator if the primary hydraulic pressure dropped below [...] A <b>switch</b> <b>contact</b> on the switching valve closed when the valve was in the secondary position. When the valve was closed, a signal {{was sent to the}} APU controller, that inhibited the 100% APU speed control logic and enabled the 112% APU speed control logic. The 100-percent APU speed enabled one APU/HPU to supply sufficient operating hydraulic pressure to both servoactuators of that SRB.|$|E
5000|$|Within the device, {{the very}} small {{electric}} heating element heats a bimetallic strip. After some time, the bimetallic strip bends to open a set of <b>switch</b> <b>contacts,</b> thus interrupting the electric current to the heating element. At the same time, another (more robust) set of spring-loaded <b>switch</b> <b>contacts,</b> mounted in parallel with the former, also open, cutting off the heavy current to the [...] "burner". Both the small heating element and the [...] "burner" [...] now begin to cool off. At some point the bimetallic strip will be sufficiently straight to trigger both sets of <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> to close, thus causing both the small heating element and the [...] "burner" [...] to recommence the above heating cycle.|$|R

5000|$|The terms {{pole and}} throw {{are also used}} to {{describe}} <b>switch</b> <b>contact</b> variations. The number of [...] "poles" [...] {{is the number of}} electrically separate switches which are controlled by a single physical actuator. For example, a [...] "2-pole" [...] switch has two separate, parallel sets of contacts that open and close in unison via the same mechanism. The number of [...] "throws" [...] is the number of separate wiring path choices other than [...] "open" [...] that the switch can adopt for each pole. A single-throw switch has one pair of contacts that can either be closed or open. A double-throw switch has a contact that can be connected to either of two other contacts, a triple-throw has a contact which can be connected to one of three other contacts, etc.|$|E
50|$|In some three-conductor TRS phone inserts, {{the concept}} is {{extended}} by using specially designed phone jacks that will accept a mono phone plug partly inserted to the first click and will then connect the tip to the signal path without breaking it. Most standard phone connectors {{can also be used}} in this way with varying success, but neither the <b>switch</b> <b>contact</b> nor the tip contact can be relied upon unless the internal contacts have been designed with extra strength for holding the plug tip in place. Even with stronger contacts, an accidental mechanical movement of the inserted plug can interrupt signal within the circuit. For maximum reliability, any usage involving first click or half-click positions will instead rewire the plug to short tip and ring together and then insert this modified plug all the way into the jack.|$|E
5000|$|A {{magnetic}} field (from an electromagnet or a permanent magnet) {{will cause the}} reeds to attract each other, thus completing an electrical circuit. The spring force of the reeds causes them to separate, and open the circuit, when the {{magnetic field}} ceases. Another configuration contains a non-ferromagnetic normally-closed contact that opens when the ferromagnetic normally-open contact closes. A thin layer of non-ferromagnetic material {{is applied to the}} reed <b>switch</b> <b>contact</b> area to serve as an electrical contact switching (wear) surface and, for normally-open contacts, as a magnetic spacer whose thickness is important in controlling the magnetic field level at which the contact opens (the drop-out). Reed switch contacts are typically Rh, Ru, Ir, or W. There are also versions of reed switches with mercury [...] "wetted" [...] contacts. Such switches must be mounted in a particular orientation. Otherwise drops of mercury may bridge the contacts even when not activated.|$|E

50|$|Each SAM {{consists}} of two coils of wire, wound on bobbins, which surround a single central, magnetically conductive pole piece or two separate pole pieces (determined by the designer) and will have one or more <b>switching</b> <b>contacts</b> or reed <b>switches</b> that are switched on or off by {{the movement of the}} armature. The <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> is used to control which rank or ranks of pipes will sound when keys on a keyboard are depressed, although the actual 'rank switching' is often handled by a more complex electromagnetic or electronic relay system.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} {{switching}} circuit for the absorption method is significant. It is switching a high voltage arc, so the <b>switch's</b> <b>contacts</b> {{must have some}} form of arc suppression. Eaton had the telegraph key drive electromagnets that operated a relay. That relay used four sets of <b>switch</b> <b>contacts</b> in series for each of the two paths (one to the antenna and one to the back shunt). Each relay contact was bridged by a resistor. Consequently, the switch was never completely open, but {{there was a lot of}} attenuation.|$|R
5000|$|Phone {{connectors}} {{with three}} conductors are also commonly used as unbalanced audio patch points (or insert points, or simply inserts), with the output on many mixers {{found on the}} tip (left channel) and the input on the ring (right channel). This is often expressed as [...] "tip send, ring return". Other mixers have unbalanced insert points with [...] "ring send, tip return". One advantage of this system is that the <b>switch</b> <b>contact</b> within the panel socket, originally designed for other purposes, {{can be used to}} close the circuit when the patch point is not in use. An advantage of the tip send patch point is that if it is used as an output only, a 2-conductor mono phone plug correctly grounds the input. In the same fashion, use of a [...] "tip return" [...] insert style allows a mono phone plug to bring an unbalanced signal directly into the circuit, though in this case the output must be robust enough to withstand being grounded. Combining send and return functions via single [...] in TRS connectors in this way is seen in very many professional and semi-professional audio mixing desks, due to the halving of space needed for insert jack fields which would otherwise need two jacks, one for send and one for return. The tradeoff is that unbalanced signals are more prone to buzz, hum and outside interference.|$|E

A microstructural analysis shows that the hardness increases with boron concentration due to a solid solution hardening mechanism, whereas in case of nitrogen, for concentration above 1 %, the nitrogen precipitates into a nitride phase correlated to a hardness decrease.
