5|$|M-48 {{currently}} {{starts at}} an interchange with I-75 in the Rudyard area. The highway runs west from the interchange into Rudyard where it turns south, running concurrently with county road H-63. M-48 turns eastward <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> along 22Mile Road through fields. At Meridian Road, M-48 turns south along M-129 through {{the community of}} Pickford. <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> M-48/M-129 runs long the Chippewa–Mackinac county line and crosses the Munuscong River. M-48 turns east at 26Mile Road into Chippewa County. The highway zig-zags through rural areas in the southeast of the county. It follows Hanna and 28Mile roads to Stalwart. In that community, M-48 runs south on Reynolds Road to a corner on the Chippewa–Mackinac county line where the highway turns back east toward the Goetzville area running through the Lake Superior State Forest. After one last north–south segment, M-48 terminates at a junction with M-134 west of DeTour Village near Albany Harbor.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the I-196/US31 freeway around the South Haven area impacted the northern terminus of M-140 in the 1960s. When it opened in 1963, BL I-196 was shown on maps as continuing north along M-140 into town to a junction with M-43. In 1972, the business loop was rerouted, and M-140 was truncated to end at the freeway interchange <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|WisDOT built a bypass of {{the city}} of Rhinelander during the early 1990s; the new highway was {{constructed}} <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> as a new two-lane highway that opened to traffic by 1993.

5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg {{from the west}} {{on the morning of}} July 1, Buford laid out his {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.|$|E
5|$|Business U.S. Highway 8 (Bus. US8) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was {{a locally}} {{maintained}} business loop highway routing through the {{central business district}} of the city. The route was designated when US8 was shifted to a bypass of downtown in the 1990s. The former routing of US8 through the area {{was turned over to}} the city and county for maintenance. The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of the main highway <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> The signs along the road were scheduled to be removed on July 1, 2005, when the business loop was to be redesignated CTH-P.|$|E
5|$|M-103 is the {{continuation}} of SR15 in Michigan. It starts at State Line Road which runs along the state line east from M-103. From here north to the terminus in Mottville, M-103 parallels the St. Joseph River running through farmlands. <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> it runs past the Mottville Township Cemetery. Between John and Water streets, M-103 intersects and ends at US12. The highway has not been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the country's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E

West of the Luce County Airport, M-117/Bus. M-28 met M-28; at this intersection, M-117 turned west along M-28 and the business loop ended.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E

5|$|General Buford {{recognized}} the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army {{would have a hard time}} dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Early that morning, Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.|$|E
5|$|I-69 in Michigan {{begins at}} the Indiana state line {{southeast}} of Kinderhook and just north of an interchange with the Indiana Toll Road, which carries I-80 and I-90. From there, I-69 runs northward through a mixture of Southern Michigan farmland and woodland in Branch County. A few {{miles north of the}} state line, the freeway passes Coldwater Lake State Park and its namesake body of water; north of the lake, there is a welcome center for the northbound lanes. I-69 curves around the east side of Coldwater, connecting to the city's business loop on the <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> Immediately east of downtown, the freeway intersects the northern end of the business loop at an interchange that also features US12 (Chicago Road). Farther north, the freeway turns to the northwest, crosses into Calhoun County and then over the St. Joseph River. I-69 turns back northward and bypasses Tekonsha to the town's west, intersecting M-60 in the process.|$|E
5|$|M-142 begins just a {{few miles}} south of Bay Port at an {{intersection}} with M-25 near the Bay Port Cemetery, about two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) inland from Saginaw Bay. From there, the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road. The highway follows a direct course over the Pigeon River to the village of Pigeon, when M-142 turns south on Main Street to exit town. <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> the Pigeon Road name resumes, and after about , M-142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery. The road then continues eastward through more farms to Elkton, diverting off a direct course to cross a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway {{on the east side of}} town.|$|E

5|$|M-79 starts {{south of}} Hastings at a {{three-way}} intersection with M-37 in Hastings Township. The trunkline runs east and parallel to {{a section of}} the Thornapple River through wooded terrain that is interspersed with farm fields. South of Thornapple Lake, M-79 angles southeasterly moving from Quimby Road to Scott Road running parallel to the Thornapple River again into the community of Nashville. M-79 meets M-66 and turns south along the latter highway's route along Main and Durkee streets through the community. <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> in Maple Grove Township, M-79 separates from M-66 and turns east along Lawrence Road. Outside of Charlotte, M-79 curves southeast to transition to Lawrence Avenue through town. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with Cochran Avenue, which carries BLI-69 and M-50.|$|E
5|$|Morgan's Raid, the Confederate army's major {{incursion}} into Indiana, occurred a {{month after}} Hines' raid. On July 8, 1863, General Morgan crossed the Ohio River, landing at Mauckport, Indiana, with 2,400 troopers. Their arrival was initially contested by a small party from the Indiana Legion, who withdrew after Morgan's men began firing artillery from the river's southern shore. The state militia quickly retreated towards Corydon, Indiana, where a larger body was gathering to block Morgan's advance. The Confederates advanced rapidly on the town and engaged in the Battle of Corydon. After a brief but fierce fight, Morgan took command of high ground <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> and Corydon's local militia and citizens promptly surrendered after Morgan's artillery fired two warning shots. Corydon was sacked, but little damage was done to its buildings. Morgan continued his raid north and burned most {{of the town of}} Salem.|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

5|$|The {{business}} loop {{follows the}} former routing of US12. This routing was first designated as M-14 in 1956 when US12 {{was moved to}} a freeway bypass to the <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> I-94 was first designated {{by the middle of}} 1960 along the US12 freeway, and a new BL I-94 designation was created {{by the middle of the}} next year. BL I-94 followed M-14 from the Jackson Road interchange to Main Street along Jackson Road and Huron Street. At Main Street, BL I-94 turned along US23 on Huron Street, Washtenaw Avenue and Carpenter Road back to I-94/US12. The US23 freeway was finished on November 2, 1962. BL I-94 was rerouted on the east end to follow the new US23 freeway, returning the Carpenter Road alignment to local control. Bus. US23 replaced US23 along Huron Street and Washtenaw Avenue in the city of Ann Arbor at this time. A new M-14 freeway opened on November 16, 1965, removing the M-14 concurrency from the routing.|$|E
5|$|When Pettigrew's troops {{approached}} Gettysburg on June 30, {{they noticed}} Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford arriving <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth {{what he had}} seen, neither general believed {{that there was a}} substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|M-55/M-76 ran west into Roscommon County along West Branch Road. The two {{highways}} separated at a junction with St. Helen Road where M-76 turned due {{north toward}} St. Helen. <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> the highway met county road F-97 at a junction with Artesia Beach Road. The two roads ran concurrently into town {{along the east}} end of Lake St. Helen. Near the airport in town, M-76 turned back northwesterly along Washington Street, parting from F-97 in the process. The highway ran along the northeastern shore of Lake St. Helen and near Mud Lake as it continued toward Roscommon. As it entered that town, the trunkline passed the Roscommon Conservation Airport and followed Elm Street on a northwest track through the middle of the village. M-18 joined M-76 in the center of town, and the two turned parallel to the Roscommon–Crawford county line on Federal Highway. Northeast of Higgins Lake, the highway transitioned to a freeway; that freeway ran northwest into Crawford County. M-18/M-76 terminated at a junction south of Grayling with US27. This partial interchange marked the point where I-75 resumed its course north through the state. Traffic could not directly access southbound US27 from northbound M-76 and northbound US27 could not access southbound M-76.|$|E
