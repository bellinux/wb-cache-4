5|$|The {{species is}} partly self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} {{been shown to}} have one of the lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of <b>self-fertilisation,</b> and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. <b>Self-fertilisation</b> is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When <b>self-fertilisation</b> does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E
25|$|Cross-pollination, {{also called}} allogamy, occurs when pollen is {{delivered}} from the stamen of one flower to {{the stigma of}} a flower on another plant of the same species. Plants adapted for cross-pollination have several mechanisms to prevent self-pollination; the reproductive organs may be arranged {{in such a way}} that <b>self-fertilisation</b> is unlikely, or the stamens and carpels may mature at different times.|$|E
25|$|Within the Notostraca, {{and even}} within species, there is {{variation}} {{in the mode of}} reproduction, with some populations reproducing sexually, some showing <b>self-fertilisation</b> of females, and some showing a mix of the two. The frequency of males in populations is therefore highly variable. In sexual populations, the sperm leave the male's body through simple pores, there being no penis. The eggs are released by the female and then held in the cup-like brood pouch. The eggs are retained by the female only for a short time before being laid, and the larvae develop directly, without passing through a metamorphosis.|$|E
500|$|While the {{bee orchid}} showed {{adaptation}} for <b>self-fertilisation,</b> its mechanism also enabled occasional cross-fertilisation, creating the biological diversity that Darwin felt {{was needed for}} vigorous survival, {{which could not be}} provided by <b>self-fertilisation.</b> As an example of [...] "how beautifully everything is contrived", Darwin described how he had found that in Spiranthes flowers the pollen is ready for collection before access is open for the female organ to receive pollen. At Torquay he had watched bees visiting spires of these flowers, starting {{at the bottom of the}} spire and working their way up to the topmost flowers. He speculated that if bees moved from top to top of the spires, the pollen clusters they collected from the most recently opened flowers would be wasted as the topmost flowers on the next spike would not be ready to receive pollen. A bee starting at the lowest flowers on the first spire it visited would continue up until it reached flowers that still had their pollen masses to attach to the bee, then would fly to the mature lower flowers on another plant, and fertilise them. By this co-ordinated process, the bee would add [...] "to her store of honey" [...] while perpetuating the flowers [...] "which will yield honey to future generations of bees".|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the Banksia flower, with the style end functioning as a pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous <b>self-fertilisation</b> must be common. In many Banksia species, the risk of this occurring is reduced by protandry: a delay in a flower's receptivity to pollen until after its own pollen has lost its viability. There is dispute, however, over whether this occurs in B.prionotes: one study claimed to have confirmed [...] "protandrous development", yet recorded high levels of stigmatic receptivity immediately after anthesis, and long pollen viability, observations that are not consistent with protandry.|$|E
500|$|If it does occur, {{protandry}} {{does nothing}} to prevent geitonogamous self-pollination: that is, pollination with pollen from another flower on the same plant. In fact, when birds forage at B.prionotes, only {{about a quarter of}} all movements from inflorescence to inflorescence involve a change of plant. Geitonogamous self-pollination must therefore occur more often in this species than cross-pollination. This does not imply high rates of <b>self-fertilisation,</b> however, as the species appears highly self-incompatible: although pollen grains will germinate on flowers of the self plant, they apparently fail to produce pollen tubes that penetrate the style. Even where cross-pollination does occur, fertilisation rate is fairly low. It is speculated that this is related to [...] "a variety of chemical reactions at the pollen-stigma interface".|$|E
500|$|A chance {{observation}} [...] "thoroughly aroused" [...] Darwin's {{attention to}} a surprising decrease in vigour of the offspring of Linaria vulgaris following only one instance of <b>self-fertilisation,</b> and after eleven years of experimental work he published The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom in 1876 as [...] "a complement to the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' because it shows how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are ensured by the mechanisms described in that book." [...] He told a friend [...] "I cannot endure doing nothing", and resumed his work on orchids, assisted in his research by his son Francis Darwin. He corresponded about orchids with Fritz Müller, and almost completely rewrote the book with {{a considerable amount of}} new material, much of which was contributed by Müller. The revised edition was published in 1877.|$|E
500|$|Drosera regia {{flowers in}} January and February, {{producing}} scapes up to [...] long. The scapes emerge vertically, lacking the circinate vernation of its leaves {{and all other}} scapes of the genus Drosera, {{with the exception of}} D.arcturi. The scapes consist of two primary branches and bear 5 to 20 (sometimes 30) unscented pink flowers with [...] long petals. Bracts are small, bearing some reduced tentacles. Each flower has three unbranched, spreading styles emerging {{from the top of the}} ovary and extending beyond the five erect stamens (15mm long), which surround the ovary. This arrangement minimizes the chance of <b>self-fertilisation.</b> Studies have shown that the operculate pollen shed in tetrads (fused groups of four pollen grains), characteristics that are similar in the related Dionaeamuscipula (the Venus flytrap) and Aldrovandavesiculosa, is incompatible with clones, failing to produce seed when plants are self-fertilised. Seeds are brown to black, linear and ornamented with fine network-like markings, and 2mm long and 0.5mm in diameter. Seed is shed by the end of March.|$|E
500|$|Pollinated {{primarily}} by honeyeaters, the inflorescences appear from September to December. Prominent flowers, a red or pink colour, a straight style and a tubular perianth are features thought to promote pollination by birds. The structure of B.cuneatas flower, with the style end {{functioning as a}} pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous <b>self-fertilisation</b> must be common. This is countered, however, by protandry: pollen is released well before the pistil becomes receptive; usually {{by the time the}} pistil becomes receptive most of the pollen has either been transferred, or has lost its viability. This strategy is effective against individual flowers fertilising themselves, but does nothing to prevent geitonogamy: fertilisation of flowers by different flowers on the same plant. Because of the way flowers are clustered together in heads, this must be quite common, although whether it results in successful fruit set is another matter: isozyme studies have observed [...] "intense selection against homozygotes", a fairly common outbreeding strategy in plants that set lots of seed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1841 Charles and Emma Darwin moved from the turmoil of London to the countryside, to Down House, a quiet former parsonage {{in the village of}} Downe. He wrote, [...] "The flowers are here very beautiful". Darwin {{followed}} the recommendation of his friend, the leading botanist Robert Brown, and read Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen (The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered). The little known book, published in 1793 by Christian Konrad Sprengel but never translated into English, introduced the idea that flowers were created by God to fulfill a teleological purpose: insects would act as [...] "living brushes" [...] to cross-fertilise plants in a symbiotic relationship. This functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten, as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty, and were generally self-fertilising. For Darwin, the concept of evolution gave new meaning to Sprengel's research into the mechanisms for cross-fertilisation. He welcomed its support for his supposition that cross-fertilisation in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from <b>self-fertilisation,</b> and by 1845 he had verified many of Sprengel's observations.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately {{one half}} of {{angiosperm}} species are SI, the remainder being self-compatible (SC). [...] Mutations that break down SI (resulting in SC) may become common or entirely dominate in natural populations. Pollinator decline, variability in pollinator service, the so-called [...] "automatic advantage" [...] of <b>self-fertilisation,</b> among other factors, may favor the loss of SI. Similarly, human-mediated artificial selection through selective breeding {{may be responsible for}} the commonly observed SC in cultivated plants. SC enables more efficient breeding techniques to be employed for crop improvement.|$|E

60|$|It {{should be}} remembered that {{in two of the}} cases in which highly {{self-fertile}} varieties appeared amongst my experimental plants, namely, with Mimulus and Nicotiana, such varieties were greatly benefited by a cross with a fresh stock or with a slightly different variety; and this likewise {{was the case with the}} cultivated varieties of Pisum sativum and Lathyrus odoratus, which have been long propagated by <b>self-fertilisation.</b> Therefore until the contrary is distinctly proved, I must believe that as a general rule small and inconspicuous flowers are occasionally intercrossed by insects; and that after long-continued <b>self-fertilisation,</b> if they are crossed with pollen brought from a plant growing under somewhat different conditions, or descended from one thus growing, their offspring would profit greatly. It cannot be admitted, under our present state of knowledge, that <b>self-fertilisation</b> continued during many successive generations is ever the most beneficial method of reproduction.|$|E
6000|$|From {{the various}} facts now given, {{it is evident}} that most flowers are adapted in an admirable manner for cross-fertilisation. Nevertheless, the greater number {{likewise}} present structures which are manifestly adapted, though not in so striking a manner, for <b>self-fertilisation.</b> The chief of these is their hermaphrodite condition; that is, their including within the same corolla both the male and female reproductive organs. These often stand close together and are mature at the same time; so that pollen from the same flower cannot fail to be deposited at the proper period on the stigma. There are also various details of structure adapted for <b>self-fertilisation.</b> (10/19. Hermann Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 448.) Such structures are best shown in those curious cases discovered by Hermann Muller, in which a species exists under two forms,--one bearing conspicuous flowers fitted for cross-fertilisation, and the other smaller flowers fitted for <b>self-fertilisation,</b> with many parts in the latter slightly modified for this special purpose. (10/20. 'Nature' 1873 pages 44, 433.) ...|$|E
60|$|The very bare summary {{that has}} now been given of the main facts {{relating}} to the fertilisation of flowers, will have served to show the vast extent {{and complexity of the}} inquiry, and the extraordinary contradictions and difficulties which it presents. We have direct proof of the beneficial results of intercrossing in a great number of cases; we have an overwhelming mass of facts as to the varied and complex structure of flowers evidently adapted to secure this intercrossing by insect agency; yet we see many of the most vigorous plants which spread widely over the globe, with none of these adaptations, and evidently depending on <b>self-fertilisation</b> for their continued existence and success in the battle of life. Yet more extraordinary is it to find numerous cases in which the special arrangements for cross-fertilisation appear to have been a failure, since they have either been supplemented by special means for <b>self-fertilisation,</b> or have reverted back in various degrees to simpler forms in which <b>self-fertilisation</b> becomes the rule. There is also a further difficulty in the highly complex modes by which cross-fertilisation is often brought about; for we have seen that there are several very effective yet very simple modes of securing intercrossing, involving a minimum of change in the form and structure of the flower; and when we consider that the result attained with so much cost of structural modification is by no means an unmixed good, and is far less certain in securing the perpetuation of the species than is <b>self-fertilisation,</b> it is most puzzling to find such complex methods resorted to, sometimes to the extent of special precautions against the possibility of <b>self-fertilisation</b> ever taking place. Let us now see whether any light can be thrown on these various anomalies and contradictions.|$|E
60|$|If {{it became}} from any cause {{advantageous}} to a species {{to have its}} capacity for <b>self-fertilisation</b> increased, there is little difficulty in believing that this could readily be effected; for three cases of plants varying {{in such a manner}} as to be more fertile with their own pollen than they originally were, occurred {{in the course of my}} few experiments, namely, with Mimulus, Ipomoea, and Nicotiana. Nor is there any reason to doubt that many kinds of plants are capable under favourable circumstances of propagating themselves for very many generations by <b>self-fertilisation.</b> This is the case with the varieties of Pisum sativum and of Lathyrus odoratus which are cultivated in England, and with Ophrys apifera and some other plants in a state of nature. Nevertheless, most or all of these plants retain structures in an efficient state which cannot be of the least use excepting for cross-fertilisation. We have also seen reason to suspect that <b>self-fertilisation</b> is in some peculiar manner beneficial to certain plants; but if this be really the case, the benefit thus derived is far more than counter-balanced by a cross with a fresh stock or with a slightly different variety.|$|E
60|$|It {{has already}} been shown {{that there is no}} close {{relation}} between the number of seeds produced by flowers when crossed and self-fertilised, {{and the degree to which}} their offspring are aaffected by the two processes. I have also given reasons for believing that the inefficiency of a plant's own pollen is in most cases an incidental result, or has not been specially acquired for the sake of preventing <b>self-fertilisation.</b> On the other hand, there can hardly be a doubt that dichogamy, which prevails according to Hildebrand in the greater number of species (10/23. 'Die Geschlecter Vertheiling' etc. page 32.),--that the heterostyled condition of certain plants,--and that many mechanical structures--have all been acquired so as both to check <b>self-fertilisation</b> and to favour cross-fertilisation. The means for favouring cross-fertilisation must have been acquired before those which prevent self-fertilisation; as it would manifestly be injurious to a plant that its stigma should fail to receive its own pollen, unless it had already become well adapted for receiving pollen from another individual. It should be observed that many plants still possess a high power of <b>self-fertilisation,</b> although their flowers are excellently constructed for cross-fertilisation--for instance, those of many papilionaceous species.|$|E

60|$|That certain plants, for instance, Viola tricolor, Digitalis purpurea, Sarothamnus scoparius, Cyclamen persicum, etc., {{which have}} been {{naturally}} cross-fertilised for many or all previous generations, should suffer to an extreme degree from a single act of <b>self-fertilisation</b> is a most surprising fact. Nothing of the kkind has been observed in our domestic animals; but then {{we must remember that}} the closest possible interbreeding with such animals, that is, between brothers and sisters, cannot be considered as nearly so close a union as that between the pollen and ovules of the same flower. Whether the evil from <b>self-fertilisation</b> goes on increasing during successive generations is not as yet known; but we may infer from my experiments that the increase if any is far from rapid. After plants have been propagated by <b>self-fertilisation</b> for several generations, a single cross with a fresh stock restores their pristine vigour; and we have a strictly analogous result with our domestic animals. (12/2. Ibid chapter 19 2nd edition volume 2 page 159.) The good effects of cross-fertilisation are transmitted by plants to the next generation; and judging from the varieties of the common pea, to many succeeding generations. But this may merely be that crossed plants of the first generation are extremely vigorous, and transmit their vigour, like any other character, to their successors.|$|E
60|$|The common {{carnation}} {{is strongly}} proterandrous, and therefore depends {{to a large}} extent upon insects for fertilisation. I have seen only humble-bees visiting the flowers, but I dare say other insects likewise do so. It is notorious that if pure seed is desired, the greatest care is necessary to prevent the varieties which grow in the same garden from intercrossing. (4/10. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1847 page 268.) The pollen is generally shed and lost before the two stigmas in the same flower diverge and are ready to be fertilised. I was therefore often forced to use for <b>self-fertilisation</b> pollen from the same plant instead of from the same flower. But on two occasions, when I attended to this point, I was not able to detect any marked difference in the number of seeds produced by these two forms of <b>self-fertilisation.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{means for}} favouring {{cross-fertilisation}} and preventing <b>self-fertilisation,</b> or conversely for favouring <b>self-fertilisation</b> and preventing {{to a certain}} extent cross-fertilisation, are wonderfully diversified; and it is remarkable that these differ widely in closely allied plants,--in the species of the same genus, and sometimes in the individuals of the same species. (12/5. Hildebrand has insisted strongly to this effect in his valuable observations on the fertilisation of the Gramineae: 'Monatsbericht K. Akad. Berlin' October 1872 page 763.) It is not rare to find hermaphrodite plants and others with separated sexes within the same genus; and it is common to find some of the species dichogamous and others maturing their sexual elements simultaneously. The dichogamous genus Saxifraga contains proterandrous and proterogynous species. (12/6. Dr. Engler 'Botanische Zeitung' 1868 page 833.) Several genera include both heterostyled (dimorphic or trimorphic forms) and homostyled species. Ophrys offers a remarkable instance of one species having its structure manifestly adapted for <b>self-fertilisation,</b> and other species as manifestly adapted for cross-fertilisation. Some con-generic species are quite sterile and others quite fertile with their own pollen. From these several causes we often find within the same genus species which do not produce seeds, while others produce an abundance, when insects are excluded. Some species bear cleistogene flowers which cannot be crossed, as well as perfect flowers, whilst others in the same genus never produce cleistogene flowers. Some species exist under two forms, the one bearing conspicuous flowers adapted for cross-fertilisation, the other bearing inconspicuous flowers adapted for <b>self-fertilisation,</b> whilst other species in the same genus present only a single form. Even with the individuals of the same species, the degree of self-sterility varies greatly, as in Reseda. With polygamous plants, the distribution of the sexes differs in the individuals of the same species. The relative period at which the sexual elements in the same flower are mature, differs in the varieties of Pelargonium; and Carriere gives several cases, showing that the period varies according to the temperature to which the plants are exposed. (12/7. 'Des Varieties' 1865 page 30.) ...|$|E

60|$|The chief {{types of}} {{flowering}} plants have existed during {{the millions of}} ages of the whole tertiary period, and during this enormous lapse of time many of them may have been modified {{in the direction of}} insect fertilisation, and again into that of <b>self-fertilisation,</b> not once or twice only, but perhaps scores or even hundreds of times; and at each such modification a difference in the environment may have led to a distinct line of development. At one epoch the highest specialisation of structure in adaptation to a single species or group of insects may have saved a plant from extinction; while, at other times, the simplest mode of <b>self-fertilisation,</b> combined with greater powers of dispersal and a constitution capable of supporting diverse physical conditions, may have led to a similar result. With some groups the tendency seems to have been almost continuously to greater and greater specialisation, while with others a tendency to simplification and degradation has resulted in such plants as the grasses and sedges.|$|E
