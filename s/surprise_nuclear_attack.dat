5000|$|The {{directives}} of Project RYAN underscore {{how deeply}} rooted {{the idea of}} a western first strike was in the minds of high-ranking Soviet officials. They truly believed that nuclear war was imminent, and the fear of a <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack</b> was rapidly growing. [...] The intent of Project RYAN was not so the Soviets could strike second, it was to ensure the Soviets had the necessary information in order to strike first.|$|E
50|$|After a 40-year {{armistice}} in a {{war between}} the Twelve Colonies (the homeworlds populated by humans) and the Cylons (human-created robots), the Cylons launch a <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack</b> intended to exterminate the human race. Virtually all {{of the population of}} the Twelve Colonies are wiped out. Most of the Colonial military is either rendered ineffective or destroyed due to malware in the military computer network that renders it vulnerable to cyber attack. The malware was introduced by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), a Cylon in the form of a human woman, who seduced the famous scientist Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) and exploited their relationship to gain access codes under the cover of an insider contract bid.|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India {{praised the}} Soviet Union for [...] "a great victory of man over {{the forces of}} nature" [...] and urged that it be [...] "considered as a victory for peace." [...] The Economist voiced worries that orbital {{platforms}} might be used for <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attacks.</b> The Svenska Dagbladet in Sweden chided [...] "free countries" [...] for [...] "splitting up and frittering away" [...] their resources, while West Germany's Die Welt argued that America had the resources to have sent a man into space first but was beaten by Soviet purposefulness. Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun urged [...] "that both the United States and the Soviet Union should use their new knowledge and techniques {{for the good of}} mankind," [...] and Egypt's Akhbar El Yom likewise expressed hopes that the cold war would [...] "turn into a peaceful race in infinite space" [...] and turn away from armed conflicts such as the Laotian Civil War.|$|R

5000|$|In a later book, titled, The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon, he {{indicated}} that he believed {{it was possible that}} the battle of Armageddon could occur in the not too distant future, stating, [...] "the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it.". He noted again that there is no reference to the U.S. in Bible prophecy. He listed a few scenarios that seemed plausible to him at the time: (1) A takeover by Communists, (2) destruction by a <b>surprise</b> Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack,</b> or (3) becoming a dependent of the 10-nation European community. [...] The book was on the New York Times bestseller list for more than 20 weeks.|$|R
5000|$|Project VRYAN, or RYAN {{as it is}} more {{commonly}} known, is the Russian acronym for <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack.</b> [...] It was the largest Soviet intelligence gathering program ever mounted in peacetime. [...] The objective of RYAN was to monitor the United States and its NATO allies for any indicator whatsoever of an impending nuclear first strike. Project RYAN had the highest priority over any other intelligence gathering initiative in the Soviet Union at the time, including any currently being undertaken by the KGB or the GRU. [...] There were hundreds of indicators which were monitored by Project RYAN, including the United States economy. More specifically, any large scale purchase of gold by the United States which may indicate an impending nuclear apocalypse.|$|E
5000|$|Rupp {{claims that}} his {{activities}} may have averted {{a nuclear war}} {{in the fall of}} 1983, a claim that is not entirely unfounded according to American experts. In an interview for the Channel 4 programme [...] "1983: The Brink of Apocalypse", about exercise Able Archer 83, broadcast in the UK on 5 January 2008, {{he said that he had}} transmitted the message that NATO was not preparing to launch a <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack</b> against the USSR during the exercise to his HVA controllers. He did this by way of encoding the message on a device disguised as a calculator which then turned the message into a short electronic burst which could be transmitted to a set telephone number. He viewed this as vital to preventing a Soviet pre-emptive strike against NATO forces. In the same program, Rupp said he was proud of the damage he did to NATO over the years of his intelligence activities.|$|E
5000|$|Able Archer 83 {{took place}} between November 2-11, 1983. [...] This was a {{strategic}} arms exercise conducted by the United States Government in order to simulate an escalating nuclear conflict. Able Archer 83 occurred just {{two months after the}} shoot down incident of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. The United States was simulating the deployment and use of the Pershing II nuclear missile system that was being developed at the time. The Soviets suspected the United States of performing a <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack</b> with the Pershing II system, {{despite the fact that the}} Pershing II missiles were not delivered to Europe until November 22, eleven days after the conclusion of Able Archer 83. [...] The Soviets believed the United States had determined that a nuclear war was technically winnable. The reason behind this rationale by the Soviet Union was related to the fact that the United States had just recently upgraded its Minuteman III ICBM to the Minuteman IIIA. [...] This ICBM was several times more accurate and had twice the yield of its predecessors, thus making Soviet hardened nuclear silos a viable target. [...] That same year, the United States also introduced the Trident C-4 submarine-launched ballistic missile. [...] All of these factors combined to make the Able Archer 83 test and incredibly stressful and dangerous time.|$|E
5000|$|Schilling made {{a number}} of media appearances, {{including}} on Edward R. Murrow's Hidden Revolution radio series in 1959, where he described the effects of a <b>surprise</b> Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack</b> on the U.S.; on New York local television station news and public affairs programs to discuss international events; and on the CBS Morning News in 1982 to discuss the ongoing Falklands War. [...] He was quoted in newspapers over several decades, often emphasizing the need to appreciate a broad sweep of history to understand current developments. [...] A 1986 front-page story in the Portland Press Herald displayed his quote, [...] "Statesmen very rarely decide to have a war - they usually decide to risk a war," [...] meaning that miscalculations in those risk assessments sometimes result in wars taking place that they never would have chosen.|$|R
25|$|On October 4, 1957, {{from the}} Tyuratam {{range in the}} Kazakh SSR, the Soviet Union {{launched}} Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. The event, while a scientific triumph, also signified that the Soviet Union now had the capability to attack the United States with an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The R-7, the booster rocket that launched Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2, could be loaded instead with a hydrogen bomb, bringing {{the threat of a}} <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> Pearl Harbor-style <b>attack</b> on the United States and Canada. To give an early warning of any Soviet sneak ICBM attack, the governments of the United States, Canada, and Denmark (with the authority over Greenland, where the main radar station built at Thule, Greenland) agreed to build the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). This system would use radar to detect incoming ICBM warheads and give about 20 minutes of warning of an ICBM attack.|$|R

5000|$|Able Archer was a {{standard}} military exercise that was performed annually by the United States. Unfortunately in 1983, the aforementioned factors all {{came into play}} at the wrong time, and Soviet nuclear threat perceptions were at a critical level. [...] While the United States Chiefs of Staff remained largely indifferent to this Soviet perception, the exercise was nothetheless [...] "toned down" [...] in order to assuage fears of impending WWIII. [...] President Reagan and Vice President Bush were removed from participating in the exercise, however it still remained {{one of the most}} realistic exercises to date, with a complete simulation of NATO forces going to DEFCON 1. [...] The Soviet leaderships suspiscion of Able Archer 83 as an attempt at a <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack</b> masquerading as an exercise grew with intelligence collections of United States message traffic which was [...] "unusual" [...] in its message formats and ocmmunications procedures. [...] The unusual message procedures led Soviet leadership to believe that Able Archer may not be an exercise at all. This was coupled with a [...] "too literal" [...] interpretation of the scenario, whereby NATO forces were perceived by the Soviets to be at DEFCON 1. [...] In actuality, the NATO forces were never at DEFCON 1, it was all simulated, however Soviet leadership still mistook the exercise for a real event.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPresent defense posture {{of the naval}} establishment,, particularly the defense posture of ships in port, reveals some inadequacies when evaluated in the environment of an attack without warning. Now that a potential enemy of the United States has intercontinental ballistic missiles and Mach 2 -plus bombers which could reduce the warning to 30 - 90 minutes, some new methods of defense should be instituted in order that naval ships and bases could better withstand a <b>surprise</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack.</b> Various alternatives which could be adopted to improve this defense posture are examined qualitatively. Some of the alternatives are staggered in-port periods, equal distribution of ships in home ports, even distribution of home ports, hardening bases, keeping ships at sea more, and having an all-submersible fleet. It is recommended that at least the measure of staggered in-port periods be adopted, and that serious consideration be given to equal distribution of ships in home ports. For ships at sea, the dispersed disposition remains {{the best choice for}} the immediate future. Dispersal and hardening of bases and facilities (including control centers) should be accomplished as time and funds permit. The ideas expressed in this thesis are intended to lead to future detailed and quantitative study of the alternatives, resulting in concrete recommendations for increasing the chances of survival of U. S. Navy ships and bases. [URL] Commander, United States NavyLieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|As the United States reeled {{from the}} Soviet Union 2 ̆ 7 s launch of Sputnik in late 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{received}} a top secret report prepared {{by a committee}} of leading scientific, business, and military experts. The panel, called the Gaither committee in recognition of its first chairman, H. Rowan Gaither, Jr., emphasized both the inadequacy of U. S. defense measures {{designed to protect the}} civil population and the vulnerability of the country 2 ̆ 7 s strategic nuclear forces {{in the event of a}} Soviet attack. The Gaither committee viewed these defense measures [...] ranging from a missile system to defend the continental United States to the construction of shelters to protect the population from radioactive fallout [...] and the maintenance of sufficient strategic forces to launch military strikes against Soviet targets as essential for the preservation of U. S. security. It concluded that in the case of a <b>surprise</b> Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>attack</b> the United States would be unable to defend itself with any degree of success. The committee emphasized the urgent need for the Eisenhower administration to strengthen the country 2 ̆ 7 s continental and civil defenses and to accelerate the development of its strategic striking power. This study examines the history of Gaither committee: Why was it created? What were the backgrounds of its members? What evidence did it examine in performing its study? Why did it reach the conclusions it did? How influential was it on the Eisenhower administration? This manuscript illuminates the significance of the Gaither committee in shaping changes in Eisenhower 2 ̆ 7 s national security policies and in the development of President Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s. It demonstrates that Eisenhower followed a consistent set of values and used an established decision making system to evaluate the Gaither committee 2 ̆ 7 s findings and to make changes in his national security policies. It reveals that Eisenhower sought the assistance of experts from a variety of professions to supplement the advice he received from his official advisers. Finally, it shows that the Gaither committee reached its conclusions based as much on the preconceptions of its members as on the evidence it examined...|$|R
