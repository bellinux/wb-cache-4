The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, producing a high quality yarn. <b>Self-acting</b> mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1830, Richard Roberts {{patented}} {{the first}} <b>self-acting</b> mule. The Stalybridge mule spinners strike was in 1824, this stimulated {{research into the}} problem of applying power to the winding stroke of the mule. The draw while spinning had been assisted by power, but the push of the wind had been done manually by the spinner, the mule could be operated by semiskilled labour. Before 1830, the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles after, <b>self-acting</b> mules with up to 1,300 spindles could be built.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} {{powered by a}} single engine that moved the whole 3.6 {{kilometre}} (2.2 mile) length of ropeway, but was later modified {{into a series of}} five <b>self-acting</b> inclines.|$|E
25|$|Mule spinners {{were the}} leaders in {{unionism}} within the cotton industry; the pressure to develop the self-actor or <b>self-acting</b> mule was partly to open the trade to women. It was in 1870 that the first national union was formed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-acting</b> {{machine tools}} that {{displaced}} hand dexterity {{so they could}} be operated by boys and unskilled laborers were developed by James Nasmyth in the 1840s. Machine tools were automated with Numerical control (NC) using punched paper tape in the 1950s. This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC).|$|E
25|$|Oldham counts {{refers to}} the medium {{thickness}} cotton that was used for general purpose cloth. Roberts didn't profit from his <b>self-acting</b> spinning mule, but on the expiry of the patent other firms took forward the development, and the mule was adapted for the counts it spun. Initially Robert's self-actor was used for coarse counts (Oldham Counts), but the mule-jenny continued {{to be used for}} the very finest counts (Bolton counts) until the 1890s and beyond.|$|E
25|$|The pit {{known as}} Wellington, renamed William in 1843, was also {{operating}} from 1843; coal was brought down from it to Lady Anne by a separate <b>self-acting</b> inclined plane. In 1847 no. 9 Pit was sunk, near to Lady Anne. Light parallel iron rails {{were used in}} the short branch connection. In 1850 the George Pit was sunk on the north of Cuttlehill; a standard gauge waggonway was built to connect to the nearby Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway.|$|E
25|$|In 1830, {{using an}} 1822 patent, Richard Roberts {{manufactured}} the first loom with a cast-iron frame, the Roberts Loom. In 1842 James Bullough and William Kenworthy, made the Lancashire Loom. It is a semiautomatic power loom. Although it is <b>self-acting,</b> {{it has to}} be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. It was the mainstay of the Lancashire cotton industry for a century, when the Northrop Loom invented in 1894 with an automatic weft replenishment function gained ascendancy.|$|E
25|$|The Brunswick mill {{was built}} around 1840 in one phase. The main seven storey block that faces the Ashton Canal {{was used for}} spinning. The {{preparation}} was done {{on the second floor}} and the <b>self-acting</b> mules with 400 spindles were arranged transversely on the floors above. The wings contained the blowing rooms, some spinning and ancillary processes like winding. The four storey range facing Bradford Road was used for warehousing and offices. The mill was built by David Bellhouse, but it is suspected that William Fairbairn was involved in the design. It is built from brick, and has slate roofs. Fireproof internal construction was now standard. Brunswick was built using cast iron columns and beams, each floor was vaulted with transverse brick arches. There was no wood in the structure. It was powered by a large double beam engine.|$|E
25|$|Six {{locomotives}} {{worked in}} the quarry. Allenby, Beatty, Haig and Trotter were based at the shed {{at the top of}} the main <b>self-acting</b> incline, while Ian Hamilton and Stringer were based in a shed at a higher level. Three steam navvies were used to load stone into the railway wagons, and there were nineteen or twenty steam cranes, all of which were self-propelled and ran on the tracks either in the quarry or on top of the dam. An official visit by officers of the Corporation on 5 June 1925 used motor transport to reach Scar House, but the party then made the zig-zag railway journey to cross the valley and inspect the steam generating plant, which was on the far side. They ascended the incline to Carle Fell Quarry, sitting in wagons fitted with transverse seats, and having inspected the new workings, descended again, a scene which was officially recorded by a photographer.|$|E
25|$|In 1790, William Kelly of Glasgow used a {{new method}} {{to assist the}} draw stroke. First animals, and then water, {{was used as the}} prime mover. Wright of Manchester moved the head stock to the centre of the machine, {{allowing}} twice as many spindles; a squaring band was added to ensure the spindles came out in a straight line. He was in conversation with John Kennedy {{about the possibility of a}} <b>self-acting</b> mule. Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in Ancoats, was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules; their firm prospered and eventually merged into the Fine Spinners & Doublers Association. In 1793, John Kennedy was addressing the problem of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse. He attached gears and a clutch to implement this motion.|$|E
25|$|Completion of the Low Horse Level in the 1840s {{meant that}} new ore {{dressing}} facilities were needed {{at a lower}} level than at the old High Mill. A new Low Mill was built near the smelt mill, with a <b>self-acting</b> incline to lower wagons of ore to the new mill. There it was crushed, washed, and the concentrated ore was delivered to the smelt mill. Leats from Glenridding Beck brought a plentiful supply of water to operate the machinery at the mill. Increased ore production in the 1840s also meant that the smelting capacity had to be increased. One reverberatory furnace {{seems to have been}} installed in 1844, with more in 1851. These could process much larger amounts of lead ore, but were expensive to run, consuming large amounts to coal, and needing frequent replacements of their fireclay brick linings. They were soon abandoned and a number of the simpler ore hearths were installed in 1855. Since these produced greater quantities of lead dust and fumes, the flue was extended {{at the same time to}} the new chimney.|$|E
500|$|Details of the {{inclined}} planes {{have been}} the subject of some speculation, largely because contemporary documents from the time of their construction are unknown. A local writer called Ap Huw stated that [...] "the inclined planes were manipulated by hydraulic pumps which were considered to be great discoveries". He also noted that only two of the inclines were used, but whether this was because Hirwaunissa was unfinished or because there was no traffic on the upper section is not clear. The railway engineer W. Robinson described [...] "balance caissons with hydraulic brakes apparatus to check the barges in their descent and to arrange that the full ones coming down pull the empty ones up". The Colliery Guardian carried an eye-witness report of their operation, in which they were described as <b>self-acting</b> inclines, and it is stated that all three were in operation at the time.|$|E
500|$|The railway had modern {{passenger}} locomotives, {{some with}} four wheels There were passenger stations at Stockton, Middlesbrough, Darlington, Shildon and West Auckland, and trains also stopped at Middlesbrough Junction, Yarm Junction, Fighting Cocks and Heighington. Some of the modified road coaches {{were still in}} use, {{but there were also}} modern railway carriages, some first class with three compartments each seating eight passengers, and second class carriages that seated up to 40. Luggage and sometimes the guard travelled on the carriage roof; a passenger travelling third class suffered serious injuries after falling from the roof in 1840. Passenger trains averaged , and a speed of [...] was recorded. Over 200,000 passengers were carried in the year to 1 October 1838, and in 1839 there were twelve trains each day between Middlesbrough and Stockton, six trains between Stockton and Darlington, and three between Darlington and Shildon, where a carriage was fitted with Rankine's <b>self-acting</b> brake, taken over the Brussleton Inclines, and then drawn by a horse to St Helens Auckland. The Bradshaw's railway guide for March 1843, after South Church opened, shows five services a day between Darlington and South Church via Shildon, with three between Shildon and St Helens. Also listed were six trains between Stockton and Hartlepool via Seaton over the Clarence Railway and the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway that had opened in 1841.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roberts {{took out}} his first patent in 1825 and a second in 1830. The task he had set himself was to design a self-actor, a <b>self-acting</b> or {{automatic}} spinning mule. Roberts is also known for the Roberts Loom, which was widely adopted because of its reliability. The mule in 1820 still needed manual assistance to spin a consistent thread; a <b>self-acting</b> mule would need: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was invented}} between 1775 and 1779 by Samuel Crompton. The <b>self-acting</b> (automatic) mule was {{patented}} by Richard Roberts in 1825. At its peak there were 50,000,000 mule spindles in Lancashire alone. Modern versions {{are still in}} niche production and are used to spin woollen yarns from noble fibres such as cashmere, ultra-fine merino and alpaca for the knitware market.|$|E
2500|$|The {{savings that}} could be made with this {{technology}} were considerable. [...] A worker spinning cotton at a hand-powered spinning wheel in the 18th century would take more than 50,000 hours to spin 100lb of cotton; by the 1790s, the same quantity could be spun in 300 hours by mule, and with a <b>self-acting</b> mule it could be spun by one worker in just 135 hours.|$|E
2500|$|In 1835, Mason {{moved to}} Taunton, Massachusetts, to join Crocker and Richmond, {{manufacturers}} of cotton machinery. He worked {{almost entirely on}} ring frames. The firm failed in 1837 during the financial crisis. The business {{was taken over by}} Messrs Leach and Keith. Mason was employed as foreman. On October 8, 1840, his greatest invention, a [...] "self-acting mule" [...] was patented. Competition required improvements and on October 3, 1846, he received a patent for [...] "Mason's <b>Self-acting</b> Mule." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Stephenson {{planned to}} ascend {{from the valley}} of the Murk Esk at Beckhole to the high moors at Goathland by means of a [...] long rope-worked incline at an average {{gradient}} of 1 in 15. [...] "The method of working was that of a <b>selfâ€‘acting</b> incline common in mines, but here, differing from the case of a mine, the load was equal each way, and so there was attached to each train a waterâ€‘tank this was filled with water {{at the top of the}} incline, and its preponderating weight as it descended pulled the other train up the hill arrived at the bottom, the waterâ€‘tank was emptied and was sent up with the next train".|$|E
2500|$|Breaching of {{the banks}} by floodwater was a continual problem, with six {{breaches}} of the north bank recorded between 1821 and 1882, and eight of the south bank in the same period. Measurement showed that the river level rose by [...] for every [...] of rain falling on the river's catchment area. The arrival of railways in the area resulted in a rapid decline of river traffic. A railway from Boston to Spalding opened in 1848, while the line from Spalding opened to Bourne in 1866 and on to Sleaford in 1872. Although occasional boats were still reaching Bourne in 1857, the <b>self-acting</b> doors at Tongue End were replaced by a sluice in the 1860s, which prevented passage from the Glen to the Bourne Eau, although the right of navigation was not officially revoked until 1962, as part of flood defence measures which included {{the replacement of the}} sluice by a pumping station in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the incline}} {{did not work}} well. [...] In 1884, the company {{chairman}} reported to shareholders that [...] "one of the greatest difficulties that had had to be overcome in working the mine had been the task of finding a competent mechanical engineer to work the incline." [...] A new engineer, Henry Hughes, was engaged {{at the end of}} 1883 and the whole system remodelled. George Binns, an Inspector of Mines, had suggested in 1883 that an ordinary endless rope system would be better than the system then being tried for lowering coal on the incline. Mr Hughes adopted this idea and altered the system into five <b>self-acting</b> inclines, each with an endless rope. In 1884, George Binns reported that the new inclines worked very well, but noted it was necessary to stop each incline every time a tub (truck) passed the incline terminus, causing considerable delays. He expected this would soon be resolved.|$|E
2500|$|Near the Scar House dam site, {{a network}} of sidings were constructed, zig-zagging down to the Nidd, and back up {{the other side of}} the valley. A double track <b>self-acting</b> incline {{provided}} access to the Carle Fell Quarry, to the north of the reservoir, and as the quarry was worked, two further inclines were constructed. One was single track, with a winding engine at the top, and around 1930, an incline worked by locomotives was added. Above the later quarry face, a Simplex petrol locomotive worked on a [...] track, removing overburden. Hydro-electric power for the works was generated using water from Angram reservoir, which was discharged into Haden Carr reservoir. A [...] pipeline supplied the turbines. This was later supplemented by a steam generating station. Two locomotive sheds were built, one near the village and another on the north side of the River Nidd, with a further two at Carle Fell Quarry. All had two tracks. Twelve four-wheeled carriages were bought from the Maryport and Carlisle Railway, to provide transport for the workers and their families from Scar House to Lofthouse, and a two-track carriage shed was built to the east of the main complex.|$|E
2500|$|A pair of [...] long <b>self-acting</b> mules with 1320 {{spindles}} {{each would}} be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, {{and the little}} piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise {{to the status of}} a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1881, Castalia was advertised to be {{sold the}} {{following}} month on the instructions of the mortgagees, Messrs Bailey & Ridley. The sale was advertised as taking place at the Captain's Room of the Royal Exchange, London on 20 October 1881. In May 1883, Castalia was sold to the Metropolitan Asylums Board for Â£5,500 and converted to a hospital ship with provision for 150 patients. She was converted {{at a cost of}} between Â£30,000 and Â£35,000. Castalia joined the board's two other ships, [...] and [...] Her engines and paddle wheels were removed and the void covered over to form a deck, The machinery that was removed was advertised for sale in July 1883. Five ward blocks were built at an oblique angle on her twin hulls. This was to ensure a flow of air through the wards. Male patients were housed on board Atlas and female patients on board Castalia; with Endymion serving as an administration and stores ship. Ventilation was by a number of Boyle's <b>self-acting</b> ventilators, which removed [...] of air per minute from the ship. A pump provided an artificial draught in times of calm. The ventilators could change the air in the wards nine times per hour. Castalia entered service as a hospital ship in June 1884.
