The Petten reactor had a 6-month <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{officials}} on Staten Island such as Diane Savino have been demanding {{the replacement of}} the Staten Island Railway's aging R44 train cars. Initially, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority planned to order R179s for the Staten Island Railway, but later decided to overhaul some R46s to replace the existing R44s there. However, the plan to overhaul the R46s for the Staten Island Railway was also dropped, and 75 future R211S cars are planned to replace the Staten Island Railway's fleet of R44s instead. Until then, the R44s are undergoing another round of <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> to extend their usefulness until at least 2023.|$|E

A graduate of Annapolis and veteran of 30 years, Captain Brown had amassed a distinguished record commanding submarines and destroyers, but had never commanded a ship the size of Missouri, and had not been to sea in a command capacity since World War II. Captain Brown formally assumed command of Missouri on 10 December, {{just ahead of the}} completion of maintenance work on the battleship. On 23 December, Brown took the battleship out for a brief trip around the Virginia capes and returned to Norfolk on Christmas Eve. Her next scheduled departure was 17 January, at which time Missouri was to sail to Guantanamo Bay for maneuvers.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{it appears}} that after 1914 most {{maintenance}} work was undertaken only when conditions presented a safety hazard, mechanical systems were in need of repair, or the building became extremely unsightly. Lack of <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> affects the performance of building materials. Wood, in particular, requires proper maintenance of paint coatings to control the development of rot. In this building, {{it is important to}} maintain the condition of the interior, as well as exterior, coatings because of the humid indoor environment. Also necessary is the maintenance of waterproofing details, such as flashing, to prevent water from accumulating in concealed areas. It is therefore not surprising that rot developed in the building, and significant repairs to the wood elements of the building were necessary over time, given its somewhat irregular maintenance history.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 1982, the MTA {{implemented}} {{the first of}} its five-year Capital Improvement programs to repair the existing system. <b>Scheduled</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Services were formed to replace components before they failed. Subway cars in classes R26 to R46 went through general overhaul programs to fix and rehabilitate rolling stock. Older equipment (any car classes with contract numbers below R32s on the B Division and R26s on the A Division) were retrofitted with air conditioning. The red tag areas were incrementally repaired and welded rail could be seen on many lines {{by the end of the}} 1980s. At the end of the century, the MDBF rates for the entire system were at record highs and steadily increasing. The Franklin Avenue Shuttle, however, was worse in 1989 than it was in 1980, and necessitated a complete renovation by 1998, because the MTA planned to abandon the line by the end of the century.|$|E
25|$|From 1956 {{there was}} a move toward the return of {{regional}} colour schemes. Most regions adopted a maroon livery which strongly resembled that of the former London Midland and Scottish Railway but the Western Region returned some of its coaches that were used on named express trains to a chocolate/cream scheme {{similar to that used}} by the GWR before nationalisation and from July 1956 the Southern Region began using a 'coaching stock' green that was somewhat darker than the malachite green colour of the old Southern Railway. For cost reasons, liveries were usually changed piecemeal, when coaches came in for <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Coaches from different regions could also often find themselves coupled together. Due to the consequent muddle of liveries, many trains began to get an untidy if not tatty appearance which added to the run-down image of the railway. The rebranding of British Railways to British Rail on 1 January 1965 was coupled with the introduction of an entirely new national livery.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} approach for <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> concerns single-resource (machine) maintenance during production {{which may not}} be sufficient to improve production system reliability as a whole. Besides, in the literature many researchers <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities periodically with fixed maintenance duration. However, in a real manufacturing system maintenance activities can be executed earlier and the maintenance duration will become shorter since less time and effort are required. A practical example is that in a plastic production system, the proportion of machine-related downtime is even lower than mould-related downtime. The planned production operations are usually interrupted seriously because of the mismatch among the maintenance periods between injection machine and mould. In this connection, this paper proposes to jointly <b>schedule</b> production and <b>maintenance</b> tasks of multi-resources in order to improve production system reliability by reducing the mismatch among various processes. To integrate machine and mould maintenance tasks in production, this paper attempts to model the production scheduling with mould scheduling (PS-MS) problem with time-dependent deteriorating maintenance schemes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a genetic algorithm approach to <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks jointly with production jobs for the PS-MS problem, so as to minimise the makespan of production jobs.

40|$|Summary: Rising {{maintenance}} costs {{due to the}} complexity of naval vessel systems have empha¬sised the importance of cost-effective maintenance practises. The current preventative mainte¬nance approach <b>schedules</b> <b>maintenance</b> based on fixed-time intervals, leading to excess cost and time spent on maintenance. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop alternative maintenance practises. Challenges exist due to both the naval context and implementation of an alternative maintenance strategy. While reliability-based approaches are popular, they do not include a measure of severity of failure. This is necessary to produce a more-informed <b>maintenance</b> <b>schedule.</b> Risk-based <b>maintenance</b> (RBM) approaches use the product of severity and failure probability as an estimate of risk to <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Such an approach provides greater flexibility in maintenance intervals, allowing maintenance to be performed ‘on-condition’. RBM had existed since the 1970 s when it was developed for the nuclear power industry, though it had not been widely adopted for naval vessels to date. The present paper aims to describe the history of RBM for mobile maritime assets such as naval ships; by determining when RBM methodologies were developed. Eight RBM methodologies were identified, seven of which focused on components and one on a subsystem. Research focus on the development of RBM for mobile maritime assets had been found follow an increasing trend since the 1980 s. Future research directions are proposed for the development of RBM for naval vessels...|$|R

2500|$|Ultimately, {{the cause}} of the crash was not blamed on pilot error, {{although}} that was a contributing factor, but rather on maintenance issues at Executive Airlines. Pilots on prior flights with this aircraft had reported difficulties with the engine thrust, but few proper repairs were done. It seemed likely that one of the engines slipped to idle causing asymmetrical thrust and a loss of speed. [...] The NTSB concluded that Executive Airlines' <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> and inspections of the airplane were not performed in conformance with its approved maintenance program and that the manner in which required inspections of maintenance tasks were recorded and the subsequent approval of the airplane for return to service were not conducted in accordance with the proper maintenance practices.|$|E
