40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of EnglishElizabeth C. DoddAt {{the age of}} 12, I {{developed}} a condition that caused me to hyperventilate, black out, and on occasion, experience horrific visions.

Though at the time I knew there was <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> I {{had no idea what}} was causing my symptoms. Because the episodes caused many inconveniences and embarrassments, I withdrew from social activities and stopped attending school altogether. Believing that my problems were the result of a physical illness, my parents had my blood tested for diseases such as mononucleosis. I also underwent an MRI, which checked for any tumors or abnormalities in my brain. When all of my tests came back negative, I was referred to a psychiatrist. I told the psychiatrist about my inclination to avoid social activities, but refrained from telling her about the hallucinations. Despite my withheld information, she determined I had an extreme case of clinical depression and agoraphobia. Though I was comforted by the notion that I had been granted a diagnosis, I still found it impossible to leave my bedroom without having the strange episodes. As my symptoms of depression increased, my interest in living decreased. But with the help of family and close friends, I was able to persevere and accept my circumstances despite the discomfort they created in my world...|$|E

30|$|The Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; Foa et al. 1999) was {{developed}} as a self-report questionnaire that is now widely used to assess negative trauma-specific cognitive appraisals. It includes three factors; negative cognitive appraisals about the self, negative cognitive appraisals about the world and self-blame. While the PTCI is widely used, {{as far as we}} are aware, only one study has investigated {{the reliability and validity of}} the PTCI for use in Asian populations. Su and Chen (2008) reported the factor structure and psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the PTCI and its relationship with PTSD symptoms. They used a sample of 240 traumatized university students in Taiwan. Their confirmatory factor analysis suggested adequate replication of the original three-factor structure of the PTCI after eliminating four cross-loaded items. Their 29 -item PTCI was found to have good psychometric properties and had moderate to high correlations with PTSD symptoms. This initial study suggests that similar negative cognitions may contribute to PTSD development in Asian samples. The four items on the PTCI that were excluded on the Chinese version of this instrument were 1) “My reactions since the event mean that I am going crazy” 2) “I feel isolated and set apart from others” 3) There is <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> as a person” 4) “Somebody else would not have gotten into this situation”. The first three items are from the negative self-subscale and the last item is from the self-blame subscale. As Su and Chen (2008) assert, these items were excluded because of cross-loading across different factors, while the last item did not load on the BLAME factor but rather the SELF factor. This could be due to cultural deviations regarding self-blame attributions and the manner in which the self is evaluated. For instance, in regards to self-blame, Su and Chen (2008) highlight that Chinese trauma victims may still consider the possibility of others encountering a similar situation, while it could also be inferred that Chinese victims may assign less responsibility to themselves in causing trauma than Western victims do. Consequently, in both instances the Chinese participants may attribute less self-blame to the trauma experience. The exclusion of these items, however, highlights cultural concerns and potentially point to the PTCI being less appropriate for assessment of posttraumatic negative cognitions in Asian populations. The second aim of Study 1, therefore, is to further investigate the influence of culture on trauma-specific negative cognitive appraisals by examining whether there are cultural differences in these trauma-specific dysfunctional cognitive appraisals and the relationships between these trauma-specific cognitive appraisals and PTSD symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Director Nikos Nikolaidis {{said the}} {{following}} about this film's reception during an interview: [...] "When I was shooting Singapore Sling, I {{was under the}} impression that I was making a comedy with elements taken from Ancient Greek Tragedy... Later, when some European and American critics characterized it as 'one of the most disturbing films of all times,' I started to feel that <b>something</b> was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Then, when British censors banned its release in England, I finally realized that <b>something</b> is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> all of us." [...] The Icelandic neo-psychedelia band Singapore Sling is named after the film. As the band's frontman Henrik Björnsson explained in a June 2003 interview with Belgium's VRT Radio 1: [...] "We had a first gig. It was booked and we didn't have a name and I had been looking for a film called Singapore Sling for a long time. I couldn't find it anywhere. It sounded cool, so that became the name of the band. It's some kind of dark, perverse Greek film from 1990. I haven't found it yet, so if you know someone who has it, please let me know. I hope it's good. A dark perverse noir film and a guy who has sex with a corpse. And he's called Singapore Sling." [...] In November 2005, after the completion of his last film The Zero Years, a tale of perversion and sexual dominance which failed to replicate the earlier success of Singapore Sling, Nikolaidis declared his intention to stop making movies in order to deal with music. On 13 November 2012, The Projection Booth, a weekly podcast discussing films from a wide variety of genres with in-depth critical analysis hosted by critics Mike White and Rob St. Mary, dedicated an episode to Singapore Sling featuring as a guest Professor Vrasidas Karalis, an expert on Greek cinema and the author of A History of Greek Cinema, as well as a professional dominatrix who goes by the pseudonym of »Fräulein von B.« as a guest co-host.|$|R
60|$|What then? Remember this, {{that death}} is an enemy, an evil thing, an enemy to man, and {{therefore}} an enemy to Christ, the King and Head and Saviour of man.

They died, just as they die now, {{hundreds of thousands of}} years before man came upon this earth; and why should man expect to have a different lot? Why should you not take your death patiently, as you take any other evil which you cannot escape?' The heart of man, as soon as he begins to be a man, and not a mere savage; as soon as he begins to think reasonably, and feel deeply; the heart of man answers: 'No, I am not a mere animal.
