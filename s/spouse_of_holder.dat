50|$|Effective May 26, 2015, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services allows some <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> H-1B visa <b>holders</b> {{to apply}} for {{eligibility}} {{to work in the}} United States.

50|$|Because {{there no}} {{dedicated}} dependent visa class for E-2 visas, spouses and unmarried children (under 21) may receive derivative E-2 visas {{in order to}} accompany the principal alien. The duration of visa for a family member who is of a different nationality from the principal is determined by any reciprocal agreements between their country of nationality and the US. Only {{if there is no}} such reciprocal agreement will the duration be the same as the principal applicant. Dependents may seek employment in the US by applying for employment authorization using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Children under 21 cannot apply for work; only the <b>spouse</b> <b>of</b> the E-2 <b>holder</b> can.|$|R
2500|$|Green-card holders {{married to}} non-U.S. {{citizens}} {{are able to}} legally bring their spouses and minor children to join them in the USA, but must wait for their priority date to become current. The foreign <b>spouse</b> <b>of</b> a green-card <b>holder</b> must wait for approval of an [...] "immigrant visa" [...] from the State Department before entering the United States. Due to numerical limitation {{on the number of}} these visas, the wait time for approval may be months or years. In the interim, the spouse cannot be legally present in the United States, unless he or she secures a visa by some other means. Green-card holders may opt to wait to become U.S. citizens, and only then sponsor their spouses and children, as the process is much faster for U.S. citizens. However, many green-card holders can choose to apply for the spouse or children and update their application after becoming a U.S. citizen.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{taxation}} homestead exemption, [...] "Persons Residing Under Color of Law" [...] (a term {{created by}} the courts which applies to persons in the US with asylum or parole status, or someone who has applied for and completed the I-485 application process for a green card but is still awaiting final approval/issuance of the card). A person in the US under an E, H, L or R-class visa is not eligible for homestead, pursuant to Rule 12D-7.007(3), Florida Administrative Code. A person under an H or L visa who has an already approved I-140, and is awaiting USCIS retrogressions in order to submit the I-485 application, is not benefited with the homestead exemption. There is a loophole in the system, however. J-4 visa <b>holders,</b> who are <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> J-1 visa <b>holders,</b> are assigned an Alien Number. Some counties accept alien numbers {{as part of the}} requirements to obtain a homestead exemption, although J visa holders cannot file for adjustment of status.|$|R
50|$|The E-3 visa {{is similar}} in many respects to the H-1B visa. Important {{differences}} include the fact that <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> E-3 visa <b>holders</b> may work in the United States without restrictions (unlike other US non-immigrant visas, even the TN visa issued to Canadian and Mexican citizens), {{even if they are}} of a different nationality; that the E-3 visa is renewable indefinitely (in two-year increments); and that the application process is much quicker. Australian citizens applying for an E-3 visa are also no longer subject to the 65,000 annual visa limit for H-1B visas; although there is a separate annual quota of 10,500 E-3 visas, this is believed to be much more generous to Australians than requiring them to compete with all other nations for H-1B visas. (One calculation is that the E-3 guarantees Australians 15% of the combined annual total of US visas for persons in specialty occupations, should they want such visas, even though with a population of approximately 23.4 million Australia accounts for only 0.3% of the world’s non-US population.) Visas issued to spouses and children are not included in the E3 quota and spouses and children {{do not need to be}} Australian citizens.|$|R
50|$|The titles {{today are}} given to, and kept by, {{legitimate}} {{members of the}} Swedish royal family for life, except for Swedish monarchs, who do not continue to hold ducal titles after ascending the throne. Only in connection with his ascension in 1973 has the current king occasionally {{been referred to as}} King of Sweden and Duke of Jämtland. However, his wife, current Queen Silvia, whom he married in 1976, is not a duchess, and no other queen consorts have ever continued to have any such title either, after their husbands became King. Otherwise, royal <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> ducal title <b>holders</b> are also created dukes and duchesses upon marriage (this would not include spouses who do not become Swedish royalty, such as those who married former dukes who had given up their titles for unapproved marriages). The first example of a man acquiring the Swedish ducal title of a woman was at the 2010 marriage of Crown Princess Victoria to Prince Daniel. Currently the prerequisite for a ducal title has been assumed by the public to be the position of Prince or Princess of Sweden, and for that being a Swedish citizen, however no definite policy has been published.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{determine}} whether <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} have {{an increased risk of}} diabetes compared with <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> subjects with normal glucose tolerance. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — A random sample <b>of</b> <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> patients with type 2 diabetes (group 1 S) attending a general practice diabetes clinic was compared with <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> nondiabetic subjects (as determined by oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) (group 2 S). Spouses in both groups underwent OGTT, fasting lipid profile, and blood pressure (BP) measurements. RESULTS — A total of 245 subjects in group 1 S and 234 subjects in group 2 S underwent OGTT. Group 1 S had a significantly higher incidence of fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes (19. 1 vs. 9. 4 %). Group 1 S also had higher fasting glucose and triglyceride levels, higher BMI, and a trend toward higher BP.

40|$|Objectives: Following up on two earlier {{publications}} showing increased {{psychological stress}} and psy-chosocial effects of travel {{on the business}} travellers this study investigated the health <b>of</b> <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> busi-ness travellers. Methods: Medical claims <b>of</b> <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> Washington DC World Bank staff participating in the medical insurance programme in 1997 – 8 were reviewed. Only the first of each diagnosis with the ninth revi-sion of the international classification of diseases (ICD- 9) recorded for each person was included in this analysis. The claims were grouped into 28 diagnostic categories and subcategories. Results: There were almost twice as many women as men among the 4630 identified spouses. Over-all, male and female <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> travellers filed claims for medical treatment at about a 16 % higher rate than <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> non-travellers.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{life satisfaction}} in <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> middle-aged stroke 			survivors from the long-term perspective {{and to identify}} factors that 			explain their life satisfaction. 			Design: Cross-sectional, case-control study. 			Subjects: Cohabitant <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> survivors of ischaemic stroke aged < 70 years 			at stroke onset (n = 248) and <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> controls (n = 246). 			Methods: Assessments were made 7 years after inclusion to the study. Spouses’ 			life satisfaction was assessed with the Fugl-Meyer’s Life 			Satisfaction Check-List (LiSAT 11). Stroke-related factors were 			examined with the National Institutes of Health stroke scale, 			Mini-Mental State Examination, Barthel Index and modified Rankin 			Scale. 			Results: <b>Spouses</b> <b>of</b> stroke survivors had significantly lower satisfaction 			with general life, leisure, sexual life, partner relationship, family 			life, and poorer somatic and psychological health than <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> 			controls. Caregiving <b>spouses</b> had significantly lower scores on all 			life domains except vocation and own {{activities of daily living}} than 			non-caregiving spouses. Spouses’ satisfaction on different life 			domains was explained mainly by their age, sex, support given to the 			partner, and the survivor’s level of global disability, to which both 			physical and cognitive impairments contributed. 			Conclusion: Seven years after stroke, <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> stroke survivors reported lower 			life satisfaction compared with <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> controls.

40|$|Introduction: Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 2 is {{a growing}} threat in developing countries already burdened {{with high levels of}} infectious disease. Screening the general population has debatable advantages. This study aims to determine whether <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> patients with diabetes mellitus have higher random blood glucose (RBG) levels as well as the benefit of RBG testing as a targetted screening tool. Methodology: The survey employed a cross-sectional comparative study of spouses’ of diabetics and non-diabetics attend ing the general out-patient department of the LagosStateUniversityTeaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja. A modified WHO STEPS Surveillance Instrument and a one-touch Glucometer were used to collect data. Blood pressures and BMI were measured and correlated to blood glucose levels. Results: Prevalence of high RBG was found to be 7 % among <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> diabetics and 3. 3 % among <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> non-diabetic patients. Mean RBG was 5. 57 mmol/L and 7. 7 mmol/L within the age group 40 - 49 years and 50 - 59 years respectively among <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> diabetic patients compared to 5. 4 mmol/L and 5. 5 mmol/L within the same age group among the <b>spouses</b> non-diabetics. <b>Spouses</b> <b>of</b> patients with diabetes mellitus had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and BMI compared to <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> non-diabetics. Conclusion: Being male, married to a diabetic patient, lower educational levels and higher body mass index are significantly associated with higher random blood glucose in the <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> diabetic patients. Random blood glucose measurements are an effective screening tool and <b>spouses</b> <b>of</b> diabetic patients can benefit from targeted screening in controlled clinical settings. </span...|$|R
