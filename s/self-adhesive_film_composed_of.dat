30|$|MnO 2 {{thin films}} with {{nanostructures}} {{have been prepared}} on Pt substrates by a facile and mild solution method. The MnO 2 film prepared at RT with a long reaction time is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> dandelion-like microspheres, which consists of nanowhiskers with very small size. The reaction temperature {{plays an important role}} in controlling the surface morphology of the film. As the reaction temperature was increased to 80 °C, a <b>film</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> nanoflakes can be prepared in a very short time. The CV measurements indicate that MnO 2 thin films prepared by this method are promising as electrodes for supercapacitors. The <b>film</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> dandelion-like microspheres exhibited a higher specific capacitance and better rate capability than the <b>film</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> nanoflakes, which is probably due to the high surface area and smaller feature of the microspheres. The excellent cycling stability and good rate capability <b>of</b> the <b>film</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> dandelion-like microspheres coupled with the simple and low cost synthesis method make this material attractive for large applications.|$|R
