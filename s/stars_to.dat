5|$|Although {{it appears}} that {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the first}} <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{hoped to}} {{implement}} a survey called the N2K Consortium, a collaboration which uses Doppler spectroscopy to find radial velocity measurements of stars that hadn't been previously surveyed.

5|$|Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau (whose {{first and}} last names are anagrams of each other). Many reviewers believe that Gusteau is {{inspired}} by real-life chef Bernard Loiseau, who committed suicide after media speculation that his flagship restaurant, La Côte d'Or, {{was going to be}} downgraded from three Michelin <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> two. LaCôte d'Or was one of the restaurants visited by Brad Bird and others in France.|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning {{to fall out of}} favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's Soup Company {{sponsored}} the entire nineteen-year run of Lassie. In {{one of the}} first instances of product placement, the company asked that their products be visible on the set and so, in episode after episode, Campbell's products are seen in background shots. Campbell's also contractually required the show's <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> avoid appearing in any film or theatrical production that undermined their All-American images.|$|E

5|$|Lacaille gave six stars Bayer designations, {{labeling}} them Alpha (α) to Zeta (ζ) in 1756, but omitted Epsilon (ε) and designated two adjacent {{stars as}} Gamma (γ).

50|$|One of the {{requisite}} {{conditions for a}} <b>star</b> <b>to</b> be defined as symbiotic is an interaction between stars.

5|$|No known {{globular}} clusters display active star formation, {{which is consistent}} with the view that {{globular clusters}} are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy, and were among the first collections of <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> form. Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|Sir Charles Villiers Stanford (30 September 1852– 29 March 1924) was an Irish composer, music teacher, and conductor.

5|$|There {{are three}} types of Force powers; light, dark and neutral. Light Force powers provide nonviolent {{advantages}} such as being able to restore health or persuade enemies to ignore the player. Dark Force powers are violent and give the ability to throw objects or choke enemies. Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities such as being able to jump higher or run faster. There are fourteen powers in total, four of each type and a bonus power in each light and dark if the Jedi stays true to that path. Players earn <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> allocate toward Force powers by completing specific levels. By finding all the secrets in a level, players can also gain one bonus star to use. Between levels, the player can choose which Force powers to enhance by allocating <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> that power. Stars cannot be reclaimed from powers later on.|$|E

5|$|After {{meeting with}} Caine and Forte, White {{was taken to}} the grill {{restaurant}} at the Hyde Park Hotel. Forte was interested if White could transfer the Michelin stars from Harveys; White was open to this since Raymond Blanc had previously transferred two <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons when he moved his restaurant from Summertown, Oxford. Following the agreement of Michelin, White left Harveys in July 1993; The Restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel less than two months later, on 14 September. The interior was decorated with paintings from White's own collection.|$|E
