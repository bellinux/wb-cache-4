40|$|We {{present a}} shallow {{embedding}} of the weakest precondition semantics {{for a program}} renement language. We use the Isabelle/ZF theorem prover for untyped set theory, and statements in our renement language are represented as set transformers. Our representation is signi cant in making use of the expressiveness of Isabelle/ZF's set theory to represent states as dependently-typed functions from variable names to their values. This lets us give a uniform treatment of statements such as variable assignment, framed specication statements, local blocks, and parameterisation. ZF set theory requires set comprehensions to be explicitly bounded. This requirement propagates to the denitions of statements in our renement language, which have operands for the state type. We reduce the syntactic burden of repeatedly writing the state type by using Isabelle's meta-logic to dene a lifted <b>set</b> <b>transformer</b> language which implicitly passes the state type to statements.

40|$|In the {{distribution}} network 110 kV of E. ON Company {{there are the}} nodal areas of Čebin substation and Sokolnice substation which are operated separately at the present time. There is one 400 / 110 kV transformer for each nodal area. In case of fault {{on one of these}} transformers or on busbar in which the <b>set</b> <b>transformer</b> is working, it comes to an outage of electric supply in the set nodal area. This problem has to be solved with help of the parallel operation of nodal areas of Čebín substation and Sokolnice substation. The main and also the practical task of this work is to design the bridge connection appropriate for parallel operation of nodal areas (supply transformers 400 / 110 kV). With help of a computing program there were made calculations of steady state and short-circuit conditions in distribution network 110 kV for separated and parallel operation of nodal areas. Voltage conditions, load of transformers (400 / 110 kV and 110 /vn kV) and conditions on 110 kV lines are evaluated and controlled as the result of steady state calculations. Based on short-circuit conditions there is controlled the short-circuit resistance of the substations. Finally there are compared advantages and disadvantages of separated and parallel operations of nodal areas. If necessary, technical arrangements required for introduction of parallel operation of nodal areas of Čebín substation and Sokolnice substation will be designed. The theoretical part of the work deals with calculation of steady state with help of iterative methods, namely Newton´s and Gauss-Seidel methods. There are further described the method of calculating short-circuit currents, characteristic values and time behaviours of short-circuit current...|$|E

The most challenging technical issue that we faced in designing TSL was how to automate the generation of the <b>set</b> of abstract <b>transformers</b> for a given abstract interpretaton of a given instruction set. From a description of the concrete operational semantics of an instruction set, together with the datatypes and operations that define an abstract domain, TSL automatically creates the <b>set</b> of abstract <b>transformers</b> for the instructions of the instruction set. TSL advances the state of the art in program analysis because it provides two dimensions of parameterizability: (i) a given analysis component can be retargeted to different instruction sets; (ii) multiple analysis components can be created automatically from a single specification of the concrete operational semantics of the language to be analyzed.
