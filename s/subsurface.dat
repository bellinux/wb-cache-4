5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in <b>subsurface</b> oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. <b>Subsurface</b> oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and <b>subsurface</b> water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E
5|$|It is {{speculated that}} there could be life in Callisto's <b>subsurface</b> ocean. Like Europa and Ganymede, as well as Saturn's moons Enceladus, Mimas, Dione and Titan, a {{possible}} <b>subsurface</b> ocean might be composed of salt water.|$|E

First, we give a complete, explicit, and computable {{solution}} to the problem of when two simple closed curves on a surface are equivalent under the Johnson kernel. Second, we show that the Johnson filtration and the Johnson homomorphism can be defined intrinsically on <b>subsurfaces</b> and prove that both are functorial under inclusions of <b>subsurfaces.</b> The key point is that the latter reduces the former to a finite computation, which can be carried out by hand. In particular this solves the conjugacy problem in the Johnson kernel for separating twists. Using a theorem of Putman, we compute the first Betti number o...|$|R

5|$|Other moons in the Solar System {{are also}} tidally heated, and they too may {{generate}} additional heat through the friction of <b>subsurface</b> magma or water oceans.

5|$|The animators also {{employed}} <b>subsurface</b> scattering—developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull {{during his}} graduate student {{days at the}} University of Utah in the 1970s—to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This {{would be the first}} time that <b>subsurface</b> scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase <b>subsurface</b> scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the <b>subsurface</b> ocean, and therefore any <b>subsurface</b> ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E
30|$|The DS-GMR {{model is}} {{exploited}} {{to transfer the}} movement to a two-link STIFF-FLOP robot.

5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of <b>subsurface</b> liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining {{the presence or absence of}} a <b>subsurface</b> ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E

5|$|Conjectures {{regarding}} extraterrestrial {{life have}} ensured a high-profile for Europa and {{have led to}} steady lobbying for future missions. The aims of these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized <b>subsurface</b> oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around itself and Jupiter. Europa receives about 5.40 Sv of radiation per day.|$|E
5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the <b>subsurface</b> can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The <b>subsurface</b> layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E

From 1874 to 1875 the Metropolitan Railway used the Liverpool Street main-line station as a terminus; on 12 July 1875 the company opened their own station, initially called Bishopsgate. <b>Subsurface</b> platforms 1 and 2, were opened in 1875.|$|E

This poor illumination is partially caused by seismic energy being directed outside of the survey bounds. Imaging in areas with poor illumination can be improved by using Regularized Inversion with model Preconditioning (RIP). RIP helps compensate for poor illumination by regularizing amplitudes in the image. By compensating for the lost energy, RIP in essence expands the data space...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} diffcult tasks in {{reservoir}} simulations is reliable characterization of fractured <b>subsurfaces.</b> A typical situation in petroleum engineering employs dynamic data integrations such as the oil production history to be matched with simulated responses associated {{with a set of}} porosity and/or permeability fields. Among the challenges found in practice are proper mathematical modelings of the flow in the presence of fractured systems, persisting heterogeneity in the porosity and permeability, and the uncertainties inherent in them. In this paper we propose a Bayesian framework Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation (MCMC) to sample a set of <b>subsurface's</b> characteristics from the posterior distribution that are conditioned to the production data. This process requires obtaining the simulated responses over many realizations. The flow for this simulated response is governed by a dual porosity, dual permeability model. As this can be a prohibitively expensive endeavor, we address the possibility of using the Multiscale Finite Volume Element (MsFVEM) combined with a sparse stochastic collocation technique to provide a venue for an effcient computation. A set numerical examples illustrating the procedure will be presented...|$|R

5|$|Several {{explanations}} for the observed elevated temperatures and the resulting plumes have been proposed, including venting from a <b>subsurface</b> reservoir of liquid water, sublimation of ice, decompression and dissociation of clathrates, and shear heating, but a complete explanation of all the heat sources causing the observed thermal power output of Enceladus {{has not yet been}} settled.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large <b>subsurface</b> ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
