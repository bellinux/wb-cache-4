40|$|Abstract: Multi-jet {{ejection}} is the {{key factor}} to promote the industrial application of electrospinning technology. Simulation model based on Maxwell theory was built up to investigate the ejection and motion behaviors of multi charged jets. The charge Coulomb repulsive force among adjacent jet was introduced into the simulation model, which enhanced the instability motion and promoted the stretching process of charged jets. The <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> of charged jet increased with the increasing of injection distance, applied voltage, distance between spinneret and collector. But <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> of charged jet decreased with the increasing of distance between charged jets. <b>Stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> in multi-jet electrospinning was larger than that in single-jet electrospinning. The maximal <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio</b> of charged jet was larger than 9000 in the nine jets electrospinning mode. This work provided a good method to investigate the controlling technology of multi-jet electrospinning. ...|$|E

This work {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} strain-induced crystalline microstructure that develops under uniaxial elongation of amorphous poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, above its glass transition temperature, as an approach for industrial stretch-blow moulding processes. The present study aims at: a) defining the most relevant processing parameters which govern and are of significance for the induced morphology, and b) establishing of relationships between processing and morphology. Compression moulded amorphous PET was uniaxial stretched with variations of following stretching parameters: stretching temperature, Tst, stretching velocity, Vst, and <b>stretching</b> <b>ratio,</b> λst, that were varied in two levels according to a L 8 Taguchi orthogonal array.
