40|$|Cotton is a {{flammable}} {{material and}} some cottons would decompose or even self-ignite at bad {{storage and transport}} conditions. This paper studied the spontaneous combustion <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> from the aspect of thermal decomposition temperature (TDT) and critical ambient temperature (CAT). From Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis, significant thermal decomposition was detected at the temperature of 210 ° C, which indicated that the TDT <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> was around 210 ° C. From TG analysis and small-scale CAT test, activation energy <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> and CAT <b>of</b> small <b>cotton</b> stack were obtained. Then, CATs <b>of</b> the <b>cotton</b> stacks with different dimensions were calculated based on Frank-Kamenetskii theory. With the dimensions l increased from 0. 2 to 3. 2 m, the CATs <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> decreased from 195. 0 to 137 : 9 ° C. The TDT <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> was higher than these CATs, and the differences between TDT and CAT <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> varied from almost 15 - 70 ° C (with the dimensions l increased from 0. 2 to 3. 2 m). As the experiments and calculation of the CATs were very complicated and time-consuming, the CATs <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> can be estimated if the TDT was known.

40|$|Abstract: Fibre blend {{should be}} {{composed}} regarding the requirements and allowable {{price of the}} textile end product. Using the appropriate raw material and optimised fibre blends we can influence the mechanical properties and regularity of a yarn as well as significantly {{reduce the number of}} yarn faults. The contribution presents a study of the influence of quality characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres and constructional parameters of a yarn on the most important properties <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn. The achieved results have been used for determination <b>of</b> optimised <b>cotton</b> fibre blends regarding the quality and price <b>of</b> a <b>cotton</b> yarn. A complex procedure <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre blend determination significantly depends on suitable models for prediction of properties <b>of</b> resulting <b>cotton</b> yarns, in-depth knowledge <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres and consideration of parameters of a production process. The results of a theoretical part of the research have been summed up in a model <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn engineering, which main components are regression model for prediction <b>of</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> ring and rotor yarns, and model for optimisation <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre blends regarding the quality and price. The regression prediction model has been designed using one of the popular artificial intelligence methods: the machine learning from examples. The prediction accuracy for forecasting the breaking tenacity, breaking extension, and regularity <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> yarns, as well as amount of yarn faults, was significantly improved. The obtained regression trees served as a basis for realisation of a model for optimisation <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre blend...|$|R
