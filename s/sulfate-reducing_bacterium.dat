50|$|Among the Deltaproteobacteria {{the orders}} of <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> include Desulfobacterales, Desulfovibrionales, and Syntrophobacterales. This {{accounts}} for {{the largest group of}} <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> about 23 genera.|$|R
50|$|The Desulfobacterales are {{an order}} of <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> {{included}} among the Proteobacteria. There are three families. They are <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> reducing sulfates to sulfides to obtain energy. They are strictly anaerobe.|$|R

50|$|In engineering, <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{can create}} {{problems}} when metal structures {{are exposed to}} sulfate-containing water: Interaction of water and metal creates a layer of molecular hydrogen on the metal surface; <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> then oxidize the hydrogen while creating hydrogen sulfide, which contributes to corrosion.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{were grown}} in media {{containing}} (1) mercury and (2) {{a mixture of}} heavy metals to determine if these bacteria could effectively precipitate heavy metals from an aqueous solutions. Previous {{studies have shown that}} (1) <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> produce hydrogen sulfide and (2) that hydrogen sulfide reacts with various heavy metals producing insoluble complexes. Data from these studies showed that when bacteria were incubated with heavy metals for 2 to 4 days a marked decrease in the solubility of mercury, lead and cadmium resulted. For example, after incubation with <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> 90 % of the mercury, zinc, lead and cadmium, and 60 % of the copper and iron were filterable. The results suggest that <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> may be used to remove heavy metal contaminants from aqueous solutions...|$|R

40|$|The {{microbial}} population {{structure and function}} of natural anaerobic communities maintained in laboratory fixed-bed biofilm reactors were tracked before and after a major perturbation, which involved the addition of sulfate to the influent of a reactor {{that had previously been}} fed only glucose (methanogenic), while sulfate was withheld from a reactor that had been fed both glucose and sulfate (sulfidogenic). The population structure, determined by using phylogenetically based oligonucleotide probes for methanogens and <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> was linked to the functional performance of the biofilm reactors. Before the perturbation, the methanogenic reactor contained up to 25 % methanogens as well as 15 % <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> even though sulfate was not present in the influent of this reactor. Methanobacteriales and Desulfovibrio spp. were the most abundant methanogens and <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> respectively. The presence of <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (primarily Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfobacterium spp.) in the absence of sulfate may be explained by their ability to function as proton-reducing acetogens and/or fermenters. Sulfate reduction began immediately following the addition of sulfate consistent with the presence of significant levels of <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the methanogenic reactor, and levels of <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> increased to a new steady-state level of 30 to 40 %; coincidentally, effluent acetate concentrations decreased. Notably, some <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Desulfococcus/Desulfosarcina/Desulfobotulus group) were more competitive without sulfate. Methane production decreased immediately following the addition of sulfate; this was later followed by a decrease in the relative concentration of methanogens, which reached a new steady-state level of approximately 8 %. The changeover to sulfate-free medium in the sulfidogenic reactor did not cause a rapid shift to methanogenesis. Methane production and a substantial increase in the levels of methanogens were observed only after approximately 50 days following the perturbation...|$|R

40|$|Oxidation {{of acetate}} in salt marsh {{sediment}} was inhibited {{by the addition}} of fluoroacetate, and also {{by the addition of}} molybdate, an inhibitor of <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Molybdate had no effect upon the metabolism of acetate in a freshwater sediment in the absence of sulfate. The inhibitory effect of molybdate on acetate turnover in the marine sediment seemed to be because of its inhibiting <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> which oxidized acetate to carbon dioxide. Sulfide was not recovered from sediment in the presence of molybdate added as an inhibitor of <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria,</b> but sulfide was recovered quantitatively even in the presence of molybdate by the addition of the strong reducing agent titanium chloride before acidification of the sediment. Reduction of sulfate to sulfide by the <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the sediment was only partially inhibited by fluoroacetate, but completely inhibited by molybdate addition. This was interpreted as showing the presence of two functional groups of sulfate-reducing bacteria—one group oxidizing acetate, and another group probably oxidizing hydrogen...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{corrosion}} {{residual strength}} of the AZ 91 D magnesium alloy {{in the presence of}} <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> is studied. In the experiments, the chemical composition of corrosion film was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In addition, a series of instruments, such as scanning electronic microscope, pH-meter and an AG- 10 TA materials test machine, were applied to test and record the morphology of the corrosion product, fracture texture and mechanical properties of the AZ 91 D magnesium alloy. The experiments show that the <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (SRB) {{play an important role in}} the corrosion process of the AZ 91 D magnesium alloy. Pitting corrosion was enhanced by <b>sulfate-reducing</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Corrosion pits are important defects that could lead to a significant stress concentration in the tensile process.
