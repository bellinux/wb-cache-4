In an environment of intensely competitive business, the customer service {{is a means of}} differentiation from competitors and a way of increasing customer loyalty. For achieving this purpose, we conducted two market research studies, using the qualitative and quantitative methods, in order to measure the satisfaction of the customers from Brasov city regarding the level of service offered by the <b>specialized</b> <b>retailer</b> Decathlon. This company is always concerned about customer satisfaction in a timely manner and about brand consolidation at national and international level...|$|E

The purpose of this paper is to analyze that subject, internationalization through franchising, using as a case study the internationalization process of Parfois, a <b>specialized</b> <b>retailer</b> based on the North of Portugal, and operating in the fashion accessories business.

5000|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century, general stores were {{displaced}} in many areas of the United States by many different types of <b>specialized</b> <b>retailers</b> in trading towns and small cities. But from the 1960s through present, many small <b>specialized</b> <b>retailers</b> have in turn been crushed by the so-called [...] "category killers", which are [...] "big-box" [...] wholesale-type retailers large enough to carry the majority of best-selling goods in a specific category like sporting goods or office supplies.|$|R

40|$|Relationships {{have become}} more {{essential}} today considering that the business environment consists of many actors competing over the same customers. Relationships imply great advantages, for both the companies and the customers, and involve knowledge exchange. This implies that the companies are able to understand and tailor their offering to suit {{the specific needs of}} the customers. To understand how the customers perceive a company’s offering it might be useful to assess the dimensions regarding service quality. A company needs to be aware of what they are promising in order to achieve this. The purpose of this thesis is to identify essential aspects that affect the customer satisfaction in the relationship between a wholesale company and a <b>specialized</b> <b>retailer.</b> In order to fulfill our purpose a case study was conducted of the wholesale company Dogman. To be able to understand Dogman’s relationships with their retailers, five service quality determinants were used. Our research indicates that four aspects; information, knowledge, salespeople and responsiveness, are essential for customer satisfaction and long-lasting relationships...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe French Observatory of Food Quality (Oqali) aims at {{collecting}} all nutritional {{data provided}} on labels of processed foods (nutritional information and composition), at branded products level, {{in order to}} follow nutritional labeling changes over time. This study carries out an overview of allergens labeling frequencies by distinguishing allergens used in recipes from those listed on precautionary statements, for the fourteen allergen categories for which labeling is mandatory according to European legislation. 17, 309 products were collected, between 2008 and 2012, from 26 food categories. Products were classified per family and type of brand (national brands, retailer brands, entry-level retailer brands, hard discount, and <b>specialized</b> <b>retailer</b> brands). Allergenic ingredients were identified from ingredients lists and precautionary statements. 73 % of the 17, 309 products studied contained at least one allergen in their ingredients list and 39 % had a precautionary statement for one or more allergens. Milk (53 %), gluten (41 %), and egg (22 %) were {{the most commonly used}} allergens in ingredients lists. For precautionary statement, nuts (20 %), egg (14 %), peanut (13 %), soybean (12 %), and milk (11 %) were the most common allergens listed. Precautionary statement was most frequently found among first-price products (hard discount and entry-level retailer brands). National brands seemed to use it less frequently. For all these results, differences depended both on food categories and allergen categories. This study will enable to follow allergens labeling and their use as ingredients over time, particularly by assessing an hypothetical increase in allergens presence in processed food...|$|E

40|$|Planned {{shopping}} malls usually {{have one or}} more department (anchor) stores and multiple <b>specialized</b> <b>retailers</b> selling substitutable commodities in each commodity category. If consumers know their taste for the anchor’s commodity and its price, but learn about a retailer’s commodity only by costly search, collocation may benefit both store types. Intra-mall competition reduces markups, but anchors guarantee a minimum surplus from search. A mall with many retailers makes finding a suitable specialized commodity highly probable. For some parameters, additional consumer search dominates the loss in retail markups, so a profit-maximizing land developer would rent mall space to both store types...|$|R

The company was also profitable, estimating doing more than $1 billion in sales in 1998.

In the USA, a tobacconist shop is traditionally represented by a wooden Indian positioned nearby. Most retailers of tobacco sell other types of product; today supermarkets, in many countries with a special counter, are usually the main sellers of the common brands of cigarette.

50|$|As {{alternative}} fashion {{can relate}} to such a diverse selection of styles the acquisition of clothing, accessories and services (such as hair care) can come from a huge variety of resources, particularly as alternative fashion trends become more accepted and assimilated into mainstream culture. Traditionally alternative clothing, shoes and accessories have been largely procured from independently owned businesses, such as the botiques found in bohemian and artistic districts of large urban centers. Though still popular, these type of small, <b>specialized</b> <b>retailers</b> have become displaced much like mainstream retail outlets by the Internet. Also, as fashion trends are co-opted by {{more and more people}} chain stores, which may offer a wider variety of product at a lower price and are easier to access in non-urban areas than botiques, began to soak up {{a large part of the}} alternative fashion market. This change in the availability and commodification of alternative fashions has encouraged much broader use of styles in the mainstream once only found in niche groups. Items from thrift & vintage shops, altered and DIY fashions have also long held a place in alternative fashion to the point where the use of mismatched second-hand clothing is considered cliche to alternative and liberal ideologies.|$|R
