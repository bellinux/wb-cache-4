Cuesta, citing his <b>seniority,</b> <b>claimed</b> supreme command and set his columns marching July 12, against Blake's objections (although the Castilian was persuaded to detach a reserve at Benavente). Cuesta, for lack of cavalry, advanced blind to French movements, expecting to find Bessières concentrating near Valladolid.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{ascertain}} {{the incidence of}} acupuncture claims and the characteristics of patients <b>claiming</b> <b>for</b> acupuncture. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of Health Insurance Commission data on <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> acupuncture performed by a medical practitioner. PARTICIPANTS: A summary of all Medicare acupuncture <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> financial years 1984 - 85 to 1996 - 97 and {{a random sample of}} patients claiming a Medicare rebate in calendar year 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Claims</b> <b>for</b> acupuncture by patients' State, sex, age, and the socioeconomic disadvantage index of patients' residences. RESULTS: Between 1984 - 85 and 1996 - 97 the number of acupuncture claims increased, but declined as a proportion of total Medicare claims. In 1996, 1. 16 % of patients <b>claimed</b> <b>for</b> acupuncture, which constituted 0. 5 % of all Medicare <b>claims.</b> Adjusting <b>for</b> age and socioeconomic disadvantage, women were {{more likely than men to}} <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> acupuncture (odds ratio, 1. 40; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 36 - 1. 45). This sex difference is proportionately greater than that for all medical services. Propensity to <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> acupuncture increased with age, peaking at 65 - 69 years, then declining. Acupuncture claims were more likely in areas just above those assessed as having the greatest social disadvantage. CONCLUSION: The number of acupuncture claims has increased since 1984. As a proportion of all Medicare claims, acupuncture has remained stable since declining in 1991 - 92. This suggests that acupuncture is now an established complementary medical practice...|$|R

50|$|The Veteran appealed a Board of Veterans Appeals {{decision}} that determined that new and material evidence {{had not been}} submitted to reopen his <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> right ear hearing loss and that denied his <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> service connection for tinnitus. The Veteran served on active duty from December 1943 to September 1945. The VA Regional Office denied his original <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> service connection for hearing loss of the right ear in 1945 {{on the basis that}} the condition was not found on his discharge examination and there was no in-service treatment for the condition. In 1998, the Veteran filed a reopened claim and a new <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> tinnitus. He was scheduled for an examination in April 1999 and diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus. He attended a hearing at the Regional Office in May 1999 and testified regarding his in-service noise exposure and experience of having had ringing in his ears during and since service. The VA Regional Office ultimately did not reopen the finally denied <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> hearing loss, as it held that new and material evidence had not been submitted.

40|$|Does {{and should}} a wrongdoer’s {{liability}} insurance cover an aggrieved party’s <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> restitution (e. g., a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains) ? This article answers those questions. It does so by first {{answering the question}} of whether <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> restitution are covered under the terms of liability insurance policies. Then, after concluding that they are, it addresses {{the question of whether}} <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> restitution should be insurable as a matter of public policy and insurance law theory. There are long-standing legal and equitable principles that, on the one hand, dictate that a wrongdoer {{should not be allowed to}} benefit from its wrongdoing, which the wrongdoer would if insurance were allowed to cover <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> restitution. On the other hand, there are competing public policies that favor enforcing contracts and compensating innocent victims. If a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> restitution is covered by the terms of an insurance policy, but such claims are viewed as uninsurable as a matter of public policy, then policyholders would have paid millions of dollars in premiums for policies that provide illusory coverage and thousands of innocent victims with billions of dollars of claims would not receive compensation. In analyzing these issues, this article does so by using two common examples where the insurability of <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> restitution are regularly implicated—intellectual property infringement claims under Commercial General Liability insurance policies (CGL policies) and shareholder fraud claims under Directors and Officers liability insurance policies (D 2 ̆ 6 O policies) ...|$|R
