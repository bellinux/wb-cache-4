40|$|Since its {{emerging}} in mid 90 ’s, MPEG- 2 [1] {{has been widely}} accepted by the digital video industry. There have been huge amount of video content stored in MPEG- 2 format. MPEG- 4 [2] is the latest video coding standard out of MEPG targeted at network video applications. The <b>Simple</b> <b>Profile</b> (<b>SP)</b> of MPEG- 4 is often used in practical applications. Thus, it is often necessary to perform MPEG- 2 to MPEG- 4 SP transcoding for the transmission of MPEG- 2 coded video content over networks. Such transcoding usually requires hybrid spatial/temporal resolution down-sampling. Since MPEG- 4 SP does not support bi-directional prediction, the B-pictures in the MPEG- 2 bit-stream {{need to be changed}} into P-pictures. In addition, the transcoder {{needs to be able to}} deal with interlaced input video supported by MPEG- 2 standard. In this paper, we propose techniques to perform motion vector re-estimation that effectively handles the hybrid spatial/temporal resolution reduction with picture type conversion, as well as the interlaced MEPG- 2 input video.

Specific tools and methods are needed to cope with the increasing complexity of both algorithms and platforms. Our approach to design such systems is based on the usage of a high level of abstraction language called RVC CAL. This language is dataflow oriented and thus points out the concurrency and parallelism of algorithms. Moreover CAL is supported by the OpenDF simulator and by two code generators called CAL 2 C (software generator) and CAL 2 HDL (hardware generator). The MPEG expert group has recently elaborated the Reconfigurable Video Coding (RVC) standard which defines the RVC CAL language as reference for MPEG video decoder descriptions. This paper introduces the opportunities to design an innovative system involving hardware and software IPs, embedded processors and memories from a CAL model. Practical results on a FPGA are provided with a codesign solution of an MPEG 4 <b>Simple</b> <b>Profile</b> (<b>SP)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{studies on}} linear shear instabilities often use simple {{velocity}} and density profiles (e. g. constant, piecewise) for obtaining good {{qualitative and quantitative}} predictions of the initial disturbances. Furthermore, such <b>simple</b> <b>profiles</b> provide a minimal model for obtaining a mechanistic understanding of otherwise elusive shear instabilities. However, except a few specific cases, the efficacy of <b>simple</b> <b>profiles</b> has remained limited to the linear stability paradigm. In this work we have proposed a general framework that can simulate the fully nonlinear evolution {{of a variety of}} stratified shear instabilities as well as wave-wave and wave-topography interaction problems having <b>simple</b> <b>profiles.</b> To this effect, we have modified the classical vortex method by extending the Birkhoff-Rott equation to multiple interfaces, and furthermore, have incorporated background shear across a density interface. The latter is more subtle, and originates from the understanding that Bernoulli's equation is not just limited to irrotational flows, but can be modified to make it applicable for piecewise velocity profiles. We have solved diverse problems that can be essentially reduced to the multiple interacting interfaces paradigm, e. g. spilling and plunging breakers, stratified shear instabilities like Holmboe and Taylor-Caulfield, jet flows, and even wave-topography interaction problem like Bragg resonance. Free-slip boundary being a vortex sheet, its effect can also be effectively captured using vortex method. We found that the minimal models capture key nonlinear features, e. g. wave breaking features like cusp formation and roll-ups, which are observed in experiments and/or extensive simulations with smooth, realistic profiles...|$|R
