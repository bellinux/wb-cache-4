5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. Some air forces such as the German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes to suit differing flight conditions such as the skyglow over German cities, or the <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean front.|$|E

5|$|Platinum {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{reactive}} metals. It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, {{but it was not until}} Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.|$|E

In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sands</b> <b>of</b> Time was {{announced}} in March 2003. It was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows. The versions were released gradually between October and November 2003. The various versions had multiple differences in both graphics and control options. The GameCube and Xbox versions included a documentary about {{the making of the}} game. Gameloft developed a version of the game for mobile phones, which released in April 2004. Two versions were developed for higher and lower-spec mobile phones. Connecting the GameCube and Game Boy Advance versions of the game gave access to a port of the original Prince of Persia with the GameCube version, along with the ability for the Prince to automatically regenerate health. The PS2 version was released in Japan in September 2004. The game was published in the region by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, who were impressed by both the quality and the praise it earned in the west. The <b>Sands</b> <b>of</b> Time was later re-released with its two sequels in a Europe-exclusive PlayStation 3 collection on November 19, 2010, which included a 3D display option.|$|E
5|$|The Vana Parva {{book of the}} Mahabharata narrates that an asura (demon) named Dhundhu {{lived under}} the <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> the desert of Ujjalaka, in Marudhanva. Dhundu terrorized the whole world. Upset by Dhundu's action, Uttanka– whose ashram was in Ujjalaka– {{performed}} tapas (austerities) dedicated to Vishnu. Pleased, Vishnu told Uttanka that the Ikshvaku king Kulavalashva would slay the demon. The sage went to the king's palace and recounted Vishnu's prophecy. Kuvalasva and his sons went to the forest and killed the demon. As a result, Kulavalashva became known as Dhundhumara, the slayer of Dhundhu.|$|E

5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, it {{received}} critical acclaim, won and {{was nominated for}} numerous awards, and has been recognized by many {{as one of the}} greatest games of all time. Sales of the title were initially slow, but it eventually became a commercial success. Its success prompted the development of a sequel, , which was released in November 2004. Further games set in the <b>Sands</b> <b>of</b> Time continuity have been developed, and it is generally cited as the reason for the Prince of Persia series' return to fame.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Persia: The <b>Sands</b> <b>of</b> Time is an action-adventure puzzle-platformer. The player {{controls}} the main protagonist, an unnamed Prince from a kingdom in Persia. Environments are seen through a controllable third-person view. The camera's view changes to different positions triggered by entering certain areas or performing actions. The Prince {{can be moved}} in all directions, and {{he is able to}} manipulate large objects such as blocks and levers connected to mechanisms. His health and power metre are represented in the top left-hand corner of the screen. The Prince restores health by drinking water from pools and fountains. Collecting Sands increases the Prince's power, and drinking from hidden magic fountains increases the Prince's maximum health. During several points in the game, the Prince is assisted by his companion Farah, who fires a bow at enemies, though her arrows can also hit the Prince if he strays into her line of fire. Monsters will attack her, and if she is killed, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|The burglar Lady Christina de Souza steals a gold chalice once {{belonging}} to King Æthelstan from a London museum, {{replacing it with}} a maneki neko model, and hops on a 200 bus. The Doctor later joins her and the other passengers, just before the bus passes through a wormhole and ends up on the <b>sands</b> <b>of</b> the planet San Helios. The Doctor studies the wormhole and determines that the bus protected them from its effects like a Faraday cage, and is too late from stopping the driver from stepping back through. When the driver's skeleton appears on Earth, UNIT forces are alerted, led by Captain Erisa Magambo and aided by scientific adviser Malcolm Taylor.|$|E
5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing the <b>Sands</b> <b>of</b> Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} the game's release, the game was {{featured}} in an episode of How It's Made, in a segment dedicated to video game production. The game has been cited as {{the reason why the}} Prince of Persia series, formerly ignored after Prince of Persia 3D, returned to prominence in the gaming world. In 2004, Mechner began work on a , produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The film was eventually released in 2010. The success of the game prompted immediate development on a sequel. Titled , the game was made aesthetically darker by the team. It released in November 2004. Several further sequels set in the continuity of The <b>Sands</b> <b>of</b> Time followed. Aspects of its design, such as the relationship between the Prince and Farah, later provided inspiration for the 2008 series reboot.|$|E

30|$|Behaviour of {{pesticides}} {{in the soil}} environment is also greatly influenced by the soil texture. Sandy soils are known to facilitate leaching whereas the clayey soils help accumulation through colloid formation. The high negative correlation between percentage <b>sand</b> <b>of</b> soil and (p,p′-DDT and beta-HCH) indicates the influence <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> on extractable pesticides in soils. Thus, an increase in percentage <b>sand</b> <b>of</b> soils resulted in a corresponding decrease in p,p′-DDT and beta-HCH and vice versa. Similar studies by Bentum et al. (2006) and Aiyesanmi and Idowu (2012) reported no significant (p >  0.05) correlations between percentage <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> and extractable lindane and propoxur residues, and total organochlorine pesticides measured in soil samples, respectively.|$|R
