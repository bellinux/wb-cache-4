Two defense attorneys, Henry Balaban and Edward J.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} demographic, social and {{organizational}} characteristics of mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment. Many papers analyze these characteristics separately. However, {{according to the}} authors of this article, it is necessary to evaluate a wide context of workplace mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment to determine the factors affecting the occurrence of the phenomenon. The multi-complex approach to the infl uencing conditions is necessary for corporate managers, making preventive and intervention decisions. The research was carried out using the validated questionnaire “The occurrence of mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment in relations between employees” in the private and public sector organizations of Lithuania. 1, 231 respondents, who experienced violence in mutual relations, were surveyed. 867 employees distinguished from the respondents experienced mobbing, and 364 employees experienced <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment. The results of this research explain the spread of mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment in organizations of different sizes and types, its dynamism. They also allow showing that the unmanaged process has a tendency to intensify over time. Two largest risk zones of mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment related to the age and length of service have been highlighted: the fi rst and largest one is a start of professional career; the second is the pre-retirement age. Marital status doesn’t have any statistically signifi cant infl uence on becoming a victim of mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment, although a slightly higher number of victims, who are divorced or haven’t created a family, were found. The relationship between the size of the organization and the occurrence of mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment was found. The position of the victim of harassment and mobbing in the organization is conditioned by systemic causes related to internal conditions determined by the organizational policy. The article presents only a part of the research results. This part of the research allows the formation of socio-demographic view of the victim of mobbing and <b>single</b> <b>cases</b> of harassment in the organization, distinguishing the infl uencing factors under individual characteristics. The research was conducted only in one country, so the data should be tested by the cases of other countries...|$|R

5|$|The first {{indication}} of the franchises' displeasure with their parent over this issue came in 2005 and involved claims by a Manhattan-based franchise that the company failed {{to take into account}} local market conditions when setting prices. E-Z Eating Corp., operator of five restaurants in New York and owned by brother-sister partners Elizabeth and Luan Sadik, had been struggling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but had been in a company-sponsored turn around program when Burger King started its new value program in 2006. The program required all locations to carry a specific set of products at a discounted price, with limited exemptions for certain locations that met a set of criteria. The Sadiks applied for an exemption to the pricing requirement but were turned down by Burger King. In response to the denial, the Sadiks closed two of their locations without consulting Burger King and refused to implement the scheme in their other two locations. Burger King responded by suing the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for breach of contract, and eventually revoked the franchise agreement for the remaining two locations in January 2006. The Sadik's responded by filing their own lawsuit in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that Burger King had engaged in a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair in its actions towards the franchise. The actions were eventually consolidated in a <b>single</b> <b>case</b> in the Southern District Court under Judge Maricia G. Cooke, where Burger King requested and was granted a summary judgement against the Sadiks. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in June 2009.|$|E
5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a {{specific}} case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate {{the separation of powers}} in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. §8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that §8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a <b>single</b> <b>case</b> without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of §8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E
