5|$|Shevchenko, who {{had scored}} the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. He hit his penalty <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> middle of the goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot with his left hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E
5|$|The western slopes fall {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the overall impression of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, but above this is a sense of wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

25|$|Lineouts {{are used}} to restart play when the ball has crossed the sidelines.

25|$|L-shaped ambushes {{included}} {{the most effective}} aspects of both the 'Bloody Nose' and Linear ambush. The short end, or base, of the 'L' was positioned so {{that at least one}} machine gun could fire <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> kill zone, enfilading it. Parallel to the kill zone and tied into the 'L' was a second, flanking ambush.|$|E
25|$|The yorker is {{regarded}} as particularly effective against weak tail-end batsmen, who often lack the skill to defend even a non-swinging yorker and who are sometimes less susceptible to other bowling tactics. It is also particularly effective in the later stages of an innings in one-day cricket, {{because it is the}} most difficult of all deliveries to score off even if defended successfully. Runs will often only be scored off edges or <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
25|$|Elliott made 19 not {{out from}} 20 balls, and {{together}} with Lisa Sthalekar put on 27 from 22 balls before the latter {{fell in the}} penultimate over. The Australians ended at 8/106. In the sixth over, Elliott ran towards the leg side from mid-off and caught Suzie Bates who skied a pull shot from Ellyse Perry <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ground, as New Zealand collapsed to 4/29 in the eighth over. Australia {{went on to win}} by three runs.|$|E

But if they were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> through <b>the</b> depths of the void, like drops of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced anything.|$|R
25|$|To {{break the}} {{connection}} with Yorck, Napoleon ordered a new attack <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> highway by Nansouty with all three of his divisions, Colbert, Desnouettes and Laferrière. This charge broke up some Russian formations, forcing the soldiers to scatter into the Viels-Maisons woods. Vasilshikov's cavalry counterattacked, forcing Nansouty's horsemen back and restoring the link with the Prussians. By this time Meunier's Young Guard division joined Ricard's in the fighting for Marchais on Napoleon's left flank. The French captured Marchais twice before being driven out again when Sacken's 18th Division recaptured the village.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} beam pattern and headlamp construction standards in use in the world: The ECE standard, which is allowed or required in virtually all industrialized countries except the United States, and the SAE standard that is mandatory only in the US. Japan formerly had bespoke lighting regulations similar to the US standards, but for {{the left side of}} the road. However, Japan now adheres to the ECE standard. The differences between the SAE and ECE headlamp standards are primarily in the amount of glare permitted toward other drivers on low beam (SAE permits much more glare), the minimum amount of light required to be thrown <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road (SAE requires more), and the specific locations within the beam at which minimum and maximum light levels are specified.|$|E
25|$|The other effect {{occurred}} when the dish was pointed towards the ground, causing a strong return that produced a sharp return on the display. Due to the circular scanning pattern, the dish would be pointed to the sides when the beam first struck the ground, continuing to strike the ground while the scanner continued rotating until it is pointed down, and then back up until the beam no longer intersects the ground again. Since the beam strikes the ground at a point closer to the aircraft when it is pointed <b>straight</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> returns during this period are closest to the zero ring. When the reflector rotated further to the sides the beam would strike the ground further away and produce blips further from the zero line. Conveniently, the geometry of the situation causes the returns to form a series of straight lines, producing an effect similar to an artificial horizon.|$|E

25|$|He hits many sixes {{long and}} high, favouring <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ground or over midwicket. His {{trademark}} shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his {{risk of getting}} out and {{he is one of}} the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket. This is reflected by the fact that he is the only player to score more than 7,000 ODI runs at an average under 25. Afridi is the only player in the world who has scored 1,000 runs and 50 wickets in the T20 format of the game. Afridi has moved about the batting order, and this lack of consistency has made it difficult for him to settle. In the Indian subcontinent, where the ball quickly loses its shine, he prefers to open the batting; however, elsewhere he prefers to bat at number six.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February {{when the}} British {{surrendered}} at Singapore, the Japanese pincers closed on Java. A fleet of 41 transports originating at Jolo in the Philippines were heading <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Makassar Strait and, after a single stop at Balikpapan, moved {{out across the}} Java Sea. A second fleet, even larger, was coming {{down out of the}} China Sea around the western curve of Borneo against Batavia and Western Java. The men on the bomber fields in Java received the news of Singapore's surrender as forewarning of their own defeat. Attacks were flown against the fleets heading towards Java, but the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Commission credited the Army airplanes of all Allied Air forces in the theater with no more than three minesweepers, four passenger or cargo vessels, and one converted salvage vessel sunk, and a part in the sinking of two other cargo vessels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia were {{dismissed}} for 194 and England {{were reduced to}} 54/5 before Brown came in to top-score with 62 in England's 197. He won the crowd over with this innings, especially when he hit Ian Johnson <b>straight</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ground for six and through the covers for four. He bowled well and took 4/26 as Australia were out for 181, but England could only score 150 as the hosts won by 28 runs to take a 2–0 lead in the series. In the third Test, Brown made his highest Test score of 79 with another defiant innings after England {{had been reduced to}} 137/4. Injuries to Bailey and Doug Wright seriously depleted England's bowling and Brown had to bowl 44 overs to support Bedser and debutant John Warr. He took a commendable 4/153 as Australia totalled 426 before bowling England out again to win the match by an innings and secure the series victory.|$|E
