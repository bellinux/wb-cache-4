A population of persons, > or = 65 years of age and enrolled in municipal long-term care (LTC) in a county in the south of Sweden, was followed regarding changes in oral status and treatment needs for two years. The number of persons examined the year 2002 was 2416 and the corresponding figure for 2004 was 2846. Totally 1170, i. e. 48. 4 %, of those examined 2002 were deceased two years after the initial examination. Only 914, assessed in 2002, were available for assessment with full data at follow up 2004 and the results are based upon assessments in this group. Analyzing the assessed variables (dental status, oral hygiene status, oral mucosal inflammation, oral mucosal friction) revealed a change during these two years. Significant impairments were recognised, regarding mucosal inflammation and mucosal friction. Regarding treatment needs assessed by a dentist and a dental hygienist, there was a maintained and even increased need for extensive treatment, both by the dentist and, to a greater extent, by the dental hygienist. In sum, prevention efforts both from the dental profession and from other care providers are important to achieve and maintain acceptable oral status...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{population}} ageing and shrinking Germany – particularly East Germany – experiences a demographic constellation causing remarkable {{economic and social}} problems. One option {{to cope with the}} demography based challenges is immigration. In a historical part the article firstly illustrates the history of immigration in Germany during the 20 th century and concludes that substantial immigration initially occurred in the 1950 th in the Western part of Germany when the so called “Gastarbeiter” were attracted to the West German labour market. Regions in East Germany, instead, show a rather low share of immigrants – a result of the GDR immigration policy that permitted only a low level of temporary migration. However, prospects of success to stimulate immigration to East Germany seem to be rather limited. Firstly, since 2000 Germany as a whole faces reducing immigration numbers. Secondly, the low immigration experience and density of foreigners’ networks could torpedo existing immigration potentials. The sole opportunity for improving the migration balance seems to be the immigration from Central Eastern European regions. Spatial proximity might compensate for lacking migration incentives and initiate substantial migration flows towards East Germany. Yet, one should not have to high expectation regarding the dimension of immi-gration from Central Eastern Europe. Large parts of the migratory population already moved to other EU member states that implemented the Freedom of Movement for Workers immediately after 2004. Therefore, it seems to be crucial to stay away from every <b>supplementary</b> <b>regulation</b> that might discourage potential labour market migrants from Central East Europe after May 2011. ...|$|R

40|$|POSTER In Germany organic {{stakeholders}} largely {{reject the}} draft of the revised EU Organic regulation. This was evident at a workshop held {{within the framework of}} the ORGAP project, which brought together leading representatives of the organic sector in March 2006. The objective of the workshop was to develop indicators on the evaluation of the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming. The concerns voiced by stakeholders on the revision of the regulation were so strong that we consider it appropriate to i) report them and ii) to put them into perspective as a contribution to further discussion. This is the objective of this poster. MANUSCRIPT FOR THE POSTER PRESENTATION (TRANSLATED AND REVISED FROM [URL] Shortly before Christmas of last year, the Commission of the European Union (EU) published {{the draft of}} a new EU Organic Regulation. This draft proposal, which is intended to replace Council Regulation (EEC) 2092 / 91 and <b>supplementary</b> <b>regulations,</b> has provoked substantial criticism from the German organic sector. Thus the German farmers’ union (Deutscher Bauernverband, DBV) spoke of the “massive undermining of consumer protection” which could result from provisions in the draft. The German Federation of the Organic Food Industry (Bund Ökologische Lebensmittelwirtschaft, BÖLW) as the umbrella organization of organic producers, processors and traders rejects the present draft revision outright. The broad rejection of the draft replacement regulation was confirmed at a workshop held in the framework of the EU ORGAP project, which brought together leading representatives of the German organic sector on March 30, 2006 in Berlin. The ORGAP (Evaluation of the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming) research project is of special interest in connection with the new EU Organic Regulation, since the draft regulation explicitly (and quite unusually) makes specific reference to this project: its results will be drawn upon at a later stage in order to draft the detailed implementation provisions for the regulation. The methodological approach of the ORGAP research project places a very strong emphasis on stakeholder integration. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to its rapidly developing economy, China's accounting standards have evolved {{dramatically over the}} last two decades, from an old-fashioned Soviet-style fund-based accounting model towards current International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). To investigate the impact of the evolution of the earnings quality of listed companies in China, three testable historical accounting regimes have been identified, namely: (1) the uniform period (1993 - 1997); (2) the harmonisation period (1998 - 2006); and (3) the convergence period (2007 -to present). Earnings quality under these three regimes is measured for three sets of attributes: (a) time-series attributes, which include, persistence, predictability and smoothness; (b) accrual-based attributes, which include, accrual quality and earnings management and (c) market-based attributes, which include, value relevance, conditional conservatism and timeliness. Using a sample of 23, 573 firm-year observations of 2, 393 firms for the period 1993 to 2010, twelve measures of these eight earnings quality attributes are regressed on three accounting regime dummy variables while controlling for other company specific characteristics. The results are mixed indicating that the evolution of accounting in China has not necessarily improved all aspects of earnings quality, at least not at the same time, which is consistent with the expectation that the evolution of Chinese accounting will improve certain aspects of earnings quality while exerting less impact on others. In addition, the impact occurs gradually with the issuance of <b>supplementary</b> <b>regulations</b> and the development of the accounting profession. Specifically, accounting evolution seems to have no obvious impact on persistence and smoothness of operating earnings although a reduction in earnings predictability is observed. The convergence period had more scaled accruals and discretionary accruals but a smaller absolute value of discretionary accruals. Although earnings relevance declined over time, this was not due to the change in accounting standards. The harmonisation period shows the highest level of conditional conservatism which accords with expectation. Finally, accounting evolution does not seem to improve the timeliness with which contemporaneous stock information is incorporated into earnings...|$|R

Such a finding is not contrary to the longstanding rule that this Court will not infer pre-emption of the States' historic police powers absent a clear statement of intent by Congress.

40|$|Electric Vehicles (EVs) are {{promising}} to provide frequency regulation services {{due to their}} fast regulating characteristics. However, when EVs participate in <b>Supplementary</b> Frequency <b>Regulation</b> (SFR), {{it is challenging to}} simultaneously achieve the dispatch of the control center and the expected State of Charge (SOC) levels of EV batteries. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) control strategy, in which an uncertain dispatch is implemented in the control center without detailed EV charging/discharging information. The regulation from the control center is achieved by allocating the regulation task within the frequency regulation capacity (FRC) of EVs. The expected SOC levels of EV batteries are guaranteed by a real-time correction of their scheduled V 2 G power in EV charging stations. Simulations on an interconnected two-area power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed V 2 G control in achieving both the frequency regulation and the expected SOC levels of EVs.

40|$|The mirror-image {{theory of}} {{cooperative}} state enforcement of federal immigration {{law is a}} phenomenon—one of the most wildly successful legal ideas in decades. The mirror-image theory proposes that states can enact and enforce criminal immigration laws {{that are based on}} federal statutes. The theory that it is unobjectionable for a state to carry out federal policy is the basis of Arizona’s Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act—better known as SB 1070 —and similar laws enacted in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, and Utah. The same theory has provoked the introduction of bills in numerous other states and earlier but more narrowly focused immigration laws already in force in seven states. The mirror-image theory has succeeded not only in legislatures but also in the larger political culture: it has been embraced by dozens of U. S. senators and representatives, by policy groups, by private citizens, and by commentators including George Will, Sarah Palin, and the editors of the New York Post and the Washington Times. The mirror-image theory is indeed appealing. But it is also fundamentally flawed. This Article, the first to subject the mirror-image theory to sustained scholarly scrutiny, demonstrates that the mirror-image theory fails to identify a legitimate source of state authority to legislate on immigration matters. No one denies that Congress and the federal executive have exclusive authority over the substance and procedure of the admission, exclusion, and removal of noncitizens, documented and undocumented. This proposition was firmly established by a pair of Supreme Court decisions from 1876. The mirror-image theory does not challenge this deep-rooted idea head-on, but instead proposes that state legislative authority over immigration flows from federal cases and the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorize states to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law. Those sources, however, contemplate state assistance with enforcement only through arrests, and arrest authority does not imply the power to legislate or to prosecute. To the contrary, other provisions of the INA clarify that federal agencies have the exclusive power to make prosecutorial and administrative decisions after an arrest, as well as to create <b>supplementary</b> <b>regulations.</b> The mirror-image theory rests on the erroneous premise that Congress has implicitly authorized state enforcement of federal immigration law. This Article argues that state enforcement would be unconstitutional even if it were explicitly authorized by Congress. First, the federal immigration power is exclusive and nondelegable. Second, criminal prosecution and immigration enforcement are executive powers that Congress cannot remove from the president and share with non-executive-branch officials. Finally, the Supreme Court has held that states cannot prosecute crimes that affect only the sovereign interests of the United States. Accordingly, state immigration prosecutions are irremediably unconstitutional...|$|R
