5|$|The Shinano River system, {{particularly}} in its upper reaches (Chikuma River) {{and in the}} Sai basin, is used for hydroelectric power generation due to the <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> in its upper reaches and its high discharge producing, as a whole, 2,618 megawatts. While the construction of hydroelectric power stations began before World War II, it significantly increased following the war. These power plants, such as the Shimofanato Power Station and the 450,000 kilowatt JR East Shinano River Hydropower Station near Ojiya, supply Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
5|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had further doubled to 10,104. The {{early twentieth century}} saw a period of increased urbanization of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and sewerage, were completed. The <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively <b>steep</b> <b>gradient,</b> it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E
25|$|The Torpoint ferry {{had been}} in {{operation}} since at least 1834, having been developed by J M Rendel. Moorsom appears not to have given much thought to the practicalities of using the crossing, which would have involved through trains being divided and each portion then being propelled down a very <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> onto the ferry boat; and each portion being hauled up a <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> and re-formed on the other side.|$|E

30|$|Pore-dominated porosity: From Fig.  10, it is {{apparent}} that increasing confining pressure has little effect on the permeability {{for the majority of the}} samples.

The mixed microstructure samples show a <b>steeper</b> <b>gradient</b> than the pore-dominated samples.|$|R

25|$|The tunnel's small {{diameter}} {{combined with}} the <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> (1:49) to cause smoke accumulation. Incidents involving near-asphyxiation of train crews started in 1896, and continued throughout the tunnel's operating life. The first serious incident of this nature was in 1903.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the road}} is a two-lane single {{carriageway}} with a lane width of 3.5m and shoulder width of 2.5m.

25|$|The three-wire {{system was}} adopted because the initial system was fed {{directly}} from the dynamos in the surface power plant at the Stockwell end of the line.

25|$|The Lapstone Zig Zag {{became a}} {{bottleneck}} because, among other reasons, {{the length of}} the top and bottom roads restricted train lengths. A single-track tunnel was built in 1892 to replace the zig zag. However, this tunnel was on a <b>steep</b> <b>gradient,</b> with a ruling grade of 1 in 33, which caused problems with the smoke from hard-working locomotives. These problems pre-dated the fume problems with the first Cascade Tunnel {{on the opposite side of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|The Trunk Line was {{completed}} in 1854, followed by the Østfold Line in 1879. By the 1870s there was sufficient traffic on the Trunk Line that the Norwegian Trunk Railway was considering building double track along it. The economic decline throughout the 1880s put these plans on hold. Parliament decided in 1897 that the Gjøvik Line's freight trains would be handled at Loenga. This made it necessary for a separate freight track to be built through Loelvdalen. Surveys for a suitable place for cargo handling soon found that the <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> {{made it impossible to}} locate a cargo facility fore Alna.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{are major}} point sources of {{sediment}} {{contribution to the}} coastal sedimentary budget, this being particularly true of coasts with a <b>steep</b> <b>gradient,</b> where rivers directly dump their sediments at the coast. Coasts with a low gradient may lose river sediment to estuaries. Sediment delivery to the shoreline can be very intermittent mostly occurring during floods {{with the increase in}} flow typically creating an increase in sediment supplied to the coast. Some rivers are referred to as ‘large’ because they produce high amounts of sediment for which to nourish the coastal environment. For example, the Waimakariri River on the coast of Canterbury, New Zealand produces 77% of sediment supplied to the Pegasus Bay coastline. This is not always the case with some rivers referred to as ‘small’ because they struggle to supply enough sediment to keep their coastlines from eroding, for example, the Rakaia River South of Banks Peninsula in Canterbury, New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{embryonic}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (eCSF), SCO-spondin is of the uttermost importance {{in the development of}} the neuronal system, being a key protein in the balancing of differentiation and proliferation of the neuroepithelium. It starts being secreted by the diencephalic floor plate in the first embryonic stages playing an important part in the development and differentiation of structures such as the pineal gland. In particular, the SCO-spondin appears to have a major role on the growth of the posterior commissure (PC), which was proved when mutants lacking SCO, and hence had no SCO-spondin, where unable to form a functional PC. On early stages of development the axonal growth is stimulated, being inhibited afterwards. A <b>steep</b> <b>gradient</b> of spondin expression in the neuroepithelium signals the need for different processes to take place, favoring the fasciculation on the cephalic region and the incorporation of new neurons on the caudal region. As such, the lower concentrations of SCO-spondin in the caudal region favor the axonal outgrowth and incorporation of new axons on the posterior commissure and the higher concentrations in the cephalic region promotes the interactions between the neighboring axons. In conjugation with the secretion of SCO-spondin, the midline positioning of the SCO assumes a great importance on the axon guidance process. This positioning facilitates the signaling of the turning points for the axons, through the spreading of spondin.|$|E
