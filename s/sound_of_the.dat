5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Although Coming Up to Breathe {{possesses}} {{an overall}} heavier tone than MercyMe's previous albums, {{it has been}} described as an extension or a shift in presentation rather than a total departure. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album {{has been described as}} epitomizing the genre of modern rock. Guitars and guitar solos are more prominent on the album.|$|E

5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, {{to the extent that}} the Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in {{quality to the}} human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., {{and by the time}} of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E

5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bell {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E

They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
