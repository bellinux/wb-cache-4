40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of revegetation in providing habitat for fauna {{is expected to}} be determined both by within-site factors and attributes of the landscape in which a revegetation site occurs. Most studies of fauna in revegetation have been conducted in landscapes that have been extensively cleared, modified or fragmented, and in Australia, predominantly in the southern temperate zone. We investigated how within-site vegetation attributes and landscape context attributes were related to bird species richness and composition in a chronosequence of post-mining <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>sites</b> within an otherwise intact landscape in tropical northern Australia. Our working hypothesis was that bird species richness in rehabilitating sites would be positively related to site vegetation structure and landscape context including (1) proximity to woodland and (2) the proportion of woodland within a 500 -m buffer of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>sites.</b> Within each of 67 sites, we sampled vegetation once and surveyed for birds eight times over 16 ?months. Landscape context variables were calculated using GIS. There were large differences between bird assemblages of woodland and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>sites</b> and between age classes of rehabilitation. Bird assemblages were strongly related to site vegetation attributes across all <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>sites.</b> Proximity to woodland was only related to bird assemblages in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>sites</b> older than 4 ?years old. We conclude that the relative importance of landscape context and site variables at any point in time will be a function of how closely vegetation within the revegetation site matches the habitat resource requirements of individual species.

40|$|Survival {{and growth}} of first-year {{seedlings}} of the broad-leaved Banksia hookeriana and B. attenuata were lower in the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>site</b> than in two contrasting natural areas, but the needle-leaved B. leptophylla survived and grew equally well in all three sites. Root system development was poorer in the rehabilitation site: tap-roots stopped at the topsoil/subsoil boundary at 0. 1 m in the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>site,</b> while they reached 2 m at the natural sites. Seedlings in the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>site</b> had much lower pre-dawn xylem pressure potentials (XPP) and stomatal conductance. Soil water potentials (ψ) in the top 0. 5 m of the soil profile were generally lowest at the natural sites, and almost always lower than XPP. At these sites, seedlings must have been obtaining water over summer-autumn from deeper in the soil via their well-developed tap-roots. Topsoil ψ in the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>site</b> was more similar to XPP than the much higher values in the subsoils, which rarely contained roots. Impedance of the rehabilitation soils, significantly greater than that for soils at the two natural sites, appeared to explain the poor root development and dependence of seedlings on soil water stored near the surface; the consequent lower xylem potentials, stomatal conductances and growth rates; and the ultimately higher mortality levels...|$|R

40|$|Aggregate {{extraction}} {{has been}} identified {{as one of the most}} contentious land-uses in Southern Ontario. The siting or expansion of aggregate operations is often met with vehement debate from concerned members of the public, local municipalities, and additional parties who have various reasons to be opposed to aggregate extraction operations. “Aggregate wars” have now become a common planning challenge in a number of aggregate rich municipalities in Ontario. Due to a legacy of poor rehabilitation practices, aggregate <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> {{has been identified}} as one of the most serious problems plaguing pit and quarry developments. Aggregate <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> plays and essential role in preparing the land for its sequential land-use and is the primary mechanism for the mitigation of adverse environmental and social impacts caused by the extraction process. Using a mixed-methods research approach, this study aimed to determine the rate and quality of aggregate <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> occurring in Ontario for the time period of 1992 - 2011. This was completed using an assessment of production statistics and a sample of rehabilitation plans. In addition, interviews with representatives from key actor groups were conducted to strengthen the base for evaluating the effectiveness of the current policy framework to ensure the adequate rehabilitation of aggregate sites. Results from this study indicate that progressive rehabilitation efforts are falling short and a net gain in disturbed land is occurring each year. More research, in the form of field studies and long-term monitoring initiatives, is needed to permit a better assessment of the quality of rehabilitation occurring. Findings from this study illustrate that the current rate of aggregate <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> occurring in Ontario is not enough to moderate adverse environmental and social impacts. Changes are needed to the current policy framework in order to address this problem. Four policy recommendations are suggested: to set a maximum for disturbed areas at operating aggregate sites, to re-implement a security deposit type model, to introduce citizen advisory committees in the aggregate site management process, and to tie site and rehabilitation plans to predetermined timelines. An analysis of aggregate <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> prior to 1992 requires further researc...|$|E

40|$|Mine <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> {{generally}} aims {{to produce}} a safe, stable and non polluting post-mining landscape that serves some agreed post-mining land use. Historically, the presumed post-mining land use has generally driven the rehabilitation process, often {{regardless of whether the}} adopted land use matches the pre-mining land use or is achievable. This dictates the flattening of the mine waste landform and the choice of surface cover applied. In the past, the adopted post-mining land use has often been grazing, which dictates that steep (usually angle of repose) mine waste slopes be flattened substantially, and that the surface be topsoiled and grassed. The tops of surface dumps and tailings surfaces often require reshaping to enhance surface drainage or water management prior to capping, topsoiling and grassing. The outer slopes of waste dumps and tailings storage facilities are generally flattened to allow access for equipment, topsoiling and grassing, possibly with the aim of allowing grazing. Even where grazing is not to be the post-mining land use, slope flattening, topsoiling, and grassing are often adopted. Whether or not grazing is the adopted post-mining land use, it may not be utilised, and a grass cover may be difficult to establish and even more difficult to sustain. Further, the limited extent to which steep mine waste slopes can be flattened generally results in slope angles that are still too steep for grazing use, and are prone to erosion, particularly if covered with topsoil and the grass cover is inadequate. This historical approach to mine <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> has led to repeated failures of flattened, topsoiled and grassed steep mine waste slopes and of regraded, capped, topsoiled and grassed dump tops and tailings. Increasingly, the establishment and sustainability of ecological functionality is seen as the key to achieving a safe, stable, and non-polluting post-mining landscape. Hence, it is argued that ecological function should be the preferred driver of mine <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> over the post-mining land use, since it better addresses the accepted rehabilitation aims. The paper presents a history of the conventional approach to mine <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> governed by slope flattening, topsoiling and grass covers, illustrated with global examples of mine <b>site</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> failures due to the adoption of those practices. These include examples from gold mining in Johannesburg, surface coal mining in Australia, and metalliferous mining in Australia, and focusses on the rehabilitation of steep mine slopes in tailings, spoil or waste rock...|$|E
