5|$|By January 1919, the {{regiment}} were <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> return home, and had begun education courses, continuation training and playing sports. This occupied them until March when a revolt {{broke out in}} Egypt, and {{the regiment}} drew its equipment back out of storage {{and headed for the}} Nile Delta. Posted to Quesna, all of the regiment's squadrons, except the 9th which went to Cairo, began policing the riots and trying to stop looting. Once the rioting had been quelled, the regiment once again waited to return home. Their return finally began on 30 June 1919, when the majority of the brigade left the Suez Canal for New Zealand and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment ceased to be a unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the attack, Major Ormsby advanced from Fort Erie to Frenchman’s Creek with his 80 men of the 49th Regiment, where he was joined by Lieutenant McIntyre’s 70 light infantrymen, Major Hatt’s Lincoln Militia and some British-allied Native Americans under Major Givins. Finding that Boerstler’s invaders had already gone, and being unable to determine any other enemy presence in the pitch dark, Ormsby’s 300 men remained in position until daybreak, when Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp arrived from Fort Erie. Bisshopp led the force to the Red House, where they found Captain King and his men <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be evacuated. Outnumbered by ten-to-one, King surrendered.|$|E
5|$|By August the {{division}} was <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be deployed, but now plans envisioned {{using them as}} part of a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved {{the division}}, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, to close the gap between Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E

25|$|Originally, a master's mate was an {{experienced}} petty officer, who assisted the master, {{but was not}} in line for promotion to lieutenant. By the mid-eighteenth century, he was {{far more likely to}} be a superior midshipman, <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> pass his examination for lieutenant or to receive his commission, but taking rather more responsibility aboard ship. Six master's mates were allowed on a first rate, three on a third rate, and two on most frigates.|$|E

25|$|Smith-Dorrien later {{recorded}} that French inflicted “pin-pricks” on {{him from}} February 1915 onwards, including {{the removal of}} Forestier-Walker as his Chief of Staff. This was supposedly {{on the grounds that}} Forestier-Walker was needed to command a division training in England, although two months later he was <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> receive the command. French told Haig that Smith-Dorrien was “a weak spot” (5 February 1915). During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle he was dissatisfied (13 March) at the “lack of determination” of Smith-Dorrien's diversionary attacks. Smith-Dorrien was not always immune to the excessive optimism which British officers were expected to display throughout the war: Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary (15 March 1915) that prior to the battle Smith-Dorrien had been claiming that the war would be won in March 1915. However, French complained to Kitchener (Secretary of State for War) about him (28 March).|$|E
25|$|In Spanish art, a bodegón is a still-life {{painting}} depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often {{arranged on}} a simple stone slab, and also a painting {{with one or more}} figures, but significant still-life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain {{in the second quarter of}} the 17th century. The tradition of still-life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres; the breakfast piece was augmented by the trompe-l'œil, the flower bouquet, and the vanitas. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of breakfast piece did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Still-life painting in Spain, also called bodegones, was austere. It differed from Dutch still life, which often contained rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items of fabric or glass. The game in Spanish paintings is often plain dead animals <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air. Even while both Dutch and Spanish still life often had an embedded moral purpose, the austerity, which some find akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, appears to reject the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of Dutch still-life paintings.|$|E
500|$|Soult marched {{away before}} dawn on 18 May, leaving several hundred wounded behind for the Allies to treat and Beresford, despite a large {{advantage}} in numbers and a day's rest, was nevertheless unable to pursue.

The chapel at Albuera was filled with wounded Frenchmen, and the dead still lay scattered across the ground. [...] In proportion to the numbers involved, the Battle of Albuera was the bloodiest of the whole Peninsular War.|$|E

When they are taken to see him, Regina (Zoë Bell) jumps {{off the side of the}} ship, having wrapped herself in chains, but Gault dismisses it as [...] "a {{heightened}} case of cabin fever", and asserts that losing her is better than losing several more in saving her. He says that he is employed by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's girlfriend's father, and later takes them into his cabin, and tells that [...] Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) faked the plane crash by expending tremendous resources in the process and procured 324 dead bodies to make everybody believe that all the passengers were dead. Gault proceeds by saying that is one of the reasons why Mr. Widmore is keen on finding Benjamin Linus [...] and the island. After their meeting, Desmond and Sayid are relocated to a different part of the ship, where they meet Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) working as a deckhand under the alias [...] "Kevin Johnson".|$|E

500|$|Darwin's {{position}} as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset George Peacock had advised that [...] "The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am inclined {{to think that it}} would be granted". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant to be on the Admiralty's books for [...] until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first Beagle voyage were <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be described. Beaufort assured him that he [...] "should have no difficulty" [...] as long as he [...] "presented them to some public body" [...] such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the [...] "largest & most central collection", not the [...] Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge, but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum.|$|E

2500|$|By March 2011, Arizona-like bills {{had been}} {{defeated}} or {{had failed to}} progress in at least six states and momentum had shifted against such imitative efforts. [...] Reasons ranged from opposition from business leaders to fear among legislators of the legal costs of defending any adopted measure. [...] One state that did pass a law based partly on SB1070, Utah, combined it with a guest worker program that went {{in the other direction}} (and fit into the spirit of the Utah Compact). Even in Arizona itself, additional tough measures against illegal immigration were having a difficult time gaining passage in the Arizona Senate. [...] Other states were <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> see what the outcome of the legal battles would be. [...] By September 2011, Indiana, Georgia, and South Carolina had passed somewhat similar measures and were facing legal action. [...] Another anti-illegal immigration measure, Alabama HB 56, was considered tougher even than SB1070; it was signed into law in June 2011.
