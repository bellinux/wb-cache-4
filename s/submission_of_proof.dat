50|$|Once {{publishers}} {{learned of}} the provisions, the repressive measure encountered strong opposition. All the native associations irrespective of religion, caste and creed denounced the measure and kept their protests alive. All the prominent leaders of Bengal and India condemned the Act as unwarranted and unjustified, and demanded its immediate withdrawal. The newspapers themselves kept criticizing the measure without end. The succeeding administration of Lord Ripon reviewed the developments consequent upon the Act and finally withdrew it. However, the resentment it produced among Indians helped fuel India’s growing independence movement. The Indian Association, which is {{generally considered to be}} one of the precursors of the Indian National Congress, was one of the Act's biggest critics. The crucial demand for a judicial trial in case of an accusation of sedition against an editor was never conceded by the government, although in October I878 the act was modified in minor respect; the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>proofs</b> before publication was no longer insisted upon, although the bail-bond remained.|$|R

40|$|Two {{weeks after}} the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> the {{corrected}} <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> the article by García et al.

This error, though not af-fecting the equations and coefficients presented in the article, resulted in the wrong curves of the mentioned models (Figs. 6 – 10). We immediately sent the corrections to the compositor, Apex Publishing, but the corrected figures {{were not included in the}} published article. Considering that the coefficients and equations pub-lished were correct, we decided not to send an erratum.

40|$|Obtaining {{accurate}} Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitters (TX) {{is critical}} to many cooperation schemes such as Network MIMO, Interference Alignment etc. Practical CSI feedback and limited backhaul-based sharing inevitably creates degradations of CSI which are specific to each TX, giving rise to a distributed form of CSI. In the Distributed CSI (D-CSI) broadcast channel setting, the various TXs design elements of the precoder based on their individual estimates of the global multiuser channel matrix, which intuitively degrades performance {{when compared with the}} commonly used centralized CSI assumption. This paper tackles this challenging scenario and presents a first analysis of the rate performance for the distributed CSI multi-TX broadcast channel setting, in the large number of antenna regime. Using Random Matrix Theory (RMT) tools, we derive deterministic equivalents of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) for the popular regularized Zero-Forcing (ZF) precoder, allowing to unveil the price of distributedness for such cooperation methods.
