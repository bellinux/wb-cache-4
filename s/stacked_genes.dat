This review discusses {{the current status of}} insect resistant transgenic crops and the often raised concern that its resilience is limited and that its efficacy will be compromised by insect resistance. We consider this trait as it is currently deployed in fields across the world as well as potential candidates that are at various stages of development along the pathway between the laboratory and deregulation. Future trends and prospects for biotechnological applications to mediate crop protection against insects are also considered. These include strategies employing <b>stacked</b> <b>genes,</b> modified Bt toxins, vegetative insecticidal proteins, lectins, endogenous resistance mechanisms as well as novel approaches. In addition, the benefits and risks associated with the adoption of GM insect resistant crops, especially for developing countries and resource-poor smallholder farmers are also discussed...|$|E

The environmental and cost efficiency of pesticide use is assessed by means of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the external effects of pesticide are quantified by means of the pesticide leaching potential. The data are from a survey of cotton growers in North Carolina, USA. Substantial heterogeneity is found in technical, environmental performance and in costs among the cotton growers in the sample.

This PhD study evaluated the expression of stacked Hrap (hypersensitive response assisting protein) and Pflp (plant ferredoxin like protein) genes to possibly provide higher resistance to Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm) compared to single gene expression. An expression plasmid vector having stacked Pflp and Hrap genes under control of a constitutive CaMV 35 s promoter was constructed using PCR cloning and restriction enzymes analysis. This plasmid vector was used to transform embryogenic cells using Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation system and transgenic plants of banana cultivars Gonja manjaya and Sukali ndiizi were generated. Twenty one soil potted transgenic lines each of <b>stacked</b> <b>genes</b> {{as well as of}} the single Hrap or Pflp were artificially inoculated with Xcm and evaluated for resistance to BXW under screen house conditions. From inoculated plants, 28. 6 % of single Hrap lines, 19. 1 % of single Pflp lines and 33. 3 % of stacked lines had no disease symptoms and were completely resistant to BXW. Partial resistance was observed in 28. 6 % of single Hrap lines, 33. 3 % of single Pflp lines and 28. 6 % of stacked lines with only inoculated leaf showing symptoms. All non-transgenic control lines were susceptible and wilted completely. Also lesion length and chlorotic area were significantly smaller in all transgenic plants in comparison to non-transgenic control plants. However, no significant difference in lesion length and chlorotic area was observed transgenic lines with single Hrap and Pflp transgenes in comparison to lines <b>stacked</b> <b>genes.</b> Histochemical staining and calorimetric assays further confirmed higher hydrogen peroxide accumulation after Xcm infection in all transgenic plants which was related with increased transcription of NPR 1 genes. NPR 1 gene induction was also associated with transcription of PR 1, PR 3 and GST genes in transgenic banana lines. However, PR 1 gene transcription was significantly lower in all transgenic lines than in the non-transgenic control plants. In contrast, transcription of PR 3 gene, and also of a gene coding for GST, was higher in all transgenic lines than the non-transgenic control after Xcm infection. Hrap and Pflp transgene expression thereby shifted the pathogen response to a response normally expected for a necrotrophic pathogen. Overall, this study has provided evidence that stacked expression of Hrap and Pflp genes in transgenic banana lines did not have higher or additive resistance levels to Xcm compared to single genes. Future field studies should be carried out to demonstrate if developed transgenic lines expressing stacked transgenes have durable resistance to Xcm compared to lines expressing a single transgene.

40|$|Biotechnology {{has been}} widely adopted in {{agriculture}} but this has been also the focus of many controversies. Questions have arisen regarding its impact on food and environmental safety. In Europe, EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) has primary responsibility in the food safety ensuring systems. Food safety assessment for the products obtained with or containing GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms), requires evaluation of the safety of: the newly added DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid); {{the safety of the}} newly introduced gene product and the overall safety issues for new varieties crops that are potential toxicity of the newly introduced protein(s), potential changes in allergenicity, changes in nutrient composition, and unintended effects giving rise to allergenicity or toxicity. An issue that will gain importance in the near future is that of post-marketing surveillance of the foods derived from GM crops. As more GMOs enter the market worldwide, the monitoring is being preferred for obvious reasons such as determination of seed purity, verification of non-GMO status of agricultural crops and liability problems and to fulfill GMO labelling provisions. Numerous GMO analytical methods have been developed to reliably determine the presence and/or amount of GMO in agricultural commodities, in raw agricultural materials and in processed and refined ingredients. However, these methods need to be constantly updated because of the increasing use of newly developed traits or GMOs with <b>stacked</b> <b>genes.</b> The detection of GMOs relies on the detection of transgenic DNA or the transgenic protein. The methodologies for transgenic DNA detection are mainly based on the use of PCRbased (Polymerase Chain Reaction-based) techniques in particular, RTPCR (realtime PCR) is the most effective method for GMO quantification. The study discusses the development of multiplex real-time PCR methodologies to an easy applicable GMO analysis in model processed foods. The first chapter describes the development of duplex qRTPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) method for simultaneous detection and quantification of RRS (Roundup® Ready Soybean) line GTS 40 - 3 - 2 (Glyphosate Tolerant Soybean 40 - 3 - 2) targeting the junction region within the CP 4 -EPSPS / t-NOS (5 - enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase/ Terminator nopaline synthase). The study is focused on the evaluation of the performance per se in determining and quantifying GM event in processed foods. This technique uses the fluorescent dye labelled TaqMan® MGB-NFQ (Minor Groove Binder - Non Fluorescent Quencher) chemistry that is specifically designed to help improve the performance of hybridization-based systems for genetic analysis. This method has the advantage of performing the amplification of the target taxon lectin gene (Le 1) and the constructspecific genes of a GM soybean sequenced in the same tube. The second chapter focuses on the development of simultaneous amplification of two GM lines. This methodology will become practical especially in the determination of newly developed GM lines harboring <b>stacked</b> <b>genes.</b> The performance of the system has been evaluated using different endogenous control genes as well as the applicability of the developed multiplex methodology using SYBR® GreenER™ technique in the hope of developing a quantitative approach more handy than the classical real-time TaqMan® technology...|$|E

Different methods of production of <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> traits, {{as well as the}} status of their cultivation and approval, are reviewed.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays L) is {{a staple}} food crop grown in South Africa by both large scale {{commercial}} and smallholder farmers. During the 2013 / 14 cropping season maize occupied about 2. 6 million hectares {{of the total}} 3. 9 million hectares of arable land that was under field crops in South Africa. Maize accounted for about 12. 4 million tonnes of the 14. 4 million tonnes of all field crops produced. Excessive competition from weeds is a major constraint, reducing maize yield and farmer income. Resource poor and inexperienced emerging farmers who have acquired land through the government land redistribution programmes are particularly affected. To date about 5. 7 million hectares of land have been transferred to about 4. 2 million black (previously disadvantaged) emerging farmers. Although emerging farmers have several options available for weed control, these {{still need to be}} appraised with regards to benefits, in the form of grain yield measured against the cost of weed management. An on-farm study was carried out at two sites in the North West province of South Africa during the 2011 / 12 and 2013 / 14 cropping seasons. The objectives were:- ? To determine the effect of different weed control methods on maize yields of emerging farmers at two localities in the North West province. ? To identify the most competitive or problematic weed species at two localities in the North West province. ? To compare the economic benefit of different weed control methods at the two localities. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot randomised block design. A <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> (stalk borer and herbicides resistance) and a conventional maize cultivar were planted in strips. Eight weed control methods that included hand-weeding, mechanical, chemical (herbicides) and combinations of these methods were randomly allocated across the strips. Weed species were counted and crop heights were recorded at three and eight weeks after crop emergence (WACE). Weed dry biomass was also determined. Grain yield and the yield components of ear mass and 100 kernels mass were recorded. A cost-benefit analysis of these weed control methods was carried out in the context of total production costs. The highest maize grain yields were obtained, where weed competitive effects were satisfactorily suppressed. The clean field and pre- and post-emergence herbicides methods produced the highest grain yields in the two seasons. In the first season the highest grain yields obtained were 73 % higher than the lowest yield in no-weeding method for both cultivars. The second season was characterized by below average and erratic rainfall. The <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivar outperformed the conventional cultivar by 63 % where weeds were effectively controlled. Weed competition seemed to cancel the superiority of the <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivar over the conventional cultivar in a drier season. The cost-benefit analysis revealed that a single cultivation operation at six WACE was the cheapest method, costing only R 495 ha- 1 irrespective of the cultivar used. Keeping a clean field throughout the season was the most costly endeavour, at R 2 528 ha- 1 and R 2 174 ha- 1 for the conventional and the <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivar respectively. The use of both pre- and post-emergence herbicides on <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivars can provide farmers with a return of up to R 2. 60 for every R 1 invested. Controlling weeds in a conventional maize cultivar, using tractor-drawn cultivator at six WACE, can give a return of up to R 1. 64 for every R 1 invested. The weed control methods that provide the highest grain yields are not necessarily the most cost effective. It is preliminarily recommended that chemical weed control methods be considered if <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivars are to be planted. However, mechanical weed control methods must be considered when planting conventional cultivars. The present study needs to be intensified, covering a wider geographical extent, to cater for variation that can be expected as a result of differences in climate, soil type and weed spectra.

Producers are using varieties that have glyphosate resistant and Bt genes incorporated into them. Seeds having these characteristics allow greater control of weeds as well as lessening the need for foliar applications of insecticides. Methods of Production and Costs: There are several methods of cotton production from which producers can choose in Tennessee.

These diagnostic techniques are mainly divided into two major groups, i. e., identification of transgenic (1) DNA and (2) proteins from GMOs and their products. Conventional methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were routinely employed for DNA and protein based quantification respectively. Although, these Techniques (PCR and ELISA) are considered as significantly convenient and productive, but there is need for more advance technologies that allow for high throughput detection and the quantification of GM event as the production of more complex GMO is increasing day by day.

Transgenic banana plants, cv. “Gonja manjaya,” expressing stacked hypersensitive response-assisting protein gene (HRAP) and the plant ferredoxin-like protein gene (PFLP) were evaluated for resistance against BXW in comparison to transgenic lines having single gene. Transgenic lines with <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> as well as single gene had higher resistance to the pathogen than non-transgenic control plants indicated by either no symptom development or delayed symptoms for completely and partially resistant plants, respectively.

Fiber properties, which dictate price discounts, are determined by maturity, diameter and length, as well as by physiological activity at the cellular level.

Field experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in Burleson County, Texas to assess the effects of plant density on lint yield and fiber quality. Experimental design was a spit-plot design with four replications of three cultivars (SG 215 BG/RR, DP 555 BG/RR, ST 4892 BG/RR) in densities ranging from 74 to 222 thousand plants hectare- 1.

40|$|Introduction of {{resistance}} genes from wild Solanum species into potato cultivars {{is considered the}} most promising and environmentally safe approach to achieve late blight resistance. An R-gene stacking breeding program using cisgenesis is planning to trial its products in China. To adapt this approach to local conditions, we propose to assess the allelic diversity of known avirulent genes of P. infestans from the intended introduction regions of the GM-potatoes in China. So far, we have a large (~ 100 isolates) and geographically diverse collection of P. infestans. We measured diversity in the isolates based on sequences and functions of several known Avr genes. The work relied on molecular and modern computer tools to examine {{the dynamics of the}} pathogen population structure and evolutionary relationships among different genotypes. We aim to give an ecological assessment of the Chinese population of P. infestans, which would be a guideline for the release of cisgenetic plants with <b>stacked</b> R <b>gene...</b>|$|R
40|$|Massive {{resistance}} (R) <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising approaches to provide durable resistance to potato late blight for both conventional and genetically modified breeding strategies. The R 3 complex locus on chromosome XI in potato is an example of natural R <b>gene</b> <b>stacking,</b> because it contains two closely linked R genes (R 3 a and R 3 b) with distinct resistance specificities to Phytophthora infestans. Here, we report about the positional cloning of R 3 b. Both transient and stable transformations of susceptible tobacco and potato plants showed that R 3 b conferred full resistance to incompatible P infestans isolates. R 3 b encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat protein and exhibits 82 % nucleotide identity with R 3 a located in the same R 3 cluster. The R 3 b gene specifically recognizes Avr 3 b, a newly identified avirulence factor from P. infestans. R 3 b does not recognize Avr 3 a, the corresponding avirulence gene for R 3 a, showing that, despite their high sequence similarity, R 3 b and R 3 a have clearly distinct recognition specificities. In addition to the Rpi-mcd 1 /Rpi-blb 3 locus on chromosome IV, the R 3 locus on chromosome XI is the second example of an R-gene cluster with multiple genes recognizing different races of P. infestans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Crown gall (CG) (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) and {{the root}} lesion {{nematodes}} (RLNs) (Pratylenchus vulnus) are major {{challenges faced by}} the California walnut industry, reducing productivity and increasing the cost of establishing and maintaining orchards. Current nematode control strategies include nematicides, crop rotation, and tolerant cultivars, but these methods have limits. Developing genetic resistance through novel approaches like RNA interference (RNAi) can address these problems. RNAi-mediated silencing of CG disease in walnut (Juglans regia L.) has been achieved previously. We sought to place both CG and nematode resistance into a single walnut rootstock genotype using co-transformation to <b>stack</b> the resistance <b>genes.</b> A. tumefaciens, carrying self-complimentary iaaM and ipt transgenes, and Agrobacterium rhizogenes, carrying a self-complimentary Pv 010 gene from P. vulnus, were used as co-transformation vectors. RolABC genes were introduced by the resident T-DNA in the A. rhizogenes Ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation. Pv 010 and Pv 194 (transgenic control) genes were also transferred separately using A. tumefaciens. To test for resistance, transformed walnut roots were challenged with P. vulnus and microshoots were challenged with a virulent strain of A. tumefaciens. 				 				 					 						Results 					Combining the two bacterial strains at a 1 : 1 rather than 1 : 3 ratio increased the co-transformation efficiency. Although complete immunity to nematode infection was not observed, transgenic lines yielded up to 79 % fewer nematodes per root following in vitro co-culture than untransformed controls. Transgenic line 33 - 3 - 1 exhibited complete crown gall control and 32 % fewer nematodes. The transgenic plants had thicker, longer roots than untransformed controls possibly due to insertion of rolABC genes. When the Pv 010 gene was present in roots with or without rolABC genes there was partial or complete control of RLNs. Transformation using only one vector showed 100 % control in some lines. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					CG and nematode resistance <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> controlled CG and RLNs simultaneously in walnuts. Silencing genes encoding iaaM, ipt, and Pv 010 decrease CG formation and RLNs populations in walnut. Beneficial plant genotype and phenotype changes are caused by co-transformation using A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes strains. Viable resistance against root lesion nematodes in walnut plants may be accomplished in the future using this <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> technology...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three journal papers I have worked on {{during the past three}} years of my PhD studies. In the first paper, we presented a multi-objective integer programming model for the <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> problem. Although the <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> problem is proved to be NP-hard, we have been able to obtain Pareto frontiers for smaller sized instances within one minute using the state-of-the-art commercial computer solvers in our computational experiments. In the second paper, we presented an exact algorithm for the bilevel mixed integer linear programming (BMILP) problem under three simplifying assumptions. Compared to these existing ones, our new algorithm relies on weaker assumptions, explicitly considers infinite optimal, infeasible, and unbounded cases, and is proved to terminate infinitely with the correct output. We report results of our computational experiments on a small library of BMILP test instances, which we have created and made publicly available online. In the third paper, we presented the watermelon algorithm for the bilevel integer linear programming (BILP) problem. To our best knowledge, it is the first exact algorithm which promises to solve all possible BILPs, including finitely optimal, infeasible, and unbounded cases. What is more, our algorithm does not rely on any simplifying condition, allowing even the case of unboundedness for the high point problem. We prove that the watermelon algorithm must finitely terminate with the correct output. Computational experiments are also reported showing the efficiency of our algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The {{genetic and}} {{virulence}} variability of 112 isolates of Phaeoisariopsis griseola, collected from various locations in Central America, were studied using seven random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers and 12 common-bean differential genotypes. Broad molecular diversity (H = 0 · 92) among isolates was found using RAPD markers. Fifty pathotypes were identified on 12 differential bean genotypes, 29 {{of which were}} represented by only one isolate. Only 18 pathotypes were found in two or more countries. Pathotype 63 - 63 was the most virulent and caused leaf spots on all 12 common-bean differential genotypes. Comparison of virulence phenotypes and RAPD profiles to known Andean P. griseola isolates confirmed that all isolates belonged to the Mesoamerican group. Pairwise comparison between individual RAPD loci showed that the majority were in gametic phase linkage disequilibrium, revealing that P. griseola maintains a genetic structure {{that is consistent with}} asexual reproduction. The molecular and virulence diversities of P. griseola isolates from Central America imply that using single resistance genes to manage angular leaf spot is inadequate and <b>stacking</b> resistance <b>genes</b> may be necessary to manage the disease effectively.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{production of}} marker-free transgenic plants {{is still a}} challenge in most fruit species even though such plants are a necessary component of many "new breeding technologies", particularly cis- and intragenesis. Marker-free plant production is also necessary for the successive <b>stacking</b> of <b>genes</b> in an elite fruit transgenic line. Here, we used a R/Rs site-specific recombinase that is post-translationally regulated by dexamethasone through fusion with a ligand-binding domain for this hormone, and a bi-functional selectable marker gene coding for a cytosine deaminase/neomycin transferase (codA-nptII) protein; this enabled a first step of positive kanamycin selection, followed by a second step of negative 5 -fluorocytosine selection. The aim of our study was to optimize this system on the apple cv. Galaxy and on the pear cv. Conference by conducting a detailed study {{of the effects of}} dexamethasone and 5 -fluorocytosine treatments, and by comparing an early versus a delayed selection strategy. We were able to produce marker-free transgenic pear plants for the first time, and confirm the feasibility of producing marker-free transgenic apple plants using a chemically inducible recombinase system. We recommend the use of an early selection strategy for the pear cv. Conference and a delayed selection strategy for the apple cv. Galaxy...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora infestans {{remains the}} most devastating potato {{pathogen}} worldwide. In developing countries it causes annual losses of up to 2. 75 billion USD, excluding the cost of pesticides. Host plant resistance mediated by single R genes has been rapidly overcome by P. infestans on many occasions. However, durable resistance might be achieved through genetic transformation of a potato variety with different combinations of R genes from Solanum wild species. The RB, Rpi-blb 2 (isolated from Solanum bulbocastanum) and the Rpi-vnt 1. 1 (isolated from S. venturii) genes are being transferred into the susceptible variety Desiree and other varieties grown in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Close to 600 transgenic events (TE) were produced from Desiree with either a single R gene (251) or the 3 R <b>gene</b> <b>stack</b> (331). TE {{with high levels of}} resistance to P. infestans were identified by in-vitro and whole-plant assays. Fewer than 10 % of the TE with either a single R gene or the 3 R <b>gene</b> <b>stack</b> were found to be highly resistant. A hypersensitive reaction to specific isolates and extreme resistance was observed for 7 out of 64 RB-TE, 4 out of 117 Rpi-blb 2 -TE, 1 out of 25 Rpi-vnt 1. 1 -TE, and 16 out of 162 3 R-TE. Varieties from SSA have been identified as candidates for transformation, with priority given to three: Shangi (rapidly increasing adoption in Kenya), Tigoni (well established variety in Kenya), and Cruza 148 (grown in the Lake Kivu region, especially in Burundi and Rwanda). After greenhouse screening of all existing TE, the top 10 highly resistant 3 R-TE will be evaluated in confined field trials. This will be performed during several cropping seasons to monitor resistance stability and dynamics of the pathogen population...|$|R
