40|$|Orientation: The study {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} labour turnover trends amongst African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> in South Africa. There {{is a perception}} that turnover amongst African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> is higher than average. There is also a perception that African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> are only motivated by financial rewards when considering job change. Research purpose: The study focused on understanding why African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> have a propensity to change jobs and how organisations can resolve the trend. Motivation for the study: To develop {{a better understanding of}} the push and pull factors for African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> in organisations. Research design, approach and method: The research was conducted in two phases, namely as part of a qualitative study and a quantitative study: Creswell (2003) refers to this approach as triangulation. The target population was African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> on the database of a large Human Resources Consultancy, The South African Rewards Association and the Association of Black Actuaries and Investment Professionals (ABSIP) (n = 2600). A total of 208 usable responses were received. Main findings: The main findings and contribution to the field of study was that African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> do not trust organisations with their career development. They would rather take control of their own career development by moving from organisation to organisation to build their repertoire of skills and competence. They want to be in charge of their careers. This finding has profound implications for organisations employing African Black <b>managers</b> in the <b>senior</b> cadre. Practical/managerial implications: Managers of African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> need to create attractive employee value propositions that address the main findings. Contribution/value-add: The research shows that African Black <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> generally seek corporate environments that encourage a sense of belonging and with a clear career growth plan. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} on employee wellbeing (EW) has largely focussed on employees' subjective experiences and has generally assumed that managers’ interpretations of EW are consistent and non‐problematic. Tensions inherent in managing complex expectations, and diverse results, {{have not been}} adequately investigated, and ways in which EW practices are viewed by <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> have not been sufficiently examined. This paper attempts to fill this gap by exploring the perceptions of <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> with human resources (HR) responsibilities affecting EW. There is a specific focus on the tensions experienced by these <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> and the related tactics they adopted to successfully manage them. We gathered data from focus groups made up of 20 <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> from companies operating in the Milan County in Italy. An analysis of this data identified four predominant dimensions of EW, {{as well as the}} tensions felt by the managers and the various tactics they used to overcome them. Finally, we classified the interpretative tactics into four broad resolution strategies (i. e. flexible, integrative, separated and reciprocal thinking) that <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> adopted to cognitively address their experience of tensions...|$|R
40|$|Managers have {{important}} roles in organisations as it is through managers that organizations establish, maintain, and develop relationships with their environments. While there is a wealth of prescriptive literature about how managers should behave in situations of change, surprisingly little research that {{has been carried out}} with <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> and their actual responses to change. The purpose of this research is to investigate the responses of <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> to externally imposed change in fast changing environments. Specifically the focus is how <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> respond to change in changing environments and how they respond in different changing environments. Because of the exploratory nature of this investigation, the objective was to develop a framework which could explore the responses of <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> within changing environments. A conceptual framework based on the open systems model of systems/environment interaction of the individual managers and the relationship with environment was developed from early work on purposeful systems, and idealseeking systems.

40|$|Evidence of the {{seriousness}} of America 2 ̆ 7 s competitive weaknesses in the manufacturing sector is abundant. <b>Senior</b> <b>managers</b> {{play a central role in}} developing a strategy which guides individual learning and ensures the achievement of competitive advantage. This research investigated <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of four propositions related to how a company develops competitive advantage. ^ Organizational learning theory (DiBella 2 ̆ 6 Nevis, 1997) and the resource-based theory of competitive advantage (Barney, 1995) provided the theoretical framework for the study, and were used to explain variations in the dependent variables: (a) past use, (b) past payoff, and (c) planned future use of four organizational capabilities (i. e., strategic management, systems and technologies, innovation, and collaborative alliances). ^ Data were collected from <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> (n = 57) in New England manufacturing companies. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc tests were used to determine the extent of differences among <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 past use, past payoff, and planned future use scores. Paired samples t-tests were used to determine if there were differences between <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 past use and planned future use scores. ^ Systems and technologies were most favored, collaborative alliances least favored, with significant differences between <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 past use and planned future use for all four organizational capabilities. There was a wide range of opinion among the <b>senior</b> <b>managers,</b> and they did not perceive individual knowledge related to the four organizational capabilities to be a major component of their strategy in terms of competitive advantage. These findings are not consistent with the views espoused in the literature, and failed to support the study 2 ̆ 7 s four propositions regarding organizational capabilities required for competitive advantage. ^ Three new propositions, regarding (1) industry context (i. e., the allure of systems and technologies and the aversion to collaborative alliances), (2) <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 limited commitment to developing individual knowledge, and (3) management culture 2 ̆ 7 s influence on <b>senior</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding individual knowledge and competitive advantage, are presented for future research.
