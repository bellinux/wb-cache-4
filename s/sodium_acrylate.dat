Two siphon tubes feeding through two control valves into a mixing chamber before the spray operation resulted in separate feeds of a sodium hydroxide solution and a mixture of acrylic acid, water, and a catalyst.

30|$|As {{presented}} in Table  2, the in situ inhibitor was {{very effective in}} preventing Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + precipitations over 45  days at 80  °C. It was also observed that {{the efficiency of the}} inhibitor increased as the acid to alkali weight ratio was increased in the case of sodium carbonate. For instance, with a small acid to alkali weight ratio, the produced inhibitor (<b>sodium</b> <b>acrylate)</b> was insufficient to prevent the precipitations. All the acid was neutralized by the added alkali and sodium ions present in the brine. However, when a high acid to alkali weight ratio was used, only the required amount of acid was neutralized by the added alkali. The <b>sodium</b> <b>acrylate</b> concentration was increased {{as a result of the}} reaction of the alkali and sodium ions with the acrylic acid. The inhibitor adsorbs on the active growth sites of the Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + surfaces to prevent them from precipitating.

The main problem for its practical use comes from incongruent melting character during thermal cycling. Experimentally, heat of fusion of the pure salt decreased from 200 to 25 J center dot g (- 1) in a four-run freeze-thaw cycling. Additives such as thickening agent or in-situ synthesized polyacrylate sodium in the molten salt can prevent its phase separation to some extent. In the test, sodium alginate 3. 0 % - 5. 0 % (w/w) thickened mixture containing Na 2 HPO 4 center dot 12 H(2) O and some water showed constant heat storage capacities. Polyacrylate sodium gelled salt was synthesized through polymerizing <b>sodium</b> <b>acrylate</b> in the melt of Na 2 HPO 4 center dot 12 H(2) O and some extra water at 50 degrees C. Optimum conditions composed of <b>sodium</b> <b>acrylate</b> 3. 0 %- 5. 0 % (w/w), cross-linking agent N,N-methylenebis-acrylamide 0. 10 %- 0. 20 % (w/w), K 2 S 2 O 8 and Na 2 SO 3 (mass ratio 1 : 1) 0. 06 %- 0. 12 % (w/w).

40|$|Cross-linked {{copolymers}} of {{acrylic acid}} (<b>sodium</b> <b>acrylate)</b> and acrylamide were synthesized by free radical polymerization. The copolymer hydrogel was studied for capture of copper ion from aqueous solution. Effects of macromolecular structure (i. e., {{content of the}} acrylic acid, the quantity of the carboxyl groups neutralized with sodium hydroxide, {{and the degree of}} cross-linking) on water-sorption and copper ion uptake were investigated. With an increase in the content of acrylic acid (<b>sodium</b> <b>acrylate),</b> the copper sulfate uptake increases, and water sorption decreases quickly and then slowly increases when the acrylic acid content is high enough. The copper ion uptake is accompanied with a release of sodium ions from the copolymer. Increasing the percentage of the carboxyl groups neutralized by sodium hydroxide will increase the uptake of copper sulfate and water. With an increase in the content of the cross-linking agent, both copper sulfate uptake and water sorption decrease. Even though valence of copper ion is two times that of sodium ion, the copper ions sorption and sodium ions release do not follow a simple ion exchange relation because of insertion of acrylamide co-monomers in macromolecular chain. When copper ions interact with carboxyl groups in the copolymer to form chelating complexes, the water sorption decreases substantially. An analysis of adsorption isotherm indicates that at relatively low concentrations of CuSO 4 in water, the copper ion sorption into the copolymer follows the Langmuir model. The wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) data reveal that the copper sulfate sorbed in the hydrogel is not in crystalline state...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFlocculants {{are widely}} used in {{numerous}} industrial domains (food-processing industry, mineral industries, chemical industries, water purification, wastewater treatment) to im-prove the solid/liquid separation in water-containing fine par-ticles. Thanks to the addition of flocculants, particles gather together and form flocs that improve the materials aggregation and wastewater clarification. At the molecular level, floccu-lants can be mineral polymers or natural organic polymers, but synthetic organic polymers constitute the main flocculants. Generally, they are anionic polyacrylamides produced by polymerisation of acrylamide and the anionic co-monomer, the <b>sodium</b> <b>acrylate.</b> Monomers are only partially eliminated during polyacrylamide preparation and remain {{at the state of}} tracks in the end product. According to Smith et al. (1996), the residual content in monomers varies between 0. 05 and 5 %. <b>Sodium</b> <b>acrylate</b> presents no harmfulness like the polyacryl-amide (Stephens, 1991). However, as the acrylamide is con-sidered as a carcinogenic molecule, mutagen and reprotoxic (Molak, 1991), all polyacrylamides (PAMs) used within the European Union are required to contain less than 0. 1 % (w/w) of residual acrylamide (AMD) (European Parliament 1999) unless they are classified and labelled as a category 2 carcin-ogen (European Parliament 2006). More stringent thresholds are also set depending on additional regulations covering specific uses like, for example, when PAM-based flocculants are used for the treatment of drinking water (no more than 0. 05 % of residual AMD). The potential risks on environment and health are thus linked to the spreading of acrylamide and polyacrylamide degradation products in the natural environment.

Parameter of observation consisted of percentage of seeds germinated in storage, percentage of seeds infected by fungi in storage, seeds moisture content, percentage of seeds germination after storage, and early growth of cocoa seedlings. The results of the experiment showed that AASAP application with some dosages cocoa seeds storage cause to germinate in storage during 2 weeks. AASAP application with some dosages in cocoa seeds storage for 2 weeks would not result in infection by fungi and did not significantly affect seed germination after storage for 1, 2 and 4 weeks, and percentage of germination of cocoa seed after storage for 3 weeks decreased with increase dosage of AASAP.

The in situ precipitation inhibitor showed an excellent performance in preventing calcium and magnesium precipitations and the solutions remained clear for 45  days at 80  °C. Further, as the inhibitor concentration increased to an optimal value, an ultra-low interfacial tension of 0.04  mN/m could be achieved. The advantage of the in situ inhibitor is the use of hard brines without the need for softening the injection water.|$|E
