After she had appeared in four pornographic films in the softcore and fetish genrestrample fetish specificallypublic discussion about the Year 2000 problem {{and the end of the}} world caused her to think that she might experience divine judgment for her lifestyle.

25|$|One of the show's most {{maligned}} storylines of all-time involved show matriarch Rachel Cory Hutchins being {{kidnapped and}} then impersonated by an evil doppelgänger countess, Justine Duvalier (also played by Victoria Wyndham). It was panned by the soap press as being {{worthy of a}} Mystery Science Theater 3000 level of ridicule. During the storyline, the show was dealt another major blow when fan favorite Paul Michael Valley was fired and his character, Ryan, was killed off. Fans were relieved when Justine's reign of terror was put to an end when Carl finished her off with a letter opener. Wyndham was quoted as liking the storyline at first, but after it played out, she stated that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never appeared in it.|$|E

Veitch told Albee about her friend who had died and to whom <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> evangelized. Albee suggested that they start telling other strippers about Jesus. Matt Brown, Veitch's pastor at Sandals Church, arrived for a haircut and Veitch asked him for help to start an organization to minister to sex workers. He was interested. Veitch and Brown started Matthew's House, an organization they founded as [...] "a ministry to help people working in or addicted to the sex industry". They chose the name [...] "Matthew's House" [...] in reference to the Calling of Matthew, a gospel episode in which Jesus eats with sinners at the home of Matthew the Apostle.|$|E

It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman." [...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'"

During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards."
