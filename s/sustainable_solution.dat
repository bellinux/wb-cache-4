Its aim is to create full employment and price stability, by having the state promise to hire unemployed workers as an employer of last resort (ELR).|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication poses {{a problem}} {{not only to}} ecosystems, but to humans as well. Reducing {{eutrophication}} should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a <b>sustainable</b> <b>solution</b> for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans {{should be aware that}} natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. Finnish phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency. Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{from the}} U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory {{have found that}} {{large-scale}} use of CdTe PV modules does not present any risks to health and the environment, and recycling the modules {{at the end of}} their useful life completely resolves any environmental concerns. During their operation, these modules do not produce any pollutants, and, furthermore, by displacing fossil fuels, they offer great environmental benefits. CdTe PV modules that use cadmium as a raw material appear to be more environmentally friendly than all other current uses of Cd. CdTe PV provides a <b>sustainable</b> <b>solution</b> to a potential oversupply of cadmium in the near future. Cadmium is generated as a waste by-product of zinc refining and is generated in substantial amounts regardless of its use in PV, due to the demand for steel products.|$|E

25|$|Relief {{measures}} were supervised by Sir John McNeill, himself a highlander. In 1846, {{in his role}} as chairman of the Board of Supervision for the New Poor Law of Scotland, he toured 27 of the most distressed parishes. As the famine continued, many, like McNeill, began to doubt that relief was a <b>sustainable</b> <b>solution</b> to the problem. His view was shared by others. For example, in Skye, one of the hardest hit areas, the local clan chief, Norman McLeod, bankrupted himself between 1846 and 1849 providing relief to his people. In 1849, he was obliged to leave Skye and move to London, working as a clerk earning three pounds a week. He became convinced that emigration was the only solution and eventually joined the London Committee of the Highland and Island Emigration Society. Similarly, Thomas Fraser, Sheriff Substitute of Skye, who had worked there since 1846 organizing relief, came to believe that emigration was the only hope.|$|E
2500|$|Restoration {{is used as}} a {{tool for}} {{reducing}} the spread of invasive plant species in a number of ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread. [...] As this approach emphasizes control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects. The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat. These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density. These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density. They are not always actively managed following seeding. The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. This approach {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a <b>sustainable</b> <b>solution</b> long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding.|$|E
2500|$|On January 31, 2012 the United Nations {{independent}} [...] "International Fact-Finding Mission on Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" [...] filed {{a report}} stating that Israeli settlement {{led to a}} multitude of violations of Palestinian human rights and that if Israel did not stop all settlement activity immediately and begin withdrawing all settlers from the West Bank, it potentially might face a case at the International Criminal Court. It said that Israel was in violation of article 49 of the fourth Geneva convention forbidding transferring civilians of the occupying nation into occupied territory. It held that the settlements are [...] "leading to a creeping annexation that prevents {{the establishment of a}} contiguous and viable Palestinian state and undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination." [...] After Palestine's admission to the United Nations as a non-member state in September 2012, it potentially may have its complaint heard by the International Court. Israel's foreign ministry replied to the report saying that [...] "Counterproductive measures – such as the report before us – will only hamper efforts to find a <b>sustainable</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The human rights council has sadly distinguished itself by its systematically one-sided and biased approach towards Israel." ...|$|E
