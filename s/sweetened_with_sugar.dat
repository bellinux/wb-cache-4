5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar.</b> Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E
25|$|Almost every {{important}} {{town from}} Massachusetts to the Carolinas had a rum distillery {{to meet the}} local demand, which had increased dramatically. Rum was often enjoyed in mixed drinks, including flip. This was a popular winter beverage made of rum and beer <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> and warmed by plunging a red-hot fireplace poker into the serving mug.|$|E
25|$|Once brewed, coffee may {{be served}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Drip-brewed, percolated, or French-pressed/cafetière coffee may be served as white coffee with a dairy product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute, or as black coffee with no such addition. It may be <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> or {{artificial}} sweetener. When served cold, it is called iced coffee.|$|E
50|$|Originally <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> honey, {{nowadays}} Aachener Printen are <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> {{the syrup}} from sugar beets as honey became temporarily unavailable when Napoleon issued a trade embargo, banning all {{trade with the}} main supplier of honey, the United States. The tradition of <b>sweetening</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> beets was kept even after Napoleon was defeated and the French occupation lifted.|$|R

25|$|From {{the early}} stages, the cocoa was <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> cane, which the Spanish {{were the first}} to popularise in Europe. In pre-Columbus America {{chocolate}} was flavored with peppers and was a mixture of both bitter and spicy flavours. This made it an acquired taste and limited its appeal to the Spanish conquistadors, who were soon encouraged to sweeten it with sugar brought from the Iberian Peninsula in addition to heating it.|$|E
25|$|Lambic {{is usually}} a blend {{of at least two}} {{different}} beers; many producers are blenders who buy beer from other brewers and blend them together to create the desired result. A gueuze may have occupied space in several different cellars over six years or more. While those outside Belgium are likely to find bottled gueuze and fruited versions, a wider variety of styles is available to local drinkers. Beers are often blended again or <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> or flavoured syrups before drinking as some can be extremely tart.|$|E
25|$|Ice cream (derived {{from earlier}} iced cream or cream ice) is a {{sweetened}} frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors. It is typically <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> or sugar substitutes. Typically, flavourings and colourings are added {{in addition to}} stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (<nbsp&). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.|$|E

25|$|Lassi and moru {{are common}} {{beverages}} in India. Lassi is stirred liquified curd that is either salted or <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> commonly, less commonly honey and often combined with fruit pulp to create flavored lassi. Mango lassi is a western favorite, as is coconut lassi. Consistency can vary widely, with urban and commercial lassis being of uniform texture through being processed, whereas rural and rustic lassi has curds in it, and sometimes has malai (cream) added or removed. Moru {{is a popular}} South Indian summer drink, meant to keep drinkers hydrated through the hot and humid summers of the South. It is prepared by considerably thinning down yogurt with water, adding salt (for electrolyte balance) and spices, usually green chili peppers, asafoetida, curry leaves and mustard.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the most}} {{widespread}} non-alcoholic beverage among the peasantry was kvass, adopted later by Polish nobility also, mainly due to its supposed healing qualities. In contemporary times, tea {{is perhaps the most}} popular, drunk sometimes with a slice of lemon and <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar.</b> Tea came into Poland from England shortly after its appearance in Western Europe, mainly due to the Dutch merchants. However its prevalence is attributed to the Russian invaders in the 19th century – at this time samovars imported from Russia become commonplace in Polish homes. Coffee is also widely drunk in Poland since the 18th century. Frequently consumed beverages also include: buttermilk, kefir, soured milk, instant coffee, various mineral waters and juices. Following the fall of communism in 1989, numerous brands of soft drink have also become popular.|$|E

2500|$|Popcorn is {{commonly}} eaten in movie theaters. This snack is usually served salted or sweetened. In North America, it is traditionally served salted, often with butter or a butterlike topping, or with toffee or spices.

2500|$|Users have {{experimented with}} various {{alternative}} flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions. [...] A few small independent vendors offer speciality flavours such as soft drink syrups with real cane sugar. A modern {{version of the}} [...] "Hires Root Beer kit" [...] unsweetened concentrate is distributed by the Hires Big H drive-in restaurant chain, but its users must add both sugar and carbonated water. Other manufacturers have tried to make syrups that are more compatible with SodaStream, such as Rio, which makes both a concentrated version that can be <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar</b> or other sweeteners, or a fully sweetened version that is ready to use. The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{traditional}} {{drink of}} Argentina is an infusion called mate (in Spanish, mate, with the accent {{on the first}} syllable [...] ). The name comes from the hollow gourd from which it is traditionally drunk. The mate (gourd) or other small cup is filled about three-quarters full with yerba mate, the dried leaves and twigs of the Ilex paraguariensis. The drink, which is rather bitter, is sipped through a metal or cane straw called a bombilla. Mate can be <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar,</b> or flavored with aromatic herbs or dried orange peel. Hot but not boiling water is poured into the gourd, drunk, then the mate is refilled. The mate is nearly full of leaves, so each refill only makes a small drink, but many refills are possible before the yerba is spent. In small gatherings it is traditional for one mate to be passed from person to person, filled by whoever has the kettle. It is customary not to thank the refiller routinely; a final gracias (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough. Drinking mate together is an important social ritual. Mate cocido is the same leaf, which rather than brewed is boiled and served, like tea, with milk and sugar to taste.|$|E
60|$|Mark now arose, {{and found}} himself sensibly {{improved}} by his night's rest, the washing, and the nourishment received, little as the last had been. His {{first step was to}} empty the tumbler, bread and all. Then he took another bath, the last doing quite as much good, he fancied, as his breakfast. All that day, the young man managed his case with the same self-denial and prudence, consuming a ship's biscuit {{in the course of the}} next twenty-four hours, and taking two or three glasses of the wine, mixed with water and <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar.</b> In the afternoon he endeavoured to shave, but the first effort convinced him he was getting well too fast.|$|E

Then Karlsefin ordered ten plates of fried venison to be placed before them, which was done, and they applied themselves to the consumption of this with equal relish. Having concluded the repast, each man received a can of warm water and milk, highly <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar.</b> At first they took a doubtful sip of this, and {{looked at each other}} in surprise. It was a new sensation! One of them smacked his lips; the rest said [...] "Waugh!" [...] nodded their heads, and drained their cans to the bottom at a single draught; after which, observing that there was some sediment left, they scraped it out with their fingers and sucked them.|$|E
60|$|At sunset the {{exploring}} party returned. They had {{penetrated the}} thick woods, ascended hills, descended valleys, and had finally got above the rapids, {{a distance of}} about three leagues; but their account of the difficulties in the way of advancing was very discouraging indeed. Mackenzie had foreseen this, and had made suitable preparations to counteract the evil effects thereof. In their absence he had prepared for them an enormous kettle of wild rice highly <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar.</b> When the tired, hungry, and footsore men sat down to this they became quite willing to listen to their leader's arguments in favour of a bold advance, and when the hearty supper was washed down with a liberal allowance of rum, and finished off with a pipe, they avowed themselves ready to face anything! In this satisfactory state of mind they retired to rest, while their leader sat up in the hope of obtaining an observation of Jupiter and his first satellite, which laudable aim was frustrated by cloudy weather.|$|E
6000|$|He {{came back}} with a wooden pan quite full, and gave it to his wife. 'I can't eat that,' she said, turning away in disgust. 'Look! there are some dead bees in it! I want honey that is quite pure.' And the man threw the {{rejected}} honey on the grass, and started off to get some fresh. When he got back he offered it to his wife, who treated it as she had done the first bowlful. 'That honey has got ants in it: throw it away,' she said, and when he brought her some more, she declared it was full of earth. In his fourth journey he managed to find some that she would eat, and then she begged him to get her some water. This took him some time, but at length he came to a lake whose waters were <b>sweetened</b> <b>with</b> <b>sugar.</b> He filled a pannikin quite full, and carried it home to his wife, who drank it eagerly, and said that she now felt quite well. When she was up and had dressed herself, her husband lay down in her place, saying: 'You have given me a great deal of trouble, and now it is my turn!' ...|$|E
