40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the study on depleted uranium (DU) health effects on cows bred in areas exposed to DU ammunition, during NATO bombing of Serbia and Montenegro in 1999. The samples of animal blood, soils and feed were collected randomly in the region of Bujanovac, in 2003. Complete blood cells count was performed according to standard laboratory procedures. Concentration of red blood cells malondialdehyde (RBC MDA) and erythrocyte superoxid dismutase (SOD) activity were determined spectrophotometrically. The functional activity of leukocytes was investigated by NBT reduction and adhesion test. Activity of the radionuclides was determined by standard gamma spectrometry. The obtained results of complete red blood cells count indicate normocytic normochromic anaemia. Considerably increased RBC MDA concentration suggests a violent oxidative stress in cows bred in the exposed area although the activity of their RBC antioxidant enzyme SOD was in the range of values obtained in the control group. The total number of leukocytes and the differential leukocyte counts were within the physiological range. NBT reduction test revealed the absence of leukocyte oxidative burst, which pointed to the absence of inflammation. A significant decrease of granulocyte adhesiveness, pointed at partial impairment of granulocyte functional activity. The activity of 238 U/ 235 U in soils and feed was below the minimal detectable concentration (10 - 3 Bq/kg), while the content of natural (226 Ra and 232 Th) and anthropogenic 137 Cs) radionuclides in soils were within the average values for the region, except for low levels of 40 K - indicating <b>soils</b> <b>impoverishment</b> <b>in</b> potassium...|$|R

Functional {{plasticity}} of Trifolium repens L. {{in response}} to sulphur and nitrogen availability. Plant and Soil, 317, (1 - 2), 189 - 200. IMPF: 02. 52 RONO: 1330 2406 Recent control of atmospheric SO 2 pollution is leading to important <b>soil</b> sulphur <b>impoverishment.</b> Plasticity could be a mechanism allowing species to adapt to this rapid global change. Trifolium repens L. is a key grassland species whose performances in community are strongly linked to nitrogen availability. Plasticity of three white clover lines contrasting {{in their ability to}} use atmospheric N 2 or soil N was assessed by analysing a set of functional traits along a gradient of nitrogen and sulphur fertilisation applied on a poor soil. White clover traits showed high morphological and physiological plasticity. Nitrogen appeared to be the most limiting factor for the VLF (Very Low Fixation) line. S was the element that modulated the most traits for the nitrogen fixing lines NNU (Normal Nitrate Uptake) and LNU (Low Nitrate Uptake). As expected, N fertilisation inhibited white clover fixation, but we also observed that N 2 fixation was enhanced when S was added. S fertilisation increased nodule length as well as the proportion of nodules containing leghaemoglobin. S fertilisation, with a direct effect and an indirect effect through N 2 fixation, increases white clover performances particularly with regards to photosynthesis and potential vegetative reproduction. The important plasticity {{in response to}} S availability should allow it to adapt to a large range of abiotic conditions, but its sensitivity to S nutrition would be a disadvantage for competition in a situation of <b>soil</b> sulphur <b>impoverishment.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, S fertilisation could help maintain this species when nitrogen status is against it.

Quantitative and qualitative differences were found among the investigated areas. Results show that less frequently disturbed soils are capable of restoring oribatid and springtail population, leading to greater equilibrium.

30|$|Water {{resource}} {{is of great}} significance to the survival and development of human. However, the water resource system in karst regions is sensitive to external interference owing to the special geological processes which cause <b>soil</b> <b>impoverishment,</b> severe rocky desertification and large topographic height difference. Therefore, evaluating the sustainability of the water resource in karst regions is beneficial to reasonably use and protect water resource. This paper puts forward to evaluate the water resource from four aspects, including water resources system, water requirement system, ecosystem and social economic system. Moreover, on this basis, 18 evaluation indexes were selected to construct the sustainability evaluation index system and method. This method {{was used to evaluate}} the sustainability of the water resource in the typical karst region—Zunyi, Guizhou province, China, and was verified according to the actual situation in the research area. All these provide reference for the evaluation of the sustainability of the water resource in similar regions.|$|R
40|$|We {{monitored}} five-year {{changes in}} the vegetation of 31 hay meadows under an agri-environment scheme in Wallonia, Southern Belgium. Management included delayed mowing (in July) and fertilizer prohibition. It resulted in increasing cover of characteristic forbs (such as Leucanthemum vulgare, Lotus corniculatus, Centaurea jacea) and oligotrophic grasses (Avenula pubescens, Festuca rubra), while the competitive grasses, such as Holcus lanatus, Phleum pratense and Alopecurus pratensis, tended to decrease. We interpreted this as a vegetation shift from typical hay meadow to oligotrophic grasslands due to <b>soil</b> <b>impoverishment</b> following the current management. Both habitats are of conservation value. Despite these {{changes in the}} meadow plant communities, {{only one of the}} four criteria used by the Walloon administration to indicate hay meadow conservation status changed significantly over the six-year period.
