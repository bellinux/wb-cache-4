40|$|An {{algorithm}} for surface reconstruction from a polyhedron with arbitrary topology {{consisting of}} triangular faces is presented. The first {{variant of the}} algorithm constructs a curve network consisting of cubic B'ezier curves meeting with tangent plane continuity at the vertices. This curve network is extended to a smooth surface by replacing each of the networks facets with a <b>split</b> <b>patch</b> consisting of three triangular B'ezier patches. The remaining degrees of freedom of the curve network and the split patches are determined by minimizing a quadratic functional. This optimization process works either for the curve network and the split patches separately or in one simultaneous step. The second variant of our algorithm {{is based on the}} construction of an optimized curve network with higher continuity. Examples demonstrate the quality of the different methods. 1 Introduction The reconstruction of a surface from a set of (a priori unorganized) points as well as the design of surfaces with a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{foraging}} behaviour {{and promoting}} substrate choice as methods for reducing stereotypy in captive animals are widely practised and generally accepted as effective. In {{the present study}} we examined the efficacy of offering foraging patch and substrate choice {{in an attempt to}} reduce motor stereotypy in two captive vicugna (F 1 and F 2). Browse were added to the vicugna’s enclosure as an additional forage substrate and also split the vicugna’s normal feed: half being delivered outside of the sleeping enclosure and half inside to offer a <b>split</b> <b>patch</b> choice. The study employed an ABACA design (A: Baseline, B: Browse, C: Split Feed). There was a significant effect for condition, P = 0. 017. T-tests revealed a significant condition effect in F 1 between the Browse and Baseline one, P < 0. 05 with the frequency of stereotypy during the Browse condition being higher. In addition in F 1, a higher frequency of stereotypy was observed during the Browse condition as compared to Baseline two and this approached significance, P = 0. 06. T-tests revealed several significant inter-condition differences in F 2. The frequency of stereotypy during the Browse condition was significantly higher than during Baseline one, P < 0. 05, Baseline 2, P < 0. 01 and the Split Feed condition, P < 0. 05. The frequency of stereotypy was also significantly higher in the Baseline 3 condition than in the Split Feed condition, P = 0. 05. In the wild, vicugna are the only camelids who sleep and eat in different areas. However, the subjects used for the present study were fed in their sleeping enclosure. The decrease in stereotypy during the split-feed condition may be indicative the relative reinforcer value of stereotypy as compared to simulated wildtype foraging opportunities. The reason the browse increased stereotypy may be because it represented a supernormal stimulus...|$|E

(2009). The quiet Sun magnetograms observed in the Na I line by Hinode/ SOT is used in this study. Investigated patches range from 10 ^{ 17 }Mx to 10 ^{ 19 }Mx. Emergence and cancellation are much less frequent than merging and splitting. The time scale for splitting is found to be ~ 33 minutes and is independent of the flux contained in the <b>splitting</b> <b>patch.</b> Moreover magnetic <b>patches</b> <b>split</b> into any flux contents with an equal probability. It is shown that such a fragmentation process leads to a distribution with a power-law index - 2. Merging has a very weak dependence on flux content only with a power-law index - 0. 33. These results suggest that 1) magnetic patches are fragmented by splitting, merging, and tiny cancellation; 2) flux is removed from the photosphere through tiny cancellations after these fragmentations.

40|$|Patch-based texture {{synthesis}} algorithms produce reasonable {{results for}} a wide variety of texture classes. They preserve global structure, but often introduce unwanted visual artifacts along patch boundaries. Pixel-based synthesis algorithms, on the other hand, tend to blur out small objects while maintaining a consistent texture impression, which in return doesn’t necessarily resemble the input texture. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and hybrid algorithm. Our algorithm adaptively <b>splits</b> <b>patches</b> so as to use as large as possible patches while staying within a user-defined error tolerance for the mismatch in the overlap region. Using large patches improves the reproduction of global structure. The remaining errors in the overlap regions are eliminated using pixel-based re-synthesis. We introduce an optimized ordering for the re-synthesis of these erroneous pixels using morphological operators, which ensures that every pixel has enough valid (i. e., error-free) neighboring pixels. Examples and comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate that our approach improves over previous texture synthesis algorithms, especially for textures with well-visible, possibly anisotropic structure, such as natural stone wall or scales...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} was studied {{mostly on}} static landscapes by describing static patterns of habitable and non-habitable sites. Here we investigate a dynamic model of habitat fragmentation, describing the local (fine-scale) events and their frequencies observable {{on such a}} landscape. Adjacent habitat sites form patches. Removal of a single habitat site can cause {{one of the following}} elementary events: <b>splitting</b> a single <b>patch,</b> shrinking the size of a <b>patch</b> without <b>splitting</b> it, or making a patch disappear. We compare the frequencies of these elementary events and the effective size of the habitat removed from the organism living area as we transition from a pristine habitat to one totally destroyed. Our novel framework of dynamical neutral landscape models allows us to establish the following findings. First, we can distinguish four transitions delimiting five main phases of degradation: (1) at low habitat loss, the connected habitat only shrinks; (2) <b>splitting</b> of small <b>patches</b> becomes more frequent, and then the percolation threshold is reached; (3) the frequency of <b>patch</b> <b>split</b> peak after the percolation threshold; (4) isolated patches shrink; and finally, (5) the remaining patches, which already are small and isolated, disappear altogether. Second, the frequency of habitat fragmentation through <b>patch</b> <b>splitting</b> peaks at a habitat loss level in excess of the percolation threshold. Third, for organism requiring a minimum patch size to be viable, we demonstrate that the effective loss caused by the removal of a single habitat site can be several times higher than the actual habitat loss. Fourth, the larger the minimal patch size needed for the organism, the more amplified the effective habitat loss compared to the actual loss...|$|R

40|$|The multi-focus {{image fusion}} method {{is used in}} image {{processing}} to generate all-focus images that have {{large depth of field}} (DOF) based on original multi-focus images. Different approaches have been used in the spatial and transform domain to fuse multi-focus images. As {{one of the most popular}} image processing methods, dictionary-learning-based spare representation achieves great performance in multi-focus image fusion. Most of the existing dictionary-learning-based multi-focus image fusion methods directly use the whole source images for dictionary learning. However, it incurs a high error rate and high computation cost in dictionary learning process by using the whole source images. This paper proposes a novel stochastic coordinate coding-based image fusion framework integrated with local density peaks. The proposed multi-focus image fusion method consists of three steps. First, source images are split into small image <b>patches,</b> then the <b>split</b> image <b>patches</b> are classified into a few groups by local density peaks clustering. Next, the grouped image patches are used for sub-dictionary learning by stochastic coordinate coding. The trained sub-dictionaries are combined into a dictionary for sparse representation. Finally, the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm is used to carry out sparse representation. After the three steps, the obtained sparse coefficients are fused following the max L 1 -norm rule. The fused coefficients are inversely transformed to an image by using the learned dictionary. The results and analyses of comparison experiments demonstrate that fused images of the proposed method have higher qualities than existing state-of-the-art methods...|$|R

In this paper, we study a robust phenomena observed in semi-arid ecosystems, by which localized vegetation <b>patches</b> <b>split</b> in a process called self-replication. Localized patches of vegetation are visible in nature at various spatial scales. Even though they have been described in literature, their growth mechanisms remain largely unexplored.

This growth mechanism is opposite to the desertification since it allows to repopulate territories devoid of vegetation.

The relationships among impervious surfaces, landscape pattern indices, and water balance components were also quantified.

To alleviate this issue, the windows can be arranged in an overlapping way, incurring in some data redundancy storage. Recently, tree representations have been used as an alternative to windowing in order to structure and store large amounts of remote sensing data.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a fast method to avoid cracks between two adjacent NURBS-surfaces which {{are part of}} a boundary-represented 3 D-object during the tessellation process. The surfaces are first divided into almost flat regions, then trimmings curves are <b>split</b> at the <b>patch</b> borders and finally intersection points are transferred to the opposite surface by using a priori connectivity information. This algorithm covers curved surfaces as well as curved surface boundaries. Since curvature elimination of 3 D boundary curves can’t be performed well in the parameter space, it is necessary to analyze 3 D curves directly. For systems where explicit knowledge of 3 D boundary curves is not available this step could be a time-consuming task. Our algorithm overcomes this problem by introducing points on the boundary only if the curvature of one of the opposite surfaces requires this, which finally leads to a common boundary polygon that corresponds to the boundary curve’s curvature. Additionally each step preserves the relation between the analytical and the polygonal model what offers several advantages. It allows to decide which points and triangles should be removed to create two kinds of topology preserving Level Of Detail (LOD).

Total numbers {{of magnetic}} processes are followed: 493 positive and 482 negative splittings, 536 positive and 535 negative mergings, 86 cancellations, and 3 emergences. Total numbers of emergence and cancellation are significantly smaller than those of splitting and merging. Further, frequency dependences of merging and splitting processes on flux content are investigated. Merging has a weak dependence on flux content only with a power- law index of 0. 28. Timescale for splitting {{is found to be}} independent of parent flux content before splitting, which corresponds to ∼ 33 minutes. It is also found that <b>patches</b> <b>split</b> into any flux contents with a same probability.

The horizontal band of NCAM immunoreactivity was not continuous, but <b>split</b> up into <b>patches</b> of NCAM immunoreactivity within groups of nerve cell bodies. When analysing the number of cells per unitary square in the rostrocaudal direction, a significant increase of positive cells was found in the rostral and middle thirds versus the caudal third of the reticular thalamic nucleus. Many of the cell bodies with NCAM immunoreactivity in their cell surface area showed cytoplasmic GABA immunoreactivity. In the three regions shown to contain NCAM immunoreactivity, proteins of the NCAM type may play a special role for the maintenance of the synaptic structure. The findings also suggest that the sulfated proteoglycans and NCAM can interact in the regulation of cell-cell interaction via adhesion. In the reticular thalamic nucleus NCAM molecules may be part of a set of cell-adhesion molecules involved in a structural organization of the nucleus, which allows it to {{play a key role in}} relating cortical maps to thalamic maps. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Space-saving, or collapsible, {{objects are}} {{ubiquitous}} {{in our living}} and working space. They can adjust configurations to either perform their intended functionality or save space, for example, while storing and shipping. This additional space-saving characteristic of changing forms makes collapsible objects more preferable than their non-collapsible counterparts, especially in environments where space is costly. Shape compaction is an important real-world design problem, where a 3 D object is geometrically modified, such {{that it can be}} more compactly stored by changing to a different configuration, while preserving its functionality and aesthetic. This thesis argues the need for computational tools to support shape compaction of 3 D objects and proposes novel algorithms to support the compaction via stacking and folding. The first problem is stackabilization [...] - making objects more amenable to stacking. As a group collapsing principle, a collection of shapes can cooperatively occupy less space when stacked than they do individually. Given a 3 D object and a stacking direction, a measure of stackability is defined to reflect the space-saving ratio of stacking the given object along the given stacking direction. The stackabilization algorithm deforms the input 3 D object to meet a target stackability score using energy minimization. This energy accounts for the scales of the deformation parameters as well as the preservation of per-existing geometric and structural properties in the objects. The second problem is foldabilization [...] - modifying the input 3 D object such that it can be folded into a flat configuration along a prescribed direction. Folding an object involves rearranging its parts via hinging; the folded part configuration usually occupies less space than the unfolded one. The input 3 D object is first abstracted into a scaffold, which consists of a collection of connected planar patches. The foldabilization algorithm minimizes the amount of modifications, e. g. shrinking and <b>split,</b> on these <b>patches</b> such that the modified scaffold can be folded into a flat configuration. Structure soundness is considered by allowing slanted folding and patch disconnection, which usually result in fewer splits on the input scaffold. The fully automatic foldabilization results can be computed at interactive speed. The prototypes can be fabricated while folded for cost-effective printing, and unfolded to show their usage configurations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the numerical simulation of creeping rays and {{their contribution to}} high frequency scattering problems. Creeping rays are a type of diffracted rays which are generated at the shadow line of the scatterer and propagate along geodesic paths on the scatterer surface. On a perfectly conducting convex body, they attenuate along their propagation path by tangentially shedding diffracted rays and losing energy. On a concave scatterer, they propagate {{on the surface and}} importantly, in the absence of dissipation, experience no attenuation. The study of creeping rays is important in many high frequency problems, such as design of sophisticated and conformal antennas, antenna coupling problems, radar cross section (RCS) computations and control of scattering properties of metallic structures coated with dielectric materials. First, assuming the scatterer surface can be represented by a single parameterization, we propose a new Eulerian formulation for the ray propagation problem by deriving a set of escape partial differential equations in a three-dimensional phase space. The equations are solved on a fixed computational grid using a version of fast marching algorithm. The solution to the equations contain information about all possible creeping rays. This information includes the phase and amplitude of the ray field, which are extracted by a fast post-processing. The advantage of this formulation over the standard Eulerian formulation is that we can compute multivalued solutions corresponding to crossing rays. Moreover, we are able to control the accuracy everywhere on the scatterer surface and suppress the problems with the traditional Lagrangian formulation. To compute all possible creeping rays corresponding to all shadow lines, the algorithm is of computational order O(N 3 log N), with N 3 being the total number of grid points in the computational phase space domain. This is expensive for computing the wave field for only one shadow line, but if the solutions are sought for many shadow lines (for many illumination angles), the phase space method is more efficient than the standard methods such as ray tracing and methods based on the eikonal equation. Next, we present a modification of the single-patch phase space method to a multiple-patch scheme in order to handle realistic problems containing scatterers with complicated geometries. In such problems, the surface is <b>split</b> into multiple <b>patches</b> where each patch has a well-defined parameterization. The escape equations are solved in each patch, individually. The creeping rays on the scatterer are then computed by connecting all individual solutions through a fast post-processing. We consider an application to mono-static radar cross section problems where creeping rays from all illumination angles must be computed. The numerical results of the fast phase space method are presented. QC 2010111...|$|R
