5|$|In the 17thcentury Civil Wars, townspeople of Poulton {{fought on}} both sides, {{although}} more {{men from the}} Fylde were {{on the side of}} the Royalists. No battles occurred in or close to Poulton but the area was affected with the rest of the county by the widespread poverty that resulted from the wars. In 1643 interest was <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> the parish when a large Spanish vessel dropped anchor off the coast at Rossall. The ship made no movement for several days but fired its guns occasionally. Locals initially feared an invasion, but eventually realised that the crew was in distress and had been signalling for help. The vessel was carrying ammunition for the Parliamentarian forces and the crew had become sick and feeble. The ship was brought by Royalists into the mouth of the River Wyre and the Earl of Derby marched from across the River Ribble. He ordered the ship to be burnt and the Spanish crew to be set free.|$|E
5|$|While maps {{drawn in}} ink on flat silk cloths {{have been found}} in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, Hunan province), the {{earliest}} known paper map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.|$|E
25|$|Interest in the moa's {{potential}} for revival was further <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> mid 2014 when New Zealand Member of Parliament Trevor Mallard suggested that bringing back some smaller species of moa within 50 years was a viable idea.

25|$|Softly, {{well before}} the winter dawn, the yellow monster lurched towards the grey façade. A lone rook <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> the tall beeches nearby, troubled by the {{relentless}} purring of powerful motors. Down beyond the stream, what remains of his ornamental garden, a few regal bamboo blades, trembled in the night breeze. A mighty arm nudged the building. There was no crash, not even a rumble. Masonry fell with a rustle and hiss of dust down ivy-clad walls, to thud in moss. Within the hour, Frescati was no more.|$|E
25|$|Scheme 2 is {{the newer}} {{synthesis}} route {{which was designed}} to make the reaction more direct and to produce better yields. This route uses L-glutamine rather than L-glutamic acid as a starting material and by letting it react with N-carbethoxyphthalimide gives N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine (4), with 50–70% yield. The substance 4 is then <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> a mixture with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) with enough 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to catalyze the reaction and heated to reflux for 15–18 hours. During the reflux thalidomide crystallizes out of the mixture. The final step gives 85–93% yield of thalidomide, bringing the total yield to 43–63%.|$|E

However, the race of Silvan Elves are the dominant dwellers of Mirkwood. Their homes lie deep in the forest (as recollected by Aragorn and Legolas when the Company of the Ring reached the Silverlode) in the Fellowship of the Ring.'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as if some memory <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> him...'|pages=329|chapter=Lothlórien}} Sauron however secretly built a stronghold {{in the region and}} slowly took the southern regions of the land from the elves without battle over time.

25|$|California pioneers after 1848 {{discovered}} {{an increasing number}} of oil seeps—oil seeping to the surface, especially in Humboldt, Colusa, Santa Clara, and San Mateo counties, and in the asphaltum seeps and bituminous residues in Mendocino, Marin, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties. In Southern California, large seeps in Ventura, Santa Barbara, Kern, and Los Angeles counties received the most attention. Interest in oil and gas seeps was <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> the 1850s and 1860s, becoming widespread after the 1859 commercial uses of oil were demonstrated in Pennsylvania. Kerosene quickly replaced whale oil for lighting, and lubricating oils became an essential product in the Machine Age. Other uses later in the 19th century included providing paving material for many roads and providing power for many steam locomotives and steam-powered shipping—replacing coal.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} at the moment when the earth opened up, Korah's sons were {{suspended}} in the air. When the sons of Korah saw the gaping abyss below {{on one side and the}} fire of Gehinnom on the other, they were unable to open their mouths to confess. But as soon as thoughts of repentance <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> their hearts, God accepted them. Whatever thoughts one of the sons developed, the others developed as well, so that all three were of one heart. The area around them split apart, but the spot on which each stood was not touched. They stood separately like three pillars. Moses, Aaron, and all the great scholars came to hear the song of the sons of Korah, and from this they learned to sing songs before God.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} leaving the wine to spend some contact with the lees {{has a long history}} in winemaking, being known to the Ancient Romans and {{described}} by Cato the Elder in the 2nd century BC. Today the practice is widely associated with any red wines that are barrel fermented, Muscadet, sparkling wine Champagne as well as Chardonnay produced in many wine regions across the globe. Typically when wines are left in contact with their lees, they are regularly <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> order to release the mannoproteins, polysaccharides and other compounds that were present in the yeast cell walls and membranes. This stirring also helps avoid the development of reductive sulfur compounds like mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide that can appear if the lees layer is more than 10cm (4inches) thick and undisturbed for more than a week.|$|E
25|$|In January 1985, Dahmer {{was hired}} as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights a week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an {{incident}} occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform fellatio upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition, the incident <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's gay bars, bookstores, and gay bathhouses. He is also known to have stolen a male mannequin from a store, which he briefly used for sexual stimulation before his grandmother, having discovered the item stowed in a closet, demanded that he discard it.|$|E

Whitney Pastorek from Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed {{review of}} the concert saying, [...] "Her onstage banter was at times a bit silly and the visuals occasionally lacking in coherent theme, but her voice was strong and refreshingly free of overbearing tracking vocals. For all her cocky bluster, perhaps the most undeniable aspect of Gaga's talent is this: The girl can, and does, sing."

2500|$|Puddling is {{the process}} of {{stirring}} pig iron with iron bars, exposing it to the air so that the carbon in the pig iron is oxidized and burns off. [...] This process creates steel. As practiced in the early and mid-19th century, puddling required great strength as well as skill. Because chemical testing of the molten iron had not yet been developed, puddlers relied on their long experience with steelmaking to determine whether {{too much or too little}} carbon had been oxidized. Puddling was also an extremely dangerous trade, as some steel processes required the molten metal to boil and bubble as the puddler <b>stirred</b> <b>in</b> scrap iron and puddlers were required to physically remove slag and drain pure steel out of furnaces for additional processing.|$|E
