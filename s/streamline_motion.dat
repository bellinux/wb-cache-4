40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electric}} {{field on the}} carrier motion and drift velocity in nanowire (NW) are presented in this paper. When the electric field is applied in NW, the electron is expected to move in anti-parallel direction to the electric field. This is so-called randomness motion is transformed into <b>streamlined</b> <b>motion</b> in extremely high electric field. The normalized Fermi energy and relative electron population {{as a function of}} electric field are examined for various degeneracies. It was found that the electric field has lesser influence on the relative electron population with the increased degeneracy. The drift velocity in NW is shown to increase with electric field until it reaches the saturation velocity. Two approximations have been made to simplify the theoretical equation. It is also shown in this paper that when the quantum emission is taken into account, the drift and saturation velocity degrades...|$|R
40|$|Virtual force {{approach}} is preferable for motion planning of mobile robots in dynamic environments. It composes virtual attractive forces to drive robots to destinations and virtual repulsive forces to steer robots away from neighbouring robots. However, most traditional methods use functions with limited controllable parameters, compromising design flexibility essential for smooth yet responsive robot motions. This paper proposes a spline-based method to enhance design flexibility of virtual forces that <b>streamline</b> robot <b>motions.</b> We {{take advantage of}} local controllability of interpolating cubic splines to generate desirable smooth virtual forces for robots. This merit facilitates responsive robot motions in dynamic situations. A case study of autonomous military robots is presented to validate the approach, in terms of enhanced motion safety and shortened operational time...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} significant development into chaotic mixing induced through periodic {{boundaries and}} twisting flows. Three-dimensional closed and throughput domains are shown to exhibit chaotic motion under both time periodic and time independent boundary motions, A property is developed originating from a signature of chaos, sensitive dependence to initial conditions, which successfully quantifies {{the degree of}} disorder withjn the mixing systems presented and enables comparisons of the disorder throughout ranges of operating parameters, This work omits physical experimental results but presents significant computational investigation into chaotic systems using commercial computational fluid dynamics techniques. Physical experiments with chaotic mixing systems are, by their very nature, difficult to extract information beyond the recognition that disorder does, does not of partially occurs. The initial aim of this work is to observe whether {{it is possible to}} accurately simulate previously published physical experimental results through using commercial CFD techniques. This is shown to be possible for simple two-dimensional systems with time periodic wall movements. From this, and subsequent macro and microscopic observations of flow regimes, a simple explanation is developed for how boundary operating parameters affect the system disorder. Consider the classic two-dimensional rectangular cavity with time periodic velocity of the upper and lower walls, causing two opposing <b>streamline</b> <b>motions.</b> The degree of disorder within the system is related to the magnitude of displacement of individual particles within these opposing streamlines. The rationale is then employed in this work to develop and investigate more complex three-dimensional mixing systems that exhibit throughputs and time independence and are therefore more realistic and a significant advance towards designing chaotic mixers for process industries. Domains inducing chaotic motion through twisting flows are also briefly considered. This work concludes by offering possible advancements to the property developed to quantify disorder and suggestions of domains and associated boundary conditions that are expected to produce chaotic mixing...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of streamlines {{is one of}} the most common methods for visualising fluid <b>motion.</b> <b>Streamlines</b> can be computed from the intersection of two nonparallel stream surfaces, which are iso-surfaces of dual stream functions. Stream surfaces are also useful to isolate part of the flow domain for detailed study. This paper introduces a technique for calculating dual stream functions for momentum fields that are defined analytically and depend on only two variables. For axi-symmetric flows, one of the dual stream functions is the well-known Stokes stream function. The analysis reduces the problem from the solution of partial differential equations to the solution of two ordinary differential equations. Example applications include the Moffat [17] vortex bubble, for which new solutions are presented...|$|R

We investigate two important, common fluid flow patterns from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, namely, swirl and tumble motion typical of automotive engines. We study and visualize swirl and tumble flow using three different flow visualization techniques: direct, geometric, and texture-based. When illustrating these methods side-by-side, we describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach within a specific spatial dimension and across multiple spatial dimensions typical of an engineer’s analysis. Our study is focused on steady-state flow. Based on this investigation we offer perspectives on where and when thes...|$|R
40|$|The induced {{electric}} field E⃗(x⃗) during magnetic flux entry in superconductors with arbitrary cross section Ω and general critical current law, has been evaluated by integration along the vortex penetration paths. Nontrivial flux <b>motion</b> <b>streamlines</b> are {{obtained from a}} variational statement of the critical state, which {{takes the form of}} an optimization problem on the finite element discretization of Ω. The generality of the theory allows to deal with physical conditions not considered before. In particular, it is shown that the boundary condition to be used for determining E⃗ is the knowledge of the locus E= 0 within the sample. This is emphasized for anisotropic materials in which the {{electric field}} is not parallel to the surface. Both numerical and analytical evaluations are presented for homogeneous materials with different geometries: convex and concave contours, samples with holes, variable curvature contours, and for anisotropic samples. In the isotropic case, discontinuities in the electric current paths are shown to be related to changing curvature of the sample's surface. Anisotropic samples display the same kind of discontinuities, even for constant surface curvature. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, accepted in J. Appl. Phy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new approach}} to particle (fluid element) pair turbulent diffusion in terms of streamline geometry. Our theory describes particle pair diffusion in statisti-cally self-similar turbulence. Specifically, we deal with particle motions in two-dimensional (2 D) turbulence, where the energy spectrum is proportional to k− 5 / 3 {{as a result of the}} in-verse energy cascade. The theory is developed based on observations from direct numerical simulations (DNS). First, we note that if the velocity field is frozen in time, the trajectories of particles coincide with <b>streamlines,</b> and the <b>motion</b> of particles can be described in terms of streamline geometry. Of course turbulence is never stationary, but one may choose a frame where the local velocity field is approximately stationary within some time scale. Indeed, this frame is the local (Lagrangian) frame moving with a coherent vortex with a relatively long lifetime. In order to define unambiguously the velocity of the local frame moving with a coherent vortex, in which streamlines are approximately persistent, we introduce zero-acceleration points, i. e. the points where a ≡ ∂u/∂t + u · ∇u = 0. There are two types (elliptic and hyperbolic) of zero-acceleration points with different streamline topologies around them. I...|$|R
40|$|Temperate {{seagrass}} beds can {{be found}} within intertidal and tidal areas of variable hydrodynamic forcing. To investigate the interaction between hydrodynamics and seagrass plants, Zostera noltii meadows were exposed {{to a range of}} combinations of waves and flow in a flume. Velocity profiles were obtained to observe the evolution of hydrodynamic forcing due to the presence of a seagrass canopy. Observations under flow without waves agreed with those of previous studies and showed that turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) {{at the top of the}} canopy increased with increasing flow velocity as well as with distance from the leading edge. The highest TKE values were achieved for the highest flow velocity without waves, and the presence of waves generally led to reduced TKE values. Profiles of time-averaged downstream velocity were not affected by the presence of waves. However, flow reduction near the bed increased with higher seagrass density, resulting in an S-shaped profile for the highest density and flow velocity. Underlying currents affected wave orbital velocities, causing a reduction of orbital diameters in the free-stream region. In the canopy region, this process was superimposed by the damping effect of the seagrass meadow, but only positive flow components were reduced by seagrass presence. <b>Streamlining</b> and oscillating <b>motion</b> of seagrass leaves were observed under flow and waves, respectively. These processes did not affect the wave/flow attenuation capacity of the meadow, which indicates that the ecosystem-engineering traits of seagrasses are not compromised by increased flow velocity or in the presence of waves...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a novel propulsion {{system for the}} third-generation Spherical Underwater Robot (SURIII), the improved propulsion system is designed and analyzed to verify its increased stability compared to the second-generation Spherical Underwater Robot (SURII). With the new propulsion system, the robot is not only symmetric on the X axis {{but also on the}} Y axis, which increases the flexibility of its movement. The new arrangement also reduces the space constraints of servomotors and vectored water-jet thrusters. This paper also aims to the hydrodynamic characteristic of the whole robot. According to the different situations of the surge and heave motion, two kinds of methods are used to calculate the drag coefficient for the SURIII. For surge motion, the drag coefficient can be determined by the Reynolds number. For heave motion, considering about the influences of edges and gaps of the SURIII, the drag coefficient needs to be calculated by the dynamic equation. In addition, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is carried out to estimate some parameters which cannot be measured. The pressure contours, velocity vectors and velocity <b>streamlines</b> for different <b>motions</b> are extracted from the post-processor in the CFD simulation. The drag coefficients of surge and heave motion are both calculated by the simulation results and compared with the chosen one by Reynolds number. Finally, an experiment is also conducted for measure the propulsive force of the multi-vectored water-jet thrusters by using a 6 -DoF load cell. The experimental results demonstrate the propulsive force is better than a previous version. Thus, the propulsive performance is better than before...|$|R
40|$|Bright optical nebulae are a {{relatively}} common feature of galaxy clusters {{with a central}} depression in their intracluster gas temperature suggestive of an X-ray cooling flow. In my thesis, I have measured, for the first time, the velocity field of nearly the entire optical nebula associated with NGC 1275, the central cD (giant elliptical) galaxy of the Perseus cluster. This nebula is the brightest example with the largest projected size in the sky. Our primary scientific objective is to address the physical processes {{that give rise to}} the complex morphology of this nebula, which comprises a multitude of mostly approximately radial but also a number of tangential emission-line _laments. This nebula spans up to ～ 140 kpc in the north-south direction, extending far beyond the half-light radius of NGC 1275. Popular models for the nature of the nebula invoke either an X-ray cooling flow, in which case the filaments should possess a velocity profile consistent with free fall, or gas drawn out from the central galaxy by buoyantly rising bubbles inflated by radio jets from the AGN, in which case the filaments should show a reversal in velocity along their lengths. We find that the velocity field of the nebula is incredibly complex, and in several important respects contradicts model predictions based on slit spectroscopy. We find that filaments previously thought to be very long integral structures actually comprise multiple shorter filaments that each have their own distinct kinematics. Furthermore, filaments that are apparently aligned and adjacent to each other often possess entirely different kinematics. We searched for filaments with velocity profiles consistent with free fall, but we could only find very few examples beyond the central bright nebular region where overlapping filaments complicate measurements of the individual filament kinematics. We also searched for filaments that show a reversal in velocity along their lengths, but again could find only several examples. Although the combination of a residual X-ray cooling flow and relatively cool gas drawn out by buoyant X-ray bubbles remains the most viable explanation for the nature of the nebula, both the morphology and kinematics of this nebula is complicated by the action of various X-ray bubbles that are currently expanding or rising through the nebula. As such, the velocity field of the filaments reflect the effects of the X-ray bubbles on the bulk flows within the intracluster medium, and trace <b>streamlines</b> that reveal <b>motions</b> in the surrounding X-ray gas. We point out evidences that support the idea that some filaments are being dragged by rising X-ray bubbles, others represent large-scale vortices behind bubbles, and yet others are draping the surface of and pushed outwards by expanding X-ray bubbles. published_or_final_versionPhysicsMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
