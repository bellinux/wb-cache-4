6000|$|... "'Jeff,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill</b> to me, 'you are {{a man of}} {{learning}} and education, besides having knowledge and information concerning not only rudiments but facts and attainments.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mousie,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> 'the {{hole in the}} wainscoting for yours. Your dogmas and inculcations {{sound to}} me like the last words of a bicycle pump. What has your high moral, elevator-service system of pillage brought you to? Penuriousness and want. Even Brother Peters, who insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with {{theories}} of commerce and trade, admitted he was on the lift. Both of you live by the gilded rule. Brother Peters,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> 'you'd better choose a slice of this embalmed currency. You're welcome.' ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>Bill</b> curled {{himself up}} in the hay, and George soon heard by his regular {{breathing}} that he was sound asleep.|$|R
6000|$|Bill nodded, and {{was walking}} away when Kells called after him: [...] "And <b>say,</b> <b>Bill,</b> don't <b>say</b> {{anything}} to Roberts. He's easily riled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bill? When you <b>say</b> <b>Bill,</b> do {{you mean}} Bill? Your brother Bill? My {{brother-in-law}} Bill? Jolly old William, the son and heir of the Brewsters?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Say, boys,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> 'less {{divide it}} up. Thar's {{thirteen}} of us. I can swaller a thirteenth of the yarn, {{if you can}} worry down the rest.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill.</b> [...] "In {{ten minutes}} I shall cross the Central, Southern and Middle Western States, and be legging it trippingly for the Canadian border." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much obliged, sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> and ’is ’ands trembled so as ’e could ’ardly ’old it, and ’e made {{to go off}} afore Jimmy come on deck.|$|E
60|$|KEITH. Great Scott! I'm not <b>saying</b> <b>Bill</b> {{ought to}} marry her. She's got to stand the racket. But your Dad {{will have a}} tough job to take up that position.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, {{the four}} of us," [...] Bert went on irrepressibly. [...] "The night's young. Let's make a time of it--Pabst's Cafe first, and then some. What you <b>say,</b> <b>Bill?</b> What you <b>say,</b> Saxon? Mary's game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing doing. I won't {{listen to}} it. I married you, and I'll {{take care of}} you. Nobody can <b>say</b> <b>Bill</b> Roberts' wife has to work. And I don't want to think it myself. Besides, it ain't necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much obliged, sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> and 'is 'ands trembled so as 'e could 'ardly 'old it, and 'e made {{to go off}} afore Jimmy come on deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't help it," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> {{catching}} Susan's bag, {{and tossing}} {{it in the}} air; [...] "I never did like to sit still, and that's why I hate Sundays." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang about arter {{the rest}} ’ave gone ashore, and trust to luck," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> looking at me. [...] "We’ll see ’ow the land lays when we draw our advance." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{bill has}} the support of the National Parks Conservation Association {{supported}} the <b>bill,</b> <b>saying</b> the <b>bill</b> [...] "protects both our outdoor heritage and our economic future for generations to come." ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>Bill</b> seized Larry O'Neil by the collar, and led that individual, in a {{state of}} {{helpless}} and wondering consternation, through a back door, where, however, instead of kicking him out, he released him, and suddenly changed his tone to an eager whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Smoke for ever! I <b>say,</b> <b>Bill,</b> {{open that}} there port a bit, else we'll be choked," [...] cried a stentorian voice, as Guy entered the little apartment, where some dozen of noisy sailors were {{creating}} the cloud, {{which was a}} little too strong for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "And if {{they find}} it you’ll go to prison," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> giving ’im a clump o’ the side o’ the ’ead, [...] "and you won’t like that, I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of opening it in my bunk," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill.</b> [...] "The perlice might want to examine it if we took it through the dock. Come on, Jimmy, old man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Brother bushrangers,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill</b> Bassett, 'never yet, in trouble, did I desert a pal. Hard by, in yon wood, I {{seem to see}} unfurnished lodgings. Let us {{go there}} and wait till dark.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but I {{heard he}} an' that lawyer of yours {{had a long}} chin about the business. <b>Say,</b> <b>Bill,</b> {{by the time you}} get out of this scrape you'll owe a pretty penny for law, I reckon. Why don't you try to make the company pay it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{supported}} {{the inclusion of}} gays and lesbians in Pennsylvania's Ethnic Intimidation and Institutional Vandalism Act, <b>saying</b> [...] "This <b>bill</b> is not about what ministers or Sunday School teachers <b>say.</b> This <b>bill</b> is about what thugs, hooligans, and murderers do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>say,</b> <b>Bill,</b> {{that your}} best chance {{would be to}} try and get work either in a brickfield or with a market-gardener. At any rate {{we should be able to}} get a talk for half an hour in the evening. I was always done at nine o'clock, and if we were both in work we could take a room together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It's {{part of my}} business,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill</b> Bassett, 'to play up to the ruffles when I {{want to make a}} riffle as Raffles. 'Tis loves {{that makes}} the bit go 'round. Show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty parlor-maid, and you might as well call the silver melted down and sold, and me {{spilling}} truffles and that Chateau stuff on the napkin under my chin, while the police are calling it an inside job just because the old lady's nephew teaches a Bible class. I first make an impression on the girl,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> 'and when she lets me inside I make an impression on the locks. But this one in Little Rock done me,' says he. 'She saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl, and when I came 'round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it was fast. And I had keys made for the doors upstairs. But, no sir. She had sure cut off my locks. She was a Delilah,' <b>says</b> <b>Bill</b> Bassett.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Lordy!' <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> 'had {{you forgot}} you {{was in the}} desert? Didn't you see Colonel Manna drop down right before your eyes? Don't you hear the {{rustling}} of General Raven's wings? I'm surprised at you, Elijah.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} Jimmy did?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> {{screwing}} {{up his nose}} at me. [...] "That little varmint is walking about worth six ’undered quid. Now you {{keep your mouth shut}} and I’ll make it worth your while." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Say,</b> <b>Bill,</b> I'm sending your MS. back by mail to-day. I kept it {{a little}} longer after you sent for it {{because one of the}} McClure & Phillips firm wanted to see it first. Everybody says it is full of good stuff, but thinks it should be put in a more {{connected}} shape by some skilful writer who has been trained to that sort work.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am innocent," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "and what I {{have got}} to live for is to clear myself from this charge. Mr. Wakefield said this letter would not be of value {{one way or the}} other, and if I were to <b>say</b> <b>Bill</b> wrote it he might insist upon Bill's being arrested, and he might find it just as hard to prove his innocence as I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{gaining the}} deck, I beheld a small {{steamboat}} passing close under our stern, {{filled with a}} number of elderly-looking gentlemen, who eyed us with a very critical expression of countenance. I had a pretty good guess who these gentlemen were; but had I been entirely ignorant, I should soon have been enlightened by the remark of a sailor, who whispered to his comrade, [...] "I <b>say,</b> <b>Bill,</b> them's the great guns!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thankee, sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> ’ardly able to {{keep from}} dancing, [...] "and I’ll ’and over the two pounds when we’re paid off. I shall keep it all my life, sir, in memory {{of you and your}} kindness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> [...] "hurry back, Sam, {{as soon as}} you can. I wish we hadn't {{made the}} ransom more than a thousand. Say, you quit kicking me or I'll get up and warm you good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you’ll {{be searched}} arter you’ve stepped ashore," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Bill,</b> [...] "and you won’t be {{allowed on the}} ship ag’in. You’ll lose it all by being greedy, whereas if you go shares with us you’ll ’ave two ’undered pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it, Miss Agnes, sure enough--at least my son William will. I {{am getting}} {{too old for}} riding. He is at home at present; I will take one of master's horses and bring him out quietly, and William will do just as you say; and if master should come into the stable--which he won't do {{at that time of}} day--I will <b>say</b> <b>Bill</b> has taken him round to have a shoe put on." ...|$|R
50|$|Trump {{acknowledged}} {{making the}} remarks, but tried to deflect by <b>saying</b> that <b>Bill</b> and Hillary Clinton had {{said and done}} worse.|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{the teacher}} might <b>say,</b> now <b>say</b> <b>bill</b> without the [...]" [...] Students should respond with [...] There are other phonemic {{awareness}} activities, such as sound substitution, where students are instructed to replace one sound with another, sound addition, where students add sounds to words, and sound switching, where students manipulate {{the order of}} the phonemes.
