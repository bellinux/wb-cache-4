5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>die.</b> He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>die</b> of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E

Venu requests Murali to marry Seetha in case the operation is unsuccessful as he does not wish for his wife to become a widow. Seetha becomes infuriated when she discovers Venu's request and tells Murali that if Venu dies, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>die</b> as well.

5|$|In 1988, Norman broke a hip and {{her health}} began to decline. Although she {{had promised to}} live until 2001, her deteriorating {{condition}} made her followers suspect <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>die</b> before then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events {{in which they had}} rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001.|$|E
5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>die</b> young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>die</b> herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E

The decision was made not to medically intervene, and she died on June 29, 2003, a month after her 96th birthday at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut.

500|$|The storyline used {{elements}} of suspense, {{created by the}} use of [...] "shared secrets" [...] between Peggy and her daughter-in-law Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and whether <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>die,</b> but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: [...] "such devises [...] pathos to Peggy's treatment path. Audiences [...] that she [...] terrified and about to discover her biopsy results, but must watch as she is casually castigated by her son Grant for pestering his wife Tiffany to accompany her to 'the dentist'." [...] Hospital scenes were also played for narrative pace to build tension and drama.|$|E

So as long as they want me, I'm happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family." [...] She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the News of the World reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress's 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was {{very much a part of}} plans for the series' upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations.
