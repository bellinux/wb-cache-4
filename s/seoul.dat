5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of defenses south of the capital city, General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered I, IX, and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive against the Chinese forces on 25 January, Operation Thunderbolt. The three corps advanced north with IX Corps {{at the center of}} the line, on both sides of the Han River. The corps were to advance steadily northward, protected by heavy artillery and close air support, until they captured <b>Seoul.</b> IX Corps was tasked with capturing Chipyong-ni, southeast of <b>Seoul</b> while providing support to the other two corps. However, it encountered stiff resistance from Chinese forces dug into the hilly country around Chipyong-ni and was still bogged down in combat by 2 February. Chinese forces had established machine gun nests in the hillside and mined roads to slow the corps' advance. In response, X Corps launched Operation Roundup, hoping to take pressure off of IX Corps and to force the Chinese to abandon <b>Seoul.</b>|$|E

5|$|On August 4, the FEAF began B-29 interdiction {{attacks against}} all key bridges {{north of the}} 37th Parallel in Korea, and on August 15 some light bombers and fighter-bombers joined in the interdiction {{campaign}}. This campaign sought the destruction of 32 rail and highway bridges on the three main transportation routes across Korea: the line from Sinanju south to P'yongyang and northeast to Wonsan on the east coast; the line just below the 38th Parallel from Munsan-ni through <b>Seoul</b> to Ch'unch'on to Chumunjin-up on the east coast; and the line from <b>Seoul</b> south to Choch'iwon and east to Wonju to Samch'ok on the east coast. The interdiction campaign marked nine rail yards, including those at <b>Seoul,</b> P'yongyang, and Wonsan, for attack, and the ports of Inch'on and Wonsan to be mined. This interdiction program, if effectively executed, would slow and perhaps critically disrupt the movement of North Korean supplies along the main routes south to the battlefront.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of January 4, the KPA I Corps, the PVA 38th Corps and the PVA 50th Corps entered <b>Seoul,</b> but they were only greeted by an empty city in flames. Most of the civilians had either fled south through the frozen Han River or evacuated to the nearby countryside. The South Korean government in <b>Seoul,</b> which was reduced to essential personnel before the battle, also left the city with little difficulties. A Chinese platoon reached the <b>Seoul</b> City Hall at about 13:00 and raised the North Korean flag. On January 5, Peng ordered the PVA 50th Corps and the KPA I Corps to seize Gimpo and Incheon while instructing all other units {{to rest on the}} northern bank of the Han River. By January 7, Peng halted the Third Phase Campaign due to troop exhaustion and to prevent a repeat of the Incheon landing.|$|E
