40|$|Analyzing human faces from visual {{data has}} been one of the most active re-search areas in the {{computer}} vision community. However, it is a very challenging problem in unconstrained environments due to variations in pose, illumination, ex-pression, occlusion and blur between training and testing images. The task becomes even more difficult when only a limited number of images per subject is available for modeling these variations. In this dissertation, different techniques for performing classification of human faces as well as other facial attributes such as expression, age, gender, and head pose in uncontrolled settings are investigated. In the first part of the dissertation, a method for reconstructing the virtual frontal view from a given non-frontal face image using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and an efficient variant of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm is in-troduced.

40|$|Loom Speed and Tension to Reduce Warp and Weft Breaks in Air Jet Weaving is a {{published}} article of the Textile Technology department. The {{study sought to}} identify correct values of loom speed and warp tension suitable for weaving 100 % cotton yarn on Dornier double beam Air Jet Looms, AWSE 2 /E type. The causes <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> breaks are, poor quality yarn, uncontrolled temperature and humidity, uncontrolled weaving tension and loom speed. The experiments were conducted to determine warp and weft breaks at i) varying warp tension (50 cN to 85 cN) and constant speed (560 rpm,), ii) at constant warp tension(80 cN) and different loom speed (520 to 560 rpm). The company where {{the study was conducted}} is referred to as ?Company A?. Temperature and relative humidity and were kept constant at 27 ? and 75 % respectively. The yarn quality was good (11 cN/tex), according to the Ulster Statistics standard levels which was the exact tenacity of the 30 tex yarn used at ?Company A?. The results showed that warp and weft breaks occur even if the maximum warp tension during weaving is lower than the breaking strength of the yarn. A combination of high loom speed (560 rpm) and high tension (80 cN) lead to increased breaks, but breaks become reduced with the reduction in tension to 70 cNeven if the machine speed was maintained at 560 rpm. Above that tension, warp breaks start to increase. The number <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> breaks was also found to increase with the loom speed. Weft breaks also occurred due to entanglement at low warp tension (50 cN). Adjustment <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> tension and loom speed can help to determine the optimum values <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> tension and loom speed to be used {{in order to reduce the}} number <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> breaks for individual Air Jet Looms.

We aim to explore the optical scattering-induced polarization that emerges from clumpy and warped dusty tori to check whether they can fit the unified model predictions. Methods. We ran polarized radiative transfer simulations in a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>warped</b> and non-warped clumpy tori to explore the differences induced by distorted dust distributions. We then included warped tori in a more complex model representative of an AGN to check, using polarimetry and imaging methods, whether warps can reproduce the expected polarization dichotomy between Seyfert-I and Seyfert-II AGN. Results. The main results from our simulations highlight that isolated warped structures imprint the polarization degree and angle with distinctive signatures at Seyfert-I orientations. Included in an AGN model, the signatures <b>of</b> <b>warps</b> are easily (but not always) washed out by multiple scattering in a clumpy environment. Imaging polarimetry may help to detect warped tori, but we prove that warps can exist in AGN circumnuclear regions without contradicting observations. Conclusions. Two warped tori with a non-significant difference in geometry in terms of photometry or spectroscopy can have entirely different signatures in polarimetry.

50|$|A simple loom {{which has}} its roots in ancient civilizations {{consists}} of two sticks or bars between which the warps are stretched. One bar is attached to a fixed object, and the other to the weaver usually by means of a strap around the back. On traditional looms, the two main sheds are operated by means of a shed roll over which one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>warps</b> pass, and continuous string heddles which encase each <b>of</b> the <b>warps</b> in the other set. The weaver leans back and uses his or her body weight to tension the loom. To open the shed controlled by the string heddles, the weaver relaxes tension on the warps and raises the heddles.

Width is limited to how far the weaver can reach from side to side to pass the shuttle. Warp faced textiles, often decorated with intricate pick-up patterns woven in complementary and supplementary warp techniques are woven by indigenous peoples today around the world.
