5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} to their <b>seats</b> <b>for</b> the Thirty-third Congress.

Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E
