5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density,</b> and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E

25|$|Of decisive {{importance}} for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either {{be caused by a}} reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments {{under the influence of the}} external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1cm3 cube of quartz with 2kN (500lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V.|$|E

40|$|Several {{theories}} {{claim that}} ion±ion correlations {{play an important}} role in the electric double layer of colloids. One of the most outstanding predictions is overcharging, which would take place at high electrolyte concentrations and <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities.</b> The counterion concentration next to the surface can become so large that the particle charge is overcompensated and the overcharging occurs.

40|$|We {{examine the}} force between two equally <b>charged</b> <b>surfaces</b> that is {{mediated}} by rod-like counterions of varying length and valency.

We map out the values of the plate separations and <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities</b> where the force between the plates is attractive. For sufficiently high <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities</b> and sufficiently large counterion lengths, there are two distinct regions of attraction between the surfaces: one at separations of about the counterion length that is associated with the "bridging'' of the two surfaces by the counterions and another at lower separations that is due to correlations between the counterions.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the cohesion of cement paste occurs through {{the formation of a}} network of nanoparticles of a calcium-silicate-hydrate (“C-S-H”). However, the mechanism by which these particles develop this cohesion has not been established. Here we propose a dielectric continuum model which includes all ionic interactions within a dispersion of C-S-H particles. It takes into account all co- and counterions explicitly (with pure Coulomb interactions between them and with the surfaces) and makes no further assumptions concerning their hydration or their interactions with the surface sites. At high <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities,</b> the model shows that the <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> of C-S-H particles is overcompensated by Ca 2 + ions, giving a reversal of the apparent particle charge.
