5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of <b>symbolism,</b> identifying three characteristic features of religious <b>symbolism</b> which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious <b>symbolism</b> has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious <b>symbolism</b> concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E

5|$|Looking at <b>symbolism</b> in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He {{explains}} that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a hierarchy of being, and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting <b>symbolism</b> in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious <b>symbolism</b> was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were frequently}} politicised, {{either by the}} debates over their construction and design, or by the <b>symbolism</b> incorporated into them. Even where {{attempts were made to}} ensure political neutrality, as in France where the inscriptions on memorials were usually deliberately neutral, avoiding political controversy, national politics influenced the <b>symbolism</b> and messages incorporated into the memorials.|$|E

5000|$|Karl Anton Nowotny (June 21, 1904, Hollabrunn - December 31, 1978, Vienna) was an Austrian ethnographer, art {{historian}} and academic, specialising {{in the study}} of Mesoamerican cultures.

5|$|The {{widespread}} use of Christian <b>symbolism</b> led to questions about how to produce memorials suitable for non-Christians. Lutyens attempted {{to solve this problem}} for the IWGC through the design of the Stone of Remembrance, or War Stone. This was a large, simple stone, intended to resemble an altar and evoke the theme of sacrifice. In practice, many commentators felt it resembled a sarcophagus. Lutyens wanted it to avoid conventional Christian <b>symbolism</b> and based it on designs in Chinese Ming tombs. One of Lutyens' arguments in favour of his design was that explicit Christian <b>symbolism</b> excluded the Indian and Jewish communities and atheists. The IWGC designs for the Indian and Chinese war cemeteries in Europe deliberately did not use Christian imagery – although, as historian Xu Guoqi notes, the Chinese role in the Allied armies remains largely uncommemorated through memorials.|$|E
5|$|This is an {{apparently}} rare example of Western Australian swan <b>symbolism</b> being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only {{an echo of}} its formerly symbolic values. None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is an ironic transformation in the <b>symbolism</b> of a bird that that was for so long thought to be non-migratory.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, <b>symbolism,</b> or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; <b>symbolism</b> is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E

The land with “vintura” and “sura” (“fortune” and “difference”, vv. 13{17} and 14{18} respectively). The colours with “ard” (“land”) itself (v. 15{19}).|$|R

5|$|The Shaiva Upanishads are a {{group of}} 14 minor Upanishads of Hinduism {{variously}} dated from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the 17th century.

5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal <b>symbolism</b> {{throughout}} the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove <b>symbolism</b> and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E
5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian <b>symbolism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} systems, {{that of the}} {{political}} order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness {{of the city was}} historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of <b>symbolism,</b> successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and <b>symbolism</b> of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected less for its cardinal direction than for {{the extent to which it}} was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>symbolisms</b> of the house, for example, {{relate to}} the gonjong {{reaching}} to god and the dindiang tapi, which is traditionally made of plaited strips of bamboo, symbolizing the strength and utility of the community which is formed when individual Minangkabau {{become part of the}} larger community instead of standing alone.|$|R
