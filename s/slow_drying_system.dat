40|$|The loss of {{benefits}} after re-drying {{is one of the}} drawbacks of the seed priming technique. Different types of stresses have been used before re-drying to preserve the priming benefits. This process may be seen as promoting cross tolerance to increase the defense mechanisms that prevent loss of viability in seeds primed after drying. We tested the effect of some stresses to induce cross-tolerance and different drying conditions with the aim of maintaining priming benefits in melon seeds. The seeds were primed in an aerated KNO 3 solution (0. 35 M), - 1. 7 MPa, 25 &# 176;C, in the dark for six days. The primed seeds were then submitted to <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> fast drying, cold shock + <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> cold shock + fast drying, heat shock + <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> heat shock + fast <b>drying,</b> PEG + <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> PEG + fast <b>drying,</b> ABA + <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> ABA + fast drying and no drying (planted directly after priming).

To investigate adaptations in protein profile in association with the acquisition of desiccation tolerance in isolated, immature maize embryos, we applied in situ Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. In fresh, viable, 20 - and 25 -DAP embryo axes, the shapes of the different amide-I bands were identical, and this was maintained after flash drying. On rapid drying, the 20 -DAP axes had a reduced relative proportion of α-helical protein structure and lost viability. Rapidly dried 25 -DAP embryos germinated (74 %) and had a protein profile similar to the fresh control axes. On <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> the α-helical contribution in both the 20 - and 25 -DAP embryo axes increased compared with that in the fresh control axes, and survival of desiccation was high. The protein profile in dry, mature axes resembled that after <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> of the immature axes. Rapid drying resulted in an almost complete loss of membrane integrity in the 20 -DAP embryo axes and much less so in the 25 -DAP axes. After <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> low plasma membrane permeability ensued in both the 20 - and 25 -DAP axes. We conclude that <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> of excised, immature embryos leads to an increased proportion of α-helical protein structures in their axes, which coincides with additional tolerance of desiccation stress...|$|R

40|$|The desiccation-tolerant {{state in}} seeds is {{associated}} {{with high levels of}} certain sugars and maturation proteins. The aim of this work was to evaluate the contributions of these components to desiccation tolerance in soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merrill cv Chippewa 64). When axes of immature seeds (34 d after flowering) were excised and gradually dried (6 d), desiccation tolerance was induced. By contrast, seeds held at high relative humidity for the same period were destroyed by desiccation. Maturation proteins rapidly accumulated in the axes whether the seeds were slowly dried or maintained at high relative humidity. During <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> sucrose content increased to five times the level present in the axes of seeds held at high relative humidity (128 versus 25 μg/axis, respectively). Stachyose content increased dramatically from barely detectable levels upon excision to 483 μg/axis during <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> but did not increase significantly when seeds were incubated at high relative humidity. Galactinol was the only saccharide that accumulated to higher levels in axes from seeds incubated at high relative humidity relative to axes from seeds that were slowly dried. This suggests that <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> serves to induce the accumulation of the raffinose series sugars at a point after galactinol biosynthesis.

Slow-dried, non-ABA-treated embryos had low oligosaccharide to sucrose ratios, an increased proportion of ß-sheet protein secondary structures and broad membrane phase transitions extending over a temperature range of more than 60 °C, suggestive of irreversible phase separations. The spin probe study showed evidence of imbibitional damage, which could be alleviated by prehydration in humid air. These observations emphasize the importance of appropriate drying and prehydration protocols for the survival and storage of somatic embryos.

The first mechanism, which is light-induced in hydrated thalli, is sensitive to inhibition by dithiothreitol. It {{is controlled by the}} protonation of a thylakoid protein.

A third mechanism is based on the reversible photo-accumulation of a radical that acts as a quencher of excitation energy in reaction centres of photosystem II.

40|$|Plant somatic embryos usually lack {{desiccation}} tolerance. They may acquire such a tolerance upon preculture in {{the presence}} of abscisic acid (ABA), followed by <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> but not fast drying. ABA causes torpedo-shaped somatic embryos to lose their chlorophyll, suspend growth, exhibit low rates of respiration, and maintain elevated sucrose contents. The subsequent <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> leads to a partial conversion of sucrose into oligosaccharides and the expression of dehydrin transcripts. Slow-dried, desiccation-tolerant somatic embryos have stable membranes, retain their native protein secondary structure, and have a densely packed cytoplasmic glassy matrix. Fast-dried, desiccation-sensitive somatic embryos experience some loss of phospholipids and an increase in free fatty acids. Their proteins show signs of denaturation and aggregation, and the glassy matrix has reduced hydrogen bonding. The reduced conversion of sucrose into oligosaccharides appears not to underlie dehydration injury. Proteins in slow-dried somatic embryos, not pretreated with ABA, also show signs of denaturation, which might be attributed to low sugar contents. We conclude that by reducing cellular metabolism, ABA maintains high sugar contents. These sugars contribute to the stability of membranes, proteins, and the cytoplasmic glassy matrix, whereas <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> permits a further fine tuning of this stability. Partitioning of endogenous amphiphiles from the cytoplasm into membranes during drying may cause membrane perturbance, although it might confer protection to membranes in the case of amphiphilic antioxidants. The perturbance appears to be effectively controlled in desiccation-tolerant systems but not in sensitive systems, for which we suggest dehydrins are responsible.

To follow the changes in membrane integrity and cellular ultrastructure, an electron spin resonance (ESR) spin probe technique and low temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) were used. ESR data indicated that during development, the relative amount of cells with intact membranes decreased and became almost zero at the stage of mass maturity, i. e. several days {{before the onset of}} maturation drying. This suggests that the death of starchy endosperm cells is a developmental phenomenon rather than one induced by water loss. Even at 8 days after anthesis (daa), early in the differentiation phase, a considerable proportion of endosperm cells had already lost plasma membrane integrity. Comparison of ESR data with LTSEM micrographs revealed that the loss of plasma membrane integrity occurred early in the starch accumulation process, from which it was concluded that the programmes of starch accumulation and developmental death are simultaneously switched on. When the differentiation into starchy endosperm was arrested by premature <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> of kernels on the cut ear, meristematic cells (aleurone initials) acquired desiccation tolerance as assessed by the combination of the spin probe technique and LTSEM. In contrast, fast drying caused immediate death of these cells. Thus, meristematic endosperm cells have the competence to acquire desiccation tolerance. This occurs upon premature <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> or during normal differentiation into aleurone cells, but is lost when the cells differentiate into starchy endosperm...|$|R
