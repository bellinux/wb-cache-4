40|$|Despite {{preventive}} {{strategies and}} increased awareness, a {{high incidence of}} respiratory viral infections still occur in patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs) and in recipients of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Pro-gression of these viral infections to lower respiratory tract may prove fatal, especially in HCT recipients. Increas-ing evidence on the successful use of ribavirin (alone or in combination with immunomodulators) for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections in HM patients and HCT recipients is available from retro-spective studies; however, prospective clinical trials are necessary to establish its efficacy with confidence. The impact on progression to pneumonitis and/or mortality of treating parainfluenza virus infections with available (ribavirin) or investigational (DAS 181) antiviral agents still needs to be determined. Influenza infections have been successfully treated with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir or zanamivir); however, the efficacy of these agents for influenza pneumonia has not been established, and immunocompromised patients are highly susceptible to emergence of antiviral drug resistance, most probably due to prolonged viral <b>shedding.</b> <b>Infection</b> control measures and an appreciation of the complications following respiratory viral infections in immuno-compromised patients remain crucial for reducing transmission. Future studies should focus on strategies to identify patients at high risk for increased morbidity and mortality from these infections and to determine the efficacy of novel or available antiviral drugs...|$|E

Even if T. vaginalis increases the risk of HIV transmission by a small amount, this could translate into an important amplifying effect since Trichomonas is so common.

40|$|Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the leading}} cause of {{childhood}} lower respiratory infection, yet viable therapies are lacking. Two major challenges have stalled antiviral development: ethical difficulties in performing pediatric proof-of-concept studies and the prevailing concept that the disease is immune-mediated rather than being driven by viral load. Objectives: The development of ahumanexperimental wild-type RSV infection model to address these challenges. Methods: Healthy volunteers (n 5 35), in five cohorts, received increasing quantities (3. 0 – 5. 4 log plaque-forming units/person) of wild-type RSV-A intranasally. Measurements andMain Results: Overall, 77 %of volunteers consistently <b>shed</b> virus. <b>Infection</b> rate, viral loads, disease severity, and safety were similar between cohorts and were unrelated to quantity of RSV received. Symptomsbegan near the time of initial viral detection, peaked in severity near when viral load peaked, and subsided as viral loads (measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction) slowly declined. Viral loads correlated significantly with intranasal proinflammatory cytokine concentrations (IL- 6 and IL- 8). Increased viral load correlated consistently with increases inmultiple different diseasemeasurements (symptoms, physical examination, and amount of nasal mucus). Conclusions:Viralloadappears todrive diseasemanifestations inhumans with RSV infection. The observed parallel viral and disease kinetics support a potential clinical benefit of RSV antivirals.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} {{with the goal of}} adding as much information as possible about the role of pigeons (Columba livia) and chickens (Gallus gallus) in Newcastle disease virus epidemiology. These species were submitted to direct experimental infection with Newcastle disease virus to evaluate interspecies transmission and virus-host relationships. The results obtained in four experimental models were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for detection of virus shedding. These techniques revealed that both avian species, when previously immunized with a low pathogenic Newcastle disease virus strain (LaSota), developed high antibody titers that significantly reduced virus <b>shedding</b> after <b>infection</b> with a highly pathogenic Newcastle disease virus strain (São Joao do Meriti) and that, in chickens, prevent clinical signs. Infected pigeons shed the pathogenic strain, which was not detected in sentinel chickens or control birds. When the presence of Newcastle disease virus was analyzed in tissue samples by RT-PCR, in both species, the virus was most frequently found in the spleen. The vaccination regimen can prevent clinical disease in chickens and reduce viral shedding by chickens or pigeons.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infections {{occurring}} among vaccinated persons (vaccine failures) {{are known}} to occur in vaccines with imperfect efficacy. Failures among vaccinated children who were infected with vaccine-matched influenza B virus strain have not been adequately characterized. METHODS: Taking advantage of a randomized controlled trial of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV), the viral shedding and clinical symptoms associated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed influenza B infection and serum hemaggluttination inhibiting antibody response to vaccine were compared between children 6 and 17 years receiving TIV and placebo. RESULTS: Vaccine failures were observed to show lower antibody response to TIV compared with other vaccine recipients. We {{did not find any}} evidence that vaccination reduced the severity or duration of clinical symptoms of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed vaccine-matched influenza B infections. Vaccination was not observed to alter viral load or shedding duration. CONCLUSIONS: TIV was not observed to ameliorate clinical symptoms or viral shedding among vaccine failures compared with infected placebo recipients. Lower antibody response might have explained vaccine failure and also lack of effect in reducing clinical symptoms and viral <b>shedding</b> upon <b>infection.</b> Our results are based on a randomized controlled trial of split virus inactivated vaccine and may not be applicable to other vaccine types.

We obtained 6. 5 -fold coverage of a Brucella melitensis genome. Sequence reads from this genome showed signatures typical of ancient or aged DNA. Despite the relatively low coverage, {{we were able to}} use information from single-nucleotide polymorphisms to place the medieval pathogen genome within a clade of B. melitensis strains that included the well-studied Ether strain and two other recent Italian isolates.

40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1) is {{an important}} pathogen of cattle, and infection is usually initiated in the ocular or nasal cavity. Like other alphaherpesviruses, BHV- 1 establishes latency in sensory neurons but {{has the potential of}} reactivating from latency and spreading. The only abundant viral transcript expressed during latency is the latency-related (LR) RNA, which is alternatively spliced in trigeminal ganglia during acute infection (L. R. Devireddy and C. Jones, J. Virol. 72 : 7294 – 7301, 1998). LR gene products inhibit cell cycle progression (Y. Jiang, A. Hossain, M. T. Winkler, T. Holt, A. Doster, and C. Jones, J. Virol. 72 : 8133 – 8142, 1998) and chemically induced apoptosis (J. Ciacci-Zannela, M. Stone, G. Henderson, and C. Jones. J. Virol. 73 : 9734 – 9740, 1999). Although these studies suggest that LR gene products {{play an important role in}} the latency/pathogenesis of BHV- 1, construction of a mutant is necessary to test this hypothesis. Because the bICP 0 gene overlaps and is antisense to the LR gene, it was necessary to mutate the LR gene without altering bICP 0 expression. This was accomplished by inserting three stop codons near the beginning of the LR RNA, thus interfering with expression of proteins expressed by the LR RNA. The LR mutant virus grew with wild-type (WT) efficiency in bovine kidney (MDBK) cells and expressed bICP 0 at least as efficiently as WT BHV- 1 or the LR rescued virus. When calves were infected with the LR mutant, we observed a dramatic decrease (3 to 4 log units) in ocular <b>shedding</b> during acute <b>infection</b> relative to WT or the LR rescued virus. In contrast, shedding of the LR mutant from the nasal cavity was not significantly different from that of the WT or the LR rescued virus. Calves infected with the LR mutant exhibited mild clinical symptoms, but they seroconverted. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in calves infected with the LR mutant, confirming reduced growth. In summary, this study suggests that an LR protein promotes ocular <b>shedding</b> during acute <b>infection</b> of calves...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUpon infection, the genomes of herpesviruses {{undergo a}} {{striking}} {{transition from a}} non-nucleosomal structure to a chromatin structure. The rapid assembly and modulation of nucleosomes during the initial stage of infection results in an overlay of complex regulation that requires interactions of a plethora of chromatin modulation components. For herpes simplex virus, the initial chromatin dynamic is dependent on viral and host cell transcription factors and coactivators that mediate the balance between heterochromatic suppression of the viral genome and the euchromatin transition that allows and promotes the expression of viral immediate early genes. Strikingly similar to lytic infection, in sensory neurons this dynamic transition between heterochromatin and euchromatin governs the establishment, maintenance, and reactivation from the latent state. Chromatin dynamics in both the lytic infection and latency-reactivation cycles provides opportunities to shift the balance using small molecule epigenetic modulators to suppress viral <b>infection,</b> <b>shedding,</b> and reactivation from latency...|$|R
40|$|Human {{complement}} activation by cercariae and schistosomula of {{the human}} parasite Schistosoma mansoni was studied in vitro. Cercariae are composed of tails which are <b>shed</b> after <b>infection</b> of the host and bodies which transform into the larvae or schistosomula after infection. After incubation in fresh normal human serum (NHS), cercarial tails bound more anti-C 3 antibodies than did cercarial bodies (CB), and the tails were rapidly lysed, while the attached CB remained intact. Complement activation by cercariae was dependent on the alternative pathway but was independent of antibody, as shown by C 3 deposition by hypogammaglobulinemic human sera. By transmission microscopy, the fibrillar glycocalyx on both CB and tails was stained by NHS but not by heat-inactivated serum (HI-NHS). The glycocalyx was labeled with periodate and tritiated borohydride, and parasites were incubated in NHS and HI-NHS. After solubilization, the labeled glycocalyx on organisms incubated in NHS but not HI-NHS bound anti-C 3 antibodies. Of the CB incubated with eserine sulfate to prevent transformation, 78 % +/- 10 % were dead after culture for 24 h in NHS. In contrast, 21 % +/- 12 % of the CB were dead after culture in HI-NHS. Schistosomula incubated in NHS bound 37 % {{of the amount of}} anti-C 3 antibodies bound by cercariae but were not killed by NHS. In conclusion, the cercarial glycocalyx activated human complement, and schistosomula were less susceptible to killing than cercariae because they had less glycocalyx and activated less complement...|$|R

40|$|A G protein-coupled {{receptor}} agonist, angiotensin II (AngII), induces epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF) receptor (EGFR) transactivation possibly through metalloprotease- dependent, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) shedding. Here, we have investigated signal transduction of this process by using COS 7 cells expressing an AngII receptor, AT 1. In these cells AngII-induced EGFR transactivation was completely inhibited by pretreatment with a selective HB-EGF inhibitor, or with a metalloprotease inhibitor. We also developed a COS 7 cell line permanently expressing a HB-EGF construct tagged with alkaline phosphatase, which enabled us to measure HB-EGF shedding quantitatively. In the COS 7 cell line AngII stimulated release of HB-EGF. This effect was mimicked by treatment either with a phospholipase C activator, a Ca 2 ionophore, a metalloprotease activator, or H 2 O 2. Conversely, pretreatment with an intracellular Ca 2 antagonist or an antioxidant blocked AngII-induced HB-EGF <b>shedding.</b> Moreover, <b>infection</b> of an adenovirus encoding an inhibitor of Gq markedly reduced EGFR transactivation and HB-EGF shedding through AT 1. In this regard, AngII-stimulated HB-EGF shedding was abolished in an AT 1 mutant that lacks Gq protein coupling. However, in cells expressing AT 1 mutants that retain Gq protein coupling, AngII is still able to induce HB-EGF shedding. Finally, the AngII-induced EGFR transactivation was attenuated in COS 7 cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive mutant of ADAM 17. From these data we conclude that AngII stimulates a metalloprotease ADAM 17 -dependent HB-EGF shedding through AT 1 /Gq/phospholipase C-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca 2 and reactive oxygen species production, representing a key mechanism indispensable for EGFR transactivation...|$|R

JCV was detected in seven patients (6. 8 %) (31 / 1487 whole blood samples) at a median time of 139 days post-transplant. The median JC virus load of the first positive DNA blood sample was 3. 4 log 10 copies/mL (1. 9 - 5. 7 log 10 copies/mL). Induction therapy were either anti-CD 25 monoclonal antibodies (n= 5) or antithymocyte globulins (n= 2).

40|$|International audienceAbstractCattle are {{the most}} {{important}} reservoir for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a subset of shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC) capable of causing life-threatening infectious diseases in humans. In cattle, Shiga toxins (Stx) suppress the immune system thereby promoting long-term STEC <b>shedding.</b> First <b>infections</b> of animals at calves’ age coincide with the lack of Stx-specific antibodies. We hypothesize that vaccination of calves against Shiga toxins prior to STEC infection may help to prevent the establishment of a persistent type of infection. The objectives of this study were to generate recombinant Shiga toxoids (rStx 1 mut & rStx 2 mut) by site-directed mutagenesis and to assess their immunomodulatory, antigenic, and immunogenic properties. Cultures of bovine primary immune cells were used as test systems. In ileal intraepithelial lymphocytes both, recombinant wild type Stx 1 (rStx 1 WT) and rStx 2 WT significantly induced transcription of IL- 4 mRNA. rStx 1 WT and rStx 2 WT reduced the expression of Stx-receptor CD 77 (syn. Globotriaosylceramide, Gb 3) on B and T cells from peripheral blood and of CD 14 on monocyte-derived macrophages. At the same concentrations, rStx 1 mut and rStx 2 mut exhibited neither of these effects. Antibodies in sera of cattle naturally infected with STEC recognized the rStxmut toxoids equally well as the recombinant wild type toxins. Immunization of calves with rStx 1 mut plus rStx 2 mut led to induction of antibodies neutralizing Stx 1 and Stx 2. While keeping their antigenicity and immunogenicity recombinant Shiga toxoids are devoid of the immunosuppressive properties of the corresponding wild type toxins in cattle and candidate vaccines to mitigate long-term STEC shedding by the reservoir host...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{cryptosporidiosis}} {{is currently}} {{hampered by the}} absence of drugs or vaccines proven consistently effective against Cryptosporidium parvum. On the basis of observations that anti-C. parvum antibody has therapeutic effect against cryptosporidiosis, cows were immunized with C. parvum to produce hyperimmune colostral antibody. An antibody-rich fraction was prepared and differentiated from control (nonhyperimmune) antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence assay, immunoelectron microscopy, and in vitro neutralizing titer against DEAE-cellulose-isolated C. parvum sporozoites. Oocyst, purified sporozoite, and merozoite antigens recognized by hyperimmune antibody were defined by Western blot (immunoblot). Hyperimmune antibody recognized antigens common to oocysts, sporozoites, and merozoites, as well as stage-specific antigens. Upon incubation with hyperimmune antibody, sporozoites underwent distinct morphologic changes characterized by progressive formation and eventual release of membranous sporozoite surface antigen-antibody complexes, similar to the malaria circumsporozoite precipitate reaction. The infectivity of sporozoites having undergone this reaction was neutralized. The reaction was minimal or absent on sporozoites incubated with control antibody. To determine therapeutic effect in vivo, persistent C. parvum infection was established in adult severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice by oral inoculation with 10 (7) oocysts. At 5 weeks postinfection, infected mice were treated for 10 days with hyperimmune or control antibody by inclusion in drinking water and daily gavage. Fecal oocyst <b>shedding</b> and <b>infection</b> scores in the gastrointestinal tract and gall bladder/common bile duct in hyperimmune antibody-treated mice were significantly lower than those in the control antibody-treated mice. Hyperimmune bovine antibody prepared against C. parvum may provide a first-generation therapy for control of cryptosporidiosis. Additionally, the defined antigens can be evaluated as subunit immunogens to produce better-characterized polyclonal antibody for control of cryptosporidiosis or as targets for monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{parvovirus}} B 19 (B 19 V) {{infection in}} immunocompromised patients {{may lead to}} severe anemia. However, in adult transplant recipients, B 19 V reactivations without anemia and low-level viremia are common. The impact of B 19 V in pediatric transplant patients, with high risk of primary infection, is investigated here. In a six-month period, 159 blood samples of 54 pediatric liver transplant recipients were tested for B 19 V DNA by quantitative real-time PCR. Viremia was correlated with anemia and immunosuppression and compared with rates in adult transplant recipients. B 19 V DNA was detected in 5 / 54 patients. Primary B 19 V infections were observed in four patients prior to and in one patient after transplantation. Rates of viremia were significantly higher in pediatric recipients than in adults. Prolonged virus <b>shedding</b> after primary <b>infection</b> prior to transplantation accounts for most viremic cases. Anemia was significantly more frequent in samples from viremic patients, but remained mild. In 15 % of anemic samples, B 19 V DNA was detected. Therefore, in anemic pediatric transplant recipients, diagnostics for B 19 V seem reasonable...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{glycoprotein}} E-deleted Brazilian bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1 gE&# 916;) {{was tested}} regarding to safety and immunogenicity. Intramuscular inoculation of young calves {{with a high}} virus dose {{did not result in}} clinical signs or virus <b>shedding</b> during acute <b>infection</b> or after dexamethasone administration. Calves vaccinated once IM (group I) or subcutaneously (group II) with live BoHV- 1 gE&# 916; or twice with inactivated virus plus aluminum hydroxide (group IV) or Montanide&# 8482; (group V) developed VN titers of 2 to 8 (GMT: 2); 2 to 4 (GMT: 1. 65); 2 to 16 (GMT: 2. 45) and 2 to 128 (GMT: 3. 9), respectively. All BoHV- 1 gE&# 916; vaccinated calves remained negative in an anti-gE ELISA. Lastly, six young calves vaccinated with live BoHV- 1 gE&# 916; and subsequently challenged with a virulent BoHV- 1 strain shed less virus and developed only mild and transient nasal signs comparing to unvaccinated calves. Thus, the recombinant BoHV- 1 gE&# 916; is safe and immunogenic for calves and allows for serological differentiation by a gE-ELISA test...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} clinical, pathogenetic and {{immunological}} {{features of the}} infection caused by a novel bovine pestivirus, namely Hobi virus or bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 3, in Italy. This emerging pestivirus, first detected more than 10 {{years ago in a}} commercial batch of foetal bovine serum produced in Brazil, has been reported so far only in southern America and Asia. In 2010, Hobi-like viruses were detected in Italy in association with outbreaks of respiratory disease and reproductive failures occurring in a cattle herd of the Calabria region. A virus pair consisting of cytopathogenic (cp) and noncytopathogenic (ncp) BVDV- 3 was isolated from a heifer dead as a consequence of respiratory distress. At the genetic level the two viruses differed for the presence in the cp strain of an insertion displaying high similarity to a bovine sequence previously associated to other cp BVDVs. By screening the cattle herd affected by clinical forms induced by the novel pestivirus, a BVDV- 3 persistently infected (PI) calf was detected, which was monitored for about 6 months with regards to clinical conditions, viremia and viral <b>shedding.</b> Experimental <b>infection</b> of cattle, sheep and swine showed that BVDV- 3 is able to infect all those species, although only ruminants displayed clinical signs and virus shedding. The poor serological cross-reactivity existing between BVDV- 1 and BVDV- 3, which was assessed in the sheep model, raised some concerns about the ability of currently available vaccines, mostly containing BVDV- 1, to protect effectively against the new pestiviral species. To overcome the limitations of available diagnostic assays, a new tool (nested PCR) was developed which ensures unambiguous molecular characterisation of all BVDV species, including BVDV- 3, in clinical samples. Future studies will assess the real circulation of this pestivirus in Italian cattle herds and evaluate the BVDV- 3 impact on animal productions...|$|R
