So, the case went on, and there was nothing but talk for two months. Then Cardinal Campeggio, who, on behalf of the Pope, wanted nothing so much as delay, adjourned it for two more months; and before that time was elapsed, the Pope himself adjourned it indefinitely, by {{requiring}} the King and Queen to come to Rome and have it tried there. But by good luck for the King, word was brought to him by some of his people, that they had happened to meet at supper, THOMAS CRANMER, a learned Doctor of Cambridge, who had proposed to urge the Pope on, by referring the case to all the learned doctors and bishops, here and there and everywhere, and getting their opinions that the King's marriage was unlawful. The King, who was now in a hurry to marry Anne Boleyn, thought this <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> that he sent for Cranmer, post haste, and said to LORD ROCHFORT, Anne Boleyn's father, 'Take this learned Doctor down to your country-house, and there let him have a good room for a study, and no end of books out of which to prove that I may marry your daughter.' Lord Rochfort, not at all reluctant, made the learned Doctor as comfortable as he could; and the learned Doctor went to work to prove his case. All this time, the King and Anne Boleyn were writing letters to one another almost daily, full of impatience to have the case settled; and Anne Boleyn was showing herself (as I think) very worthy of the fate which afterwards befel her.|$|E

40|$|In Sweden {{there are}} over 600 000 single sewage systems which has a toilet {{connected}} to them. The sewage water contains a lot of phosphorus and nitrogen, which over fertilize seas, lakes and streams. Also, the water holds lots of bacteria's, which can contaminate drinking water and bathing places, if not purified enough. The municipal office determines which degree of purification a single sewage needs, and have the supervision over them. Lack of resources and time {{makes it hard to}} do this as much as required. This study aims to examine the possibility to simplify the administration of single sewage errands, {{in order to make it}} easier to determine purification degree and make operators take more responsibility. The study was performed as a literature study and an online questionnaire survey, directed against municipal workers, in which 89 individuals participated. Also, in order to examine how to apply a determination plan for protection level in a municipality, a practical investigation is done. The study has concluded that making operators present their systems is a possibility, but because of the fact that the operator often is a private individual and the cost can become high, it can be a hard to consider it fair according to the Swedish law. The study also shows that tools for easier determination of purification is something the municipal workers think works and focus on developing tools and guidance for <b>such,</b> is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{software}} {{project has}} "Hero Developers" when 80 % of contributions are delivered by 20 % of the developers. Are <b>such</b> heroes <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea?</b> Are too many heroes bad for software quality? Is {{it better to}} have more/less heroes for different kinds of projects? To answer these questions, we studied 661 open source projects from Public open source software (OSS) Github and 171 projects from an Enterprise Github. We find that hero projects are very common. In fact, as projects grow in size, nearly all project become hero projects. These findings motivated us to {{look more closely at}} the effects of heroes on software development. Analysis shows that the frequency to close issues and bugs are not significantly affected by the presence of project type (Public or Enterprise). Similarly, the time needed to resolve an issue/bug/enhancement is not affected by heroes or project type. This is a surprising result since, before looking at the data, we expected that increasing heroes on a project will slow down howfast that project reacts to change. However, we do find a statistically significant association between heroes, project types, and enhancement resolution rates. Heroes do not affect enhancement resolution rates in Public projects. However, in Enterprise projects, the more heroes increase the rate at which project complete enhancements. In summary, our empirical results call for a revision of a long-held truism in software engineering. Software heroes are far more common and valuable than suggested by the literature, particularly for medium to large Enterprise developments. Organizations should reflect on better ways to find and retain more of these heroesComment: 9 pages, submitted to ICSE SEIP 201...|$|R

The article responds to the Carnegie Report’s call to “bridge the gap between analytical and practical knowledge” by presenting two models for integrating skills with doctrine in the first-year curriculum. The first model, built into the curriculum at the University of Maryland School of Law, involves teaching the first semester Legal Analysis 2 ̆ 6 Writing course by pairing it with another required first-semester course, Torts, Contracts, Civil Procedure, or Criminal Law. The second model is an example of one way the author built on the ideas behind the integrated curriculum by pairing a section of the required second-semester Advocacy course with a first-year elective seminar in Public Health Law. The article presents reasons why <b>such</b> integration is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> and it includes examples of what makes these models work so well. The article concludes by suggesting ways of translating these ideas into other settings, no matter how the curriculum is structured, by recommending additional ways of integrating analysis and writing skills with theory and doctrine in law school courses...|$|R

[...] Ursula Le Guin, who reviewed the novel for The Guardian, was critical of the ending of the book which she described as [...] "sinking into the inane." [...] Bradbury did agree with her that the last third of the novel was the [...] "least satisfying part" [...] but still was positive about the book. Brandon Robshaw, who reviewed Journey into Space for The Independent said that Litt [...] "expertly lays out the relationships, the hierarchies, the changing rules and orthodoxies, in short the entire sociology of this hermetically enclosed community over the duration of the voyage" [...] and that the novel is a [...] "welcome addition to his (Litt's) oeuvre." [...] Simon Akam, in reviewing the novel for the New Statesman, opined that Litt [...] "has a tendency to overindulge his conceptual imagination when a willingness to curb it earlier might have created a tighter result" [...] but also states: [...] "the reason Journey Into Space succeeds is that its author has <b>such</b> <b>a</b> plethora of <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> to work with that he can get away with overextending a few." [...] Andrew McKie considered Journey into Space one of the better works in a trend of literary writers trying their hands at science fiction: [...] "Toby Litt has managed it too. He has done nothing very new, but he has written <b>a</b> <b>good</b> novel. Journey into Space avoids cliché, the sentences never go clunk, the reader is always engaged — and it offers a thoroughly old-fashioned future." ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{formative}} stages of their businesses, entrepreneurs {{have to provide}} incentives for employees to protect, rather than steal, the source of organizational rents. We study how the entrepreneur’s response to this problem determines the organization’s internal structure, growth, and its eventual size. Large, steep hierarchies will predominate in physical-capital-intensive industries, and will have seniority-based promotion policies. By contrast, at hierarchies will prevail in human-capital-intensive industries and will have up-or-out promotion systems. Furthermore, at hierarchies will have more distinctive technologies or cultures than steep hierarchies. The model points to some essential differences between organized hierarchies and markets. At the root of most enterprises generating economic surplus is an entrepreneur with a unique critical resource <b>such</b> as <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> <b>good</b> customer relationships, <b>a</b> new tool, or superior man-agement technique. A fundamental problem of entrepreneurship is how to enlist {{the cooperation of the}} many agents necessary for production without ceding to them too much of the surplus gen-erated by the enterprise. The risk of being expropriated, however, is always inherent in production. In particular, the entrepreneur has to give her employees (whom we call managers) close prox-imity or access to the critical resource for them to learn to produce effectively. For example, a manager has to understand the idea, be in contact with the key customers and suppliers, or even learn the entrepreneur’s unique managerial techniques, in order to work effectively. But access also gives the manager the opportu-nity to expropriate this critical resource and compete against the entrepreneur. Managers may steal the idea, walk away with clients, or mimic the entrepreneur’s management style, and start up a rival concern. The greater the access a manager has, the more he can appropriate, and the more effectively he can com-pete. This paper explores the role of organizational design i...|$|R

The studios were housed within a converted dairy in Old Church Street, Chelsea and soon went on {{to become one of the}} country's first independent professional music recording studios. In 1966, he met Joe Boyd, who worked with him closely. The two formed a partnership, whereby Wood tended to the record's sound, while Boyd looked after its musical direction. However, Wood, well known for his forthright approach, often gave his opinion on musical direction. According to Boyd: [...] "professional session musicians regarded the pair of us with curiosity: the normal deference of engineer towards producer didn't seem to apply.

In the Paul Zollo book Songwriters on Songwriting, Cohen explains that it takes him so long to finish songs because [...] "Nothing works. After a while, if you stick with the song long enough it will yield. But long enough is way beyond any reasonable estimation of what you think long enough may be...'Anthem' took a decade to write. And I've recorded it three times. More." [...] In the same interview, Cohen spoke at length about [...] "Democracy," [...] admitting that he wrote 60 verses for it: This was when the Berlin Wall came down and everyone was saying democracy {{is coming to the}} east.

[...] But then I asked myself, [...] "Where is democracy really coming?" [...] And it was the U.S.A....So while everyone was rejoicing, I thought it wasn’t going to be like that, euphoric, the honeymoon. So it was these world events that occasioned the song. And also the love of America. Because I think the irony of America is transcendent in the song. It’s not an ironic song. It’s a song of deep intimacy and affirmation of the experiment of democracy in this country. That this is really where the experiment is unfolding. This is really where the races confront one another, where the classes, where the genders, where even the sexual orientations confront one another. This is the real laboratory of democracy.|$|E
