5|$|The {{species is}} also {{considered}} ideal for cut flower production, as its flowers fulfill the commercial criteria of terminal blooms {{and a long}} <b>stem</b> <b>length.</b> As such {{it is one of}} the most popular banksias for cut flower production, with commercial crops grown in Israel, Victoria, South Australia and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} <b>stem</b> <b>length</b> of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E
5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} produces a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the <b>stem</b> <b>length.</b> All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} blasting operation as practiced in five selected quarries (Beautiful Rock, Borini Prono, Gitto Construction Company, Bulletine Construction Company and Rock Bridge) in Kogi State, and also suggested ways {{of improving the}} lapses that were observed. Information and data {{of the most recent}} blasting operation from each of the selected quarries were collected to examine their explosive usage in terms of quantity. In order to compare the practices in the selected quarries to recommended standards, total amount of explosives required per blast hole and the <b>stemming</b> <b>length</b> were examined. Necessary calculations were performed by using appropriate formulae to assess their blasting operations based on their targeted powder factors. Result of the assessment shows that all the quarries overcharged the blast holes by a significant amount ranging from 7. 86 to 16. 91 kg per hole. The <b>stemming</b> <b>length</b> used in Bulletine Quarry can be considered as adequate though still 0. 04 m less than the minimum recommended <b>length.</b> <b>Stemming</b> <b>length</b> of 0. 75 m in Gitto Construction Company instead of 1. 75 m is grossly inadequate.

40|$|Molecular beacons are {{increasingly}} being used in many applications involving nucleic acid detection and quanti®cation. The stem±loop structure of molecular beacons provides a competing reaction for probe±target hybridization that serves to increase probe speci®city, which is particularly use-ful when single-base discrimination is desired. To fully realize the potential of molecular beacons, {{it is necessary to}} optimize their structure. Here we report a systematic study of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters that describe the molecular bea-con structure±function relationship. Both probe and <b>stem</b> <b>lengths</b> are shown to have a signi®cant impact on the binding speci®city and hybridization kinetic rates of molecular beacons. Speci®cally, molecular beacons with longer <b>stem</b> <b>lengths</b> have an improved ability to discriminate between targets over a broader range of temperatures. However, this is accompanied by a decrease in the rate of molecular beacon±target hybridization. Molecular beacons with longer probe lengths tend to have lower dissociation constants, increased kinetic rate con-stants, and decreased speci®city. Molecular bea-cons with very short stems have a lower signal-to-background ratio than molecular beacons with longer stems.

40|$|Nineteen {{chickpea}} varieties {{were evaluated}} for {{their reaction to}} ascochyta blight following detached-leaf and whole-plant inoculation with an aggressive isolate of Ascochyta rabiei. The same varieties were also evaluated under field conditions following inoculations with chickpea residues infected with ascochyta blight. A wide range of variation was observed among the varieties for disease severity, <b>stem</b> lesion <b>length,</b> lesion number and pycnidial density. Positive correlations between <b>stem</b> lesion <b>length,</b> pycnidial density and disease severity indicated that <b>stem</b> lesion <b>length</b> or pycnidial density may be an indicator of disease resistance. Among the chickpea entries tested, two varieties with compound leaves (desi cv. Myles, kabuli cv. CDC Chico) were relatively resistant. Blight severity was consistently higher on unifoliate varieties compared to those with compound leaves, irrespective of evaluation methods. These results suggest that avoiding the cultivation of unifoliate-leaved chickpea varieties in the Albertan agro-ecosystems.

40|$|Stemming {{is used in}} {{blasting}} operations to help contain explosive gases as long as possible. Stemming can reduce airblast, improve fragmentation, and reduce the chances of hot explosive gases igniting methane and dust explosions in underground mines. Stemming is required in underground coal mines but is generally not used in underground metal and nonmetal mines. Some underground metal and nonmetal mines are classified as gassy and can require special blasting procedures {{such as the use}} of stemming to minsure the safety of miners. The types and amounts of stemming material that are desirable in underground metal and nonmetal mine blasting to ensure good or improved fragmentation while containing the hot gases are largely unknown. This Bureau of Mines research examined the effectiveness of differing <b>lengths</b> of <b>stemming</b> by measuring stemming ejection times as related to burden movement. With properly stemmed blasts, stemming is contained until some burden movement has occurred. Test blasts at two surface limestone quarries were evaluated using high-speed photography. For the conditions of these tests, a <b>stemming</b> <b>length</b> of at least 26 charge diameters was found to prevent premature stemming ejection. In tests with <b>stemming</b> <b>lengths</b> of 16 charge diameters, the stemming was effective but there was early venting of hot gases through fractures in the rock. Further testing with other rock types, hole diameters, explosive types, and stemming materials as they affect incendivity is recommended...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The effects of sixteen environmental and physical variables on the growth of six natural populations and on the establishment and growth of transplanted populations of widgeon grass, Ruppia maritima L. s. l., were evaluated in the Galveston Bay System, Texas. Growth differences in natural populations among different basin morphologies and tidal regimes were examined. Sediment texture influenced the percent cover of widgeon grass the greatest of the variables studied. High silt content and low sand content in the sediments resulted in greater percent cover of widgeon grass than sediments with low silt and high sand content. Water temperature significantly influenced the <b>stem</b> <b>lengths</b> of widgeon grass; warm temperatures stimulated longer plant lengths, while cold water temperatures resulted in reduced <b>stem</b> <b>lengths.</b> Marshes and tidal habitats exhibited perennial growth patterns of widgeon grass as compared to annual growth patterns found in ponds, lakes, and semitidal habitats. Ponds, lakes, and semitidal habitats generally had significantly higher percent cover and <b>stem</b> <b>lengths</b> than marshes and tidal habitats; except in periods of drought. The effects of sixteen environmental and physical variables on the growth and establishment of transplanted widgeon grass, Ruppia maritima L. s. l., in the Galveston Bay System, were analyzed. Growth differences between different transplant spacings (1 meter, 0. 5 meters and 0. 25 meters) also were studied. Various fetch distances had the greatest significant influence on the establishment and growth of transplanted widgeon grass. Greater fetch distances resulted in reduced growth of transplants due to increased wave action that the transplants were subjected to. There {{was no significant difference in}} widgeon grass growth among the transplant spacings. In conclusion, I found that widgeon grass can be successfully transplanted onto submerged bare sediments in areas of low fetch distances. Transplanting widgeon grass into internal open water areas designed with low fetch distances in saltmarsh restoration projects can increase habitat diversity and function. Efforts should concentrate on designing suitable habitat into restoration plans rather than transplanting large quantities of plant material...|$|R
