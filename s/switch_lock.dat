2500|$|On April 12, 2001, the Ocean train {{originating}} at Halifax {{destined for}} Montréal derailed at a manually operated main track switch in Stewiacke, Nova Scotia. A standard Canadian National (CN) <b>switch</b> <b>lock</b> used {{to secure the}} switch in correct position had been tampered with. The two locomotives and the first two cars continued on the main track, but the following cars took a diverging route onto an industrial track adjacent to the main track. Nine of the cars derailed and a farm supply building, {{as well as the}} industrial track were destroyed. Four occupants of the building escaped without injury prior to impact. There were 132 persons on board the train. Twenty-two persons were transported to hospital in either Truro or Halifax. Nine were seriously injured. [...] A 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty to the charge of mischief endangering life relating to the lock tampering.|$|E
50|$|Around the 1870s, lock makers {{realized}} they could successfully package the same locking mechanism found in cast heart locks {{into a more}} economical steel or brass shell {{instead of having to}} cast a thick metal body. These lock shells were stamped out of flat metal stock, filled with lever tumblers, and then riveted together. Although more fragile than the cast hearts, these locks were attractive because they cost less. In 1908, Adams & Westlake patented a stamped & riveted <b>switch</b> <b>lock</b> that was so economical that many railroads stopped using the popular cast hearts and went with this new stamped shell lock body design. Many lock manufacturers made this very popular style of lock.|$|E

50|$|Felix John Watts (August 4, 1892 - August 17, 1966) was an {{accomplished}} inventor with several U.S. patents granted for {{items such as}} motion picture projectors, vehicle ignition systems, light <b>switches,</b> <b>locking</b> mechanisms, etc.|$|R
60|$|The Compound crawled {{across the}} tracks {{on a long}} slant, groaning horribly at each switch, and moving like a cow in a snow-drift. There was a little pause along the yard after her tail-lights had disappeared; <b>switches</b> <b>locked</b> crisply, and every one seemed to be waiting.|$|R
50|$|In August 2004, Graham {{was charged}} with {{kidnapping}} and three counts of child abuse, and Kendrick with two lesser counts of child abuse. Kendrick promised to testify against Graham at her trial. She says both of them spanked Rilya with <b>switches,</b> <b>locked</b> her in a dog cage and in the laundry room.|$|R

5|$|There {{are four}} {{physical}} {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the <b>switch</b> <b>locked</b> the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute <b>switch,</b> with rotation <b>lock</b> now available in an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical vehicle {{switching}} minimizes inter-vehicle spacing or headway distance, but it {{also increases}} the minimum distances between consecutive junctions. A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different switch settings, cannot proceed from one junction to the next. The vehicle must adopt a new switch position, and then wait for the in-vehicle <b>switch's</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism to be verified. If the vehicle switching is faulty, that vehicle {{must be able to}} stop before reaching the next switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed vehicle would be affected.|$|R

50|$|Similar (non-fatal) wrecks near Newport News, Virginia, on , and in Stewiacke, Nova Scotia, on , {{resulted}} from switches being thrown open {{in front of}} the trains by saboteurs. To prevent these incidents, most unused <b>switches</b> are <b>locked</b> up.|$|R
5000|$|An unusual {{interior}} change {{placed the}} power window switches {{flat against the}} door panel, whereas the window switches for the first generation and third generation extended from the door panels and were oriented in a horizontal position and were located underneath the drivers or occupants hands for easy location and use, and integrated into the door pull and armrest. The express up feature for the driver's window was also removed, leaving express down only. The power door <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> design was upgraded to a more conventional door <b>lock</b> <b>switch,</b> installed next to the power window switches, with a secondary power <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> installed for the front passenger. This approach was also used on the 1990-1993 Honda Integra ...|$|R

50|$|On {{vehicles}} {{equipped with}} power central locking, the feature is activated from the inside drivers door <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> only, by pushing the rocker <b>switch</b> to <b>lock</b> or unlock all doors. There is no label {{on any of the}} doors that suggest the door lock function is electric. Other doors can be locked or unlocked individually by pushing the respective door <b>lock</b> rocker <b>switch,</b> but it will not lock or unlock the other doors. The outside key door lock can unlock the drivers door only by turning the key partially, or with a complete turn to the left to unlock all doors.|$|R
50|$|Ignition <b>switches</b> or <b>locks</b> are {{combined}} with security locking {{of the steering}} column (in many modern vehicles) or the gear lever (such as in Saab Automobile vehicles). In the latter, the switch is between the seats, preventing damage to the driver's knee {{in the event of}} a collision.|$|R
5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the <b>switch</b> <b>locked</b> the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|R
50|$|Thirty-seven {{tracks were}} {{sustained}} or repeatedly percussive {{notes in the}} timbre of a particular instrument and were played through a standard three-octave piano-style keyboard with the right hand; twenty-one were of a live band or soloist playing chords in different keys arranged per the circle of fifths, specifically B-flat, F, C, G, D, A and E major, minor, and diminished and were played with the left hand in much {{the style of a}} chord organ or accordion. The remaining five were assigned to rocker switches above the chord buttons and featured (depending on the disc in question) percussion, sound effects, introductions, vamps, and endings synchronized with the chord buttons. Pushing upward on the rocker <b>switches</b> <b>locked</b> them in place for use with percussion; pushing downward allowed momentary use for vamps, introductions and endings.|$|R
40|$|The {{reliable}} {{response to}} weak biological signals requires {{that they be}} amplified with fidelity. In E. coli, the flagellar motors that control swimming can switch direction in response to very small changes in the concentration of the signaling protein CheY-P, but how this works is not well understood. A recently proposed allosteric model based on cooperative conformational spread in a ring of identical protomers seems promising as {{it is able to}} qualitatively reproduce <b>switching,</b> <b>locked</b> state behavior and Hill coefficient values measured for the rotary motor. In this paper we undertook a comprehensive simulation study to analyze the behavior of this model in detail and made predictions on three experimentally observable quantities: <b>switch</b> time distribution, <b>locked</b> state interval distribution, Hill coefficient of the switch response. We parameterized the model using experimental measurements, finding excellent agreement with published data on motor behavior. Analysis of the simulated switching dynamics revealed a mechanism for chemotactic ultrasensitivity, in which cooperativity is indispensable for realizing both coherent switching and effective amplification. These results showed how cells can combine elements of analog and digital control to produce switches that are simultaneously sensitive and reliable. © 2012 Ma et al...|$|R
50|$|Unless the <b>switch</b> is <b>locked,</b> a train {{coming from}} {{either of the}} {{converging}} directs will pass through the points onto the narrow end, regardless {{of the position of}} the points, as the vehicle's wheels will force the points to move. Passage through a switch in this direction is known as a trailing-point movement.|$|R
5000|$|Man {{is using}} {{electric}} trimmer to cut hedges around exterior of home. Trimmer is plugged into outlet on exterior of home 75 feet from where man is working. The trimmer <b>switch</b> is <b>locked</b> in the [...] "on" [...] position and in normal use. Extending {{beyond the reach}} of the trimmer's power cord, the plug is accidentally pulled from the outlet on the house 75 feet away. The man puts down the trimmer, <b>switch</b> still <b>locked</b> in the [...] "on" [...] position, and walks with his back away from the trimmer towards the outlet. A 4-year-old boy playing nearby sees the trimmer on the ground and approaches it. He picks it up with both hands. Back still turned, the man re-inserts the trimmer's power cord plug into the outlet. The trimmer starts immediately, severely injuring the boy's fingers on both hands.|$|R

50|$|The Door Control Unit is {{responsible}} for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles {{have more than one}} door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with the driver's door has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like <b>locking,</b> driver door <b>switch</b> pad, child <b>lock</b> <b>switches,</b> etc., which are associated with the driver's door. In most of the cases driver door module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.|$|R
50|$|Rogers led Cronulla to {{the grand}} final as captain, in 1978, once more against the Sea Eagles. The match was a tie, and Cronulla lost a replay in the {{following}} week. During that season, he was often <b>switched</b> to <b>lock</b> forward and was effective in that role. Three years later, he won the Dally M Lock Of The Year award.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{selectable}} 4WD {{system is}} {{not to be confused with}} all road conditions [...] "all-wheel-drive" [...] systems; the MPV can be <b>switched</b> into <b>locked</b> 4WD with a switch mounted on the column gear selector. A dash mounted switch controlled the center differential, creating a locked power distributions on the front and rear axles. The 4WD is not for use on dry roads, but can be engaged and disengaged while moving.|$|R
50|$|The KM 400 first flew in June 1983 at Nyíregyháza, piloted by Károly Borosnyai. An all-moving {{tailplane}} {{was fitted}} on these early flights, {{to check out}} its general characteristics. It was then modified so the pilot could <b>switch</b> between <b>locked</b> and unlocked elevator and by December 1983 was reported as flying successfully entirely under flaperon control. Tests to optimize the tailplane were still in progress in 1988, after which little is heard about the KM 400.|$|R

40|$|A driven Brownian {{particle}} (e. g. an adatom on a surface) diffusing on a low-viscosity, periodic substrate may execute multiple jumps. In {{the presence}} of an additional periodic drive, the jump lengths and time durations become statistically modulated according to a syncronyzation mechanism reminiscent of asymmetric stochastic resonance. Here, too, bistability plays a key role, but in a dynamical sense, inasmuch as a particle <b>switches</b> between <b>locked</b> and running states.

50|$|The switch {{was formed}} {{of a single}} {{swinging}} section turning upon a hinge of great strength attached {{to one of the}} posts. A movement of four or five feet by the free end of the switch was enough to permit the cars and trucks on one track to clear the end of the other track. The free end travels upon a carriage provided with rollers moving upon a supporting rail. Suitable mechanism was provided for operating the <b>switch</b> and <b>locking</b> it in place.|$|R
50|$|Compulsive {{checking}} {{can include}} compulsively checking {{items such as}} <b>locks,</b> <b>switches,</b> and appliances.
