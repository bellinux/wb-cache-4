5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2006, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the General Assembly's legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain. Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a gallstone in his common bile duct and also diagnosed him with an inflamed pancreas and gallbladder disease. After surgery to remove the gallbladder, Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1. Days later, he returned to St. Joseph's with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not {{have a negative impact on}} his ability to get legislation passed during the session. A right-to-work law and a repeal of the state's prevailing wage law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started. Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory seat belt law, a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an all-terrain vehicle, and legislation allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.|$|E

25|$|Further {{advance in}} liver {{transplant}} involves only resection of the lobe {{of the liver}} involved in tumors and the tumor-free lobe remains within the recipient. This speeds up the recovery and the patient <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> quickly shortens to within 5–7 days.|$|E
25|$|Responding to {{the unique}} needs of an urban population, SVCMC instituted a program to help {{patients}} provide for the pets during their <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> Animals were either walked and fed in patient's home, or were relocated to care facilities or short-term foster homes.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may be able}} {{to return}} home soon after the vitrectomy, or may be asked to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> overnight. After the operation, the eye will be red and sensitive, and {{patients}} usually need to wear an eyepatch for a few days or weeks to protect the eye. Medicated eye drops are also prescribed to protect against infection.|$|E

25|$|Most {{patients}} do improve with conservative care in 2–5 days. However, on some occasions, {{the cause of}} obstruction may be a cancer and in such cases, surgery is the only treatment. These individuals undergo surgery where the cause of SBO is removed. Individuals who have bowel resection or lysis of adhesions usually <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> {{a few more days}} until they are able to eat and walk.|$|E
25|$|In the Errol Morris documentary, McNamara {{reports that}} {{both he and}} his wife were {{stricken}} with polio shortly after the end of World War II. Although McNamara had a relatively short <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> his wife's case was more serious and it was concern over meeting her medical bills that led to his decision to not return to Harvard but to enter private industry as a consultant at Ford Motor Company.|$|E
25|$|His {{tenure at}} Harvard almost ended before it began, {{when he was}} injured in an {{automobile}} accident. Boring fractured his skull and had to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for six weeks. Also, the accident resulted in temporary retroactive and progressive amnesia. The experience caused Boring to question {{what it means to}} be conscious. If a person could not recall what the person had said moments afterward, could he really be considered conscious? Such questions become a lifelong endeavor for Boring to try to answer.|$|E

50|$|In January 2008 {{he had to}} {{be taken}} to a {{hospital}} for severe chest pains caused by stress. He <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>in</b> Cuenca {{for a couple of days}} after a cardiac problem was ruled out.|$|R
25|$|In 1943, Albizu Campos became {{seriously ill}} {{and had to}} be interned at the Columbus Hospital of New York City. During his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> he learned of the work that the Harlem Ashram was doing with the local Puerto Ricans. He asked Julio Pinto Gandía, a member of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, to bring the group to his bedside because he wanted to meet them. Reynolds and the others went to meet Albizu Campos as requested. That was the {{beginning}} of a lifelong friendship between Reynolds and Albizu Campos.|$|E
25|$|In August 2000, Wisniski {{fell from}} his front porch, {{and had a}} number of {{injuries}} and complications. These included a fractured back, pneumonia, staph infection, collapsed lungs and kidney failure. Due to his many injuries he slipped into a coma. At one point he came out of it while his wife was singing to him. He began singing himself but fell back into the coma. His wife had purchased medical insurance through a health maintenance organization (HMO), but the organization was unwilling to pay for Wisniski's extended <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> As a result, Lou Thesz's wife convinced the Cauliflower Alley Club to help contribute to Wisniski's medical bills. Those medical bills reached close to a million dollars.|$|E
25|$|He {{died after}} an 18-day <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> According to the book, Jazz and Death: Medical Profiles of Jazz Greats (2002), the author, M.D. Frederick J. Spencer (also a coroner) {{went back and}} {{analyzed}} Rollini's death {{along with many other}} jazz greats, and discovered Rollini truly died of mercury poisoning. While in his 18-day stay, he had developed a resistance to feeding and so a glass tube had been inserted into his stomach. The tube was weighted with mercury and somehow the tube broke, exposing Rollini to mercury poisoning. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy ("Dixie") Rollini. In 1998, Adrian Rollini was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.|$|E
50|$|Moody {{had been}} {{diagnosed}} with an abscess on <b>the</b> brain and <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for almost three weeks when she died from pneumonia on 12 January 2010. She is survived by her husband, Terence Moody, and other family members.|$|R

50|$|Humphrey {{spent his}} last weeks calling old {{political}} acquaintances.

25|$|Positive {{emotions}} {{not only}} have physical outcomes but also physiological ones. Some physiological outcomes caused by humor include improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary immunoglobulin A, a vital system antibody, which serves as the body’s {{first line of defense}} in respiratory illnesses. Moreover, other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly, and reductions in a patient’s <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> among many other benefits. A study was done on positive emotions in trait-resilient individuals and the cardiovascular recovery rate following negative emotions felt by those individuals. The results of the study showed that trait-resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions had an acceleration in the speed in rebounding from cardiovascular activation initially generated by negative emotional arousal, i.e. heart rate and the like.|$|E
25|$|Knievel's daredevil show {{broke up}} after the Barstow {{performance}} because injuries prevented him from performing. After recovering, Knievel started traveling from small town to small town as a solo act. To get ahead of other motorcycle stunt people who were jumping animals or pools of water, Knievel started jumping cars. He began adding more and more cars to his jumps when {{he would return to}} the same venue to get people to come out and see him again. Knievel had not had a serious injury since the Barstow performance, but on June 19 in Missoula, Montana, he attempted to jump twelve cars and a cargo van. The distance he had for takeoff did not allow him to get up enough speed. His back wheel hit the top of the van while his front wheel hit the top of the landing ramp. Knievel ended up with a severely broken arm and several broken ribs. The crash and subsequent <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> were a publicity windfall.|$|E
25|$|On his return, de Hory {{discovered}} that his paintings were fetching high prices at several art galleries, and was incensed that the galleries had only paid him {{a fraction of}} what they thought the paintings were worth. Further compounding de Hory's plight was that the manner of his forgeries had become recognizable, and he was now a person of interest to the FBI. This unwanted attention may have prompted de Hory to temporarily abandon his fakery and resume creating his own artwork once more. This led him to an ascetic existence in a low-rent apartment near Pershing Square in Los Angeles. Here, he had limited success, mostly selling paintings of pink poodles to interior decorators. However, his self-imposed exile was not to his liking. He decided to return to the East Coast and try his luck once more at his illicit craft, for which he always found an eager buyer—eventually. In Washington DC, de Hory began an ill-fated association with a picture dealer that ended in disaster. In 1959, suffering from depression, he attempted suicide by overdose of sleeping pills. A friend rescued him and called an ambulance. His stomach was pumped, and after a <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> de Hory convalesced in New York City, helped by an enterprising young man, Fernand Legros.|$|E
