This assessment is undertaken {{from the perspective of}} the optimal deployment of economic policies as prescribed by economic analysis and takes into consideration the legal mandate and the institutional constraints imposed by EU treaties and regulations. The analysis shows that as a result of the limited policy tools available to the Union, trade and competition policies have to fulfil several competing goals. This multiplicity of objectives leads to non-optimal interventions. Policy inconsistencies arise also between trade/competition policies and the industrial policy of Member States. Current policy practice leads to inefficient outcomes both in mature and <b>sunrise</b> <b>industries.</b> These inefficiencies could be reduced with a reinforcement of integration policies (notably, state aid control). The paper argues that the current institutional arrangements allow for a strengthening of centralized industrial policy, however, which could be usefully utilized to achieve more efficient outcomes.

40|$|Hydrogeology has {{traditionally}} been regarded as {{the province of the}} water industry, but it is increasingly finding novel applications in the energy sector. Hydrogeology has a longstanding role in geothermal energy exploration and management. Although aquifer management methods can be directly applied to most high-enthalpy geothermal reservoirs, hydrogeochemical inference techniques differ somewhat owing to peculiarities of high-temperature processes. Hydrogeological involvement in the development of ground-coupled heating and cooling systems using heat pumps has led to the emergence of the sub-discipline now known as thermogeology. The patterns of groundwater flow and heat transport are closely analogous and can thus be analysed using very similar techniques. Without resort to heat pumps, groundwater is increasingly being pumped to provide cooling for large buildings; the renewability of such systems relies on accurate prediction and management of thermal breakthrough from reinjection to production boreholes. Hydrogeological analysis can contribute to quantification of accidental carbon emissions arising from disturbance of groundwater-fed peatland ecosystems during wind farm construction. Beyond renewables, key applications of hydrogeology {{are to be found in}} the nuclear sector, and in the <b>sunrise</b> <b>industries</b> of unconventional gas and carbon capture and storage, with high temperatures attained during underground coal gasification requiring geothermal technology transfer...|$|E

Method: We gathered data from a 65 -question internet-based survey conducted from February 2013 to April 2013 with OPV researchers and research managers around the world. A multi-method (investigative/exploratory, descriptive statistics) approach is used for analyses and discussions. Results: Overall findings show that the organization of OPV research, innovation and governance in Northern America, Western Europe and East Asia reflect similar aspects, patterns with their political economies surveyed in the literature: Northern America's neo-liberal market and finance orientation, Western Europe's orientation to sustainable development and policy-driven research, coordinated-regulatory inspirations and research-driven system, and East Asia's neo-developmental state view with international trade, technology-export orientation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} play {{has been a}} touchstone for {{cultural}} studies since the translation of Mikhail Bakhtin’s work on carnival (1968), a natural and liberating resistance to domination. As the neo-baroque constructs its spectacles, it requires a spectacular, unquestionable depiction of both Evil and the Good (Bather 2004). Articulated {{as it is with}} the markets for consumer goods, through product placement, tie-ins and merchandising, all pitched at the youth market, play offers itself as the royal instantiation of good. The ludic may well be instinctual, but only {{in the same way that}} hunger and sex are instinctual. Humans, mammals, are born with an interest in play, but that interest is as thoroughly socialised, as thoroughly historical, and as thoroughly open to exploitation as the other primal forces acting on the human psyche. Play can no longer be thought of as an instinctual revolt against domination, a kind of instrumental irrationality. Instead, like hunger or sex, it has become an integral element in the imbrication of the somatic into the social. Integral to the management of creativity in the <b>sunrise</b> <b>industries,</b> play is also a privileged vehicle for socialisation into the contemporary. To be specific, contemporary capital opposes evil not with good but with innocence; and play constitutes the single most manipulable tool for the construction of innocence, on screen and in life. The predilection of postmodernism for play in all its guises is inadequately critical. Which kind of game? Are all games equally and essentially good or are there distinctions to make between them and histories to tell? Is the celebration of play merely a reaction to the imagined high seriousness of modernism? Is there a cultural task remaining, to build new modes of play...|$|E
