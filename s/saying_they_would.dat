5|$|The pay dispute {{split the}} unit. About two thirds went on strike, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{not return to}} action unless the Army upped their wages and paid them in foreign currency. Meanwhile, {{some of the more}} {{contented}} Frenchmen made steps to remain permanently, buying cars and having their wives join them in Salisbury. The Army detained the strike's ringleaders for insubordination. With neither side willing to budge—the Army refused to give the strikers extra pay or special treatment, saying this would contravene Rhodesia's policy not to engage mercenaries—the disaffected men were repatriated to France at their own request. The Rhodesian Army considered disbanding the unit altogether, but persevered when Major de l'Assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most {{recently}} from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not bother to vote in the 2014 EU elections. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All My Children due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official statement <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back {{due to a lack of}} storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.|$|E

5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent {{of those surveyed}} felt Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was the best choice for premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they would vote for the party in an election. The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> vote for the party in an election.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} found that tip size is only weakly related to service quality. Bodvarsson and Gibson {{recently}} challenged this finding—criticizing previous research and reporting that consumers <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> tip substantially different amounts with different levels of service quality. This paper presents a critical response to Bodvarsson and Gibson’s article. Contrary to Bodvarsson and Gibson’s claims, the weakness of the tipping–service relationship in the existing literature is not just a reflection of restricted variability in service ratings. Nor is it attributable to other methodological problems with service ratings. Furthermore, the data from Bodvarsson and Gibson’s role-playing survey is suspect, because what people <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do in a given situation is often different from what they actually do in that situation...|$|R

Most people <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would.</b> Would you push that same person into the path of the trolley in order to save the five? Most people <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not. These sorts of intuitive moral judgments are made rapidly and seem almost automatic. Now imagine a combined choice context where one can redirect a trolley, push a person in its path or do nothing. The number of lives lost from intervening can be varied. The most straightforward interpretations of current theories of moral judgment predict either no effect or that the combined context will lead to greater focus on lives lost. In contrast, we observe a similarity effect such that utilitarian choice may become less attractive in the combined choice context. context effects, trolley problem, moral dilemma, moral...|$|R
