5000|$|In {{order to}} provide mono [...] "compatibility", the NICAM signal is {{transmitted}} on a subcarrier alongside the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier.</b> This means that the FM or AM regular mono <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> is left alone for reception by monaural receivers.|$|R

50|$|The PAL-N {{system has}} a {{different}} <b>sound</b> <b>carrier,</b> and also a different colour subcarrier, and decoding on incompatible PAL systems results in a black-and-white image without sound. The PAL-M system {{has a different}} <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> and a different colour subcarrier, and does not use 625 lines or 50 frames/second. This would result in no video or audio at all when viewing a European signal.|$|R

50|$|This ensures video interoperability. However, as some {{of these}} {{standards}} (B/G/H, I and D/K) use different <b>sound</b> <b>carriers</b> (5.5 MHz, 6.0 MHz 6.5 MHz respectively), it {{may result in a}} video image without audio when viewing a signal broadcast over the air or cable. Some countries in Eastern Europe which formerly used SECAM with systems D and K have switched to PAL while leaving other aspects of their video system the same, resulting in the different <b>sound</b> <b>carrier.</b> Instead, other European countries have changed completely from SECAM-D/K to PAL-B/G.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as intercarrier sound, and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|R
50|$|So the FM <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> is then demodulated, amplified, {{and used}} to drive a loudspeaker. Until {{the advent of the}} NICAM and MTS systems, {{television}} sound transmissions were invariably monophonic.|$|R
40|$|Robot {{capability}} of hearing sounds, in particular, {{a mixture of}} sounds, by its own microphones, that is, robot audition, is important in improving human robot interaction. This paper presents the robot audition open-source software, called “HARK ” (HRI-JP Audition for Robots with Kyoto University), which consists of primitive functions in computational auditory scene analysis; sound source localization, separation, and recognition of <b>separated</b> <b>sounds.</b> Since <b>separated</b> <b>sounds</b> suffer from spectral distortion due to separation, the HARK generates a time-spectral map of reliability, called “missing feature mask”, for features of <b>separated</b> <b>sounds.</b> Then <b>separated</b> <b>sounds</b> are recognized by the Missing-Feature Theory (MFT) based ASR with missing feature masks. The HARK is implemented on the middleware called “FlowDesigner ” to share intermediate audio data, which enables near real-time processing.

40|$|Robot {{audition}} systems require capabilities {{for sound}} source separation and {{the recognition of}} <b>separated</b> <b>sounds,</b> since we hear a mixture of sounds in our daily lives, especially mixed of speech. We report a robot audition system {{with a pair of}} omni-directional microphones embedded in a humanoid that recognizes two simultaneous talkers. It first <b>separates</b> the <b>sound</b> sources by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) model. Then, spectral distortion in the <b>separated</b> <b>sounds</b> is then estimated to generate missing feature masks. Finally, the <b>separated</b> <b>sounds</b> are recognized by missing-feature theory (MFT) for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The novel aspects of our system involve estimates of spectral distortion in the temporalfrequency domain in terms of feature vectors and based on estimates error in SIMO-ICA signals. The resulting system outperformed the baseline robot audition system by 7 %. Index Terms: Robot audition, ICA, missing-feature mask. 1...|$|R
