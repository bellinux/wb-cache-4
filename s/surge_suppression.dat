50|$|A typical {{application}} of inrush current limiters {{is in the}} input stage of non-power factor corrected switching supplies, to reduce the initial surge of current from the line input to the reservoir capacitor. The most popular application is the inrush protection of the AC current in switching power supplies (SPS). The primary reason for having <b>surge</b> current <b>suppression</b> in a SPS {{is to protect the}} diode bridge rectifier as the input or charging capacitor is initially charged. This capacitor draws significant current during the first half AC cycle and can subject the components in line with the capacitor to excessive current. The initial equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor provides very little protection for the diode bridge rectifier.|$|R

In order to improve the accuracy of far small infrared targets recognition of ship under surge interference, this paper proposed far small infrared target recognition algorithm of ship based on distributed target position estimation and DOA location in computer vision model for constructing coherent distributed source array model of far small infrared target distribution of ship.

50|$|Close {{proximity}} strikes {{by lightning}} will always {{set off the}} ground fault circuit and at times blow the system out if the system did not follow NEC code Art. 250.94 which illustrates how {{to get rid of}} grounding differentials. A good ground filter/notch filter will prevent a feedback loop up case ground which causes false alarms. Also <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> improperly installed inside a fire alarm panel will also cause a feedback loop up case ground and cause false alarms. So the <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> must be outside the box, in a plastic box and not grounded directly to the fire panel, rather the grounded to the ground side/line side of the in-line series three stage two tank circuit designed AC <b>surge</b> <b>suppression.</b> Parallel will not protect a fire alarm panel nor prevent false alarms. In series <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> will at least help one control where the surges are coming from and the ground filter will also help. Tie three to four knots in the low voltage wire between the low voltage surge suppress and the fire alarm panel, and tie at least one knot in the phase/neutral/and ground wire attached to the power supply.

50|$|<b>Surge</b> <b>suppression</b> {{is usually}} {{provided}} {{by one or}} more metal-oxide varistors (MOVs), which are inexpensive two-terminal semiconductors. These act as very high speed switches, momentarily limiting the peak voltage across their terminals. By design, MOV surge limiters are selected to trigger at a voltage somewhat above the local mains supply voltage, so that they do not clip normal voltage peaks, but clip abnormal higher voltages. In the US, this is (nominally) 120 VAC. It should be borne in mind that this voltage specification is RMS, not peak, and also that it is only a nominal (approximate) value.|$|E
50|$|Systems used {{to reduce}} or limit high voltage surgescan include {{one or more of}} the {{following}} types of electronic components. Some <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> systems use multiple technologies, since each method has its strong and weak points.The first six methods listed operate primarily by diverting unwanted surge energy away from the protected load, through a protective component connected in a parallel (or shunted) topology. The last two methods also block unwanted energy by using a protective component connected in series with the power feed to the protected load, and additionally may shunt the unwanted energy like the earlier systems.|$|E
50|$|A voltage drop, current rise {{is another}} issue caused by power induced by HVAC systems and other heavy loads. AC <b>surge</b> <b>suppression</b> will not stop this problem so a power {{monitoring}} device will work. Example, {{in a nursing home}} a fire alarm system keeps having problems with their power supply and at times deprogramming the panel every time the backup generator came on. In facilities like these, they are required to test generators every month. When the power goes out, that is one thing, but when the power comes on all the HVAC systems are on the same time delay and when they come on, the heavy load is what causes the voltage drop and current rise and the system will go into false alarm. There is technology like the 120HWCP20CBPLC that will monitor the power and when the voltage drops, the unit shuts off the power. The batteries inside the fire alarm will sustain the system until the power is back to normal.|$|E

Dannenbaum Engineering was appointed as the engineering consultant. Despite this, though, the declining economy in 2010 stifled efforts to secure funding and the project remains stalled. By the end of 2012 momentum toward building the structure had waned significantly, in large part due to Hurricane Sandy, which seriously damaged the U.S. Northeast and attracted attention away from the Gulf Coast. Nevertheless, in 2013 Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, a local community organization, began efforts to raise funds for a comprehensive study that could convince the U.S. Congress to fund the project. In addition, throughout 2013 researchers at Delft University of Technology worked out several flood defense concepts for closing off the Bolivar Roads Inlet.

The surge pressure investigated is that propagated by the emergency relief coupling valve (ERV) connected to a loading system carrying crude oil from four flow stations. The results of the analysis show remarkable changes in the fluid parameters arising from the shut down of the loading system by the ERV {{in the event of}} storm.

The system showed high Reynolds number indicating turbulent flow and the Mach number in pipe IV as high as 3. 6 indicating supersonic flow.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{extensive}} study concerning surge instability in an industrial compression system and its dynamic suppression. Both numerical simulations and experiments have been used to analyse the system behaviour under unstable operating conditions and to compare different control devices for <b>surge</b> <b>suppression.</b> First, the characterization of surge is performed over the whole unstable operating range of a compression system based on a four-stage centrifugal compressor. The unsteady energy associated with the surge cycle is employed as an index of the surge intensity to allow for a quantitative approach to the problem. Subsequently, the behaviour and performance of a passive-type control system and of an active-type one are analysed and compared. The former consists of an innovative device based on an oscillating water column, whereas the latter is a high-gain type of feedback device implemented digitally. Experimental data show that the proposed passive device is effective not only in inhibiting surge development, but also in suppressing fully developed instability. The active device turns out to be more effective than the passive one, but under severe conditions it may fail because of actuator limitations and noise amplification. Finally, the relative merits and limitations of the two control systems are discussed with reference to their effectiveness range, flexibility, steady-state performance, installation, maintenance, and costs...|$|E
40|$|Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) provide {{short-term}} power {{back-up to}} sensitive electronic and electrical equipments, where an unexpected power loss {{could lead to}} undesirable outcomes. They usually bridge the connected equipment between the utility mains power and other long term back-up power systems like generators. A UPS also provides a “clean” source of power, meaning they filter the connected equipment from distortions in electrical parameters of the mains power like noise, harmonics, surges, sags and spikes. A surge resistant UPS or SRUPS {{is one that has}} the capability to withstand surges, which are momentary or sustained increases in the mains voltage, and react quickly enough to offer protection to the connected equipment from the same. Usually UPSs run off battery power when the utility mains power is absent. But the SRUPS developed in this design project uses super capacitors instead of battery packs. The {{reason for this is that}} the high energy-densities and medium power-densities offered by super capacitors allow for it to serve two purposes. One is to provide the DC power to operate the UPS in the absence of mains power, as an alternative to batteries. Secondly, super capacitors can withstand heavy momentary high current/voltage surges due to its high energy-density characteristics. Also as the life-time of super capacitors is much higher than that of conventional batteries and as they do not need regular topping-up or inspection, the end result is a truly maintenance-free UPS. Most commercial UPSs do not have inherent surge protection capabilities. The UPS is one entity while a discrete surge protection module is inserted between the utility mains and the UPS to provide for transient <b>surge</b> <b>suppression.</b> In the proposed SRUPS, the super capacitor, because of their inherent capability to absorb transient surges, forms a protective front end to the actual UPS rather than needing to have the involvement of discrete protection devices...|$|E
