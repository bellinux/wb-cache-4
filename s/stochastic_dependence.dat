40|$|Graphical {{models are}} widely used to model <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependences</b> among large {{collections}} of variables. We introduce a new method of estimating undirected conditional independence graphs based on the score matching loss, introduced by Hyvarinen (2005), and subsequently extended in Hyvarinen (2007). The regularized score matching method we propose applies to settings with continuous observations and allows for computationally efficient treatment of possibly non-Gaussian exponential family models. In the well-explored Gaussian setting, regularized score matching avoids issues of asymmetry that arise when applying the technique of neighborhood selection, and compared to existing methods that directly yield symmetric estimates, the score matching approach has the advantage that the considered loss is quadratic and gives piecewise linear solution paths under ℓ_ 1 regularization. Under suitable irrepresentability conditions, we show that ℓ_ 1 -regularized score matching is consistent for graph estimation in sparse high-dimensional settings. Through numerical experiments and an application to RNAseq data, we confirm that regularized score matching achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Gaussian case and provides a valuable tool for computationally efficient estimation in non-Gaussian graphical models...|$|R

5000|$|As {{quantification}} {{of behavior}} is fundamental in this endeavor, {{the theory of}} measurement is a central topic in mathematical psychology.Mathematical psychology is therefore closely related to psychometrics. However, where psychometrics is concerned with individual differences (or population structure) in mostly static variables, mathematical psychology focuses on process models of perceptual, cognitive and motor processes as inferred from the 'average individual'. Furthermore, where psychometrics investigates the <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence</b> structure between variables as observed in the population, mathematical psychology almost exclusively focuses on the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms and is therefore even {{more closely related to}} experimental psychology/cognitive psychology/psychonomics. Like computational neuroscience and econometrics, mathematical psychology theory often uses statistical optimality as a guiding principle, assuming that the human brain has evolved to solve problems in an optimized way.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the multivariate <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence</b> between the returns of asset classes is of importance for many finance applications, such as, e. g., asset allocation or risk management.

40|$|Purpose: In 3 D {{gradient}} echo {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI), strong field gradients B 0 (macro) are visually observed at air/tissue interfaces. At low spatial resolution in particular, the respective field gradients lead to an apparent increase in intravoxel dephasing, and subsequently, to signal loss or inaccurate R- 2 * estimates. If the strong field gradients are measured, their influence can be removed by postprocessing. Methods: Conventional corrections usually assume a linear phase evolution with time. For high macroscopic gradient inhomogeneities {{near the edge of}} the brain and at the paranasal sinuses, however, this assumption is often broken. Herein, we explored a novel model that considers both linear and <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependences</b> of the phase evolution with echo time in the presence of weak and strong macroscopic field inhomogeneities. We tested the performance of the model at large field gradients using simulation, phantom, and human in vivo studies. Results: The performance of the proposed approach was markedly better than the standard correction method, providing a correction equivalent to that of the conventional approach in regions with high signal to noise ratio (SNR > 10), but appearing more robust in regions with low SNR (SNR < 4). Conclusion: The proposed technique shows promise to improve R- 2 * measurements in regions of large susceptibilities. The clinical and research applications still require further investigation...|$|R

Our work generalizes the measures of scatter and linear dependence proposed by Peña and Rodriguez (2003). The measure of variability we introduce is the (transformed) r-th root of the entropy and the measure of dependence is based on the mutual information between the components of an r-dimensional random vector, capturing general <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence</b> instead of merely linear dependence. We further investigate decompositions of the measure of variability into a measure of scale and a measure of <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence.</b> The decomposition resulting from independent components provides a representation of variability by the scale of independent components and thus generalizes the explanation of covariance by principal components in classical multivariate analysis.

30|$|Renewal {{processes}} {{have been}} a frequent object of analysis in early studies of stochastic processes, see Cox (1962), for instance. Only recently the idea of parallel renewal processes receives more attention, see Borgelt and Picado-Muino (2012), Gaigalas (2003), Kai et al. (2014), CRC (1994), Kallen et al. (2010), Truccolo (2005), Modir et al. (2010). However, little emphasis {{has been given to}} the subject of <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence</b> between processes so far, with few exceptions such as shown in Borgelt and Picado-Muino (2012) or Truccolo (2005), Modir et al.

The latter paper emphasizes <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence</b> between point processes described by conditionally independent intensity functions. In the same spirit, <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence</b> between events will be {{at the core of the}} present paper in combination with a linear damage model in a condition based maintenance context. A formal representation of a parallel renewal process is given in Modir et al. (2010), whereby the authors look at the process from the point of view of an abstract Poisson process with state-dependent event rates, conditionally independent given the history of the process. Kai et al. (2014) is another example of a biomedical application of a parallel renewal process, whereby the individual occurrence rates of neural spikes depend not only on the neuron in question, but also on a set of neighboring neurons. A Monte-Carlo algorithm is used to construct a parallel renewal process based on the event rates identified.|$|E

This paper explores the possibility of spatial diversification of insurance by estimating the joint occurrence of unfavorable weather conditions in different locations. For that purpose copula methods are employed that allow an adequate description of stochastic dependencies between multivariate random variables. The estimation procedure is applied to weather data in Germany. Our results indicate that indemnity payments based on temperature as well as on cumulative rainfall show strong <b>stochastic</b> <b>dependence</b> even at a national scale. Thus the possibility to reduce risk exposure by increasing the trading area of the insurance is limited. Irrespective of their economic implications our results pinpoint the necessity of a proper statistical modeling of the dependence structure of multivariate random variables.

Under the mild assumption that the Wiener and uncertain parameters can be treated as independent random variables, it is also shown that the Galerkin formalism naturally separates parametric uncertainty and <b>stochastic</b> forcing <b>dependences.</b> This enables us to perform an orthogonal decomposition of the process variance, and consequently identify contributions arising from the uncertainty in parameters, the stochastic forcing, and a coupled term.

Analogous results are obtained when the variables X and Y are negatively dependent.
