5000|$|The Western Gneiss Region and the Bergen Arc of Western Norway: Known {{as one of}} {{the largest}} eclogitized pieces of {{continental}} crust that was exhumed during the Caledonian orogeny, studies here have shown that recrystallization of the eclogite facies is also accompanied with a significant reduction in rocks strength. This is shown by a localization of shear zones where the host granulites have been transformed to eclogites. The main point of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the kinematics of syn-eclogite deformation in the Bergen arc which suggested that eclogitization is ultimately responsible for the separation of tectonic units from the descending lithosphere. Furthermore, despite density increase, studies show that eclogitization may trigger exhumation due to the reduction in rock strength and requires that eclogitization is not complete. This is especially true in basic and intermediate lithologies that may become denser than the mantle if eclogitization in case of complete recrystallization which is shown by a localization of shear zones where the host granulites have been transformed to eclogites. [...] Thus the Bergen Arc provides an excellent example of eclogitization's role in slab detachment and initiation of exhumation in a continental subduction region.|$|E
