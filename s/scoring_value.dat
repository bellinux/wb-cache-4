2500|$|Jackpot: Some targets on the playfield {{increase}} the <b>scoring</b> <b>value</b> of something else, {{which could be}} as simple as hitting a ramp, or a complicated sequence of targets. Upon their inception, the jackpot was the main goal of most pinball machines in the 1980s. Jackpots would often range from one to four million (back when this was a significant addition to the score), and their value would accrue between games until it was scored. Scoring it was usually a complicated task. Modern games often dilute the meaning of [...] "jackpot". Modern games give off several jackpots in each multiball mode, which is usually quite easy to attain, and the value of today's jackpots is far less significant. Many jackpots awarded during special modes often do not increase at all, but are instead simply fixed-value bonuses.|$|E

Financial institutions like banks and insurance companies also use group profiling to detect fraud or money-laundering. Databases with transactions are searched with algorithms to find behaviours that deviate from the standard, indicating potentially suspicious transactions.|$|E
50|$|In baseball, it {{is unusual}} for {{the best team in}} the league to win the World Series. Experts from statisticians to oddsmakers say chance plays an unusually big part in the game, partly because play is spread out over such a large area. The game's {{complexity}} is also relevant: The <b>scoring</b> <b>value</b> of a base hit, for instance, depends largely on factors outside the hitter's control—namely the ability of the previous batters to get on base.|$|E

The study aimed to: (i) investigate the sensitivity of several lesser-known wood species from natural forest in Riau to drying process at high temperature; and (ii) develop basic drying schedule for each wood. Five lesser-known species from Riau were investigated, namely punak (Tetramerista glabra), mempisang (Diospyros korthalsiana), pasak linggo (Aglaia argentea), meranti bunga (Shorea teysmanniana) and suntai (Palaquiumburckii). Modified Terazawa 2 ̆ 7 s (1965) method {{was used for the}} experiment. The result shows that deformation was found for all species. The most severe deformation level was observed for both punak (<b>score</b> <b>value</b> of 4 - 6) and mempisang (<b>score</b> <b>value</b> of 4 - 5). On the other hand, pasaklinggo experienced the most severe initial end/surface check/split (<b>score</b> <b>value</b> of 6) and honeycombing (<b>score</b> <b>value</b> of 5). The result also showed that punak and pasaklinggo can be dried with the same drying schedule at the temperature range of 40 - 65 ° C and the humidity range of 38 - 88...|$|R

50|$|Minchiate can {{be played}} by two to four players with the most common version played by four players divided into two partnerships. The game, like other tarot games, is a trick taking game in which points are scored by {{capturing}} certain cards and sets of cards. As in most tarot games, the pip cards in cups and coins are in reverse order and play is counter-clockwise. The lowest five trumps were called papi ("popes") while the highest five trumps (Star, Moon, Sun, World, Trumpets) were called arie ("airs") and have a special high <b>scoring</b> <b>value</b> in the game. Minchiate is similar in many ways to tarocchini played in Bologna. In these games, combinations (melds) of cards {{are more important than}} the value of individual cards.|$|E
