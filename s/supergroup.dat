Nothingface guitarist Tom Maxwell became friends with Mudvayne vocalist Chad Gray, and they talked about the possibility of forming a <b>supergroup.</b> The following year, Nothingface toured with Mudvayne and talks to form the <b>supergroup</b> continued, although were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. At this time, Gray and Maxwell had brainstormed five band names.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his main work—performing with Deep Purple and other bands during the 1970s and 1980s—he sang the role of Jesus in the original recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, performed in the charity <b>supergroup</b> Rock Aid Armenia, and engaged {{in a number of}} business investments and ventures, including a hotel, a motorcycle manufacturer, and music recording facilities at Kingsway Studios. More recently, he has performed solo concerts concurrently with his latter career in Deep Purple, and his work and affinity with Armenia, combined with his continued friendship with Tony Iommi since his brief time in Black Sabbath, has led him to form the <b>supergroup</b> WhoCares with Iommi. His solo career outside of Deep Purple was given a comprehensive overview with the Gillan's Inn box set in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In late Precambrian time, {{extension}} {{from a large}} {{tectonic plate}} or smaller plates moving away from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to Glacier National Park in Montana to the Grand Canyon and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting Grand Canyon <b>Supergroup</b> of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2billion and 740million years ago in this sea.

Webb and Zimmer formed a <b>supergroup</b> with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and former Eurythmic, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart {{did not participate in}} the film's music, and the <b>supergroup,</b> credited as The Magnificent Six (a reference to the Sinister Six) was composed of Williams, Marr, Einziger, Junkie XL, Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski assisting Zimmer. The soundtrack for the film was released on April 22, 2014 by Columbia Records and Madison Gate Records. Hans Zimmer described his work for this film as different from previous works by him, thus revealing one of the themes for the film, which was first heard on the website.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEvery torsionfree {{abelian group}} A of rank two is a {{subgroup}} of Q⊕Q and is expressed by a direct limit of free abelian groups of rank two with lower diagonal integer-valued 2 × 2 -matrices as the bonding maps. Using these direct systems we classify all subgroups of Q⊕Q which are finite index <b>supergroups</b> of A or finite index subgroups of A. Using this classification we prove that for each prime p {{there exists a}} torsionfree abelian group A satisfying the following, where A⩽Q⊕Q and all <b>supergroups</b> are subgroups of Q⊕Q:(1) for each natural number s there are ∑q|s,gcd(p,q) = 1 q s-index <b>supergroups</b> and also ∑q|s,gcd(p,q) = 1 q s-index subgroups;(2) each pair of distinct s-index <b>supergroups</b> are non-isomorphic and each pair of distinct s-index subgroups are non-isomorphic...|$|R

Aetosaurs are also known from the Newark <b>Supergroup</b> along the East Coast of the United States in states such as Connecticut and North Carolina. Two genera are known from Greenland: Aetosaurus and Paratypothorax. They have been found from the Fleming Fjord Formation in Jameson Land. Longosuchus is the only aetosaur known from Africa, with scutes having been found from the late Carnian Timesgadiouine Formation in Morocco.

During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker musical ideas he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in <b>supergroup</b> Box Car Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. Box Car Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} <b>supergroup</b> and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on Box Car Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of Box Car Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it loomed over the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E

Bases were used for social meeting or housing special items used in crafting Inventions, serving as a collective item vault, or to recover after losing all Health in the overworld. <b>Supergroups</b> in turn could form Coalitions with each other for increased collaborations.
