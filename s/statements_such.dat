25|$|In mathematics, a theorem is a {{statement}} that has been proved {{on the basis of}} previously established <b>statements,</b> <b>such</b> as other theorems, and generally accepted <b>statements,</b> <b>such</b> as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental.|$|E
25|$|Some {{approaches}} {{for the resolution}} of the paradox reject Hempel's equivalence condition. That is, they may not consider evidence supporting the statement all non-black objects are non-ravens to necessarily support logically-equivalent <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as all ravens are black.|$|E
25|$|Scholars rate voting methods using mathematically-derived voting method criteria, which {{describe}} desirable {{features of}} a method. No ranked-preference method can meet all of the criteria, because {{some of them are}} mutually exclusive, as shown by <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as Arrow's impossibility theorem and the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{an operator}} {{form of an}} if <b>statement,</b> <b>such</b> as C's ternary operator.|$|R
5000|$|The word liberty {{can refer}} to many things, but Isaiah Berlin {{recognized}} two main types of liberty. Berlin described a <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "I am slave to no man" [...] as one of Negative Liberty, that is, freedom from another individual's direct interference. He contrasted this with a Positive Freedom <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "I am my own master", which lays claim to a freedom to choose one's own pursuits in life.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] symbol {{stands for}} any <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as I walk outside. Therefore {{it could also}} stand for The apple is Red.|$|R
25|$|In most uses of en dashes, such as {{when used}} in {{indicating}} ranges, they are closed up to the joined words. It is only when en dashes take the role of em dashes – for example, in setting off parenthetical <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as this one – that they take spaces around them. For more on the choice of em versus en in this context, see En dash versus em dash.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the book's release, <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as Haruki Murakami's {{messages}} on 28 February and 15 March, were issued to convey fragments of information {{over the course}} of seven statements. However, details of the novel were not disclosed. Furthermore, galleys, usually given to other reviewers, newspapers, and bookstores before the publication, were not created. The knowledge of the content of the book was limited to a small number of people.|$|E
25|$|There is {{much debate}} within Judaism, {{as well as}} by outside scholars, about the exact {{relationship}} between measurements in the system and those in other measurement systems, such as the English units system used in the United States of America. Classical <b>statements,</b> <b>such</b> as that an Etzba was seven barleycorns laid side by side, or that a Log was equal to six medium-sized eggs, are so indefinite and vague as to be nearly useless.|$|E
5000|$|A zone file is {{referenced}} by {{the configuration}} file {{of the name}} server software such as bind, typically by a <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as: ...|$|R
6000|$|And he {{interspersed}} {{his text}} plentifully with exclamatory headings intended {{to catch the}} eye with startling fragments of narration and <b>statement,</b> <b>such</b> as ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They tell me you're a {{prominent}} philosopher." [...] The yellow horse turned to Marcus. [...] "Can you deny a basic and pivotal <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as this?" ...|$|R
25|$|The initial {{chip design}} process begins with {{system-level}} design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft {{a proposal for}} a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers will meet at this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. This step is where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the functional requirements, verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as encodes in the MP3 format or implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.|$|E
500|$|Some <b>statements,</b> <b>such</b> as [...] and , may {{themselves}} contain <b>statements.</b> <b>Such</b> statements may {{be terminated}} in two ways: by a period (...) , which terminates all unterminated statements contained, or by a scope terminator, which terminates the nearest matching open statement.|$|E
500|$|Such {{descriptions}} {{are often}} cited by Dworkin's critics, interpreting {{the book as}} claiming [...] "all" [...] heterosexual intercourse is rape, or more generally that the anatomical mechanics of sexual intercourse make it intrinsically harmful to women's equality. For instance, Cathy Young says that <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as, [...] "Intercourse is the pure, sterile, formal expression of men's contempt for women," [...] are reasonably summarized as [...] "All sex is rape".|$|E
5000|$|Then one {{may make}} several {{equivalent}} <b>statements</b> about <b>such</b> a set. One <b>such</b> <b>statement</b> is the following: ...|$|R
50|$|A set of axioms is (simply) {{consistent}} {{if there}} is no <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> that both the statement and its negation are provable from the axioms, and inconsistent otherwise.|$|R
5000|$|Both the A-State and A-Trait scales {{comprise}} 20 items {{each and}} are scored on 4-point forced-choice Likert-type response scales. [...] Scores range from 20 to 80, {{with higher scores}} suggesting greater levels of anxiety. Low scores suggest mild anxiety, median scores suggest moderate anxiety, while high scores suggest severe anxiety. Both scales include direct and reverse-worded items. Direct-worded items represent the presence of anxiety in a <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "I feel worried." [...] Reverse-worded items represent the absence of anxiety in a <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as, [...] "I feel secure." ...|$|R
500|$|Barbauld's texts were {{designed}} for the developing reader, beginning with words of one syllable and progressing to multi-syllabic words. The first part of Lessons includes simple <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as: [...] "Ink is black, and papa's shoes are black. Paper is white, and Charles's frock is white." [...] The second part increases in difficulty: [...] "February is very cold too, but the days are longer, {{and there is a}} yellow crocus coming up, and the mezereon tree is in blossom, and there are some white snow-drops peeking up their little heads." ...|$|E
500|$|The kernel ker(f) of {{a linear}} map [...] {{consists}} of vectors v that are mapped to 0 in W. Both kernel and image [...] are subspaces of V and W, respectively. The existence of kernels and images {{is part of}} the statement that the category of vector spaces (over a fixed field F) is an abelian category, i.e. a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a category) that behaves much like the category of abelian groups. Because of this, many <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as the first isomorphism theorem (also called rank–nullity theorem in matrix-related terms) ...|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect has an {{optional}} subplot where the player {{can develop a}} romantic relationship with a non-player character. If the relationship becomes more intimate, a cutscene containing partial nudity and sexual activity is shown. The scene first came under scrutiny in an article by neoconservative blogger Kevin McCullough, who employed <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "Mass Effect can be customized to sodomise whatever, whomever, however, the game player wishes", and [...] "with its over the net capabilities virtual orgasmic rape is just {{the push of a}} button away." [...] The article was criticized by the gaming community and long-time anti-obscenity campaigner Jack Thompson, who said that [...] "this contrived controversy is absolutely ridiculous." [...] Although McCullough ultimately issued an apology, he still considered the material offensive.|$|E
5000|$|Authorization is {{indicated}} on a check draft in the signature blank, usually by a <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as the following: [...] "This draft is preauthorized by your depositor, no signature required.".|$|R
5000|$|Second, {{although}} classes {{may contain}} algorithmic components similar to statements or blocks in programming languages, their primary content {{is a set}} of equations. In contrast to a typical assignment <b>statement,</b> <b>such</b> as ...|$|R
5000|$|A basic {{aspect of}} verbal reasoning, a {{proposition}} {{is a statement}} that expresses a judgement, opinion or fact about something. A simple <b>statement</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "sharks are dangerous" [...] {{is a form of}} proposition.|$|R
500|$|Rockefeller {{called her}} [...] "Miss Tarbarrel" [...] in private but held back in public saying only, [...] "not {{a word about}} that misguided woman." [...] He began a {{publicity}} campaign to put his company and himself in a better light. Though he had long maintained a policy of active silence with the press, he decided to make himself more accessible and responded with conciliatory comments such as [...] "capital and labor are both wild forces which require intelligent legislation to hold them in restriction." [...] He wrote and published his memoirs beginning in 1908. Critics found his writing to be sanitized and disingenuous and thought that <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "the underlying, essential element of success in business is to follow the established laws of high-class dealing" [...] seemed to {{be at odds with}} his true business methods.|$|E
500|$|Woo {{was also}} {{pressured}} by Universal to tone-down {{the violence and}} body count that they had seen in his Hong Kong films. As Woo had not mastered the English language yet, it took time for {{the cast and crew}} to get used to working with him. When Woo could not explain what he wanted with a shot to cinematographer Russell Carpenter, he would resort to simple <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "this will be the Sam Peckinpah shot" [...] to get his message across to Carpenter. Actor Lance Henriksen recalled that it was a gradual process that led everyone involved to start seeing the film as a John Woo film rather than a Jean-Claude Van Damme film. Producer James Jacks recalled that Woo was not [...] "the most powerful person on the set but as far as I was concerned, he was certainly the most respected".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene of}} the crime was visited by Father Michael Lewis of the Stella Maris Church, who was {{accompanied}} by Williamson's sister Gradryn Williams; she was convinced not to look at the body by Williamson's friends. Crowds assembled outside the apartment block, made up of individuals who were laughing and celebrating Williamson's death. Some of the assembled people shouted out <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "This is long overdue", [...] "Battyman he get killed", [...] "Let's get them one at a time", [...] "That's what you get for sin", and [...] "Batty man fi dead!" [...] ("Faggots should die!"). Others sang [...] "Boom Bye Bye", a line from a dancehall song by Buju Banton that discusses shooting and burning gay men. Rebecca Schleifer, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher, had a meeting with Williamson planned for that day, and arrived at his home to find the assembled crowd; she noted that [...] "It was like a parade. They were basically partying".|$|E
50|$|When a variable, v, {{is on the}} LHS of an {{assignment}} <b>statement,</b> <b>such</b> as s(j), then s(j) is a definition of v. Every variable (v) {{has at least one}} definition by its declaration (V) (or initialization).|$|R
50|$|While the {{paintings}} has some similarity to the Madonna of Loreto, Raphael {{make a more}} dramatic <b>statement,</b> <b>such</b> as {{through the use of}} ruins of the Sacchetti Villa and vineyard, near the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.|$|R
5000|$|Java allows flow {{of control}} {{to leave the}} finally block of a try statement, {{regardless}} {{of the way it}} was entered. This can cause another control flow <b>statement</b> (<b>such</b> as return) to be terminated mid-execution. For example: ...|$|R
500|$|List {{believed}} that the basic teachings of Wotanism {{were found in the}} runic alphabet, believing that they could be deciphered by linking these letters with particular runic spells which appear in the Old Norse Havamal. He claimed to have deciphered these secret meanings himself, translating them as <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "Know yourself, then you know everything", [...] "Do not fear death, he cannot kill you", [...] "Marriage is the root of the Aryan race!", and [...] "Man is one with God!" [...] List emphasised the importance of a mystical union between humans and the universe, viewing divinity as being immanent in nature, with all life being an emanation of it. Connected to this, he believed in a close identification between the racial group [...] the volk or folk [...] and the natural world. List {{believed that}} human beings had an immortal soul, {{and that it would be}} reincarnated according to the laws of karma until eventually uniting with divinity.|$|E
500|$|Grant often poked fun {{at himself}} with <b>statements</b> <b>such</b> as, [...] "Everyone {{wants to be}} Cary Grant—even I want to be Cary Grant", and in ad-lib lines—such as in the film His Girl Friday (1940), saying, [...] "Listen, the last man who {{said that to me}} was Archie Leach, just a week before he cut his throat." [...] In Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. According to a famous story now {{believed}} to be fictional, after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking, [...] "How old Cary Grant?", Grant reportedly responded, [...] "Old Cary Grant fine. How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E
500|$|The chariot races were {{important}} in the Byzantine Empire, as in the Roman Empire, {{as a way to}} reinforce social class and political power, including the might of the Byzantine emperor, and were often put on for political or religious reasons. In addition, chariot races were sometimes held in celebration of an emperor's birthday. An explicit parallel was drawn between the victorious charioteers and the victorious emperor. The factions addressed their victors by chanting [...] "Rejoice... your Lords have conquered" [...] while the charioteer took a victory lap, further indicating the parallel between the charioteer's victory and the emperor's victory. Indeed, reliefs of Porphyrius, the famous Byzantine charioteer, show him in a victor's pose being acclaimed by partisans, which is clearly modeled on the images on the base of Emperor Theodosius's obelisk. The races could also be used to symbolically make religious <b>statements,</b> <b>such</b> as when a charioteer, whose mother was named Mary, fell off his chariot and got back on and the crowd described it as [...] "The son of Mary has fallen and risen again and is victorious." ...|$|E
