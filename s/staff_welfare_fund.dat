40|$|ABSTRACT: The growing {{importance}} of the environmental and social policies in the Spanish savings banks and the large differences between them, take us to delve into those factors that influence on the amounts spent on environment and <b>welfare</b> <b>fund.</b> In this line, we have analyzed all the Spanish Savings Banks, over the period 2004 - 2008 and using the methodology of panel data, {{the effect that the}} composition of the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Committee has on the percentage of income spent on Environment and <b>Welfare</b> <b>Fund.</b> Specifically, such as variables of Board ´ composition, we used the presence of women and the existence of a political representative. In view of the results obtained, we can draw as general conclusions that the amount of the <b>Welfare</b> <b>Fund</b> that is spent on Environment depends positively on the presence of women in the Board of Directors, while the variable that have a big positive influence on the <b>Welfare</b> <b>Fund</b> is the existence of a political representative in the Board.

40|$|Making the Link: Pregnancy Prevention in the New Welfare Era offers {{strategies}} to prevent unintended pregnancy {{in an era}} in which the nation's welfare program has a changed mission, more money, and greater reach. The enactment of the 1996 welfare law allows federal <b>welfare</b> <b>funds</b> to be spent on an array of pregnancy prevention activities and family planning services; furthermore, <b>welfare</b> <b>funds</b> are no longer limited to welfare recipients who receive grants [...] funds may be spent on individuals who have never {{been a part of the}} welfare system. These fundamental policy changes, along with nearly $ 8 billion of unspent <b>welfare</b> <b>funds,</b> allow states to consider whether and how to invest in a range of {{strategies to}} prevent unintended pregnancy. The law permits, but does not require, any such investment. Nevertheless, a number of states are creating new ways to address unintended pregnancy. Some states are linking welfare offices and family planning services [...] through co-location, information dissemination, referrals, case management, education, and training. Others are tapping <b>welfare</b> <b>funds</b> to provide education, information, or services to those who might never enter a welfare office. Some programs target adults, others teens; some include a focus on males. Making the Link seeks to provide insight into different types of links and how to make them work...|$|R
