40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} volume estimates with bark, obtained with equations originated from {{data of the}} stem measurements with bark and stem analysis without bark, respectively. The base of information {{for the development of}} this study was obtained in forest of Pinus taeda L. in the municipal district of Ponte Alta do Norte, Santa Catarina, being composed by two hundred and forty trees measured with bark in different ages, which were selected aleatorily and distributed by diameter class. Another source of data was obtained with the stem analysis without bark of thirty sample trees, distributed among averages and dominant. Mathematical models were tested for each source of data, in order to <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> better adjustment and precision, with base in the selection criterion of the Score Pondered Value of the Statistical Parameters (VP). The result of VP revealed the equation of Schumacher-Hall as the most appropriated one in the estimate of the volume for the respective sources of data. The comparison between the estimates of volume of the adjusted models starting from data of the stem measurements with bark and of the stem analysis without bark was accomplished with the test Qui-square, which demonstrated that there area no significant differences to be significant difference among the them allowing to affirm {{that it is possible to}} obtain the volume with bark starting from an equation generated with volume data without bark, obtained through the stem analysis...|$|E

40|$|Anycasting is {{a network}} service that <b>selects</b> <b>the</b> best <b>one</b> <b>of</b> service {{providers}} in an anycast {{group as a}} destination. While anycasting offers better service flexibility in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), it also incurs new problems. In MANETs, every node can move arbitrarily, and the routes from mobile nodes to their service providers would vary. Therefore, anycast service discovery in MANETs usually relies on network-layer message broadcasting, which leads to large traffic overhead for the scarce bandwidth of MANETs. In this work, we present a traffic-control scheme for anycast service discovery in MANETs. Our scheme can reduce the volume of query messages and the reply messages. In addition to basic anycasting, our scheme also supports k-anycast service that requests for k anycast service providers in each service instance. With k-anycast service, the fault tolerance and service flexibility of our scheme can be improved. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is efficient and feasible for MANETs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{mathematical}} model of a simplified version of genetic algorithm (GA) based on mutation and tournament selection and obtain upper and lower bounds on expected proportion of the individuals with the fitness above certain threshold.

The theoretical estimates obtained are compared with experimental results. 1 Introduction In this {{paper we propose}} a mathematical model of a simplified version of the genetic algorithm (GA) based on mutation and selection operators and evaluate the probability distribution of its population. We study the GA with s-tournament selection operator which randomly chooses s individuals from the previous population and <b>selects</b> <b>the</b> best <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them (see e. g.

40|$|We {{have created}} an {{automatic}} algorithm that creates a mosaic of user-supplied digital images to reproduce a user-supplied single larger digital image. In creating the mosaic of smaller images to reproduce the larger image, the simplest approach in selecting which image to place in each larger image pixel location is simply to <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> image <b>of</b> all smaller images whose overall color or grayscale levels best matches that of the larger image at that pixel location. However, for a higher quality result, other additional considerations and issues arise, including: reshading of the smaller images to better match the color or grayscale value at each large image pixel location; how to best reproduce essentially solid (constant-valued) areas in the larger image; creating more smoothness between smaller images in the mosaic for a more visually pleasing large image; ensuring {{that all of the}} smaller user-supplied supplied images are used at least once in reproducing the larger image, or possibly using all of the smaller images essentially an equal number of times; and numerical issues such as image and integer types in working in Matlab...|$|R

40|$|Available are {{independent}} observations (continuous data) that {{are believed to}} be a random sample. Desired are distribution-free confidence intervals and significance tests for the population median. However, there is the possibility that either the smallest or the largest observation is an outlier. Then, use of a procedure for rejection of an outlying observation might seem appropriate. Such a procedure would consider that two alternative situations are possible and would select <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. Either (1) the n observations are truly a random sample, or (2) an outlier exists and its removal leaves a random sample of size n- 1. For either situation, confidence intervals and tests are desired for the median of the population yielding the random sample. Unfortunately, satisfactory rejection procedures of a distribution-free nature {{do not seem to be}} available. Moreover, all rejection procedures impose undesirable conditional effects on the observations, and also, can <b>select</b> <b>the</b> wrong <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two above situations.
