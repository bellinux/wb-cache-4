Ryerson put forth a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the Quebec and in turn educated most English-speaking Canadians about a region they knew very little about. As a sequel to 1837, Ryerson's French Canada revealed [...] "the militant spirit of democracy among French Canadians" [...] in the hopes of uniting [...] "them with their Anglophone compatriots." [...] Ryerson did follow a certain [...] "great man" [...] approach to history when, in the early chapters, he emphasized the heroes [...] "who struggled for self-determination and/or Canadian unity"; this approach was complemented by an emphasis on [...] "the Quebec masses and their rise out of feudal subjugation toward political power." [...] Very much the Historical Materialist, Ryerson viewed the previous administrations of Quebec as working with representatives of English Canada and international capitalism to keep Quebec in economic subservience. Ryerson believed, [...] "The Toronto Tory and the Quebec corporatist meet on common ground: hostility to the democratic peoples' movement, [...] denial of our democratic heritage." [...] Following on his contentions laid out in 1837, Ryerson viewed the failure of English Canada to recognise their connection to French Canada and to fight hand in hand for the fullest democratic rights of the minority nation only served to deepen the power of reactionary influences and limit Canadian democracy and unity in general.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{argues for}} a need of {{rethinking}} {{the interaction between}} social science and <b>socio-economic</b> policy <b>analysis</b> {{on the one hand}} and policy making and implementation on the other. The interaction, traditionally conceived as a variant expert-client interaction should rather be conceived in terms of an expert-to-expert dialogue. The inevitable conclusion is that any understanding of the impact of (social) scientific research on policy must understand the cultural context of the interaction. A suggested avenue to incorporate the effects of scientific advice on policy making is seeing such analysis as part of the policy system’s or policy maker’s ‘innovation system’. This view has immediate consequences for the organisation of the science/policy interface. ...|$|R

40|$|Schumpeter {{designed}} Business Cycles as {{his major}} work, {{but it has}} never received much attention. The problem is partly related to its complex treatment {{of the theory of}} waveform economic evolution and the related study of the statistics and history of 150 years of capitalist evolution, but the book also makes a deliberate analytical delimitation: the emphasis on economic evolution and the placement of institutional change as an external factor. This definition of the task did not allow Schumpeter to make a full-blown study of the history of capitalist evolution. To some extent, he overcame that problem in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, but we have to return to the works of his youth to understand his conception of the coevolutionary processes of <b>socio-economic</b> life. <b>Analysis</b> of economic evolution, socio-economic coevolution, Joseph A.
