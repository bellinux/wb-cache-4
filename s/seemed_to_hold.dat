Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were confirmed as the first planets discovered to transit the same star.|$|E

It was a rusty brown, but <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a thousand runs, and both Hammond and Bradman were enthusiastic in their keenness {{to win the}} toss. When the England skipper called correctly he smiled with confident pleasure.... Imagine Hammond's surprise when before an hour had passed the wicket, which looked so docile, {{was in fact a}} dangerous spin-taking nightmare.|$|E
25|$|O’Neill was in {{permanent}} conflict with Portugal. While other contemporaries wrote poems that protested against national life under Salazar, O’Neill’s attack ran deeper. Poems such as ‘Standing at Fearful Attention’ and ‘Portugal’ {{suggested that the}} dictatorial regime was a symptom (the worst symptom) of graver ills– lack of courage and smallness of vision– woven into the nation’s psyche. Other poems, such as ‘Lament of the Man Who Misses Being Blind’, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> religion and mysticism responsible for an obscurantism that made change difficult if not impossible.|$|E

25|$|The Roman troops arrived {{tired and}} dehydrated, facing the Gothic camp {{that had been}} set up {{on the top of a}} hill. The Goths, except for their cavalry, defended their wagon circle, inside of which were their {{families}} and possessions. Fritigern's objective was to delay the Romans, in order to give enough time for the Gothic cavalry to return. The fields were burnt by the Goths to delay and harass the Romans with smoke, and negotiations began for an exchange of hostages. The negotiations exasperated the Roman soldiers who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the stronger position, but they gained precious time for Fritigern.|$|E
25|$|King Faisal <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the pluralist view, favouring limited, {{cautious}} {{accommodation of}} popular demands for inclusive reform, and made repeated attempts to broaden political representation, harking {{back to his}} temporarily successful national integration policy from 1965 to 1975. King Faisal acknowledged his country's religious and cultural diversity, which includes the predominantly Shia Ahsa in the east; the Asir in the southwest, with tribal affinities to Yemen, especially among the Ismaili tribes of Najran and Jizan; and the Kingdom of the Hejaz, with its capital Mecca. He included non-Wahhabi, cosmopolitan Sunni Hejazis from Mecca and Jeddah in the Saudi government. However, after his reign, discrimination based on sect, tribe, region, and gender became {{the order of the}} day and has remained as such until today.|$|E
500|$|In this meeting, Said Bey had {{attempted}} to dissuade Lynch of his plans {{to travel to the}} Dead Sea, with Aqil remarking that the Bedouin of the Ghor (Jordan Valley) would [...] "eat them up". Lynch's reply was that [...] "they would find us difficult of digestion," [...] but he suggested that as Aqil <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> influence with these tribes, he would be prepared to pay him to make the trip a more peaceable one.|$|E

500|$|The {{position}} in the future empire of the Frisians, another Germanic people, was discussed on 5 April 1942 in one of Hitler’s many wartime dinner-conversations. Himmler commented that there was ostensibly no real sense of community between the different indigenous {{ethnic groups in the}} Netherlands. He then stated that the Dutch Frisians in particular <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> no affection for being part of a nation-state based on the Dutch national identity, and felt a much greater sense of kinship with their German Frisian brethren across the Ems River in East Frisia, an observation Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel agreed with based on his own experiences. Hitler determined that the best course of action in that case would be to unite the two Frisian regions {{on both sides of the}} border into a single province, and would at a later point in time further discuss the topic with Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the governor of the German regime in the Netherlands. By late May of that year these discussions were apparently concluded, as on the 29th he pledged that he would not allow the West-Frisians to remain part of Holland, and that since they were [...] "part of the exact same race as the people of East Frisia" [...] had to be joined into one province.|$|E
500|$|On 1August 1986, U2 regrouped in Dublin {{to resume}} {{work on the}} album and begin the {{recording}} stage proper. During this more intense phase of the sessions, the group began {{to work at the}} Edge's newly purchased house, Melbeach, in seaside Monkstown. Lanois said of Melbeach, [...] "That was less of a rock 'n' roll room but we made it work. I think {{there were a lot of}} headaches, isolating people and having to build baffles around the place." [...] The Edge called the house [...] "more sombre" [...] but said it had a [...] "solid unpretentious quality that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the energy in". [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] were among the songs that evolved at Melbeach. Lanois said that most of the record was done there, and that it was the preferred location for mixing. Writing and recording alternated between the two houses and Windmill Lane Studios. In late August during Hurricane Charley, U2 were visited at Danesmoate by Robbie Robertson, the former guitarist of the Band. Robertson was in Ireland to complete his self-titled debut solo album that he had begun with Lanois. Together, U2 and Robertson recorded the tracks [...] "Sweet Fire of Love" [...] and [...] "Testimony", both of which appear on Robertson's album.|$|E
2500|$|Mulder's {{greatest}} nemesis was The Smoking Man, who, {{despite his}} obvious ill-intent, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> Mulder in special regard. Though he mocked Mulder {{to his face}} for his foolishness and the futility of his quest, in [...] "Two Fathers", he told his son Jeffrey Spender, [...] "You pale to Fox Mulder." [...] Mulder also developed an intense enmity for Alex Krycek, a double agent who briefly worked with Mulder in the FBI as an infiltrator, and who continued {{to serve as a}} recurring adversary, acting as an assassin for the Syndicate in the murders of Bill Mulder and Melissa Scully.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "They seemed longer than wide, their thickness was about 1/20th their width." [...] (document with Arnold's drawing at right) [...] As to motion, Arnold wrote, [...] "They flew like many times I have observed geese to fly in a rather diagonal chain-like line as if they were linked together. They <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a definite direction but rather swerved {{in and out of the}} high mountain peaks."

2500|$|The film {{combines}} {{elements of}} science fiction, Atompunk, and gothic horror. Science fiction remained popular throughout the 1950s, though the genre had experienced {{significant changes in}} the post-war period. The Atomic Age, heralded by the development of nuclear weapons and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had inspired science fiction films which were dealing with the dangers of unrestricted science while spaceflight and the existence of extraterrestrial life and civilizations, more [...] "traditional" [...] elements of the genre, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> new fascination for audiences experiencing the start of the Space Race. On the other hand, Gothic fiction had enjoyed the height of its popularity in film during the 1930s and 1940s. It was experiencing a decline in the 1950s and was seen as old-fashioned. The combination of dated and modern elements, by 1950s standards, gives the film a rather anachronistic quality.|$|E
