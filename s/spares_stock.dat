40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a computer simulation model for determining effective <b>spares</b> <b>stock</b> levels for recoverable items at Air Force bases and depots. The simulation model {{is based on}} the following fundamental inventory theory; whenever a demand arises, it is satisfied from stock on hand, and the quantity equal to that demand is recorded immediately; when a demand exceeds stock on hand, the excess demand is backordered immediately and when item life expires procurement action is initiated at depot level. The resulting product of the model cam be used as a guide for the optimum distribution of available spares or as a computation of the necessary spares which will meet a desired percent fill rate. Outputs from the simulation model will also enable evaluation of the spares level effects as a result of change in other logistic parameters. The purpose of this thesis is two-fold {{to the extent that it}} presents: (a) A computer simulation model of an Air Force logistic system; and (b) A discussion of compound Monte-Carlo demand generation involving various analytic failure distributions. The specific nature of the problem to which the simulation model is applied is described and the model construction and output are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|When {{customers}} {{buy a new}} product, {{the reliability}} related {{issues such as the}} warranty/post-warranty service and the performance of the product are becoming important factors in the customers' decision-making process. In this dissertation, some important aspects in estimating both warranty and post-warranty repair demands have been studied. To ensure the new product will have a good performance, the availability of a repairable k-out-of-n:G system considering spare parts logistics is investigated. The installed base of the product varies with time due to both new sales and units being taken out of service is considered. We explicitly address the fact that customers may not always request repairs for failed units and formulate the corresponding warranty and post-warranty repair demands for a general failure process. For the case where the product failure time is exponential, we derive the closed-form expressions for the two types of repair demands for both an individual unit and the installed base. A step further, we develop an integrated model to estimate the gross profit for a new durable product to be sold in a fixed sales period at a fixed price. The sales over time is characterized by a stochastic Bass model and the production system is a make-to-order type of system. An approximate, yet accurate approach is developed to quantify the expected total cost of production involving a learning effect. The analysis of key parameters that affect the optimal gross profit is carried out in numerical examples. Finally, the availability management of a new product (or system) is studied. We introduce a collection of operational availability maximization problems, in which the component redundancy levels and the <b>spares</b> <b>stock</b> quantities are to be determined simultaneously under economic and physical constraints...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a mathematical model, called MOD-METRIC, for the control of a multi-item, multi-echelon, multi-indenture inventory-system for recoverable items, that is, items subject to repair when they fail. Discussion is limited to two-echelon multi-item systems in which an item may be demanded at any one of several locations called bases; in turn, these bases receive inventory from a central location called a depot. The objectives of the model are to describe the logistics relationship between an assembly and its subassemblies, and to compute <b>spare</b> <b>stock</b> levels for both echelons for the assembly and subassemblies with explicit consideration of this logistics relationship. In particular, the model is used to determine the base and depot <b>spare</b> <b>stock</b> levels which minimize total expected base backorders for the assembly subject to a system investment constraint. An example is given showing how the model can be used to calculate spare engine and engine module stock levels. MOD-METRIC has been implemented by the Air Force as the method for computing recoverable <b>spare</b> <b>stock</b> levels for the F- 15 weapon system. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze and improve Dolphin Drillings spare part management. That is done by {{conducting}} a current situation analysis, and proposing a framework for determining necessary <b>spare</b> part <b>stock</b> levels. Chapter 3 presents a review of elements in an RCM analysis, and classification of spare parts. It is proposed to use the analytical hierarchy process to determine the importance of parameters influencing spare parts needs. Chapter 4 presents the current situation analysis of Dolphin Drillings spare part management. An important result of the current situation analysis is the overstocking tendency. For the current situation analysis and developing a framework for determining <b>spare</b> part <b>stock</b> levels, a Microsoft Access database was built. In chapter 5, {{the development of the}} database and framework is presented. The decision framework is divided in two parts. The first part consists of deciding if the spare part should be stocked, or purchased when required. The second part is determining stock levels. The framework resulted in potential savings of up to 46 %. Chapter 6 presents the results of the proposed framework, by utilizing it to determine <b>spare</b> part <b>stock</b> levels for a selection of equipment. In chapter 7 results of the current situation analysis and development of the framework is presented and discussed. Results of the current situation analysis include lacking information about materials in the computerized maintenance management system, incomplete and missing bill of materials, and overstocking. By addressing the proposed improvements Dolphin Drilling will in the future have a better maintenance and material management system as well as improved cost control.

The steady state probabilities {{for the number of}} units in resupply (or repair) completely describe the item's long term behavior, and are simply the normalized values of the compound Poisson demand distribution based on the mean of the resupply distribution but not on the distribution itself. Knowledge of these state probabilities enables us to compute several measures of item supply performance {{as a function of the}} <b>spare</b> <b>stock,</b> s.

Implicitly, a decision is assumed on which components to discard and which to repair upon failure, and where to perform repairs.

In our experiment, we use a set of such problems, and a set of multi-echelon, multi-indenture problems, for which we achieve a cost reduction of 3 % on average (35 % at maximum) compared with the sequential approach.
