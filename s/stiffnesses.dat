All is very mysterious about him; his inward opinion about all manner of matters, from the GNADENWAHL to the late Double-Marriage Question.

Let us try Schulenburg.

It is a perfect {{entanglement}} of gun-cotton, and explodes into vacuity wherever one holds a light to it. I shall leave him to do so with the rest of it for himself, and should perhaps have left it to his own handling altogether, but for the intemperateness of the spirit with which he has spoken on a subject perhaps of all others demanding gentleness and caution. No man could more earnestly have desired the changes lately introduced into the system of the University of Oxford than I did myself: no man can be more deeply sensible than I of grievous failures in the practical working even of the present system: but I believe that these failures may be almost without exception traced to one source, the want of evangelical, and the excess of rubrical religion among the tutors; together with such rustinesses and <b>stiffnesses</b> as necessarily attend the continual operation of any intellectual machine. The fault is, at any rate, far less in the system than in the imperfection of its administration; and had it been otherwise, the terms in which Mr. Fergusson speaks of it are hardly decorous in one who can but be imperfectly acquainted with its working. They are sufficiently answered by the structure of the essay in which they occur; for if the high powers of mind which its author possesses had been subjected to the discipline of the schools, he could not have wasted his time on the development of a system which their simplest formulæ of logic would have shown him to be untenable.|$|E

For soft substrates, the influence of substrate <b>stiffness</b> on cell cortical <b>stiffness</b> is more prominent than that of cell shape, since increasing adherent area does not lead to cell stiffening.

40|$|We present {{variable}} negative <b>stiffness</b> actuation (VnSA), {{an alternative}} method of achieving variable <b>stiffness</b> actuation {{based on the}} nonlinear deflection characteristics of buckling beams. The approach exploits transverse <b>stiffness</b> variations of axially loaded beams around their critical buckling load to achieve an actuator with adjustable <b>stiffness.</b> In particular, transverse <b>stiffness</b> of buckled beams are positive under tensile loading and for compressive loading below their first critical buckling load, while they display negative <b>stiffness</b> above this critical value. Furthermore, for small deflections transverse <b>stiffness</b> of buckled beams depends linearly {{on the amount of}} axial loading. Consequently, the <b>stiffness</b> of a variable <b>stiffness</b> actuator can be modulated (i) by decreasing the transverse <b>stiffness</b> through an increase of the axial compressive loading on a beam, up to values above the first critical buckling load where the overall <b>stiffness</b> of the actuator approaches its lowest negative value, and (ii) by increasing the transverse <b>stiffness</b> through application of tensile axial loading. Capitalizing on the concept of negative <b>stiffness,</b> the lowest <b>stiffness</b> of VnSA can be set arbitrarily close to zero or even to negative values (when counterbalanced), while very high <b>stiffness</b> values are also achievable by tensile loading of the beam. As a result, VnSA can modulate its <b>stiffness</b> over a uniquely large range that includes zero and negative <b>stiffness</b> values. Furthermore, thanks to the negative <b>stiffness</b> characteristics, the <b>stiffness</b> of VnSA can be kept very low without sacrificing the mechanical integrity and load bearing capacity of the actuator. We introduce the design of VnSA, theoretically analyze its <b>stiffness</b> modulation response, and provide implementation details of a prototype.

50|$|Generally speaking, {{deflections}} (or motions) of an infinitesimal element (which {{is viewed}} as a point) in an elastic body can occur along multiple DOF (maximum of six DOF at a point). For example, a point on a horizontal beam can undergo both a vertical displacement and a rotation relative to its undeformed axis. When there are M degrees of freedom a M x M matrix must be used to describe the stiffness at the point. The diagonal terms in the matrix are the direct-related <b>stiffnesses</b> (or simply <b>stiffnesses)</b> along the same degree of freedom and the off-diagonal terms are the coupling <b>stiffnesses</b> between two different degrees of freedom (either at the same or different points) or the same degree of freedom at two different points.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the enhanced <b>stiffness</b> modeling {{and analysis of}} robot manipulators, and a methodology for their <b>stiffness</b> identification and characterization. Assuming that the manipulator links are infinitely stiff, the enhanced <b>stiffness</b> model contains: 1) the passive and active <b>stiffness</b> of the joints and 2) the active <b>stiffness</b> created by {{the change in the}} manipulator configuration, and by external force vector acting upon the manipulator end point. The <b>stiffness</b> formulation not accounting for the latter is known as conventional <b>stiffness</b> formulation, which is obviously not complete and is valid only when: 1) the manipulator is in an unloaded quasistatic configuration and 2) the manipulator Jacobian matrix is constant throughout the workspace. The experimental system considered in this study is a Motoman SK 120 robot manipulator with a closed-chain mechanism. While the deflection of the manipulator end point under a range of external forces is provided by a high precision laser measurement system, a wrist force/torque sensor measures the external forces. Based on the experimental data and the enhanced <b>stiffness</b> model, the joint <b>stiffness</b> values are first identified. These <b>stiffness</b> values are then used to prove that conventional <b>stiffness</b> modeling is incomplete. Finally, they are employed to characterize <b>stiffness</b> properties of the robot manipulator. It has been found that although the component of the <b>stiffness</b> matrix differentiating the enhanced <b>stiffness</b> model from the conventional one is not always positive definite, the resulting <b>stiffness</b> matrix can still be positive definite. This follows that stability of the <b>stiffness</b> matrix is not influenced by this <b>stiffness</b> component.
