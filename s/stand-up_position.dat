50|$|She died on July 19, 2008 from {{pneumonia}} {{at the age}} of 101. She {{was buried}} in her birth town, in <b>stand-up</b> <b>position.</b> Her mausoleum, designed by herself in 1991, has the shape of a glass pyramid. The conception is similar to Louvre Pyramid.|$|E
50|$|Called clinch {{position}} or standing grappling position, {{these are the}} core of clinch fighting. From a separated <b>stand-up</b> <b>position,</b> a clinch {{is the result of}} one or both fighters applying a clinch hold. The process of attempting to advance into more dominant clinch positions is known as pummelling.|$|E
50|$|Over-under is a <b>stand-up</b> {{grappling}} <b>position</b> {{in which}} both combatants have one overhook and one underhook, and {{is the most common}} <b>stand-up</b> grappling <b>position</b> in mixed martial arts. The head is typically on the same side as the overhooked arm, to allow greater weight to be put on the opponent's underhooked arm, and hence preventing the opponent from using the underhooked arm effectively. The over-under position can be advanced into a pinch grip tie by locking the hands behind the opponent's back.|$|R
50|$|A collar-and-elbow hold is a <b>stand-up</b> {{grappling}} <b>position</b> {{where both}} combatants have a collar tie, {{and hold the}} opponent's other arm at the elbow. Generally the opening move in professional wrestling, the collar-and-elbow is generally a neutral position, but by pushing the hand on the elbow {{to the inside of}} the opponent's arms, and holding the biceps, more control can be obtained. From here it will be easier to strike or to attempt takedowns, while defending against the opponent's techniques.|$|R
50|$|In wrestling, a bear hug, {{also known}} as a bodylock, is a {{grappling}} clinch hold and <b>stand-up</b> grappling <b>position</b> where the arms are wrapped around the opponent, either around the opponent's chest, midsection, or thighs, sometimes with {{one or both of the}} opponent's arms pinned to the opponent's body. The hands are locked around the opponent and the opponent is held tightly to the chest. The bear hug is a dominant position, with great control over the opponent, and also allows an easy takedown to the back mount position.|$|R
5000|$|A {{striking}} combination (generally {{referred to}} as a combination or [...] "combo") is a combination of strikes performed in rapid succession, usually from a <b>stand-up</b> <b>position.</b> If the combination includes only punches, it is called a punching combination, and if it includes only kicks, it is called a kicking combination.|$|E
50|$|The wristlock is a {{technique}} {{that can be applied}} from a <b>stand-up</b> <b>position,</b> simply by grabbing the opponent's hand and twisting and/or bending it in a non-natural direction. It {{is considered to be a}} relatively safe technique to practice with a willing opponent, but if applied suddenly and/or forcefully, a wristlock can cause ligament tears or possibly even dislocation or bone fractures.|$|E
50|$|A stomp (also {{referred}} to as a stamp) is a downwards strike with the heel of the foot from the <b>stand-up</b> <b>position,</b> and is usually directed at the head or body of a downed opponent. A stomp similar to an axe kick is {{referred to}} as an axe stomp, while a particularly powerful jumping stomp with both heels is called a bronco kick, and a stomp from the clinch directed at the opponent's foot is called a foot stomp or a heel stomp.|$|E
50|$|A {{pinch grip}} tie, or an over-under bodylock, is a clinch hold and <b>stand-up</b> {{grappling}} <b>position</b> {{that is an}} extension of the over-under position, but having both hands locked behind the opponents back. The hands are typically locked with a palm-to-palm grip, palm-to-wrist grip or fingers-to-fingers grip. The pinch grip tie can be used to throw the opponent, but usually the grapplers attempt to obtain a better hold such as double underhooks or double collar tie. The pinch grip tie is often a neutral position when both grapplers symmetrically have the same hold on each other.|$|R
50|$|A {{shoulder}} strike (also {{referred to}} as a shoulder butt) is a strike with the anterior part of the shoulder. The shoulder strike can be used against the head of the opponent in close positions such as in a clinch or ground fighting, but is generally not considered to have knockout power. However, as used as a fulcrum for a joint hyperextention, such as an arm lock in classic jujitsu from <b>stand-up</b> or ground <b>positions,</b> can serve well to break said joint either when being the surface that an elbow is slammed upon or as a surface to balance out the break much as the thigh is for the juji-gatame in Judo.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: aerobic {{exercise}} {{has been identified}} as the main treatment for type 2 diabetic patients. Such an exercise, however, is usually repined by some of patients who suffer from lack of stamina. Therefore, whole body vibration has recently been introduced as a passive intervention. The present study aimed at comparing how {{aerobic exercise}} and whole body vibration affect glycaemia control in type 2 diabetic males. Methods: Thirty diabetic males were divided into three groups, namely aerobic exercise (AE), whole body vibration (WBV), and control. Aerobic exercise schedule consisted of three walking sessions a week, each for 30 - 60 minutes and in 60 - 70 % of maximum stock heartbeat. Vibration exercise was composed of 8 - 12 -min <b>stand-up</b> and semi-squat <b>positioning</b> in frequency of 30 Hz and amplitude of 2 mm.

5000|$|The supinating wristlock (in budō {{referred}} to as kote gaeshi, 小手返, [...] "forearm return") is a rotational wristlock, and arguably the most common wristlock. It involves rotating the hand so that it becomes maximally supinated, often {{referred to}} as 'externally rotating' the wrist, and hence putting a joint lock on the wrist and radioulnar joint. This can be done by grabbing the opponent's hand with one or both hands, and twisting the hand so that the opponent's thumb points away from the opponent. A supinating wristlock performed from a <b>stand-up</b> <b>position</b> can be used to force the opponent to the ground on his or her back. Straightening the arm does not alleviate the pressure, since the shoulder joint does not allow further supination of the hand.|$|E
50|$|Stand-up {{grappling}} {{is arguably}} {{an integral part}} of all grappling and clinch fighting arts, considering that two combatants generally start fighting from a <b>stand-up</b> <b>position.</b> The aim of stand-up grappling varies according to the martial arts or combat sports in question. Defensive stand-up grappling concerns itself with pain-compliance holds and escapes from possible grappling holds applied by an opponent, while offensive grappling techniques include submission holds, trapping, takedowns and throws, all of which can be used to inflict serious damage, or to move the fight to the ground. Stand-up grappling can also be used both offensively and defensively simultaneously with striking, either to trap an opponents arms while striking, prevent the opponent from obtaining sufficient distance to strike effectively, or to bring the opponent close to apply, for instance, knee strikes.|$|E
50|$|The {{straight}} knee (also {{known as}} a front knee) is a typical knee strike, and involves thrusting {{the front of the}} knee into the head or body of an opponent. The straight knee can be applied from a <b>stand-up</b> <b>position</b> both when the combatants are separated, or when they are clinching. A particularly effective clinching position for throwing front knee is the double collar tie, where the head of the opponent is controlled. On the ground, front knees can be effective from a few top positions such as the Side control and north-south position. Typical targets for the front knee include the head, hips, ribs, solar plexus, stomach and thighs. In Muay Thai, a double collar tie with a front knee to the face was traditionally called Hak Kor Aiyara. The groin is widely considered the key target for knee strikes and clinch knee attacks in a street fight according to karate, tae kwon do, muay thai, and many other martial arts.|$|E

Concentrations of fasting glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, and insulin were measured {{in the beginning of the}} trial, after the fourth week, and after the eighth week. Results:After 8 weeks of exercise, no significant difference was detected in concentrations of fasting glycosylated hemoglobin and insulin between the groups (P= 0. 8, P= 0. 1). There were no significant differences in any of the variables between AE and WBV (P> 0. 05). But a more significant decrease in fasting glucose was observed in exercise groups (AE and WBV) compared with control group (P= 0. 02). Conclusions:The present study showed that AE and WBV identically stimulate metabolic system. Thus, it can be concluded that type 2 diabetic patients lacking stamina for aerobic exercise can opt for vibration exercise as an effective substitute...|$|R
50|$|The flying armbar or tobi-jūji-gatame (飛び十字固め) is {{a version}} of the jūji-gatame that is {{performed}} from a <b>stand-up</b> <b>position.</b> Without a gi, it is typically applied when the opponent has a collar tie. By tightly holding the opponent's neck and arm, the practitioner places one of his shins against the opponent's midsection, and leans up on the opponent; at the same time, the attacker swings the leg on the same side as the opponent's collar tie over the opponent's head, into the typical jūji-gatame position. A slight modification of this maneuver can also be made. Instead of initiating the move by placing the shin against the opponent's midsection, the lower leg can be directed through the space between the arm and trunk of the opponent with the knee generally placed close to the opponent's armpit. The advantage of this modification is that the attacking practitioner's hips more closely engage with the defender's shoulders, making the forthcoming armbar submission easier to accomplish. However, the disadvantage of this modification is that the associated risk of injury is increased due to the attacker's increased height above the ground and near-vertical upside-down angle to the ground. (With a gi, it can be performed without needing to hold the neck.) If improperly performed, this technique can allow the opponent to escape, and gain an advantageous position. The flying armbar is considered {{to be one of the}} most visually spectacular joint locks, but it is uncommon because of the associated risk of falling into a poor position.|$|E
40|$|The rolling {{track is}} an {{effective}} modular robot configuration with high maneuverability. However, one technical barrier that prevents it from practical usage is that most existing rolling track robots must start from a typical <b>stand-up</b> <b>position</b> and they are also difficult to turn while rolling. This paper presents a solution for these problems. By extending our previous work, we have developed a set of new gaits for the rolling track to self-standup, roll and turn. The combination of these behaviors on a single SuperBot rolling track has enabled it to roll from any initial conditions, steer while rolling, and recover from falling sideways. These new gaits have been demonstrated with 6 modules in hardware and 8 and 10 modules in simulation. In addition, the new gaits can be activated even reconfiguring from a snake configuration. ...|$|E
40|$|Wood piles are {{commonly}} used to improve bearing capacity and to reduce settlements below embankments on soft soil. Indonesian that consists of lowland areas and around the coast, particularly in large river estuary, many found the soft clay soil and swamp as alluvial deposits or river delta. This area {{has a lot of}} dolken and gelam wood resources derived from mangrove forests. Dolken wood is a type of wood that is not easily weathered though submerged in water. This study uses a laboratory model to study the behavior of embankment using dolken wood pile. There were two methods of dolken wood pile installation: <b>stand-up</b> <b>position</b> and oblique position (slope 15 ???). The purpose of the installation were to analyze settlement behavior, horizontal deformation, vertical deformation, and the excess of the pore pressure on soft soil. Laboratory test results showed that the use of sloping dolken wood pile able to reduce a decline of up to 33. 2 %...|$|E
40|$|Young shoots of Poplar Ghoy {{have been}} {{inclined}} artificially during increasing periods to induce {{the formation of}} tension and opposite wood tissues as reaction to the gravitational stimulus. The shoots are able to react to an extremely short stimulus according to {{the scale of the}} normal growing season. After a presentation time of only 6 hours, the whole of the shoots present an opposite wood arc. However, on the upper face, it takes between 24 and 48 hours, for the shoots to feel the modification of their equilibrium state and start producing tension wood. After 48 hours of latent period, formation of gelatinous fibres can be observed on the upper face of the stem. The increase duration of the stimulus influences the quantity of gelatinous fibres and the arc angle of the tension wood. On the lower face, the opposite wood fibres are produced at a slower rate, causing a pith eccentricity. The shoots will return to the <b>stand-up</b> <b>position</b> after being submitted to a stimulus of approximately 4 to 8 days...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) simulation with straightline local planner [1]. I set up {{a simulation}} environment with 7 -links robot, obstacles (bombs), and a goal. First of all, I generated samples in free configuration space. Second, if one sample could be connected to its neighbor samples, store these two samples in a graph with a cost (L 2 -metric distance between two samples). Finally, the path, from start point to the goal, could be found by simple graph search algorithm. I. 7 -Links Robot Implementation Figure 1 shows that my 7 -links robot and its DH-parameters. The robot has 2 spherical joints, and I added up two Ghost-axis (z 2 and z 5) arbitrarily; {{because this is the}} only way, if we want to start 7 -links robot simulation from right <b>stand-up</b> <b>position</b> under DH convention. To clarify it, let’s remind the two constraints for DH-representation [2]: (DH 1) The axis x 1 is perpendicular to the axis z 0. (DH 2) The axis x 1 intersects the axis z 0. Link Actua...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructured multilayers {{constituted}} by alternate metallic (gold) and organic (alkyldithiol) layers, and grafted onto glass or silicon substrates are prepared and analysed. Such complex layers {{could be of}} interest as {{a new type of}} surfaces but also as localized dissipative zones particularly in the field of adhesion science. The formation and the structure of these model systems are examined using a number of techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), wetting analysis (contact angles), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and conductivity measurements. It is shown that, in terms of electrical conductivity, gold layers exhibit a percolation transition from an insulating granular structure to a conductive worm-like structure at a threshold thickness of about 5 nm. XPS (and wettability) analyses clearly indicate that the fractional coverage of the gold surface is about 30 % with alkyldithiol and that these molecules are either grafted in a <b>stand-up</b> <b>position</b> or {{in the form of a}} loop. Moreover, a partial electrical connection between two successive gold layers is observed, confirming that the confined organic layer of alkyldithiol between them is too loosely organized to play the role of an insulating barrier.
