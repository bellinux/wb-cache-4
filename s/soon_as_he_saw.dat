5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where {{he happened to be}} at that time. His soul then left his body {{in the form of a}} snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
25|$|Gatiss gave {{permission}} for the sketch {{to be included}} on the DVD only on condition that the lines be cut, saying that {{he knew it was}} a mistake as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it broadcast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't see plain {{owing to}} the things in the way, but <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I got outside and saw who it was I nearly dropped. It was the boy, and he was {{running up and down}} {{wringing}} his 'ands and crying like a wild thing, and, instead o' running away <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>'e</b> <b>saw</b> me, <b>he</b> rushed right up to me and threw 'is grubby little paws round my neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know yet; I haven't {{looked up}} the {{steamship}} companies' notices," [...] Foster answered, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had spoken <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> had made a mistake.|$|R
60|$|In {{the hall}} he found Demoiselle Candeille waiting for him. She, too, had evidently been desirous of leaving Blakeney Manor <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> {{her to her}} chaise; then escorted her as far as her lodgings, which were close by: there were still one or two things which he wished to discuss with her, one or two final {{instructions}} which he desired to give.|$|R
25|$|At 18:40, {{the head}} of the hospital's {{emergency}} department, Maria Teresa Fiandri made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17, which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped working. Watkins later said that as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Wisniewski was {{nineteen}} years old she was pitching for the Detroit Keller Girls, a team who gained attention {{during the early}} days of World War II, which earned her a solid prestige and consideration in national softball circles. Wisniewski possessed a blazing fastball thrown with a windmill-like underhand pitching motion and speeds in the 90 miles per hour range. Then, an advancing scout of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League grabbed her up as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her pitching. She was invited to a try out and later was allocated to the Milwaukee Chicks, an expansion team managed by former big leaguer Max Carey.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jimmy Savile scandal, Newsnight investigated the North Wales child abuse scandal. On 2 November 2012, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home was reported on Newsnight claiming that a prominent, but unnamed, former Conservative politician had sexually abused him during the 1970s. The rumour was spread by users of Twitter and other social media which identified the politician. After The Guardian reported a possible case of mistaken identity, Lord McAlpine issued a strong denial that he was in any way involved, asserting that the allegations were wholly false and seriously defamatory. The accuser unreservedly apologised, admitting that, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a photograph of the individual, he realised he had been mistaken. The BBC also apologised.|$|E
60|$|A Scotch nobleman {{sent for}} one of these second-sighted men out of the Highlands, to give his {{judgment}} of the then great George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him; Pish, said he, he will come to nothing, I see a dagger in his breast; and he was stabbed in the breast by Captain Felton, as has been at large recounted in some of the foregoing pages.|$|R
60|$|He was on deck again early. A gray mist {{overhung}} the water. The sea {{was of a}} leaden colour, crested {{with white}} heads. The waves were far higher {{than they had been}} on the previous evening, and as they came racing along behind the Bonito each crest seemed as if it would rise over her stern and overwhelm her. But this apprehension was <b>soon</b> dispelled, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> how lightly the vessel rose each time. Although showing but a very small breadth of sail, she was running along at a great rate, leaving a white streak of foam behind her. The captain was standing near the helm, and Francis made his way to him.|$|R
6000|$|For instance, {{one called}} Fronto, {{who belonged to}} the palace, and had a grievous disease (for he gnawed his own tongue, and tried to injure his eyes), came to the {{mountain}} and asked Antony to pray for him. And when he had prayed he said to Fronto, [...] "Depart, and be healed." [...] And when he resisted, and remained within some days, Antony continued saying, [...] "Thou canst not be healed if thou remainest here; go forth, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> thou enterest Egypt, thou shalt see the sign which shall befall thee." [...] He, believing, went forth; and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> only <b>saw</b> Egypt <b>he</b> was freed from his disease, and became sound according to the word of Antony, which he had learnt by prayer from the Saviour [...] .|$|R
25|$|However, on 12 December, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet {{ratified}} the Belevezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It was now {{apparent that the}} momentum towards dissolution could not be stopped. Shortly after the RSFSR {{ratified the}} Accords, Gorbachev hinted that he was considering stepping aside. On 17 December, he accepted the fait accompli and reluctantly agreed with Yeltsin to dissolve the Soviet Union. Four days later, the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics—all except Georgia (the Baltic states had already seceded in August)—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol which formally established the CIS. They also preemptively accepted Gorbachev's resignation. When Gorbachev learned what had transpired, he told CBS that he would resign as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that the CIS was indeed a reality.|$|E
500|$|Blaine {{is portrayed}} by actor Darren Criss, who had auditioned for Glee several times for several roles before the {{character}} Blaine was created. He originally auditioned to play Finn Hudson. Criss made several audition videos for Glee, {{of which he}} posted only one to the social networking website MySpace where he sang a cover of Bill Withers' song Lean on Me. Although the series writers have seen them, he considers them supplemental to his main audition, which was for series creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy had not seen any of Criss's previous auditions, but knew he was the right actor for Blaine as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> this one. The actor cut his long hair before auditioning, to suit the [...] "serious and preppy" [...] role.|$|E
2500|$|These {{events had}} {{important}} consequences. The Portuguese chroniclers unanimously stated what [...] Rui de Pina synthesized this way: [...] " ... king D. Ferdinand ... as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> defeated {{his first and}} big battles , and believing the same fate would happen to his own battles {{at the hands of}} King Afonso's battles, was counselled to withdraw as he did to Zamora".|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, one day, while Henry {{and herself}} were {{together}} in the king's cabinet engaged in transacting some public affairs, Margaret made some excuse for sending for Gloucester, and while Gloucester was in the cabinet, Somerset, according to a preconcerted arrangement, presented himself {{at the door with}} an air of excitement and alarm, and asked to be admitted. He wished to see the king on business of the utmost urgency. He was allowed to come in. He had a paper in his hand, and his countenance, as well as his air and manner, denoted great apprehension and anxiety. As <b>soon,</b> however, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the Duke of Gloucester, he seemed surprised and embarrassed, and was about to retire, saying he had supposed that the king and queen were alone.|$|R
60|$|Charlie went to {{the door}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> passed, and <b>saw</b> that, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> expected, he took the road to Westminster. Looking round, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Harry riding about a hundred yards behind. Charlie had no {{difficulty}} in keeping up with Nicholson, and traced him to a house in a quiet street lying behind the Abbey. A boy came out and held the horse, while its rider dismounted, and then led it away to the stable of an inn a short distance away. Charlie turned at once, and joined Harry.|$|R
60|$|As <b>soon,</b> therefore, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{that the}} perils of the coast of Ireland were passed, and that the vessel was likely to reach Spain in safety, he {{determined}} that he would on reaching a port disclose his real identity. There were on board several Scotch and Irish volunteers, {{and he decided to}} throw himself upon the pity of one of these rather than on that of the Spaniards. He did not think that in any case his life was in danger. Had he been detected when first picked up, or during {{the early part of the}} voyage, he would doubtless have been thrown overboard without mercy; but now that the passions of the combatants had subsided, and that he had been so long among them, and had, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> believed, won the goodwill of many by the assistance he had rendered to the sick and wounded, he thought that there was little fear of his life being taken in cold blood.|$|R
2500|$|The conductor, W. C. Powers, {{also gave}} a statement. [...] He said {{the car was}} not going very fast as it started across the bridge. [...] As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the red light, he opened the trolley's door and alerted the {{passengers}} to jump from the car. [...] The conductor then jumped himself, just before the car struck the wooden gate before the open draw. [...] He saw a number people jump off the car.|$|E
2500|$|The Ring {{slowly but}} inevitably {{corrupted}} its bearer, {{regardless of the}} bearer's initial intent. [...] For this reason the Wise, including Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, refused to wield it themselves, but determined instead {{that it should be}} destroyed. The corrupting power of the ring was apparently stronger on individuals more inclined to evil and selfishness: it took almost immediate hold of the greedy Sméagol as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it, and corrupted Boromir after a few months of near proximity, while its effects were only starting to be seen in the well-meaning Bilbo after his sixty [...] years' possession.|$|E
2500|$|Smalls {{applied the}} {{emergency}} brakes as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the vehicle. After the crash, {{he went back}} into the burning train several times to rescue passengers. [...] "He did everything he could," [...] said Anthony Bottalico, head of Association of Commuter Rail Employees, the labor union which represents Metro-North workers. Despite that, the train knocked Brody's SUV [...] up the tracks, which dislodged more than [...] of the third rail, breaking it into thirteen [...] segments, most of which accumulated in the front car's passenger compartment, and then into the second car. The New York Daily News reported that injuries from them were responsible for most of the deaths on the train.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if the {{presiding}} genius of evil was determined to patronize this young man; for before he had been long at college, and soon after he had, with the greatest difficulty, escaped from the nightcap scrape, an opportunity occurred by which he was enabled to gratify both his propensities at once, and not only to steal, but to steal sweetmeats. It happened that the principal of the college received some pots of Narbonne honey, which came under the eyes of Cartouche, and in which that young gentleman, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them, determined to put his fingers. The president of the college put aside his honey-pots in an apartment within his own; to which, except by the one door which led into the room which his reverence usually occupied, there was no outlet. There was no chimney in the room; and the windows looked into the court, where there was a porter at night, and where crowds passed by day. What was Cartouche to do?--have the honey he must.|$|R
60|$|Amabel replied by {{mentioning}} Philip. She deemed him {{a sort of}} trust, and {{had been}} reposing in the thought of making him a reason for lingering in the scene where the brightness of her life had departed from her. Mrs. Edmonstone would not allow that she ought to remain for his sake, and {{told her it was}} her duty to resolve to leave the place. She said, 'Yes, but for him;' and it ended in Mrs. Edmonstone going, without telling her, to inform him that she thought Amy ought to be at home <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible; but that it was difficult to prevail on her, because she thought him as yet not well enough to be left. He was, of course, shocked at being thus considered, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> next <b>saw</b> Amabel, told her, with great earnestness, that he could not bear to see her remaining there on his account; that he was almost well, and meant to leave Recoara very soon; the journey was very easy, the sea voyage would be the best thing for him, and he should be glad to get to the regimental doctor at Corfu.|$|R
60|$|All {{these matters}} weighed upon us much, so much, indeed, that I wished Jan to trek from the Transkei {{and found a}} new home; but he would not, for he loved the place which he had built up brick by brick, and planted tree by tree; nor would he consent to be driven out of it through fear of the wicked {{practices}} of Swart Piet. To one thing he did consent, however, {{and it was that}} Ralph and Suzanne should be married <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible, for <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that until they were man and wife there would be little peace for any of us. When they were spoken to on the matter, neither of them had anything to say against this plan; indeed, I believe that in their hearts, for the first and last time in their lives, they blessed the name of Black Piet, whose evil-doing, as they thought, was hurrying on their happiness.|$|R
2500|$|... "Cold Openings" [...] – The Cold Openings {{would appear}} at the {{beginning}} of each episode, and would officially introduce the guest star. During the first series, Kermit would introduce the guest star during the opening theme. His introduction would be followed by a clip of the guest star, usually surrounded by a group of Muppets. Beginning the second series, the Cold Openings would appear before the opening theme song. Scooter would visit the guest star in his/her dressing room, usually saying [...] "Fifteen seconds to curtain". This would then be followed by a brief joke. In the fifth series, the guest star would enter the Muppet Theater and would be greeted by Pops the Doorman. Pops would always say [...] "Who are you?" [...] as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the guest star. After the guest star introduced himself/herself to Pops, a joke would follow.|$|E
2500|$|Ramin Djawadi {{had been}} a fan of the {{character}} Iron Man as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes [...] "that actually don’t have any superpowers". After Iron Man director Jon Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film, Djawadi sought out the role himself. Filming on Iron Man had already been completed by the time Djawadi joined the production, and rather than wait until he could see the completed film, as he usually would, Djawadi began [...] "playing with ideas" [...] as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the first trailer. Due to time constraints and the final cut of the film changing until [...] "the last possible minute", Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions. Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 September 1931, Celtic {{were playing}} their Old Firm rivals Rangers at Ibrox Park in Glasgow {{in front of}} 80,000. Early {{in the second half}} Thomson and a Rangers player, Sam English, went for the ball at the same time. Thomson's head {{collided}} with English's knee, fracturing his skull and rupturing an artery in his right temple. Thomson was taken off the field in a stretcher; most people assumed that he was just badly concussed, but a few people who had seen his injuries suspected worse. One source said, [...] "There were gasps in the main stand, a single piercing scream being heard from a horrified young woman"; this was believed to be the scream of 19-year-old Margaret Finlay, who was watching with Jim Thomson (brother of John). One Rangers player, also a medical student, said later that as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him he gave little chance for his survival.|$|E
6000|$|She {{instantly}} rose, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> Goodwood <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> {{was seen}} he started forward. She had had time only to rise when, with a motion {{that looked like}} violence, but felt like--she knew not what, he grasped her by the wrist and made her sink again into the seat. She closed her eyes; he had not hurt her; {{it was only a}} touch, which she had obeyed. But there was something in his face that she wished not to see. That was the way he had looked at her the other day in the churchyard; only at present it was worse. He said nothing at first; she only felt him close to her--beside her on the bench and pressingly turned to her. It almost seemed to her that no one had ever been so close to her as that. All this, however, took but an instant, {{at the end of which}} she had disengaged her wrist, turning her eyes upon her visitant. [...] "You've frightened me," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|He {{was within}} fifteen feet of some dense bushes when {{of a sudden}} he came to a halt, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a pair of gleaming eyes glaring at him. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> noticed the eyes they disappeared.|$|R
60|$|When {{the shouts}} grew a little louder he walked round {{in front of}} the {{locomotive}} which stood still with the steam blowing noisily from a valve, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had done so <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the cause of the commotion. A pair of vicious, half-broken bronchos were backing a light waggon away from the locomotive {{on the other side of}} the track, and a fur-wrapped figure sat stiffly on the driving seat. Hawtrey called out and ran suddenly forward <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that it was Sally.|$|R
2500|$|The force left Ramdam at 2am on 12 February, {{with only}} 4,000 {{horsemen}} {{rather than the}} 8,000 he had expected to have, but French {{felt he had to}} push on rather than wait for straggling units to catch up (the brigades’ staffs were all new, and brigadiers only joined their units {{in the course of the}} march). De Kiel’s Drift on the Riet was seized by mid afternoon—French ordered his cavalry to gallop for it as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the way was clear—but the crossing was soon in what Haig called [...] "an indescribable state of confusion" [...] as Roberts had neglected to order priority for Cavalry Division baggage. Kitchener, arriving in the evening, ordered French to seize Waterval Drift, another crossing a few miles to the northwest where he had left a brigade masking a small Boer force under de Wet. Although this was done, the advance could not be resumed until 10.30am—with the sun high in the sky—on 13 February, and accompanied by five baggage wagons which had managed to get through the logjam at De Kiel’s Drift.|$|E
60|$|The syce {{brought out}} his horse, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Dick approaching.|$|E

60|$|I {{understood}} {{this to be}} a carte blanche to Sennit to carry off as many of my people <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit; there being nothing novel or surprising in men's tolerating in others, acts they would disdain to perform in person. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> left his junior in rank, the youthful first-lieutenant approached me. I call him youthful, for he appeared even younger than he was, though I myself had commanded a ship when only of his own age. It was easy to see that this young man felt he was employed on an affair of some importance.|$|R
