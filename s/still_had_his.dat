5|$|Following {{a failed}} bid {{to win the}} 2001 Alberta championship, the team then boycotted the Brier, as {{prominent}} curling teams of the day wanted {{to focus more on}} the World Curling Tour, while the Canadian Curling Association scheduled events conflicting with major WCT events. In the meantime, however, Martin <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> sights set on an Olympic championship. The team went to the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials and finished first after the round robin with a 7–2 win-loss record. That gave the team a bye to the finals, which Martin won by defeating Kerry Burtnyk with a score of 8–7.|$|E
5|$|Since Smyth <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, {{he could}} only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Reid is {{generally}} {{believed to have}} <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> revolver tucked away and that Smith <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> Winchester shouldered, but {{about what happened in}} the few seconds before gunfire erupted, accounts differ greatly. Some claim Reid drew his weapon first, while others claim Reid did not draw until Smith attempted to shoot him.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{since the}} game uses {{many of the}} {{graphical}} assets seen in 2004's Fight for NY, it does not reflect physical changes seen {{in some of the}} celebrities featured in the game. For example, Busta Rhymes, in the role of Magic, <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>his</b> dreadlock hairstyle, which he cut in late 2005. Also, Ludacris <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>his</b> cornrow hairstyle, which he would cut in the summer of 2006.|$|R

25|$|In 1982, Benihana National Corporation {{went public}} with Joel Schwartz as president. Some of the {{restaurants}} continued to be privately owned by Aoki. The company had some missteps including {{the opening of the}} upscale Big Splash restaurant and a frozen foods division Benihana National Classics. Its stock dived and shareholders sued over management including the fact that Aoki <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> privately held restaurants of the same name.|$|E
25|$|Bronstein, in {{his final}} book, {{published}} just {{after his death in}} late 2006, wrote that the Soviet chess leadership favoured Smyslov to win Zurich 1953, and pressured several of the other top Soviets to arrange this outcome, which did in fact occur. Bronstein wrote that Keres was ordered to draw his second cycle game with Smyslov, to conserve Smyslov's fading physical strength; Keres, who <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> own hopes of winning the event, tried as White to win an attacking game, but instead lost because of Smyslov's excellent play.|$|E

25|$|Minos {{was also}} part of the King Nisus story. Nisus was King of Megara, and he was invincible as long as a lock of crimson hair still existed, hidden in his white hair. Minos {{attacked}} Megara but Nisus knew he could not be beaten because he <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> lock of crimson hair. His daughter, Scylla, fell in love with Minos and proved it by cutting the crimson hair off her father's head. Nisus died and Megara fell to Crete. Minos spurned Scylla for disobeying her father. She was changed into a shearer bird, relentlessly pursued by her father, who was a falcon.|$|E
25|$|In the Maxi Trial of 1986/1987, Leggio faced {{charges of}} helping {{to run the}} Corleonesi from behind bars, {{including}} the accusation that he ordered the murder of prosecutor Cesare Terranova, who was shot dead on 25 September 1979 along with his police bodyguard Lenin Mancuso. He acted as his own lawyer and defended himself, cross examining Tommaso Buscetta and other pentiti. He claimed he had been framed for political reasons. He was eventually acquitted of all charges {{due to lack of}} evidence, although he <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> life-sentence to serve and was returned to the Badu 'e Carros maximum security prison in Nuoro, Sardinia, where he indulged in his hobby of painting, in particular landscapes.|$|E
25|$|Boring's self-criticism, fear of failure, {{and need}} for peer-acceptance became unmanageable and {{affected}} the productivity of his work. In 1933, {{at the suggestion of}} his friends and family, Boring began psychoanalysis treatment with a former colleague of Freud, Hanns Sachs. Boring remained in psychoanalysis for a year, five sessions a week, but he found it to be ineffective in alleviating his concerns. Boring had hoped to achieve a change in personality {{by the end of the}} experience and was disappointed to find that he <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> old mindset. Four years later, both Sachs and Boring wrote about the experience in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. The two men agreed that the psychoanalysis was not successful.|$|E

25|$|Cowdrey {{was made}} vice-captain for an Australian tour {{for the fourth}} time and Illingworth's tough no-nonsense {{approach}} to the game clashed with the MCC tour manager David Clark, who had been captain of Kent in Cowdrey's youth and had given him his county cap. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour {{with the support of the}} players and Clark's influence declined, as did that of Cowdrey, who as his only ally he became isolated, though he <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> Kent team-mates Derek Underwood, Alan Knott and Brian Luckhurst. The players tended to avoid the press and public, even to the point of having their meals in their hotel rooms, and only Cowdrey made an effort to meet and greet the cricket fans. The rotund Cowdrey was in the sunset of his career and failed on tour, making only one century – 101 against Victoria – which was so slow that he was likened to a beached whale.|$|E
25|$|Having played nearly up to {{full speed}} {{in the preseason}} games, {{it was decided that}} McNabb would return to the field several months short of the full year-long {{recovery}} expected of an ACL injury. In the season-opener at Green Bay, the Eagles and McNabb suffered a 16-13 loss. McNabb had his share of problems, completing less than half of his passes for 184 yards and one touchdown. The Eagles lost their first home game of the season to the rival Washington Redskins, 20-12, though his numbers improved. As week 3 approached, skeptics had already wondered whether McNabb <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> skill that propelled him to success in the past. The Eagles defeated the Detroit Lions in a 56-21 win in week 3. McNabb completed 21 out of his 26 attempted passes for 381 yards. Four of those passes went for touchdowns (three of them went to Kevin Curtis). His brilliant performance against the Lions was highlighted by his first perfect (158.3) quarterback rating game. However, week 4 did not prove {{to be as good as}} the Eagles thought it would be. The Eagles endured yet another loss, this time to the New York Giants. The Giants' defense, led by defensive end Osi Umenyiora, sacked McNabb a record-tying 12 times. McNabb completed 15 out of 31 attempted passes for 138 yards and no touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the last}} match before the First Test on the same ground and was played in {{stifling}} heat and humidity. Peter May captained again to give Hutton a rest. Ron Archer, captain of Queensland (the brother of the Australian all-rounder Ken Archer) won the toss and put the MCC in to bat on a good wicket. Reg Simpson opened with 136, but again only two batsman did anything as Denis Compton added 110 runs and everybody else 56. The tourists were 18/3 before the 234 run Simpson-Compton partnership and collapsed from 252/4 to 304 all out thereafter. Ray Lindwall took 4/66, but had to retire because of gastric trouble. Strangely every batsman in the Queensland team except the absent Lindwall got into double figures, {{but none of them}} made fifty and they were out for 288. Mick Harvey made 49 and thrashed a ball into Jim McConnon's groin, a painful injury that put the unlucky spinner out of contention for weeks. Alex Bedser <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> unexplained rash, but bowled 31 eight ball overs for 2/56 and Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey both took 3/74. The MCC made 288 as well in their second innings despite being 8/2 when the makeshift opener Colin Cowdrey and wicket-keeper Keith Andrew batting at number 3 were out for ducks. Simpson made 38, but it was May (77), Compton (69) and Bailey (51 not out) who made the runs as no bowler took more than 2 wickets. There was no time to consider a run chase, but Simpson surprised everybody when his off-spinners took 2/5 to leave Queensland on 25/2.|$|E

500|$|In his 1947 book From Caligari to Hitler, Siegfried Kracauer argued, {{based largely}} on an {{unpublished}} typescript written and provided by Janowitz, that the film originally included no frame story at all and only the main story, starting with the fair coming to town and ending with Dr. Caligari becoming institutionalized. Kracauer argued the frame story glorified authority and was added to turn a [...] "revolutionary" [...] film into a [...] "conformistic" [...] one. (See the Themes section for more.) No surviving copies of the script were believed to exist to confirm this fact, until the early 1950s when actor Werner Krauss revealed he <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> copy. Krauss refused to part with it, {{and it was not}} until 1978, after his death, that it was purchased by the German film archive Deutsche Kinemathek. It remained unavailable for public consumption until 1995, when a full transcript was published.|$|E
500|$|In 1956 Holloway {{created the}} role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the {{original}} [...] Broadway production of My Fair Lady. The librettist, Alan Jay Lerner, remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridge's: Lerner recalled, [...] "He put down his knife and fork, {{threw back his head}} and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted." [...] Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, the 1958 London version at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the film version in 1964, which he undertook instead of {{the role of}} Admiral Bloom in Mary Poppins that he had been offered the same year. [...] In The Manchester Guardian, Alistair Cooke wrote, [...] "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England." [...] Also in 1964, he appeared as Bellomy in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of The Fantasticks.|$|E
500|$|The {{scale of}} the project was enormous: By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their {{original}} home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps. This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, would clearly be too much to fit into the proposed 6 volumes. Gygax decided he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973 by amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes. However, neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans. Because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot, they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps. These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure their independent work would dovetail. All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year-old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece. Recreating the city too would be a challenge. [...] Although Gygax <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of the city from scratch while still maintaining the [...] "look and feel" [...] of his original.|$|E

2500|$|VMI's {{publishing}} business never {{scored a}} major hit, and Porter was frustrated {{by what he}} saw as bad business decisions forced on him by the partnership. In January 1973, he resigned. On October 14, a [...] "mysterious fire" [...] burned out United Recording of Nevada, including all VMI's papers, stored master tapes and cases of pressed records, and Porter lost all of the recording equipment stored inside, a total he estimated at $250,000—about $ in today's dollars. He <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> outside electronics company and he concentrated on that.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1983, one of Symington's {{projects}} {{as a real}} estate developer, with The Symington Company, was {{the construction of the}} Esplanade on 24th Street and Camelback Road, an up-scale office complex that had been built on a former Christmas tree lot. Symington believed it to be the [...] "best location in town for business," [...] and as of 2007, <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> own office on the fourth floor of the building. The financing of the project would later play a part in an investigation in his involvement with Southwest Savings and Loan, which provided the funds with Symington on its board of directors. Symington has stated that the approval of the construction of the Esplanade was significant because nothing over four stories had ever been granted along Camelback Road. The Esplanade took two decades to finish construction, with construction beginning in 1983, and completing in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was soon}} {{followed}} by a leap from the Chestnut Street Bridge (88 feet) in Philadelphia into the Schuylkill River. He achieved this latter feat at 7 AM on February 18, 1887, inviting a [...] "score of reporters and prominent sporting men" [...] to witness the leap, made wearing shoes with lead-lined soles. He was [...] "badly winded, and a little stream of blood gushed from his mouth", but was otherwise uninjured. He was, however, arrested and spent three months at [...] "The Tombs" [...] jail. He had been intending to attempt to set a record of 500 miles in a [...] "walking match" [...] later in the month, and apparently <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> sights on the Genesee Falls. Soon after, he declared his intention to jump from the Niagara Horseshoe Falls on May 8, and to swim the Niagara Falls Rapids. Nothing seems to have come of these plans. In March, he was appointed lieutenant in the volunteer life saving corps.|$|E
