5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} requires <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> completed 12 {{general education}} requirements {{in order to}} graduate, with some exceptions depending on the school. These include courses in aesthetics, global inter-dependencies, humanities, laboratory science, composition and oral communication, mathematics, physical activity and wellness, social science and U.S. pluralism. Individual schools within the University have additional requirements. Students in Harpur College must complete a minimum of 126 credits to graduate. Most classes at Binghamton are worth four credits, rather than the more usual three. The typical undergraduate's course load thus consists of four courses (for 16 credits) rather than the usual five (for 15 credits).|$|E
25|$|According to the Flexner Report, Hopkins {{has served}} as the model for American medical education. It was the first medical school to require its <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an {{undergraduate}} degree and was also the first graduate-level medical school to admit women on an equal basis as men. Mary Elizabeth Garrett, head of the Women's Medical School Fund, was a driving force behind both of these firsts. Sir William Osler became the first Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins and the first Physician-in-Chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Osler was responsible for establishing the residency system of postgraduate medical training, where young physicians were required to reside within the hospital to better care for their patients.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} years, the University had among its faculty {{a number of}} noted writers, such as Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, John Crowe Ransom, Hiram Haydn, Peter Taylor, Robie Macauley and Randall Jarrell. They invited other {{distinguished}} writers to campus to read from their work and to meet with students; these writers included Robert Lowell, Robert Frost, Flannery O'Connor, Robert Penn Warren, Eudora Welty, and Saul Bellow. In 1965, {{under the leadership of}} Robert Watson, creative writing offerings were formalized. Since that time, enrollment has grown, but the faculty has intentionally kept the program small, enabling <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> individual conferences with faculty. Notable faculty members have included Fred Chappell, H.T. Kirby-Smith, Michael Parker, Craig Nova, Stuart Dischell, Jennifer Grotz and David Roderick. Notable graduates include Claudia Emerson, Steve Almond, Keith Lee Morris, Lee Hadaway and Rodney Jones.|$|E
50|$|In Secondary 1 <b>to</b> 2, <b>students</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take 14 classes, and for {{secondary}} 3 <b>students,</b> they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take 18 classes. In Secondary 4 <b>to</b> 6, <b>students</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take 4 core subjects (English, Chinese, Mathematics and Liberal Studies) and 3 other subjects as elective {{subjects in the}} New Senior Secondary (NSS) 334 Scheme curriculum.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>student</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> study {{four core}} {{subjects}} and two/ three elective subjects. <b>Students</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{take part in}} different Other Learning Experiences (OLE) as well.|$|R
25|$|There {{are certain}} {{requirements}} {{as to how}} many subjects each <b>student</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> take and at how high levels. For instance, all <b>students</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take at least four subjects at level A (there are two compulsory subjects at this the highest level: Danish and History), and all <b>students</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take a natural science subject at level B.|$|R
25|$|In 1934, bachelor's degrees were {{required}} for admission and Yale Corporation authorized the Master of Nursing degree. This program, allowing students with no prior background in nursing graduate entry, would continue until 1956 when the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program began. The MSN required <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a prior background in nursing {{in order to}} gain entry into the program. The Nurse Practitioner track within the MSN degree was established in 1971 with the offering of the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner specialty. This was expanded in 1972, when the Family Nurse Practitioner specialty began. By 1975 YSN offered 10 specialty programs and tracks, and was at the vanguard of the education of nurse practitioners at the graduate level along with clinical nurse specialists and nurse-midwives. In 1974, YSN reopened admission for students with no prior background in nursing through its Three-Year Program for Non-Nurse College Graduates (later called the GEPN program).|$|E
25|$|This {{reform was}} {{elaborated}} {{in order to}} attain an education system based {{on the development of}} competences rather than on the transmission of knowledge, and included the development of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees aimed to simplify comparison between qualifications across Europe. The flexibility and transparency enabled <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their qualifications recognised more widely, facilitating freedom of movement around a more transparent EHEA (European Higher Education Area). This was aided by the establishment of a system of credits {{in the form of the}} European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the adoption of the Diploma Supplement by all countries involved. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS-credits that are equivalent to 1500–1800 hours of study. The new model comes closer to the North American and Japanese systems. It gives greater weight to practical training, intensive research projects and the way credits are measured reflects how hard a student has worked. The new evaluation methods reflect not only a student's performance on exams, but also his or her lab experiments, presentations, hours spent on study, innovation capacities and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Many {{programs}} {{base their}} admission decisions {{on a combination}} of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work, and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole. The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MBA programs. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MBA programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have. Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission. In order to achieve a diverse class, business schools also consider the target male-female ratio and local-international student ratios. In rare cases, some MBA degrees do not require <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an undergraduate degree and will accept significant management experience in lieu of an undergraduate degree. In the UK, for example an HND or even HNC is acceptable in some programs.|$|E
