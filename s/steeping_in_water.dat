6000|$|Dried Meat.--When more game is shot {{than can}} be eaten before the party travel onwards, it is usual to jerk a part of it. It is cut in long strips, and festooned about the bushes, under the full sun, in order to dry it. After it has been sun-dried it will keep for long, before it becomes wholly putrid. Dried meat is a poor {{substitute}} for fresh meat; it requires long <b>steeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> to make it tender, and then it is tasteless, and comparatively innutritious. [...] "Four expert men slice up a full-grown buffalo in four hours and a-half." [...] (Leichhardt.) The American buccaneers acquired their name from boucan--which means jerked meat, in an Indian dialect; for they provisioned their ships with the dried flesh of the wild cattle that they hunted down and killed.|$|E
60|$|The {{cause of}} all which Phænomena, {{seems to be the}} differing texture of the parts of these bodies, each of them (especially the Beard of a wilde Oat, and of Mosk-grass seed) seeming to have two kind of substances, one that is very porous, loose, and spongie, into which the watry steams of the Air may be very easily forced, which will be thereby swell'd and {{extended}} in its dimensions, just as we may observe all kind of Vegetable substance upon <b>steeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> to swell and grow bigger and longer. And a second that is more hard and close, into which the water can very little, or not at all penetrate, this therefore retaining always very neer the same dimensions, and the other stretching and shrinking, according as there is more or less moisture or water in its pores, by reason of the make and shape of the parts, the whole body must necessarily unwreath and wreath it self.|$|E
60|$|In which Experiment, {{there are}} three Observables that seem very manifestly to prove the porousness of these {{seemingly}} close bodies: the first is their acquiring a transparency, and losing their whiteness after <b>steeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> which will seem the more strongly to argue it, if what I have already said about the making transparent, or clarifying of some bodies, as the white powder of beaten Glass, and the froth of some glutinous transparent liquor be well consider'd; for thereby it will seem rational {{to think that this}} transparency arises from the insinuation of the water (which has much the same refraction with such stony particles, as may be discover'd by Sand view'd with a Microscope) into those pores which were formerly repleat with air (that has a very differing refraction, and consequently is very reflective) which seems to be confirm'd by the second Observable, namely, the increase of weight after keeping, and decrease upon drying. And thirdly, seem'd yet more sensibly confirm'd by the multitude of bubbles in the last Experiment.|$|E

Some seaweeds--the only English one of which I have heard is the common olive-green weed called Chorda Filum; it looks like a whip-thong, and sometimes grows to a length of thirty or forty feet; when half-dried, the skin is taken off and twisted into fishing-lines, etc. Hay-bands; horsehair ropes, or even a few twisted hairs from the tail of a horse; the stems of numerous plants afford fibres that are more or less effective {{substitutes for}} hemp, those that are used by the natives of the country visited should be notices; [...] "Indian grass" [...] is an animal substance attached to the ovaries of small sharks and some other fish of the same class.|$|E

In addition, in order to analyze the effect of water quality purification after the planting, the samples were collected from each designated zone 1, 7 and 30 days after <b>steeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> Then, the samples were analyzed in terms of seven test items such as SS, BOD, COD, T-N, T-P, pH, etc. {{on the basis of the}} test method for water pollution.

As a result of analysis for water quality purification for the concrete block containing the effective microorganism, it was found that the values for SS, BOD, T-N and T-P for the sample taken after 30 days were lower than the initial values, which indicated that the water purification effect had been created.

40|$|Pearl millet is {{a staple}} food in Namibia. It is milled into flour by {{traditional}} and industrial dry milling processes. This {{research was conducted}} to help determine how to improve the nutritional value and acceptability of pearl millet. The traditional milling process involves a lactic acid fermentation step which lowers the pH of kernels. The effects of the traditional Namibian and industrial “dry milling” processes on the physical and nutritional composition of pearl millet grain were compared. Additionally, the effect of steeping three different Namibian pearl millet varieties (Kangara, Kantana and Okashana 2) in lactic acid and water on the colour and the phenolic content of the flour were determined. Regarding comparing the milling processes, variety Kangara was conditioned and decorticated traditionally with a pestle and mortar and industrially with an abrasive decorticator. The traditional decorticated grain was steeped and sun dried for 24 h before hammer milling, whereas the industrially decorticated grain was roller milled. Tristimulus colorimetry and proximate analyses were conducted on the samples. Concerning acid steeping, kernels were steeped in a pH 3. 5 solution and in water as a control. Colour, total polyphenol and c-glycosyl flavone contents were determined. The determination of cglycosylflavone content was particularly important because these compounds are considered goitrogenic. The traditionally milled flour was lighter in colour than industrial milled flour. However, it was significantly lower in protein, ash and c-glycosyl flavone contents in comparison to industrial milled flour. This {{was due to the}} removal of more pericarp and germ in the traditional process. The industrial dry milling process therefore produces flour with a higher nutrient content in terms of protein, fat and minerals. However, the traditional Namibian milling process makes the colour of the pearl millet flour lighter, which is probably the reason that it is more acceptable to consumers. Kernels steeped in a lactic acid solution were lighter in colour than those steeped in water. Irrespective of the steeping media, the total polyphenol content was significantly lower in steeped kernels compared to those unsteeped. A similar trend was observed for the cglycosyl flavone content. This indicates that some of these compounds may have leached out during steeping. For all varieties, kernels steeped in lactic acid had a significantly higher total polyphenol content than those in water, probably due to the dissociation of metal-polyphenol complexes in the acidic medium whereby these polyphenols became free and available for measurement. Thus, steeping in a lactic acid solution can lead to better colour improvement of kernels compared to <b>steeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> Thus, lactic acid steeping can improve the sensory quality of pearl millet products. An industrial process can thus be designed to include tempering the grain with food grade lactic acid to produce sour taste and leach out the colour pigments, particularly the cglycosyl flavones hence lightening the colour of the industrial milled flour. This produces a product with high nutritional content, lighter in colour and has the sour taste that consumers find appealing. Copyright 2007, University of Pretoria. All rights reserved.
