A model of horizontal pressure vessel and <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> is created in ANSYS. Stresses are calculated using mathematical approach and ANSYS software. The analysis reveals the zone of high localized stress at the junction part of the pressure vessel and <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> due to operating conditions.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} patients to manifest vasovagal reactions after orthotopic heart transplantation. Background. Paradoxic stimulation of left ventricular baroreceptors may be the afferent limb of the vasovagal reflex in humans. Orthotopic heart transplantation causes surgical denervation of these receptors and would therefore be expected to abolish the vasovagal reflex. Methods. To attempt to confirm this hypothesis, 10 patients with orthotopic heart transplantation underwent both head-up tilt testing while resting on a <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> and testing for parasympathetic innervation of the donor heart before and after atropine infusion. Native and donor heart sinus rates were monitored by using an esophageal pill electrode throughout tilting and during parasympathetic testing. Results. Unexpectedly, seven patients had vasovagal responses at <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> tilt testing, during which native heart rate decreased by 25 ± 7 beats/min and mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 55 ± 9 mm Hg. In three of these patients, {{there was also a}} decrease in donor heart rate of 23 ± 26 beats/min. Parasympathetic testing showed possible evidence of donor heart vagal reinnervation in these patients with donor heart bradycardia during tilt but not in those with vasovagal reactions to tilt without slowing of the donor heart rate. Conclusions. Vagal efferent reinnervation can occur after orthotopic heart transplantation in humans. However, the absence of sach reinnervation in some patients with vasovagal responses to tilt calls into question the role of left ventricular receptors in inducing the vasovagal reaction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProlonged 60 ° head-up tilf {{has been}} shown to be {{valuable}} in the investigation of unexplained syncope, diagnosing neurally mediated bradycardia/hypotension or malignant vasovagal syndrome. To evaluate the methodology of tilt testing, the following were examined: reproducibility of results, tilt duration, angle of tilt, method of tilt support and effect of age in patients and control subjects. Seventy-one patients with recurrent unexplained syncope underwent 60 min of 60 ° tilt; 53 (75 %) had an abnormal test with vasovagal syncope at 24 ± 10 min (mean ± SD). Tilting to 60 ° resulted in an abnormal test in only 2 (7 %) of 27 control subjects without cardiovascular symptoms (p < 0. 001); and 5 (15 %) of 34 patients with syncope and documented conduction tissue disease (p < 0. 001). of 15 youthful fainters, 3 (20 %) had vasovagal reactions as did 1 (8 %) of 12 asymptomatic youthful control subjects. These 12 control subjects also underwent tilting with a <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> and 7 (67 %) had vasovagal reactions. It is concluded that uk duration of lilting at 60 ° should be 45 min (mean time to syncope + 2 x SD in the 53 patients with abnormal results). Twenty percent of patients with an abnormal tilt test may not demonstrate syncope with repeat tilting. Saddle tilt testing in unexplained syncope may result in a loss of specificity. Tilting at < 60 ° results in a loss of sensitivity. Head-up tilt may be less useful in youthful subjects with vasovagal syncope than in other subjects...|$|E

40|$|The static {{behavior}} of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells {{is the subject}} of numerous research works since long time. For the dynamic load of these tanks only few theoretical and no experimental examinations are known to this day. In the present work a contribution to the calculation of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells under vertical dynamic load is performed. In this connection, special attention is directed upon the simple manipulation for practical purposes. For the numeric calculation a model is generated on basis of the finite-element-method (FEM) with 4 -node shell elements after the discreet Kirchhoff'schen theory for the simulation of the vertical oscillation of lying liquid tanks. The contact between saddle and cylindrical shell is simulated by framework beams to which for pressure a linear-elastic material behavior is assigned, while with strains the Young's-module is set to zero. Through here the local take off of the cylindrical shell of the saddle can be simulated. An additional simplification of the model is the calculation of the liquid pressure from the toe acceleration of the oscillating tank. To confirm the FEM model experimental examinations of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells are executed in the present work for the first time. To measure the pressure between saddle and cylinder shells the Tekscan measurement system is used. Although the measuring system is used in different areas at research and production, no systematic examination of the measuring system is known to this day. Therefore, the functional principle of the measurement system is described in detail and the mistake influences and measuring accuracies are analyzed systematically {{for the first time in}} the present work. In this connection, the measuring accuracy is examined for different calibration loads and areas, different surface materials, temperature changes, dynamic load of different frequency, shear effects of folios and the temporal drift and indicated quantitatively. For the experimental examinations of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells a experimental plant is developed in the present work, so the vertical dynamic oscillation of the vessel is possible. In the main attempts of this work the filling degree, the saddle position, the saddle angle, the elasticity of an interposition between saddle and cylinder shell and the exciter frequency are varied. The displacement and strain condition of the vessel was measured at 60 measuring points, the support pressure distribution was measured with the Tekscan measurement system. With the FEM model the experimental results are checked and extended, as well as other shell and saddle parameters, as for example the shell length, the shell radius, the shell thickness etc. are examine. To represent the dependence of the numeric results of the different shell and saddle parameters, only one parameter is varied in every calculation series and the others are held. The numeric results are standardized on the parameter shell radius. A dynamic factor is developed in the present work which can be determined as a product from three partials dynamic factors diagrammatically.

40|$|Saddle {{supported}} cylindrical {{vessels are}} often used to store or transport liquids or gaseous materials. The <b>saddle</b> <b>support,</b> especially rigid supports, lead to a concentrated loading at the saddle horn and this makes it necessary to determine the bending stresses in this area. The calculation of the internal forces can be based on precise shell theories, on approached theories by idealising the shell as a beam or by using the finite element method. A precise theoretical method based on the complete or simplified shell theory by Flügge is impracticable because {{the solution of the}} differential equations needs high calculation expenditure and in combination with flexible saddle supports additional theories are necessary. The semi-bending theory by Wlassow, which neglects the effect of moments in longitudinal direction and drilling moments is easier to handle {{but in the case of}} very thin vessels or a great distance between the <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> and the vessel bottom inexactitudes have been determined. For rigid saddles in practice the design method developed by Zick in 1951 is used. The calculation of the internal forces is based on a circular curved beam which has a clamped support at the height of the saddle horn. The curved beam is charged by tangential orientated forces and the distribution of these forces is obtained by the bending theory of beams with a tube cross section. The resulting stress distribution is then calculated by considering an effective shell width dependant on the vessel diameter and length. The effective shell width is based on experiments but in comparison with later accomplished tests and calculations inexactitudes concerning short vessels and vessels with a great distance between support and bottom have been determined. Independant of the determined inaccuracies the design method of Zick is still used because it is very easy to handle and no alternative methods exist which are more precise but still easy to practice. The aim of this thesis is the development of a new design method in which the structural behaviour of a cylindrical shell is taken into account by employing a shell theory. Additional the new method should be able to consider different forms of saddles, the influence of ring stiffeners and the solution should be as simple as possible so that this method can be an alternative to the method of Zick. To realise this the new developed method is based on the principal procedure of the method of Zick by calculating the internal forces in a curved beam. Different saddle forms are represented by an elastic foundation along the curved beam in the region of the saddle angle. To avoid the inexactitudes in the method of Zick the loading of the beam is obtained from a separated calculation which is based on the shell theory in the generalised bending theory developed by Schardt. A comparison with other shell theories shows that the results obtained by the generalised bending theory are precise enough concerning the present conditions and the solution is reduced on a differential equation of fourth degree which can be solved in analogy to known problems in the classic theory of beams. Main problem is to guarantee the kinematic compatibility of the deformed shell and the saddle. This is solved indirectly by taking a saddle pressure distribution into account which has to be verified and improved by the calculation with the curved and elastic based beam. In general case this leads to an iterative procedure. For the case of a vessel on a rigid saddle it is shown by comparative calculations with results according to the FE method that the new method determines the structural behaviour realistically. It is also shown that by using known pressure distributions no iteration is necessary and the computation expenditure is minimised. In this form it is suitable for a practical application. With the presentation of the proceeding and the results for the case of vessels on a thin elastomer layer a possible extension of the new method is shown. The case of a thin layer requires an idealisation of non linear behaviour of elastomers. From investigations done by the FE-method a proposal results, how the non linear behaviour can be idealised by a linear elastic foundation. Determined formulas for the expected saddle pressure distribution, can be used, in order to reduce the computation expenditure as in the rigid case. On basis of a parameter study for this case, which was so far not yet the subject of an investigation, a simple design formula was developed. Finally it is shown, how by simple modifications the influence of stiffening rings can be considered. Thus a method is presented, with which different execution forms of saddle supported vessels can be designed without great mathematical difficulties and considering a realistic structural behaviour...|$|E
