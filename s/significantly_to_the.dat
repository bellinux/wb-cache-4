5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} dogfish is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac. There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The black dogfish contributes <b>significantly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|E

5|$|Andrei Kolmogorov {{developed}} in a 1931 paper {{a large part of}} the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmgorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed <b>significantly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> study was <b>to</b> {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> {{construct validity of}} the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI) as a screening test for alcoholism. The study sample consisted of 238 participants. These included 50 alcoholics, 50 normals, 50 psychiatric outpatients, 50 co-dependent family members and 38 drug addicts, so classified by clinician diagnosis. All participants were administered the SASSI and also the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and the MacAndrew Alcoholism-Screening Scale (AMAC). Correct classification rates for all three tests were determined using both a five-group criterion of classifying as an alcoholic, normal, psychiatric outpatient, co-dependent or drug addict, and a simpler two-group criterion of classifying as a substance abuser or non-abuser. Five null hypotheses were tested using Chi-square (alpha =. 01) tests for equal proportions of classification accuracy. A sixth null hypothesis was tested using linear discriminant function analyses. Results Five-group criterion: 1. The three tests differed in correctly classifying alcoholics, with the MAST statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AMAC and the SASSI. 2. The three tests differed in correctly classifying normals, with the MAST and the AMAC statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SASSI. 3. The three tests differed in correctly classifying psychiatric outpatients, with the AMAC statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SASSI. 4. The three tests differed in correctly classifying drug addicts, with the AMAC and the SASSI statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MAST. 5. The three tests did not differ to a statistically significant degree in classifying codependents. Two-group criterion (abuser/non-abuser) : 1. The three tests differed in correctly classifying alcoholics, with the MAST statitically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AMAC and the SASSI. 2. The three tests differed in correctly classifying normals, with the SASSI statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AMAC and the MAST. 3. The three tests differed in correctly classifying psychiatric outpatients, with the SASSI and the AMAC statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MAST. 4. The three tests differed in correctly classifying drug addicts, with the MAST statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AMAC and the SASSI. 5. The three tests differed in correctly classifying co-dependents, with the SASSI statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AMAC and the MAST. Employing the two-group criterion, all tests vastly improved their performance with <b>the</b> SASSI <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MAST and the AMAC at author-recommended cutting scores. Increasing the cutting score for the MAST improved classification accuracy even further. Employing the linear discriminant function, the three tests differed significantly, with the MAST statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> all other scales. ConclusionsNone of the three scales performed adequately with the five-group criterion. The simpler two-group criterion produced an 87 % classification accuracy rate for the SASSI with the study sample at author-recommended cutting scores, which was statistically <b>significantly</b> superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MAST and the AMAC. The highest classification accuracy rates of 90. 3 % and 91. 2 % respectively were produced by the MAST at elevated cutting scores of 10 and 12 in the two-group criterion.
