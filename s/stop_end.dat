The opposite side of this is platform 2. Mainly used by trains towards [...] and beyond, it is also used by through trains for [...] moving on or off the St Ives branch. [...] Because the main line is on a falling gradient towards Hayle, at the buffer <b>stop</b> <b>end</b> a few steps are needed to connect platforms 2 and 3 but at the east end they are nearly level. Standing at {{this end of the}} station the line to St Ives curves away to the left over Western Growers Crossing towards the covered way beneath the A30 road. The Cornish Main Line towards Hayle drops gently to the right with the signal box situated between the two.

He told the House of Commons; [...] "It is absolutely clear that Raoul Moat was a callous murderer, full <b>stop,</b> <b>end</b> of story. ... I cannot understand any wave, however small, of public sympathy for this man. ... There should be sympathy for his victims and the havoc he wreaked in that community. ... There should be no sympathy for him". Facebook later responded by saying {{that it would not}} remove the site because it encourages public debate about issues in the media. [...] "Facebook is a place where people can express their views and discuss things in an open way as they can and do in many other places. And as such we sometimes find people discussing topics others may find distasteful, however, that is not a reason in itself to stop a debate from happening. We believe that enabling people to have these different opinions and debate about a topic can help bring together lots of different views for a healthy discussion". Cameron later said he would be making an official complaint to Facebook. The page was deleted by its creator on 15 July.|$|E

40|$|The Time Digitizer {{capable of}} {{covering}} {{a range of}} 0. 34 sec in 9. 76 psec increments is described. The time interval between a pair of start-stop pulses is digitized coarsely in 20 nsec periods by a very accurate 50 MHz reference clock. The residual fractions of a clock period at the start and the <b>stop</b> <b>end</b> of the measured interval are stretched in two interpolators and digitized in 9. 76 psec increments. An equivalent digitizing frequency of 102. 4 GHz is thus achieved. The digitizer is built in a minicrate and communicates via a standard crate controller. It is intended {{for use in the}} laser ranging between ground stations and the Laser Geodetic Satellite (LAGEOS). It is shown that the distribution in any two adjacent 9. 76 psec channels of a small number of identical test time intervals is essentially binomial. The performance of the digitizer and test results are given...|$|E
40|$|In current 3 -dimensional multi-pass {{repair weld}} {{simulations}} each pass is generally modelled {{as a single}} continuous weld bead using either a simultaneous bead deposition or a progressive bead deposition moving heat source approach. In reality the length of typical manual metal arc (MMA) repair welds often necessitates {{the use of multiple}} weld beads for any individual pass. To investigate the modelling assumptions associated with this approximation a series of results are presented that simulate the deposition of a multi-bead, single MMA weld pass on a stainless steel flat plate. The simulations make use of a fabricated single bead weld test specimen to define the welding conditions. A number of different heat source models and bead sequencing scenarios have been investigated. These include moving heat source simulations, simultaneous bead laying methods (also called "block-dumped" methods) and combinations of the two. The work provides a useful insight into how certain modelling approximations affect weld residual stress distributions. It is concluded that moving heat source end effects are not sensitive to modelling assumptions made in weld beads remote from the <b>stop</b> <b>end.</b> However, residual stress predictions at the mid-length of a multi-bead weld pass on a flat plate are sensitive to the modelling assumptions. In particular, modelling each bead of a multi-bead weld pass can increase the stresses at mid-length relative to a simulation that deposits the whole pass in one go. One further observation made is that modelling the central bead of a multi-bead weld pass using a block-dumped technique (allowing a symmetry boundary condition to be used perpendicular to the weld bead) can result in inaccurate or misleading results...|$|E
