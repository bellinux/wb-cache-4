40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the understanding of}} business concentration through the Her findahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), by showing that this index is conceptually a model according to which this concentration is the consequence of a renewal process. This process is prompted by firms engaging in different types of economic activity as {{the means by which}} to vie for market share. The resultant rivalry produces departures between the market shares of firms. These departures ultimately transmit into differing concentration levels attributable only to the economic activity with which firms vie. As a consequence, while the HHI is commonly interpreted to be a <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> of market structure, it is in fact first and foremost a <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> of market conduct, which incidentally doubles-up as an indicator of market structure. As part of this, the paper shows that while the HHI cannot identify the exact economic conduct that produces the corresponding business concentration of the observed market structure, it does reveal that whatever this conduct is, it is always subordinated to some type of regenerative or revitalising process...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{models in}} the Management Science {{literature}} contain constructions that are {{a variant of the}} following: A decision-maker must choose from a set of alternatives based on imperfect information as to their relative quality, while further evaluation, through costly, provides more accurate information. We examine decision heuristics in which the optimal search policy entails a screening strategy limiting the number of alternatives in the subsequent, costly evaluation. There are two general methods for accomplishing this screening: Quota cutoffs operate by selecting the optimal number of alternatives to evaluate; Level cutoffs operate by specifying a minimally-acceptable level of the imperfect <b>screening</b> <b>indicator.</b> The present paper has three main objectives. First, to define the Level and Quota cutoff methods, broadly characterize optimal behavior for each and determine what aspects of the decision environment of order statistics as a methodology for exploring decision problems when information is imperfectly known; and third, to discuss the pivotal role of default, or fallback, options in a broad class of search problems. Quota and Level strategies restrict the number of alternatives passing the cutoff-based screen. Because restrictive cutoffs reduce evaluation costs while lowering the expected quality of the item finally selected, changes in the decision environment making the evaluation process less beneficial or increasing its cost drive the optimal cutoff to be more restrictive. In particular, increases in unit evaluation cost, improvement in the quality of a fallback option, decreases in the total number of alternatives available or improvement in the precision of the final evaluation process all lead to more restrictive cutoffs at optimum. These results hold over a remarkably broad range of assumptions and conditions. We also find that a better <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> leads to more restrictive screening when evaluation costs are low but, surprisingly, to less restrictive screening when costs are high. Comparing the two strategies, we find the unexpected result that the Quota cutoff strategy is generally superior to the Level, except under on of two fairly uncommon set of circumstances: when evaluation cost is prohibitively high, or when there is a fallback option of very high quality. choice models, optimal stopping, cutoffs, imperfect information, order statistics, random utility models...|$|E
40|$|The factors {{influencing}} {{the prognosis of}} acute kidney injury (AKI) were analyzed {{in a group of}} elderly AKI patients to determine the markers of early prognosis. A total of 258 patients were screened, and 201 patients were enrolled in the study. Eventually, 184 AKI patients were included in the study, including 79 elderly AKI patients (≥ 60 years old). During one year of follow-up, renal function changes were observed, and the risk factors that influenced the prognosis of AKI were analyzed. When AKI occurred, the urine kidney injury molecule- 1 (uKIM- 1) level was significantly higher in the progressive deterioration of renal function group than in the renal function stable group. The ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve for poor progressive deterioration of renal function as predicted by the uKIM- 1 level was 0. 681. At a cutoff point of 2. 46 ng/mg, the sensitivity was 71. 9 % and the specificity was 70. 0 %. In elderly AKI patients, uKIM- 1 levels exceeding 2. 46 ng/mg were positively associated with poor kidney prognosis. Elderly AKI patients are at risk of developing progressive deterioration of renal function. In elderly AKI patients, the high uKIM- 1 level may predict the prognosis of kidney function and may be used as an early <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> of poor kidney prognosis...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of extended spectrum of beta lactamases (ESBLs), to compare different phenotypic methods for ESBL confirmation and to evaluate the antibiotic resistance patterns among ESBL-producing urinary Escherichia coli. MethodsUrinary E. coli isolates that were resistant {{to at least one}} of the three indicator cephalosporins (cefotaxime, cefpodoxime and ceftazidime) were tested for ESBL production using the double disc synergy test (DDST), the inhibitory potentiated disc diffusion (IPDD) test and the quantitative E-strip method. ResultOf the 163 E. coli strains isolated, 80 (49 %) were resistant to {{at least one of the}} three cephalosporins, and 38 (47. 5 %) tested positive for ESBLs by the IPDD test and the E-strip test. However, only 15 (18. 7 %) strains tested positive by the DDST. Among the third-generation cephalosporins, cefpodoxime (46. 1 %) was the best <b>screening</b> <b>indicator,</b> followed by ceftazidime (43 %) and cefotaxime (39. 9 %). Most of the ESBL producers (97. 3 %) were resistant to three or more drugs, compared with 51. 2 % of non-ESBL producers. ConclusionCompared with the DDST, the IPDD and E-strip tests appear to be preferable methods for detecting ESBLs, with better sensitivity (100 %) and specificilty (97. 6 %) and positive predictive values (97. 3 %). ESBL producers showed significantly (p< 0. 05) higher resistance to tobramycin, co-amoxyclav and amikacin than did non-ESBL producers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} obstetric and {{perinatal}} outcomes of women presenting with reduced fetal movement (RFM) {{during the third}} trimester, specifically {{in relation to the}} diagnostic capacity of non-stress cardiotocography (CTG) used as the primary investigation in this clinical scenario. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective population-based cohort study of pregnancy outcomes of all women ≥ 28 weeks' gestation with singleton pregnancies presenting during one calendar year with maternal perception of RFM, all of whom underwent CTG at presentation. Main outcome measures included: obstetric intervention (induction of labour, spontaneous vaginal delivery, operative vaginal delivery, emergency caesarean section), and perinatal outcome (subsequent perinatal death, low Apgar scores (< 7 (5)), neonatal resuscitation and NICU admission). RESULTS: In all, 524 women presented with RFM and a live fetus, representing 7 % of the antenatal obstetric population; 284 women (54 %) were nulliparous. The reassuring CTG group comprised 482 (92 %) women in whom initial CTG was reassuring and 15 (3 %) where a repeat tracing within 1 h was reassuring. The non-reassuring/abnormal CTG group (n= 27, 5 %) either underwent emergency delivery or comprehensive serial fetal assessment; this group had significantly higher rates of emergency caesarean delivery, neonatal resuscitation and NICU admission; the incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants did not differ significantly. No perinatal death occurred in either group following CTG. CONCLUSION: Normal non-stress CTG is a reliable <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> of fetal wellbeing in women presenting with perception of RFM in the third trimester; abnormal pregnancy outcomes were more common when initial CTG was abnormal or persistently non-reassuring...|$|E

Here, we report a new testing method named colloidal gold-immunochromatography assay (GICA) to detect syphilis instead of fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-Abs). Syphilis-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody was detected with GICA established on syphilis-specific recombinant proteins, TPN 17 and TPN 47. FTA-Abs Treponema pallidum (TP) -IgG was set as the gold standard. A GICA test was performed to detect the serum of 14 967 subjects who took a serologic test for syphilis at the Xiamen Center of Clinical Laboratory, Fujian, China, from March 2009 to February 2010, among which 1326 cases were diagnosed as syphilitic. The results showed that the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 99. 38 % (1279 / 1287), 99. 96 % (12 975 / 12 980), and 99. 61 % (1279 / 1284), respectively. The positive rate between the 2 test methods had no significant difference (chi(2) = 0. 003, P > 0. 05). Detection on 500 interference specimens indicated that the biologic false-positive rate of the GICA test was extremely low and free from other biologic and chemical factors. The characteristics of GICA TP-IgG correspond to that of FTA-Abs TP-IgG (EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Germany). The GICA test is convenient, fast, and inexpensive, and it can be used both as a confirmatory test and a <b>screening</b> <b>indicator,</b> instead of FTA-Abs TP-IgG. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background. Health-related {{quality of}} life (HRQoL) is an {{important}} component of comprehensive management in primary care. Objectives. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationships between physical performance measures and self-reported HRQoL and to fi nd optimal values of muscle function tests associated with lower HRQoL. Material and methods. From a single primary health care center patient list, 330 subjects were randomly selected. Information about the patient’s age, gender, body mass index and presence of self-reported chronic diseases was collected, as well as analyses for systemic infl ammation and vitamin D. Physical performance was measured by dominant hand grip strength (GS) and a 30 -second chair stand test (30 -CST). The physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component scores of the Short-Form- 36 Questionnaire (SF- 36) were used to evaluate HRQoL. The predictive power of physical function measures were tested with multivariate linear regression analyses. Threshold values for physical function tests were calculated by receiver operating characteristic curves. Results. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that 30 -CST was signifi cantly (p < 0. 0001) associated with SF- 36 summary scores for both genders. Males with 30 -CST results under 7 stands and females with results of fewer than 13 stands were in the risk group for having the lowest PCS scores. Results in 30 -CST under 12 stands in males and under 13 stands in females were associated with the lowest scores of MCS. Conclusions. 30 -CST had the most expressed association with the outcomes of HRQoL in the Estonian population. Subjects with physical performance results under threshold values are at risk of lower HRQoL; therefore, 30 -CST is a potential <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> for HRQoL assessment...|$|E
40|$|Grazing {{management}} {{effects on}} soil property dynamics are poorly understood. A {{study was conducted}} to assess effects of grazing management and season on soil property dynamics and greenhouse gas flux within semiarid rangeland. Grazing management treatments evaluated in the study included two permanent pastures differing in stocking rate (moderately and heavily grazed pastures) and a fertilized, heavily grazed crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum [Fisch. ex. Link] Schult.) pasture near Mandan, North Dakota. Over a period of 3 yr, soil properties were measured in the spring, summer, and fall at 0 – 5 cm and 5 – 10 cm. Concurrent to soil-based measurements, fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide were measured on 1 -wk to 2 -wk intervals and related to soil properties via stepwise regression. High stocking rate and fertilizer nitrogen (N) application within the crested wheatgrass pasture contributed to increased soil bulk density and extractable N, and decreased soil pH and microbial biomass compared to permanent pastures. Soil nitrate nitrogen tended to be greatest at peak aboveground biomass, whereas soil ammonium nitrogen was greatest in early spring. Drought conditions during the third year of the study contributed to nearly two-fold increases in extractable N under the crested wheatgrass pasture and the heavily grazed permanent pasture, but not the moderately grazed permanent pasture. Stepwise regression found select soil properties to be modestly related to soil–atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes, with model r 2 ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 76. Electrical conductivity was included most frequently in stepwise regressions and, accordingly, may serve as a useful <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> for greenhouse gas ‘‘hot spots’’ in grazing land...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented research was to address the suitability of a battery of bioassays for a site-specific ecotoxicological evaluation of contaminated soils. Experimental fields are located at an abandoned armament site where the topsoil was contaminated by the explosive 2, 4, 6 -Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and several co-contaminants. At this site, different soil treatments were established at technical scale to investigate the efficiency of a newly developed phytoremediation technology. Being part of an extensive monitoring programme, the test battery was intended to evaluate changes of soil toxicity {{in the course of}} remediation. The battery was compiled of five rather standardised test methods used in ecotoxicology: a phytotoxicity test with garden cress (Lepidium sativum), a springtail reproduction test with Folsomia candida (Collembola) and soil respiration measurements (basal and substrate induced respiration). In addition to these soil assays two aquatic tests based on the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri (acute toxicity and mutagenicity) were included to assess the toxicity of aqueous soil extracts. Biological data generated by the test battery reveal a differentiated toxicity of complex contaminated soil samples. Observed differences in toxicity are in relative agreement with a gradient of TNT-contamination between experimental fields as described by chemical analyses. The five bioassays revealed clear differences in sensitivity. The acute luminescent bacteria toxicity test conducted with soil leachates proved to be a sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> of water-extractable toxicity. Bioassay data from all treatment variants largely indicate a reduction of soil toxicity during a 17 months remediation period, supposedly reflecting decreased soil concentrations of nitroaromatic compounds as shown by chemical analyses. These observations indicate a positive impact of the remediation procedures applied, but further monitoring is essential...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Deliberate {{screening}} allows {{detection of}} health risks that are otherwise not noticeable and allows expedient intervention to minimize complications and optimize outcomes, especially during critical events like hospitalization. Little research has evaluated {{the usefulness of}} screening performance and outcome indicators as measures to differentiate nursing quality, although policymakers are using them to benchmark hospitals. OBJECTIVES: The aims {{of this study were}} to examine hospital performance based on nursing-sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> and to assess associations with hospital characteristics and nursing-sensitive outcomes for patients. METHODS: A secondary use of nursing-sensitive data from the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate was performed, including the mandatory <b>screening</b> and outcome <b>indicators</b> related to delirium, malnutrition, pain and pressure ulcers. The sample consisted of all 93 hospitals in the Netherlands in 2011. High- and low-performing hospitals were determined based on the overall proportion of screened patients. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used to examine screening performances in relation to hospital characteristics and nursing-sensitive outcomes. RESULTS: Over all hospitals, the average screening rates ranged from 59 % (delirium) to 94 % (pain). Organizational characteristics were not different in high- and low-performing hospitals. The hospitals with the best overall screening performances had significantly better results regarding protein intake within malnourished patients (p <. 01). For mortality, marginal significant effects did not remain after controlling for organizational structures. No associations were found with prevalence of pressure ulcers and patient self-reported pain scores. DISCUSSION: The screening for patient risks is an important nursing task.

The objective {{of this study was to}} culturally adapt and validate the GAD- 7 for the Portuguese patients with generalized {{anxiety disorder}}. Methods: For the cultural adaptation of the Portuguese version of the GAD- 7 scale we started with a previous translation made by Mapi Institute and decided to perform a clinical review followed by a cognitive debriefing with patients. Once piloted, this version was then tested in a larger sample for feasibility and reliability (1 -week test-retest). Construct validity was assessed by the relationship between GAD- 7 and socio-demographic and clinical variables. Its unidimensionality was tested by principal component factor analysis. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing GAD- 7 scores with those obtained by HADS, and EQ- 5 D. STAI was mainly used as a <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> for patient inclusion. Results: GAD- 7 was considered feasible with a mean completion time of 2. 3 minutes and no major floor or ceiling effects. We found an excellent Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency score (0. 880) and the test-retest and interclass correlation coefficients were also very good. Regarding the construct validity, younger patients, those with higher education, employed and without anxiety symptoms revealed lower GAD- 7 scores, meaning better health. The unidimensionality of GAD- 7 index was also confirmed by principal component factor analysis. At last, GAD- 7 was significantly correlated with other health outcome indices and the classification levels created by it and by HADS showed to be dependent. Conclusion: The excellent metric properties confirmed the cultural adaptation and validity of GAD- 7 into Portuguese population, allowing the clinicians an early detection and treatment of these patients...|$|E

In this observational study we investigated whether community health workers could do community-based screenings to predict cardiovascular disease risk as eff ectively as could physicians or nurses, with a simple, non-invasive risk prediction indicator in low-income and middle-income countries. Methods This observation study {{was done in}} Bangladesh, Guatemala, Mexico, and South Africa. Each site recruited at least ten to 15 community health workers based on usual site-specifi c norms for required levels of education and language competency. Community health workers had to reside in the community where the screenings were done {{and had to be}} fl uent in that community’s predominant language. These workers were trained to calculate an absolute cardiovascular disease risk score with a previously validated simple, non-invasive <b>screening</b> <b>indicator.</b> Community health workers who successfully fi nished the training screened community residents aged 35 – 74 years without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{diagnosis}} of the metabolic syndrome is time-consuming and invasive. Convenient instruments {{that do not require}} laboratory or physical investigation would be useful in early screening individuals at high risk of metabolic syndrome. Examination of the autonomic function can be taken as a directly reference and <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> for predicting metabolic syndrome. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The EZSCAN test, as an efficient and noninvasive technology, can access autonomic function through measuring electrochemical skin conductance. In this study, we used EZSCAN value to evaluate autonomic function and to detect metabolic syndrome in 5, 887 participants aged 40 years or older. The EZSCAN test diagnostic accuracy was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves. Among the 5, 815 participants in the final analysis, 2, 541 were diagnosed as metabolic syndrome and the overall prevalence was 43. 7 %. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased with the elevated EZSCAN risk level (p for trend < 0. 0001). Moreover, EZSCAN value was associated with {{an increase in the number}} of metabolic syndrome components (p for trend < 0. 0001). Compared with the no risk group (EZSCAN value 0 - 24), participants at the high risk group (EZSCAN value: 50 - 100) had a 2. 35 fold increased risk of prevalent metabolic syndrome after the multiple adjustments. The area under the curve of the EZSCAN test was 0. 62 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 61 - 0. 64) for predicting metabolic syndrome. The optimal operating point for the EZSCAN value to detect a high risk of prevalent metabolic syndrome was 30 in this study, while the sensitivity and specificity were 71. 2 % and 46. 7 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, although less sensitive and accurate when compared with the clinical definition of metabolic syndrome, we found that the EZSCAN test is a good and simple screening technique for early predicting metabolic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nurse-sensitive {{indicators}} and nurses' {{satisfaction with the}} quality of care are two commonly used ways to measure quality of nursing care. However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between these kinds of measures. This study aimed to examine concordance between nurse-sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> and nurse-perceived quality of care. Methods: To calculate a composite performance score for each of six Dutch non-university teaching hospitals, the percentage scores of the publicly reported nurse-sensitive indicators: screening of delirium, screening of malnutrition, and pain assessments, were averaged (2011). Nurse-perceived quality ratings were obtained from staff nurses working in the same hospitals by the Dutch Essentials of Magnetism II survey (2010). Concordance between the quality measures was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. Results: The mean screening performances ranged from 63 % to 93 % across the six hospitals. Nurse-perceived quality of care differed significantly between the hospitals, also after adjusting for nursing experience, educational level, and regularity of shifts. The hospitals with high-levels of nurse-perceived quality were also high-performing hospitals according to nurse-sensitive indicators. The relationship was true for high-performing as well as lower-performing hospitals, with strong correlations between the two quality measures (r S = 0. 943, p = 0. 005). Conclusions: Our findings showed that there is a significant positive association between objectively measured nurse-sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> and subjectively measured perception of quality. Moreover, the two indicators of quality of nursing care provide corresponding quality rankings. This implies that improving factors that are associated with nurses' perception of what they believe to be quality of care may also lead to better screening processes. Although convergent validity seems to be established, we emphasize that different kinds of quality measures could be used to complement each other, because various stakeholders may assign different values to the quality of nursing care...|$|R
40|$|Background: Risks {{assessments}} and subsequent assignment of interventions are important nursing tasks. Nurse-sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as <b>screening</b> of delirium, screening of malnutrition, and pain assessments are therefore {{commonly used to}} benchmark nursing care quality. Previously, specific characteristics of nurses and their work environment {{have been linked to}} nurses’ abilities to perform well and to deliver high quality of care. Understanding the influence of these factors is necessary in order {{to improve the quality of}} nursing care. Aims: The aims of this thesis were: (i) to assess the value of nurse-sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> as measures to evaluate quality of nursing care, and (ii) to determine contributing factors in nurses’ work environment and individual characteristics of nurses that affect the quality of care. Methods: A series of studies were performed, including a systematic review of literature, two cross-sectional studies, a descriptive-exploratory study, an observational study in intensive care units (ICUs), and a survey study among the nurses of these ICUs. The results of these studies were synthesized and discussed to generate evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice and future research. Results: We found that nurse-sensitive <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> are potentially valid and useful measures to gain insight into the quality of nursing care in hospitals. However, the following challenges occurred with regard to indicator measurement: (i) applicability of indicators in daily nursing practice, (ii) uniformity in indicator definitions, (iii) continuity in monitoring of indicators, and (iv) multitude of quality registrations. This is also represented by the various barriers related to attitude, knowledge and behavior that were perceived by nurses. Nurses’ educational level and the work environment characteristics of nurse staffing levels, autonomy, patient-centered cultural values and professional relationships are important in relation to the quality of care provided. The emerging mediating factor of nurses’ proactivity seems to be the hidden force in care processes, connecting characteristics of nurses and their work environment (nurse level) to nurses’ job performance and patient outcomes in hospitals (organizational level). Conclusions: To gain full understanding of the quality of nursing care, it is necessary that organizational entities (policymakers, hospital organizations) continuously assess the value of nurse-sensitive indicators as representative measures of quality. At nurses’ level, nurse managers have to, and also should be allowed to create healthy work environments for their nurses. Bridging the gap between measurement of quality of nursing care and clinical reality involves enhancing nurses’ intrinsic motivation to appropriately use quality indicators, by showing their added value in nursing practice. Individual nurses could optimize their own performances by means of continuous education and maintenance of competences. All in light of the overarching goal of provision of the highest quality of care to patients by the effective performances of excellent nurses...|$|R

40|$|Developing salt-tolerant crops {{is central}} to {{remediation}} of salinity affected land and to meet increasing global food demand. Salt tolerance is a polygenic trait involving multiple mechanisms, with contributions from genetic, developmental, physiological and environmental interactions. The molecular and physiological mechanisms of plant salt tolerance have been intensively investigated {{with most of the}} studies focused on detrimental effects of Na+. Accordingly, most of the plant breeding for salt tolerance has been focused almost exclusively on excluding Na+ from uptake and/or transport to shoot. Salt-induced perturbations in K+ homeostasis are often recognised as being of secondary importance or even ignored by many researchers. This work argues that surmounting those constraints may open new avenues for breeding for salt-tolerant crops. Various plant physiological and genetic techniques were employed to test the hypothesis that the K+ retention in barley under saline conditions {{is central to}} maintain the cytosolic K+/Na+ ratio and hence that salt-induced loss of K+ from seedling roots can be used for effective selection and breeding of salt-tolerant barley. A comprehensive study was undertaken comparing whole-plant and cellular responses to salinity. Using seven barley cultivars contrasting in salt tolerance, a strong negative correlation was observed between the magnitude of K+ release from the roots of young seedlings and salt tolerance of mature plants judged by various physiological indices under saline conditions in glasshouse experiments. This suggested that K+ loss from the mature zone of intact 3 -d old roots following 1 h pre-treatment with 80 mM NaCl {{can be used as a}} reliable <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> for salt tolerance in barley. A faster and more cost-effective procedure, based on the amount of K+ lost from plant roots during exposure to NaCl, was developed for rapid screening of large numbers of seedlings...|$|E

However, present methods used for detecting bacterial pollution are still plagued with problems originating from sample composition, matrix interference and fluctuations in various instrumental components such as lamps and detectors over the time of the assay. The fluorescence methods used for identifying oil-spill sources have also been plagued with variability and a degree of uncertainty. Research included in this Dissertation addresses certain aspects and enumerates how certain of those problems have been and can be overcome. The fluorescent ratio method developed in this research has shown to significantly improve the accuracy and sensitivity of detecting fecal pollution in marine waters via substrate to enzyme assays. In addition, the enumeration of the important wavelengths has demonstrated the potential of an online probe detector to distinguish different oils from one another in a subsurface water column using a flashing xenon light source and five different emission bandpass filters. A new generation of in-situ, on-line oil contamination detector is being developed upon the design of an established commercial oil detector provided by the Spectrogram.

40|$|Abstract Background Amount {{of sleep}} is an {{important}} indicator of health and well-being in children and adolescents. Adequate sleep (AS: adequate sleep is defined as 6 – 8 hours per night regularly) is {{a critical factor in}} adolescent health and health-related behaviors. The present study was based on a health promotion project previously conducted on adolescents in Tao-Yuan County, Taiwan. The aim was {{to examine the relationship between}} AS during schooldays and excessive body weight, frequency of visiting doctors and health-related behaviors among Taiwanese adolescents. Methods A cross-sectional study design, categorical and multivariate data analyses were used. The hypotheses investigated were: high frequency of AS is positively associated with lack of obesity and less frequent visits to doctors; and high frequency AS is positively associated with health-related behavior. Results A total of 656 boys (53. 2 %) and girls (46. 8 %), ranging in age from 13 – 18 years were studied between January and June 2004. Three hundred and fifty seven subjects (54 %) reported that they slept less than the suggested 6 – 8 hours on schooldays. A significant negative association was found between low sleep and of the following health-related behaviors: (1) life appreciation; (2) taking responsibility for health; (3) adopting healthy diet; (4) effective stress management; (5) regular exercise; and (6) total AHP score. High frequency AS was associated with low frequencies of obesity after potential confounding factors were controlled. Junior high school adolescents reported significantly higher frequencies of AS than high school participants. Gender, family structure, home location and frequency of television watching or computer use were not significantly associated with AS. Conclusion These findings support the proposition that AS is associated with good health status and high-frequency adoption of health-related behavior. Furthermore, these findings suggest that inadequate sleep may be a <b>screening</b> <b>indicator</b> for an unhealthy lifestyle and poor health status. The results might be useful for future research into the development of intervention strategies to assist adolescents who are not receiving enough hours of sleep. </p...|$|E

40|$|Many poverty, safety net, training, {{and other}} social {{programs}} utilize multiple screening criteria to determine eligibility. We apply recent advances in multidimensional measurement analysis to develop a straightforward method for summarizing changes in groups of eligibility (<b>screening)</b> <b>indicators,</b> which have appropriate properties. We show how this impact can differ across participants with differing numbers of initial deprivations. We also examine impacts on other specially designed multidimensional poverty measures (and their components) that address key participant deficits. We apply our methods to a BRAC ultra-poverty program in Bangladesh, and find that our measures of multidimensional poverty have fallen significantly for participants. This improvement is most associated with better food security and with acquisition of basic assets (though {{this does not mean}} that the cause of poverty reduction was program activities focused directly on these deficits). In general, we find that the BRAC program had a greater impact on reducing multidimensional poverty for those with a larger initial number of deprivations. We also showed how evaluation evidence can be used to help improve the selection of eligibility characteristics of potential participants. </p...|$|R
40|$|This short paper {{presents}} the results of an exploratory pilot survey on HIV-AIDS screening (DOD-CI) conducted in Côte d'Ivoire to test the feasibility and representativeness of a national general population survey based on a random sample of mobile phone numbers. The refusal rate was low, and below the levels habitually observed for similar surveys conducted in France. In terms of representativeness, the sample obtained was younger, more urban and more masculine than the population in general. Four HIV-AIDS <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> were compared with those obtained in the Demographic and Health survey (DHS) conducted in 2011 - 2012. Owing to differences in selection biases affecting the two surveys, the indicators were higher than those observed in the DHS 2011 - 2012. However, the differences observed by sex, age group, level of education and place of residence were similar. This confirms the feasibility of applying such an approach for a national survey in Côte d'Ivoire, providing that several adjustments are made, such as including non-subscribers living in the same household as a mobile phone subscriber...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular disease {{contributes}} substantially to the {{non-communicable disease}} (NCD) burden in low-income and middle-income countries, which also often have substantial health personnel shortages. In this observational study we investigated whether community health workers could do community-based screenings to predict cardiovascular disease risk {{as effectively as}} could physicians or nurses, with a simple, non-invasive risk prediction indicator in low-income and middle-income countries. Methods: This observation study was done in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Mexico, and South Africa. Each site recruited at least ten to 15 community health workers based on usual site-specific norms for required levels of education and language competency. Community health workers had to reside in the community where the screenings were done {{and had to be}} fluent in that community's predominant language. These workers were trained to calculate an absolute cardiovascular disease risk score with a previously validated simple, non-invasive <b>screening</b> <b>indicator.</b> Community health workers who successfully finished the training screened community residents aged 35 – 74 years without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease. Health professionals independently generated a second risk score with the same instrument and the two sets of scores were compared for agreement. The primary endpoint of this study was the level of direct agreement between risk scores assigned by the community health workers and the health professionals. Findings: Of 68 community health worker trainees recruited between June 4, 2012, and Feb 8, 2013, 42 were deemed qualified to do fieldwork (15 in Bangladesh, eight in Guatemala, nine in Mexico, and ten in South Africa). Across all sites, 4383 community members were approached for participation and 4049 completed screening. The mean level of agreement between the two sets of risk scores was 96 · 8 % (weighted κ= 0 · 948, 95 % CI 0 · 936 – 0 · 961) and community health workers showed that 263 (6 %) of 4049 people had a 5 -year cardiovascular disease risk of greater than 20 %. Interpretation: Health workers without formal professional training can be adequately trained to effectively screen for, and identify, people at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Using community health workers for this screening would free up trained health professionals in low-resource settings to do tasks that need high levels of formal, professional training.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} simple {{predictive}} model of physical intimate partner violence (PIPV) {{to be used}} by primary health care (PHC) professionals. The sample comprised 811 mothers of children< 5 months old attending PHC facilities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A multinomial logit model was used. Measured by the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales, PIPV was classified in three levels (absence, at least one episode during preg-nancy or postpartum, and presence in both periods). Socio-economic, demographic and life style variables were considered as potential predictors. Maternal age< 20 years, an education of 2 children under 5, tobacco smoking, alcohol misuse and illicit drug use by the mother and/or partner, and perception of baby’s ill-health were identified as predictors of PIPV. The model-projected prevalence of PIPV for pregnancy and/or postpartum was just 10. 1 % in the absence of these characteristics, whereas this increased to 96. 4 % when all the seven characteristics were present. Child, maternal and family characteristics greatly increase the likelihood of PIPV and could be used together as <b>screening</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of environment with hazardous chemicals due to ever increasing consumption of various products has reached alarming levels. The problem is internationally recognised and actions {{are taken to}} reduce {{the negative effects of}} chemicals’ use. Ecodesign, which recently has emerged as a comprehensive tool for environmental management, is seen {{as one of the most}} effective approaches to minimise chemical risks associated with products since it starts at the conceptual development phase of the products when problematic materials can be avoided or design for closed loop systems of those materials can be made. There are different types of ecodesign tools ranging from guidelines and checklists to one-score <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> and full life cycle assessment. This paper analyzes existing ecodesign tools with respect to the minimization of chemical risks and focuses on critical points that hamper the application of these tools. The study outlines the need for sub-instruments that achieve a successful reduction of hazardous chemicals while maintaining the design objectives. Ideas for the development of such sub-instruments are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The Forced Choice Recognition (FCR) and the Critical Item Analysis (CIA) {{indices of}} the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) have been {{identified}} by the CVLT-II test developers as potentially useful, brief <b>screening</b> <b>indicators</b> of effort in neuropsychological assessment. This retrospective study analyzes performance on these measures in three groups: (1) clinically referred individuals; (2) forensically referred individuals not suspected of inadequate effort; and (3) forensically referred individuals whose performance on freestanding tests of effort suggested inadequate effort. Performances on FCR were analyzed for their relation to actual memory impairment and with regard to concrete and abstract distractor endorsement. FCR and CIA performances were analyzed for agreement with formal tests of inadequate effort and their test characteristics. Incremental validity was assessed by hierarchical logistic regression with previously identified indices for detection of inadequate effort on the CVLT. Results indicate that (1) FCR and CIA performances {{are not related to}} decreased memory performance; (2) FCR and CIA indices exhibit higher specificity and lower sensitivity, with higher positive predictive value than negative predictive value; and (3) FCR and CIA indices exhibit modest incremental validity with previously identified indices.
