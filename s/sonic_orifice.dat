50|$|The {{most common}} system of active {{addition}} of make-up gas in semi-closed rebreathers is {{by use of}} a constant mass flow injector, also known as choked flow. This is easily achieved by using a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice,</b> as provided the pressure drop over the orifice is sufficient to ensure sonic flow, the mass flow for a specific gas will be independent of the downstream pressure. The mass flow through a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice</b> {{is a function of}} the upstream pressure and the gas mixture, so the upstream pressure must remain constant for the working depth range of the rebreather to provide a reliably predictable mixture in the breathing circuit, and a modified regulator is used which is not affected by changes in ambient pressure. Gas addition is independent of oxygen use, and the gas fraction in the loop is strongly dependent on exertion of the diver - it is possible to dangerously deplete the oxygen by excessive physical exertion.|$|E

Expressions are also developed for a spherically-symmetric thermal expansion (M = 0). CND solutions are found for the most general paths relative to these sources and briefly explored. It is determined that the maximum CND from a distant location through directed effusion and <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice</b> cases occurs along the path parallel to the source plane that intersects the plume axis. For the effusive case this value is exactly twice the CND found along the ray originating from that point of intersection and extending to infinity along the plume's axis. For sonic plumes this ratio is reduced to about 4 / 3. For high Mach number cases the maximum CND will be found along the axial centerline path.

A large liquid helium-driven cryopump allows the undisturbed plume gas expansion into the highly rarefied regime. The plumes consist of continuum to free molecule flow, and isentropic core/boundary layer expansion into the backflow region. Initially thruster nozzles and <b>sonic</b> <b>orifices</b> are operated with test gases N_ 2 and H_ 2 as two essential components of thruster plumes (instead of real propellants such as hydrazine N_ 2 H_ 4).

The tool would consist of a Residual Gas Analyzer for partial pressure measurements and a full range pressure gauge for total pressure measurements. The primary application is to detect NH 3 coolant leaks in the ISS thermal control system. An analytical model of leak plume physics is presented that can account for effusive flow as well as plumes produced by <b>sonic</b> <b>orifices</b> and thruster operations. This model is used along with knowledge of typical RGA and full range gauge performance to analyze the expected instrument sensitivity to ISS leaks of various sizes and relative locations ("directionality"). The paper also presents experimental results of leak simulation testing in a large thermal vacuum chamber at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This test characterized instrument sensitivity {{as a function of}} leak rates ranging from 1 lb-mass/yr. to about 1 lb-mass/day. This data may represent the first measurements collected by an RGA or ion gauge system monitoring off-axis point sources as a function of location and orientation.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) code is being developed to compute the mixing and combustion of hydrogen fuel in the turbulent flow fields of supersonic combustion ramjets (scramjet). The code solves the three-dimensional Reynolds time-averaged complete Navier-Stokes equations including transport equations for a four species, two reaction, global finite rate chemistry model. The code {{was applied to the}} case of transverse injection of hydrogen from a <b>sonic</b> circular <b>orifice</b> into a supersonic airstream. The equations were numerically integrated using MacCormack's explicit method, and the algebraic eddy viscosity model of Baldwin-Lomax was used to model the turbulence. In the species transport and energy equations, diffusion coefficients based on Fick's Law and an assumption of unit Lewis number were applied. Computed features of the three-dimensional flow field are depicted by static pressure, static temperature, mass fraction of species, and velocity vectors. For engineering interest, mixing and combustion parameters were examined to assess the effect of injector diameter, injected fuel pressure, fuel-air ratio, and spacing of fuel injectors. The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the capability of the present three-dimensional spatially elliptic, CFD code for turbulent, reacting flow. Application of the code to specific supersonic combustion configurations is planned...|$|R

The probe is a water cooled <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice</b> probe followed by a Fanno duct. Tests showed that it rapidly quenched the reaction, and that time-average, ingested gas composition accurately reflected the time-average composition at the sampling point. A new way to measure mixedness to the molecular level in a reactive flow situation is described, based on time-average compositions at the probe. This definition is compared to the definition of intensity of segregation which can be used for unreactive mixing situations. Finally, the probe is used to examine centerline composition in a confined coaxial mixing situation...|$|E

The technique is applicable to discharge processes in which the mass flow rate is controlled by a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice.</b> Once the plenum is calibrated-using a method that is described-the technique allows mass flow rate out of the plenum to be determined from a single pressure measurement and an initial temperature measurement without the need for a traditional flow-metering device. Accuracy is comparable to conventional tertiary measurement techniques. The technique has application {{to a wide range of}} facilities in which gas is supplied from a pressurized plenum, and in which installation of a conventional device is either impossible or prohibitively costly.

40|$|Planar laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (PLIF) {{is demonstrated}} to {{be a valuable}} tool for studying the onset of transition to turbulence. For this study, we have used PLIF of nitric oxide (NO) to image underexpanded axisymmetric free jets issuing into a low-pressure chamber through a smooth converging nozzle with a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice.</b> Flows were studied over a range of Reynolds numbers and nozzle-exit-to-ambient pressure ratios {{with the aim of}} empirically determining criteria governing the onset of turbulence.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} {{contribution}} a physical {{model of the}} flow occurring inside impulsive actuators is developed. An impulsive actuator is characterized by its sudden flow output. The subsonic actuator under consideration is composed of a high pressure air supply and a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice</b> driven by a valve and followed by a tube. A theoretical analysis is put forward and assessed using experimental data. It is demonstrated that the operation of such actuators essentially depends on a single parameter consisting of the reservoir to ambient pressure ratio and the throat to tube area ratio. The relationship between this parameter and others, such as the length to diameter ratio of the tube are explored. In the unsteady mode the flow inside the tube is thoroughly analyzed {{with the help of}} measurements at the exit of the tube. In addition, the time scales involved are accurately extracted, which is a crucial factor in designing closed-loop control approaches.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of underexpanded and highly underexpanded axisymmetric nitrogen free jets seeded with 0. 5 % nitric oxide (NO) and issuing from a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice</b> was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center. Reynolds numbers based on nozzle exit conditions ranged from 770 to 35, 700, and nozzle exit-to-ambient jet pressure ratios ranged from 2 to 35. These flows were non-intrusively visualized with a spatial resolution of approximately 0. 14 mm x 0. 14 mm x 1 mm thick and a temporal resolution of 1 s using planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of NO, with the laser tuned to the strongly-fluorescing UV absorption bands of the Q 1 band head near 226. 256 nm.

40|$|During {{the course}} of experimentation, no solid {{particle}} powder could be found which produced an aerosol with a {{narrow particle size distribution}} when fluidization was the only flow process used in producing the aerosol. The complication of adding particle size fractionation processes to the aerosol generation effort appears to be avoidable. In this regard, a simple <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice</b> is found to be effective in reducing the percentage of agglomerates in the several metal oxide powders tested. Marginally beneficial results are obtained for a 0. 5 / 99. 5 percent by weight mixture of the flow agent and metal oxide powder. However, agglomeration is observed to be enhanced when the flow agent percentage is increased to 5 percent. Liquid atomization using the Collison nebulizer as well as a version of the Laskin nozzle resulted in polydispersed aerosols with particle size distributions heavily weighted by the small particle end of the size spectrum. The aerosol particle size distributions produced by the vaporization/condensation seeder are closer to the ideal monodispersed aerosol {{than any of the other}} aerosols tested.

40|$|Providers of {{payloads}} carried {{aboard the}} International Space Station must conduct analyses {{to demonstrate that}} any planned gaseous venting events generate {{no more than a}} certain level of material that may interfere with optical measurements from other experiments or payloads located nearby. This requirement is expressed in terms of a maximum column number density (CND). Depending on the level of rarefaction, such venting may be characterized by effusion for low flow rates, or by a sonic distribution at higher levels. Since the relative locations of other sensitive payloads are often unknown because they may refer to future projects, this requirement becomes a search for the maximum CND along any path. In another application, certain astronomical observations make use of CND to estimate light attenuation from a distant star through gaseous plumes, such as the Fermi Bubbles emanating from the vicinity of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, in order to infer the amount of material being expelled via those plumes. This paper presents analytical CND expressions developed for general straight paths based upon a free molecule point source model for steady effusive flow and for a distribution fitted to model flows from a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice.</b> Among other things, in this Mach number range it is demonstrated that the maximum CND from a distant location occurs along the path parallel to the source plane that intersects the plume axis. For effusive flows this value is exactly twice the CND found along the ray originating from that point of intersection and extending to infinity along the plumes axis. For sonic plumes this ratio is reduced to about 43...|$|E
40|$|Improvements in {{understanding}} how to design future mesocombustors are mandatory {{for the development}} of propulsion and power-generation systems having a size of few centimeters or even smaller and able to deliver high performances (lasting, power and energy density). To advance and extend the analysis carried out by the same authors in previous works, the experimental investigation of a 254 mm 3 non-premixed swirling cylindrical mesocombustor, fed by methane/air at 0. 3 MPa and with air preheated up to 200 °C was performed. The combustion pressure was chosen based on the values quoted in literature for gas turbines of centimeter scale. The analysis is carried out for several equivalence ratios and at two pressure values (0. 1 and 0. 3 MPa). To this aim the combustor is enclosed in a pressurized vessel. The desired pressure value inside the vessel is obtained by discharging a controlled mass flow rate of nitrogen through a <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice.</b> Data about the behavior and the performances of the meso-combustor (stability, exhaust gas composition, exhaust gas temperature, etc.) are obtained at the operating conditions specified above. The results evidenced that either the pre-heating of the combustion air or the increase of pressure are effective in improving the general performances (stability limits, chemical efficiency). Based on the measured chemical efficiency, the maximum power density of the meso-combustor resulted to be above 1. 4 GW/m 3 at 0. 3 MPa, while the maximum exhaust gas temperature resulted to be higher than 1570 K. Nevertheless the maximum values of chemical efficiency, power density and exhaust gas temperature cannot all be achieved simultaneously. Finally the measured data (CO, CO 2 and TUHC molar fractions, gas temperature, chemical efficiency) appear to be well correlated with the mean gas residence times...|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations for the Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) film/dump cooled nozzle design is presented, {{with an emphasis on}} the timely impact of CFD on the design of the sub-scale nozzle coolant system. The following aspects of the sub-scale coolant delivery system were analyzed with CFD: 1) a design trade study of a mechanical flow splitting device for uniform distribution of the subsonic cavity flow, 2) a design trade study of the subsonic cavity lip to achieve film integrity, and 3) an analysis of the primary flow interaction with the core/secondary coolant streams. All design calculations were performed with the Generalized Aerodynamic Simulation Program (GASP), a 3 -D, multi-block, generalized Navier-Stokes code capable of solving with frozen, finite-rate or equilibrium chemical kinetics. The initial design of the subsonic cavity flow used square posts to distribute the <b>sonic</b> <b>orifice</b> jets into a uniform flow. Calculations for this design indicated that an unacceptable mal-distribution of film occurred. Design modifications involving curved and slotted posts were computed in an effort to uniformly distribute the secondary coolant flow. Analysis of these configurations showed that although the flowfield improved in uniformity, it was still unacceptable, especially at higher feed pressures. Results from these studies were then incorporated into a design that resulted in the insertion of a porous metal ring into the subsonic cavity. Subsequent water flow model studies showed that this concept was successful in uniformly distributing flow exiting the cavity. In addition to the design of the subsonic cavity, CFD was also used to analyze the secondary coolant lip and the primary flow interaction with the core/secondary coolant streams. A series of calculations were first performed to modify the subsonic cavity lip contour. The flow over the modified lip was then computed simultaneously with the primary injectors to determine the impact of the subsonic coolant stream on the primary slot jets. Pressure, temperature, velocity, and coolant mass fraction contours are presented for these configurations. Information is given in viewgraph form...|$|E
