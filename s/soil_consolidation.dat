40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} numerically {{the evolution}} of surface settlement during continuous tunnel excavation by formulating and solving the poro-elasticity equations in a frame of reference, which is fixed to the moving face. In tunnelling through low-permeability <b>soils,</b> <b>consolidation</b> processes take place in general simultaneously with the spatial stress redistribution {{in the vicinity of}} the advancing face. Apart from the borderline case of highly permeable ground or very slow excavation, the excavation advance rate must be taken into consideration. One can readily verify by a dimensional analysis that the time-development of settlement is governed by the ratio of advance rate to ground permeability. The higher the advance rate, the lower the surface settlements and the angular distortion will be. ...|$|R
40|$|In many {{geotechnical}} problems it {{is vital}} to consider the geometrical non-linearity caused by large deformation in order to capture a more realistic model of the true behaviour. The solutions so obtained should then be more accurate and reliable, which should ultimately lead to cheaper and safer design. The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method originated from fluid mechanics, but has now been well established for solving large deformation problems in geomechanics. This paper provides an overview of the ALE method and its challenges in tackling problems involving non-linearities due to material behaviour, large deformation, changing boundary conditions and time-dependency, including material rate effects and inertia effects in dynamic loading applications. Important aspects of ALE implementation into a finite element framework will also be discussed. This method is then employed to solve some interesting and challenging geotechnical problems such as the dynamic bearing capacity of footings on soft <b>soils,</b> <b>consolidation</b> of a <b>soil</b> layer under a footing, and the modelling of dynamic penetration of objects into soil layers...|$|R

The station {{is located in the}} middle Po Plain on fine-grained alluvial deposits. A seasonal oscillation in the order of 18 mm (peak-to-peak amplitude) is present in the data. This crustal deformation has been modeled by including variations in the atmospheric, oceanic and hydrologic mass. The vertical positions can also be affected significantly by <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation.</b> Geotechnical parameters derived by in situ tests and laboratory analyses of the clayey soil collected at Medicina allowed the estimate of the soil settlement relevant to the seasonal oscillation of the surficial water table.

40|$|Modern {{continuum}} mechanics is {{the topic of}} this book. After its introduction it will be applied to a few typical systems arising in the environmental sciences and in geophysics. In large lake/ocean dynamics peculiar effects of {{the rotation of the}} Earth will be analyzed in linear/nonlinear processes of a homogenous and inhomogenous water body. Strong thermomechanical coupling paired with nonlinear rheology affects the flow of large ice sheets (such as Antarctica and Greenland) and ice shelves. Its response to the climatic forcing in an environmental of greenhouse warming may significantly affect the life of future generations. The mechanical behavior of granular materials under quasistatic loadings requires non-classical mixture concepts and encounters generally complicated elastic-plastic-type constitutive behavior. Creeping flow of <b>soils,</b> <b>consolidation</b> processes and ground water flow are described by such theories. Rapid shearing flow of granular materials lead to constitutive relations for the stresses which incorporate rate independent behavior of Mohr-Coulomb type together with dispersive stress contributions due to particle collisions.

40|$|In {{consolidation}} {{tests on}} compacted soils as embankment materials, the curve representing the time versus settlement relationship has a characteristic shape, due partly {{to the great}} amount of immediate settlement.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis focuses on the probabilistic modelling of <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> via prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) considering soil spatial variability. Soils are highly variable from one point to another {{in the ground and}} yet this is often coupled with inadequate site data, probabilistic analysis is a more rational approach to assess the behaviour of <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> by PVDs. Although the fact that spatial variation of soil properties can affect <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> has long been realized, the design of <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> via PVDs has been traditionally carried out deterministically and thus can be misleading due to the ignorance of the uncertainty associated with the inherent spatial variation of soil properties. One of the major advantages of probabilistic modelling over deterministic approach is that it can explicitly incorporate soil spatial variability in the analysis and design of a geotechnical problem and subsequently provides much physical insight into the impact of soil spatial variability on the behaviour of the problem under consideration. However, owing to the complexity of the stochastic problem, available research into consolidation of highly variable soils has been limited. The review of relevant literature has indicated that soil spatial variability in relation to ground improvement by PVDs has never been previously considered in a systematic, scientific manner in design and little research has been done in this area. Therefore, to obtain a more realistic measure of the degree of consolidation at any specified time, the effect of soil spatial variability needs {{to be taken into account}} by employing probabilistic modelling approach. Among several available methods of stochastic modelling, the random finite element method (RFEM) using random variable soil input properties in a Monte Carlo framework has gained much popularity in recent years. The same approach is adopted in the present research for modelling soil spatial variability in <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> by PVDs. The soil permeability, k, and volume compressibility, mv, are considered as random variables and the variability of both k and mv is characterised statistically in terms of the mean, standard deviation, lognormal probability distribution and scale of fluctuation (SOF). The random fields of k and mv are generated using 2 D local average subdivision (LAS) method developed by Fenton and Vanmarcke (1990). The generated random fields are then used as inputs in a stochastic finite element modelling of <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> by PVDs. In this research, all numerical analyses are carried out using the 2 D finite element computer program AFENA (Carter and Balaam 1995), in which the consolidation process of soil is treated as a coupled transient problem governed by the Biot’s consolidation theory (Biot 1941) ...|$|E

Soil detachment measurements were repeated for four different soil moisture contents (0 · 04, 0 · 14, 0 · 20 and 0 · 31 g g− 1). Whereas no effect of <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> and sealing is observed for critical flow shear stress (τcr), soil erodibility (Kc) decreases exponentially with increasing cumulative rainfall depth. The erosion-reducing effect of <b>soil</b> <b>consolidation</b> and sealing decreases with a decreasing soil moisture content prior to erosion due to slaking effects occurring during rapid wetting of the dry topsoil. After about 100 mm of rainfall, Kc attains its minimum value for all moisture conditions, corresponding to a reduction of about 70 % compared with the initial Kc value for the moist soil samples and only a 10 % reduction for the driest soil samples. The relationship estimating relative Kc values from soil moisture content and cumulative rainfall depth predicts Kc values measured on a gradually consolidating cropland field in the Belgian Loess Belt reasonably well (MEF = 0 · 54). Kc is also shown to decrease linearly with increasing soil bulk density for all moisture treatments, suggesting that the compaction of thalwegs where concentrated flow erosion often occurs might be an alternative soil erosion control measure in addition to grassed waterways and double drilling. status: publishe...|$|E

In this research several different methods of improvements were tried out in Sri Lankan peat, which have a rather low organic content around 20 %- 40 %. The improvement methods tried out were namely; pre-consolidation through preloading, mixing with cement at percentages of 5 %, 10 % and 15 % and mixing 15 % of lime. Peats at different levels of humification were used in the study. It was shown that the preconsolidation causes a significant improvement in both the primary and secondary consolidation characteristics irrespective of the degree of humification. Improvements were achieved in both the fibrous and amorphous peat. Even after the mixing of 15 % of cement or 15 % of lime significant improvements of consolidation characteristics could not be achieved in fibrous peat. But, even the mixing of 5 % cement caused significant improvements in both the primary and secondary consolidation characteristics in amorphous peats. The organic contents of the two types of peat considered were similar. Improvements of shear strength were achieved in all types of peat due to preconsolidation.
