40|$|Abstract: In the phytosociological literature, {{there are}} {{numerous}} different approaches to the designation of diagnostic species. Frequently, this results in discrepancies between the lists of diagnostic species published for {{one and the same}} community. We examined different approaches to determining diagnostic species using as an example Picea abies forests within the broader context of all Central European forests. Diagnostic species of <b>spruce</b> <b>forests</b> were determined from a data set of 20, 164 phytosociological relevØs of forests from the Eastern Alps, Western Carpathians, and the Bohemian Massif, which included 3, 569 relevØs of <b>spruce</b> <b>forests.</b> Phi coefficient of association was used to measure species fidelity, and species with the highest fidelities were considered as diagnostic. Diagnostic species were determined in four ways, including (A) comparison of <b>spruce</b> <b>forests</b> among the three mountain ranges, (B) comparison between <b>spruce</b> <b>forests</b> and other forests, performed separately in each of the mountain ranges, (C) simultaneous comparison of <b>spruce</b> <b>forests</b> of each of the mountain ranges with <b>spruce</b> <b>forests</b> of the other two ranges and with the other forests of all ranges, (D) comparison of <b>spruce</b> <b>forests</b> with the other forests, using pooled data sets from the three mountain ranges. The sets of diagnostic species of <b>spruce</b> <b>forests</b> yielded in comparisons A and B were sharply different; the set resulting from comparison C was intermediate between the first two and comparison D resulted in similar diagnostic species as comparison B.

25|$|Canaan Valley and {{surrounding}} areas were strongly {{impacted by the}} southward advance of glaciers some 15,000 years ago. Although the glaciers themselves did not extend into the area, this climatic change resulted in a very cool, moist environment that was forest-unfriendly. Later, as the ice receded, many cold-adapted plant species remained behind and survived due to the high elevation. Soon, however, this tundra-like vegetation was largely crowded out by the growth of an extraordinarily dense climax red <b>spruce</b> <b>forest,</b> intermixed with balsam fir and hardwoods.|$|E

Spruce seedlings were packed in, each requiring a bushel or two of soil, and by the 1940s a new <b>spruce</b> <b>forest</b> had been established on the slopes overlooking the Valley. In 1943–44, as part of the West Virginia Maneuver Area, the U.S. Army used the Canaan Valley area as a practice artillery and mortar range and maneuver area before troops were sent to European Theater of Operations to fight in World War II.|$|E

25|$|On 15 April 1945 the British Army liberated the Bergen-Belsen {{concentration}} camp, {{which was}} handed {{over by the}} SS guards without a fight. Diseases and the terrible unhygienic state of the concentration camp buildings caused the British Army to relocate the former inmates and eventually to burn the prisoner huts. The survivors of the concentration camp became the first residents of the future DP camp, which was around 2 kilometres from the main concentration camp area, in a former German Army barracks. Initially, the British medical staff used buildings in the former Panzertruppenschule (school for Panzer troops) as an emergency hospital to treat the former inmates away from the disastrous conditions of the concentration camp. On 21 April the first patients were moved to the new location, disinfected and issued with new clothing. This movement of people was completed by 18 May {{and at that point}} the former barracks had around 12,000 hospital beds. The British also moved the wounded German soldiers from the Wehrmacht Reservelazarett (reserve hospital, in a nearby <b>spruce</b> <b>forest)</b> to civilian hospitals and added the Reservelazarett to their hospital space. This raised the number of available beds by a further 1,600. Within the first four weeks almost 29,000 survivors from Belsen concentration camp were moved to the emergency hospital. Around 14,000 former inmates died after liberation despite the best efforts of the British Army, the British Red Cross and many others of various nationalities. By June 1945, around 11,000 of the former inmates still required emergency treatment.|$|E
