25|$|This message traffic, {{which was}} {{encrypted}} with a one-time pad system, was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy {{by hundreds of}} cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s. Due to a serious blunder {{on the part of}} the Soviets, some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers, as a result of pressures brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication—which undermines the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one-time system—was discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users. Despite this, the reuse was detected by cryptologists in the US.|$|E
25|$|Title {{insurance}} {{is available in}} many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, China, Korea and throughout Europe. However, while {{a substantial number of}} properties located in these countries are insured by U.S. title insurers, they do not constitute a significant share of the real estate transactions in those countries. They also do not constitute a large share of U.S. title insurers' revenues. In many cases these are properties to be used for commercial purposes by U.S. companies doing business abroad, or properties financed by U.S lenders. The U.S. companies involved buy title insurance to obtain the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> U.S. insurer backing up the evidence of title that they receive from the other country's land registration system, and payment of legal defense costs if the title is challenged.|$|E
25|$|In February 1965, North Melbourne {{moved its}} playing and {{training}} base from the Arden Street Oval to Coburg Oval, signing a seven-year lease with the City of Coburg after initially negotiating long-term leases {{for up to}} 40 years. The club came to an arrangement to merge with the VFA's Coburg Football Club, whom it was displacing from the ground; fourteen Coburg committeemen joined the North Melbourne committee, but the merger was never completed after Coburg established a rival committee which remained loyal to the VFA. The lease at Coburg lasted only eight months; the Coburg council was hesitant {{to build a new}} grandstand without the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long-term lease, and neither party made the returns they expected, so it was terminated by mutual agreement in September 1965 and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval.|$|E

500|$|John met {{the rebel}} leaders at Runnymede, a water-meadow {{on the south}} bank of the River Thames, on 10 June 1215.

Here the rebels presented John with their draft demands for reform, the 'Articles of the Barons'. Stephen Langton's pragmatic efforts at mediation over the next ten days turned these incomplete demands into a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; a few years later, this agreement was renamed Magna Carta, meaning [...] "Great Charter". By 15 June, general agreement had been made on a text, and on 19 June, the rebels renewed their oaths of loyalty to John and copies of the charter were formally issued.|$|E
