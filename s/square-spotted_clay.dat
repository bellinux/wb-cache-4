50|$|The <b>Square-spotted</b> <b>Clay</b> (Xestia stigmatica) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{is found}} in most of Europe, Transcaucasia, Caucasus, Kazachstan, {{northern}} Turkey and northern Iran.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} known as X. rhomboidea up to 1997. Since the taxonomic {{revision}} by Hacker in 1998, the name Xestia stigmatica is in use and was used by Fibiger & Skuhle in 2004 {{as well as on}} Fauna Europaea. The reason for the change is that Phalaena Noctua rhomboidea as described by Esper in 1790 is actually the Double Square-spot (X. triangulum), but Esper's name had been misapplied to the <b>Square-spotted</b> <b>Clay.</b>|$|E
