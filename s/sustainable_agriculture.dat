5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as <b>sustainable</b> <b>agriculture,</b> organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E
40|$|Food Security and Food Sovereignty {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues facing Food Policy. Maintaining productive farmland and sustainable farms as well as providing adequate volumes of foodstuffs have led to measures to protect farmland and farm activities in many countries. These include land use planning with agricultural zones and in some jurisdictions legislation to ‘protect’ agriculture in agricultural reserves. Are these tools adequate to maintain <b>sustainable</b> <b>agricultures</b> particularly around major urban and metropolitan centers. Agricultural zones and agricultural reserves in many jurisdictions have continued to experience removal of farmland in order to permit different types of urban development (e. g. residential development and industrial parks). An emerging response to this has been the integration of strategic development planning for agriculture in certain jurisdictions (e. g. the province of Quebec (Canada)), because this approach can integrate the necessary parameters to enable the development of <b>sustainable</b> <b>agricultures,</b> including how to respond to opportunities as well as adapting to emerging stressors. This approach also ideally requires the integration of farmers and their families as actors and participants in the strategic development planning process. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, <b>sustainable</b> <b>agriculture),</b> or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Sheep are an {{important}} part of the global agricultural economy. However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow. China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton. Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or <b>sustainable</b> <b>agriculture</b> and local food customers. Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade. Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.|$|E

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{narratives}} {{associated with the}} benefits of <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> areas in terms of {{adaptation to climate change}} in the Cape Town Metropolitan Area, South Africa. Urbanization and climate change are stressing urban areas in developing countries. Therefore, finding a development path towards "sustainable adaptation" remains a critical matter for humanity. Adaptation is sustainable only if it takes into consideration climate risks, while maximizing both social justice and environmental integrity. Urban agriculture is defined in this dissertation as the urban and peri-urban locations where agricultural practices, either the production of crops, livestock, or fish, utilize urban resources for the purpose of selling and consuming these goods produced locally, supporting the urban economy and providing a supply of food for urban citizens. <b>Sustainable</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> encompasses urban agricultural areas operating towards the satisfaction of human food, the preservation of environmental resources, the economic viability of agriculture and the enhancement of {{the quality of life of}} farmers, farm workers, and society. This research reviews the practices and views of urban agriculture stakeholders in Cape Town on <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> to determine if the practices of urban agriculture could be a part of a sustainable adaptation strategy. The methods used to answer this question included a systematic review of studies on urban agriculture worldwide since 1980, and a review of the urban agriculture and adaptation to climate change policies which are implemented at the metropolitan level, all supported and tested through interviews with key informants. Non-Government Organization (NGO) -based community farming initiatives such as Oranjezicht City Farm, Abalimi Bezekhaya or the ERF 81, independent farmers, municipal and provincial government representatives were interviewed. A critical discourse analysis method was utilized to analyze the findings. The study found that the narratives at the metropolitan level, including the policies and the views of governmental representatives, remains focused on the food security contribution whereas the practitioners' narrative expressed an interest in the economic opportunities and social benefits that <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> can bring, as stated by the literature on <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>agriculture.</b> The key practitioners and NGOs narratives suggest that <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> is contributing to the adaptive capacity of the farmers as they are using practices such as permaculture or organic farming, which allow them to cope with the impacts of climate variability and climate change. If sustainable farming practices were emphasized instead of farming practices towards small-scale, home-based activity to improve households' food security, the adaptation framework at the municipal and provincial level would be aligned with practitioners and NGOs narratives and would contribute to the sustainable adaptation capacity of the city. The recent shift within the City of Cape Town towards the broad concept of resilience could bridge the gap between current policy and practices, and informants' narratives, but it remains too soon for this to be tested. This study concludes suggesting that the analysis of the informants' and literature's narratives on <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> express potential to contribute to climate change adaptation and the reduction of vulnerability in Cape Town but alignment between policy and practitioners' needs, wants and actions needs to take place...|$|R
