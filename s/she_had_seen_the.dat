During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at 102.1 the edge, the Toronto radio station he worked at. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> band perform as Pezz, and {{he asked her to}} check out the band's {{performance}} at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by Warner Music Canada to work in A. This connection would get the band their producer Gavin Brown, and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called Atlantic Records A executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.|$|E

25|$|According to {{producer}} Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against The Deer Hunter {{was led by}} Warren Beatty, {{whose own}} picture Heaven Can Wait had multiple nominations. Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: Julie Christie, serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where Deer Hunter was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized The Deer Hunter in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The Deer Hunter for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted {{a friend of his}} in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>The</b> Deer Hunter. Fonda replied she had not seen the film, and to this day she still has not.|$|E

However, none of 30 Rocks producers have given Studio 60 any serious criticism, positive or negative.

While the poster depicts American actress Rita Hayworth as the Marvel Comics superheroine She-Hulk, the scene is a reference to the 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption, in which the main character escapes a prison by digging a tunnel in his wall behind a poster. One of the tapes that Bart and Milhouse watch shows Fred Rogers intoxicated.

500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too."

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation was undecided {{about whether the}} main point of the episode where Captain Archer is expected to lead the Vulcans back to their main path of logic was a [...] "wonderfully progressive concept or just regressive Trek in which humans have all the answers". She thought that the change in Soval's opinions in this episode was difficult to accept and that {{the other members of}} the main cast didn't get a great deal to do in the episode. However, whilst she thought that [...] "Awakening" [...] was a visual improvement over [...] "The Forge", she was reserving judgement until <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> third part of the trilogy. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that certain elements of the plot didn't follow logical paths, such as how Archer found the Kir'shara in a few minutes when apparently the Syrrannites had been looking for it for two years even though [...] "it sits in a chamber behind a door that practically announces, 'IMPORTANT RELIC INSIDE'?" [...] However, he called the episode entertaining and gave it a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn's second {{film was}} Christopher Strong (1933), {{the story of}} an aviator and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, but Hepburn's reviews were good. Regina Crewe wrote in the Journal American that {{although}} her mannerisms were grating, [...] "they compel attention, and they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive personality." [...] Hepburn's third picture confirmed her as a major actress in Hollywood. For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace—a role intended for Constance Bennett—in Morning Glory, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> script on the desk of producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, insisted that the role be hers. Hepburn chose not to attend the awards ceremony—as she would not for the duration of her career—but was thrilled with the win. Her success continued with the role of Jo in the film Little Women (1933). The picture was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest successes to date, and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival. Little Women was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was proud of her performance, later saying, [...] "I defy anyone to be as good [...] as I was".|$|E

Before details of the episode's plot were confirmed, Turner hoped that she would not be involved in it, deeming herself [...] "awful" [...] at performing live, unable to even deliver speeches. Neil McDermott feared that he would lose his composure and laugh during the broadcast, while Palmer hoped that the episode would not turn into a pantomime, commenting: [...] "I hope we're a bit more professional than that." [...] Simons stated that she was looking forward to the challenge the episode presented, though she would be happier once <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> script. Clements denied any apprehension, likening the performance to acting in theatre, and Nina Wadia stated that she was [...] "really looking forward to it", enjoying experiences with an [...] "adrenaline rush." [...] Once the script was released, Wadia was [...] "disappointed yet relieved" [...] to learn she did not have a speaking role, explaining: [...] "You want to be in it, but not to mess it up."

[...] He arrived with a small party which included James Penn of St Ann's in Aldersgate. [...] Inside the house, a member of the group positioned himself against the bed, but was asked by one of the ghost's sympathisers to move. [...] He refused, and following a brief argument the ghost's supporters left. [...] The gentleman then asked if Parsons would allow his daughter to be moved to a room at his house, but was refused. [...] For the remainder of the night the ghost made no sound, while Elizabeth Parsons, now extremely agitated, displayed signs of convulsions.

500|$|Maxie Proetta {{appeared}} on 22 September. He told the coroner {{that he had}} witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and {{he believed that the}} shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car {{he and his wife had}} seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to [...] "Death on the Rock"; she was no longer certain that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown. Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was [...] "a bit confused". The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.|$|E
