25|$|By 1908, a {{new record}} {{attendance}} of 50,261 was set, {{on a day when}} the crowd was so huge that it broke through the fence and filed onto the ground, <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> boundary line to watch the action. This figure was beaten in the 1912 Grand Final when 54,463 saw Essendon defeat South Melbourne. The big finals crowds (and increasing cricket attendances) prompted the MCC to cut down the eleven fifty-year-old elm trees inside the ground and turn the stadium into a concrete bowl, complete with extra stands and standing room. The record fell again in the last grand final before World War I, when the excitement of St Kilda's first premiership attempt drew 59,479 spectators.|$|E
25|$|Fassbinder's second film, Katzelmacher (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang {{term for}} a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was {{received}} more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at Mannheim. It features a group of rootless and bored young couples who {{spend much of their}} time in idle chatter, empty boasting, drinking, playing cards, intriguing or simply <b>sitting</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> arrival of Jorgos, a guest worker from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity {{on the part of the}} women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich. This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder's oeuvre. Katzelmacher was adapted from Fassbinder's first produced play – a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.|$|E
500|$|The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), {{demonstrated}} {{a change in}} direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, {{who had worked with}} Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions ended up providing the context for the album itself. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by [...] "the whole idea of the old men <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fire, passing on...legends and fables to the grandchildren".|$|E

50|$|In 1914 Russell {{released}} an eight-hour-long film, The Photo-Drama of Creation, that attempted to portray chronologically {{the history of}} the world from creation to the millennial reign of Christ. The film, accompanied by a gramophone soundtrack, was screened for free in two four-hour <b>sittings</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, attracting more than 1.2 million patrons in Britain in 1914 alone. The cost of the production and screenings was so high it created financial difficulties for the society, but by Russell's death it was reported that the film had been seen by more than nine million people.|$|R
5000|$|... "All {{the vocal}} tracks slot in neatly around jigs, reels, polkas and hornpipes that blend immaculately {{together}} {{with the help of}} a relaxed production that creates the impression of a bunch of mates <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> in <b>the</b> kitchen making sweet, sweet music." ...|$|R
2500|$|Elio Di Rupo, the {{president}} of the PS, sharply criticized the duration of the negotiations. [...] "Three months on from the election, they're not even <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> negotiation table. This has never happened before". He continued, [...] "If we would have participated in the talks, negotiations would never have been derailed". Di Rupo also called the talks a [...] "guerilla war" [...] rather than negotiations.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{successful}} Stanley Cup winning campaign with the Pittsburgh Penguins where he scored 10 goals and 22 {{points in the}} playoffs, he was left off the American roster of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Following the elimination of Team USA after a 4-2 loss to Team Canada, Kessel tweeted [...] "Just <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house tonight w my dog. Felt like I should be doing something important, but couldn't {{put my finger on}} it." [...] This was interpreted by several Team USA players and personnel, including Dean Lombardi, John Tortorella, David Backes, Zach Parise, and Derek Stepan as Kessel jabbing following his snub. Kessel stated that his comments were not directed at anyone, and that he didn't mean any disrespect towards anyone.|$|E
2500|$|Around noon, a North Vietnamese tank {{crashed through}} {{the gates of the}} Independence Palace. When the {{communist}} troops entered the Independence Palace in Saigon, they found Minh and his cabinet <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> big oval table in the cabinet room, waiting for them. As they entered, Minh said [...] "The revolution is here. You are here." [...] He added, [...] "We have been waiting for you so that we could turn over the government." [...] The ranking North Vietnamese officer, Colonel Bùi Tín replied, [...] "There is no question of your transferring power. Your power has crumbled. You cannot give up what you do not have." [...] Later in the afternoon, he went on radio again and said, [...] "I declare the Saigon government is completely dissolved at all levels." ...|$|E

50|$|The séances {{featured}} in the film have some atypical elements. Skulls are set on the séance table and skeletons are <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> it. <b>The</b> sound effects and floating trumpet would not be {{out of place in}} 19th-century séance, though the electronically altered voice of the deceased is a far more recent element.|$|R

2500|$|Another similar Memling {{work is the}} [...] held at the Louvre, which Georges Hulin de Loo {{determined}} to have been completed earlier than the St John Altarpiece and the New York panel. The Cellier Diptych has the Virgin and Child in an enclosed garden with the same two Saints Catherine and Barbara on the left-hand panel. The composition is remarkably similar to the New York panel and the altarpiece, with the Virgin on her throne and St Catherine and St Barbara positioned to form a triangle. The Cellier Diptych includes four additional female saints (with attributes) <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Virgin: St Agnes, St Cecilia, St Lucy, and St Margaret. Three musical angels hover above. The opposite right-hand panel, which at one time was separated, shows the donor, Jan Cellier, with John the Baptist and John the Evangelist.|$|E
2500|$|However, the North Vietnamese {{were in an}} {{overwhelmingly}} dominant position, and {{were not interested in}} a peaceful transfer of power. PAVN T-54/55 tanks under the command of Colonel Bùi Tín burst through the gates of the Independence Palace around noon. They found Minh and 30 of his advisors <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> big oval table in the cabinet room, waiting for them. As they entered, Minh said [...] "The revolution is here. You are here." [...] He added, [...] "We have been waiting for you so that we could turn over the government." [...] Tín curtly replied, [...] "There is no question of your transferring power. Your power has crumbled. You cannot give up what you do not have." [...] Later that afternoon, Minh went on the radio for the final time and announced, [...] "I declare [...] the Saigon government is completely dissolved at all levels." [...] The Vietnam War was over.|$|E
2500|$|Brown is a Christian. He says, I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian, that I {{believe in}} the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the Bible every day. I'm still me. I'm still a guy doing a job. I find, actually, that people ask me a lot about it. I don't hit people {{over the head with}} the Bible ... I still feel a funny little tinge in my stomach when I'm out to dinner with my wife and {{daughter}} in New York. We'll go to dinner and we'll be <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table and we'll say Grace. You know what? People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that. Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he [...] "could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance" [...] adding that he's now [...] "searching for a new belief system." ...|$|E

6000|$|Both men felt rebuked and {{the group}} again settled into silence. Suddenly, Kate began to laugh, [...] "Isn't it childish?

60|$|But Diana and {{her small}} fry, the Echo Lodge {{people and the}} Allans, had stayed to help the two old ladies over the {{loneliness}} of the first evening; and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper time, <b>sitting</b> long <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table and chatting over {{all the details of}} the day. While they were sitting there Anne and Gilbert were alighting from the train at Glen St. Mary.|$|R

5000|$|Jones {{played two}} seasons in Houston (joining his brother Major on the Rockets squad), one in Chicago, four in Portland, {{and one in}} San Antonio. Primarily he was a reserve, called upon to spell the {{starting}} center, grab some rebounds, and play some defense. [...] "I'm like a spare tire on the Cadillac", he told USA Today in the twilight of his career. [...] "I'm just <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> in <b>the</b> trunk, waiting to get put on the car {{if one of the}} fancy tires blows out".|$|R
50|$|Elonzo was an {{independent}} rock band based out of Rock Hill, South Carolina area. In {{the heart of}} the Carolina Piedmont, they wrote songs about everyday life: <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> on <b>the</b> front porch, watching the train go by, loss of loved ones, childhood, their hometown and their dreams. Elonzo’s music represents some of the most classic elements of the Southeastern United States: earnestness, good story-telling, and an awareness of tragedy that never seems too far <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner. The band's sound can transform from stripped alt-country to a richer, more expansive vision that reflects the meaningfulness of the ties that bind us together. Mostly, it sounds like rock and roll.|$|R
50|$|Following {{an audit}} in 2005, {{the former mayor}} of Gap, Pierre Bernard-Reymond, formed a {{committee}} to discuss a new arena. In July 2007, the new arena was announced by Roger Didier. The project involves extending the existing ice rink {{and the creation of a}} complex of trails. The Patinoire Brown-Ferrand will be redesigned and enlarged, with the capacity increased to 2000 instead of 1800 seats, with spectators <b>sitting</b> all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ice.|$|R
60|$|When Duane got {{beyond the}} line of mesquite, which had hid {{a good view of}} the camp-site, he saw a group of perhaps fifteen rangers <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fires, near a long low shed where horses were feeding, and a small adobe house at one side.|$|E
60|$|Werner and {{his cronies}} had passed into the woods, and now were making their way down a {{hillside}} into a hollow where they had built a fair-sized campfire.

60|$|The hour {{we spent}} <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> camp-fire {{was the most}} {{pleasant}} of that night, though I {{did not know it}} then. The smell of wood-smoke and the glow of live coals stirred memories of other camp-fires. I was once more enveloped by the sweetness and peace of the open, listening to the sigh of the wind, and the faint tinkle of bells on the hobbled horses.|$|E
2500|$|Voschev, {{a machine}} factory worker, is berated by {{management}} for <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> on <b>the</b> job.

60|$|It {{was nearly}} dark that afternoon, {{and they were}} all <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> kitchen fire, the three {{seafaring}} men smoking, and Mrs. Trimmer greatly enjoying it.

60|$|Whether this {{narration}} were exaggerated or not, it {{is certain}} that the old man Downey every succeeding night of the performance was a spectator. That he may have aspired to more than that was suggested a day or two later in the following incident: A number of the boys were <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> stove in the Magnolia saloon, listening to the onset of a winter storm against the windows, when Whisky Dick, tremulous, excited, and bristling with rain-drops and information, broke in upon them.|$|E
60|$|If Steve's {{face was}} {{unpleasant}} to look upon, the nonchalant, tiger-like poise and flex {{of his body}} was not. He had been dancing, it seemed, and had thrown off his coat, and as he talked he repeatedly rolled his blue shirt-sleeves {{up and down as}} though the motion were habitual to him. Most of the men were <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room looking on and laughing at Steve's antics, and the antics of one or two others who were just drunk enough to make fools of themselves. Two or three sat on an old billiard table under the window through which John was peering.|$|E

5000|$|Ordeal in the Arctic was {{considered}} a typical [...] "made-for-TV" [...] production, although it {{had the advantage of}} covering a story that had recently been in the news.
