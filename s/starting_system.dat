40|$|The {{classical}} Theorem of Bezout yields {{an upper}} {{bound for the}} number of finite solutions to a given polynomial system, but is very often too large to be useful {{for the construction of a}} <b>start</b> <b>system,</b> for the solution of a polynomial system by means of homotopy continuation. The BKK bound gives a much lower upper bound {{for the number of}} solutions, but unfortunately, constructing a <b>start</b> <b>system</b> based on this bound seems as hard as solving the original given polynomial system. This paper presents a way for computing an upper bound together with the construction of a <b>start</b> <b>system.</b> The first computation is performed symbolically.

50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary <b>starting</b> <b>system</b> {{used the}} {{transmission input shaft}} and clutch hub to connect the kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then {{to engage the clutch}} before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary <b>starting</b> <b>system,</b> the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the clutch lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Starters are {{mechanisms}} {{that are used}} for generating the working fluid for initial rotation of LPE (Liquid Propellant Engines) turbopumps. The function of the <b>start</b> <b>system</b> is preparation of initial power for starting a turbine. This turbine {{is attached to the}} fuel and oxidizer pumps. When these pumps work in a suitable case, the required power of turbine, is prepared from another source (gas generator) and then there is not need to starter operation. A solid propellant starter is a solid propellant motor that instead of thrust, momentum of its exit gases is used for rotating the turbine. The values of power and operating time of starter, are specified from downstream conditions of the <b>start</b> <b>system.</b> Generally, the type and efficiency of turbine and pumps, propellant rate and density, control mechanisms in the path of propellant and etc, are determinant of these values. In this type of <b>start</b> <b>system,</b> gases due to combustion, pass through a convergent-divergent nozzle and enter the turbine and rotate it. In this paper, with due consideration to the role and importance of <b>start</b> <b>system</b> in the process of LPE operation, in order to better recognition of present phenomena in this system, the flow due to combustion in a <b>start</b> <b>system</b> that uses solid propellant, has been simulated via solving the navier-stokes equations. These equations have been expressed in the form of time-dependent, axisymmetric, compressible and viscous and have been solved by means of finite volume methods in company with continuity and energy equations. For finite volume methods the domain is divided up into a number of control volumes, with the value at the centre of the control volume being held to be representative for the value over the entire control volume. By integrating the PDEs over the control volume the equations are cast into a form that ensure conservation...|$|R
