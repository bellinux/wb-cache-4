And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

In his diary, Manning described Climbié as Satan, and said that no matter how hard he hit her, she did not cry or show signs that she was hurt. On 12 January 2001, both were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> [...] "what Victoria endured was truly unimaginable.

500|$|On April 28, 2008, Beghe posted online {{a letter}} to Church leader David Miscavige, {{requesting}} the confidential confessional files that Scientology compiles during Auditing sessions. In a message posted to the Operation Clambake website, Beghe wrote: [...] "As the Church of Scientology carefully monitors all anti-scientology websites, I am posting the letter here, on xenu.net, to assure that it be received by the C of S." [...] He had previously contacted the President's Office at The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International who [...] "refused to directly respond" [...] to his request, and {{a letter to}} David Miscavige sent through the Church communication system was also refused. Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are also kept on actor Tom Cruise {{as well as other}} celebrity Scientologists. [...] "More people have left Scientology than are currently in it. And yet they maintain these files about what people have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in private sessions. Why would you want these people to hold onto this stuff?" [...] said Beghe to The Village Voice. Beghe believes that Scientology's practice of disconnection is still in place, and in an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice cited his four-year-old son being kicked out of a Scientology school as an example of disconnection.|$|E
