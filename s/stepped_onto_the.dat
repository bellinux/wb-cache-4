25|$|The actual {{night of}} the moon {{landings}} on 20/21 July was also historic for British TV, {{as it was the}} first-ever all-night broadcast on British television, with both BBC1 and ITV remaining on air for 11 hours from 11.30 p.m. on 20 July to 10.30 a.m. the following morning.

25|$|Minnesota {{got off to}} a bad {{start and}} never recovered. After the opening kickoff, Collins led the Giants 74 yards in just four plays, {{throwing}} a 46-yard touchdown pass to Hilliard to give them a 7–0 lead less than two minutes into the game. Then Giants defensive back Lyle West recovered a fumble from kick returner Moe Williams on the Vikings 18-yard line and Collins capitalized with an 18-yard touchdown pass to fullback Greg Comella on the next play, giving New York a 14–0 lead before the Vikings offense had even <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> field. Minnesota eventually got a chance to score when defensive back Robert Tate intercepted a pass from Collins and returned it to the Giants 37-yard line. But Culpepper soon returned the favor with a pass that was intercepted in the end zone by Emmanuel McDaniel. Collins threw another interception on New York's following drive, this one to Don Morgan on the Vikings 12-yard line. However, Minnesota could not advance the ball, and Mitch Berger's 26-yard punt gave the Giants great field position on the Minnesota 41-yard line. Collins then threw a 22-yard pass to Amani Toomer that set up a Brad Daluiso field goal on the first play of the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|The game {{included}} {{one of the}} most bizarre plays of the football season. ASU’s Rudy Carpenter fumbled the ball as ASU was close to scoring a touchdown.

500|$|An opening {{ceremony}} was held, {{prior to the}} match. At {{the start of the}} event, cheerleading girls dressed in pom-pom clothing <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> football pitch to entertain the crowd; the routine also featured a small number of Danish–Turkish girls from a local school, performing a folk dance display containing Turkish elements. The act was succeeded by an appearance from Danish pop singer and actor Stig Rossen, who sang an alternative version of the notable song [...] "Wonderful Copenhagen". Prince Joachim of Denmark, the youngest of Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik's two children, welcomed the {{opening ceremony}} by making a short speech to all the seated spectators in the stadium.|$|E
500|$|Jardine divided opinion {{among those}} with whom he played. He could be charming and witty or {{ruthless}} and harsh, while many people who knew him believed him to be innately shy. David Frith describes him as a complex figure who could change moods quickly. Although he could be friendly off the field, he became hostile and determined once he <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> field. At his memorial service, he was described by Hubert Ashton as being [...] "provocative, austere, brusque, shy, humble, thoughtful, kindly, proud, sensitive, single-minded and possessed of immense moral and physical courage," [...] and Frith argues that these varied qualities are easily proven by what was said about him.|$|E

The closing step may be done directly beside the other foot, or obliquely beside, or even crossed, {{as long as the}} closing foot does not go past the other foot.|$|R
500|$|Six days later, between 250,000 and 350,000 people {{gathered}} {{in front of}} the Casa Rosada, Argentina's government house, to demand Juan Perón's release, and their wish was granted. At 11 pm, Juan Perón <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> balcony of the Casa Rosada and addressed the crowd. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was very powerful because it was very dramatic and recalled many important aspects of Argentine history. Crassweller writes that Juan Perón enacted the role of a caudillo addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders Rosas and Yrigoyen. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained [...] "mystic overtones" [...] of a [...] "quasi-religious" [...] nature.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero World Tour has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, many making comparisons {{between it and}} the Rock Band series. [...] 1UP noted that while World Tour is not as good a [...] "party game" [...] as Rock Band, the game still provides [...] "great peripherals and fun-to-play music" [...] and delivers what the player should expect. [...] GameTrailers stated that [...] "another viable challenger has <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> stage." [...] IGN's review was lukewarm, noting that [...] "A number of things it tries to accomplish were already done better in Rock Band", but stated that the game would be a good [...] "stepping point" [...] for the next iteration of the series.|$|E
500|$|Having {{stepped aside}} from the {{majority}} of his Star Trek duties, Roddenberry sought instead to create a film based on Asimov's [...] "I, Robot" [...] and also began work on a Tarzan script for National General Pictures. After initially requesting a budget of $2 million and being refused, Roddenberry made cuts to reduce costs to $1.2 million. When he learned they were being offered only $700,000 to shoot the film, which by now was being called a TV movie, he canceled the deal. Meanwhile, NBC announced Star Trek's cancellation in February 1969. A similar but much smaller letter-writing campaign followed news of the cancellation. Because of {{the manner in which the}} series was sold to NBC, it left the production company $4.7 million in debt. The last episode of Star Trek aired 47 days before Neil Armstrong <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission, and Roddenberry declared that he would never write for television again.|$|E
5000|$|The Shag Basic: (from the lead's {{point of}} view) Beat 1: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> left foot, beat 2: HOP on left, beat 3: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> right foot, beat 4: HOP on right, beat 5: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> left foot, and beat 6: <b>STEP</b> <b>onto</b> right foot. <b>The</b> {{movement}} during beats 5 and 6 {{is often described}} as a shuffling motion. As mentioned above, this is usually broken down verbally as [...] "slow, slow; quick, quick" [...] where the 'slows' cover two beats (or 'counts') each and the 'quicks' mark a single beat (or 'count') each. Hence, for the lead this would be two counts with the weight on the left leg while the right leg moves, two counts with weight on the right leg while the left leg moves, followed by a quick <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> left and then a quick <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> right.

500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
500|$|At 36 {{years old}} and {{approaching}} {{the end of his}} career, the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs was potentially his last chance at winning the Stanley Cup. The Flames defeated the Vancouver Canucks, Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks to set up a Stanley Cup Final rematch of the 1986 Final with the Montreal Canadiens. McDonald was left out of the Flames' lineup for the third, fourth and fifth games, but with Calgary leading the series three wins to two, head coach Terry Crisp felt that if the Flames were to win the championship, McDonald deserved to be in the game. [...] Crisp's decision paid dividends, as midway through the sixth game, McDonald <b>stepped</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ice after serving a penalty to join Håkan Loob and Joe Nieuwendyk in a three-on-one rush toward the Montreal goal. [...] Loob passed the puck up to Nieuwendyk, who saw a streaking McDonald coming up {{the right side of the}} ice. [...] McDonald received the pass then shot the puck over Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy's glove to give the Flames a 2–1 lead. Doug Gilmour added two goals, and Calgary won the game 4–2 to earn the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship. League president John Ziegler presented the trophy to McDonald, co-captain Jim Peplinski and alternate Tim Hunter. [...] Wearing the captain's [...] "C" [...] for the game, McDonald was the first member of the Flames to carry the trophy as the team paraded it around the Forum in celebration.|$|E
