25|$|In {{a bid to}} stem declining sales, a 2-seat economy {{version of}} the Minicar was {{introduced}} in October 1964, the Bond 250 G Tourer. This basically used the saloon car body, but with a larger rear deck incorporating an opening boot lid, a folding hood, new fibreglass bonnet, plain door panels, no chrome <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and non-opening quarter lights. In standard form it came with the 35A engine, but the <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and 4T engine were available as an option.|$|E
25|$|The Caprice {{models were}} renamed to Caprice Classic for the 1973 model year. The Kingswood Estate model with {{simulated}} wood-grain body <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> was now named the Caprice Estate. The convertible was {{moved from the}} Impala to the Caprice lineup {{for the first time}} in 1973.|$|E
25|$|V200 <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> {{reverted to}} the 1960 concept, {{following}} the tailfin crease and lower body break crease. However, the 1962 trim was more massive and contained an oblong triple-window effect {{at the rear}} of the body break crease. On Signets, the front fenders had an open-centred double spear, connected at the front and back, within which was contained a secondary body paint colour.|$|E

The roof hatches on these locomotives {{were made from}} aluminium. The overall colour scheme for the 3500 class matched the 3100 class with orange fronts, green <b>side</b> <b>trims</b> and high polished stainless steel sides. Body length was 19.38 metres ...|$|R
25|$|The team kit for the 2009-10 {{season was}} {{produced}} by Reebok. The home kit was changed to a black and yellow vertically striped shirt with black shorts and socks. The away kit features black sleeves with yellow trim on a white background, while the shorts are white with a yellow and black <b>side</b> <b>trim,</b> with white socks. Sony renewed its contract with the Wellington Phoenix and remained the club's major sponsor.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} V70 was an improved {{development on the}} basis of the Volvo 850 estate. Overall design became more rounded doing away with the 850's square edges. Among the many changes were a completely revised front end, fully painted bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and clear indicator lenses all around. Most of the interior was redesigned, with new seats, door panels and dashboard. According to Volvo a total of 1800 changes were made.|$|E
25|$|For 1958, Chevrolet {{models were}} {{redesigned}} longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors, {{and the first}} ever production Chevrolet big block V8, the , was now an option. The Bel Air gained a halo vehicle in 1958, the Impala, available only as a hardtop coupe and convertible in its introductory year. Impala styling followed the basic lines of the other Chevrolet models but received special styling cues including a different roof line, a vent above the rear window, unique <b>side</b> <b>trim,</b> and triple tail lights housed in slightly broader alcoves. For the budget conscious, the Biscayne, (formerly the 210) and the Delray (formerly the 150) completed this model year's family-oriented and utility offerings.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{with this}} generation, each model of Taurus {{received}} different exterior trim. The lowest level Taurus L had light grey plastic mirrors and window trim, while the bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> were also light grey. The GL, the mid priced model, got chrome window trim and body color mirrors, while still retaining the grey bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> The top-of-the-line LX model had its bumpers color keyed, {{as well as}} having the grey <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> replaced with color keyed body cladding. 1992 L and GL models (and the Mercury Sable GS) could also be ordered with a two-tone paint job, in which instead of being grey, the bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> were painted a slightly darker shade of the vehicle's body color. [...] To cut costs, this was discontinued for the 1993 model year, as all models received color-matched trim and bumpers from that year onward.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1995–1996 {{season the}} red undershirt {{was reduced to}} a T-shirt size and only visible above the overshirts collar. The hat {{insignia}} was changed to the stylized 'P' and sock colour was reversed so that socks were now primarily red with white foot and <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> Juniors were changed to a red instead of white base to the uniform and the word [...] "Padres" [...] was changed to white.|$|E
50|$|Built in {{the middle}} of the 19th century the manor house {{appearance}} is partially linked to the neo-gothic style. Today it visibly displays classical forms. Rebuilding of the structure resulted in the loss of its original appearance and proportions. There are a lot of very valuable interior components in the manor, such as furnaces, the heating systems, wood <b>siding,</b> <b>trim</b> and stair railings, iron balcony railings and pillars.|$|R

50|$|From May 1975 {{overdrive}} and {{tinted glass}} were standard. In addition, all Sprints were fitted with body <b>side</b> <b>trims,</b> a plastic surround for the gearlever, and a driver's door mirror. Headrests were now available as an optional extra. From March 1976 headrests, a radio, and laminated windscreen were standard. In 1978, laminated windscreens became a standard fitment and in 1980, {{to comply with}} UK legislation, twin rear fog lamps were also standard.|$|R
2500|$|The single-seat Kittiwake I {{monoplane}} {{was designed}} for sports flying and as a glider tug. It is an all-metal aircraft, with low [...] cantilever wings of parallel chord built around a single spar carrying 5° of dihedral. NACA single slotted flaps occupy {{the whole of the}} trailing edge inboard of the ailerons. The wings attach to a centre section which is integral with the fuselage, a feature intended to help construction in a small space like a garage. [...] The straight tapered fin carries a horn balanced rudder and the constant chord tailplane has a starboard <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> tab.|$|E
2500|$|The 1970 Riviera was restyled. Exposed quad {{headlamps}} {{were nearly}} flush-mounted, {{while the new}} front bumper wrapped around and over the new vertical bar grille, set between the headlamp pods. A newly optional <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> feature accented the large coupe's flowing lines. Skirted rear wheels became standard, with exposed wheels an option. At the rear, a new rear bumper/taillight motif was seen. The engine was upgraded to , the largest engine Buick offered to date, rated at [...] gross, [...] net, and over [...] of torque. Despite the fact that 1970 sales dropped to 37,366, the second-generation Riviera proved more successful than the first, with 227,669 units sold over five seasons.|$|E
2500|$|The SCXY 1363 is now {{black with}} a yellow cab face and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> (separated by a red stripe), recalling the Northern Pacific Railway paint scheme {{commonly}} found on later NPRY diesels (shortly before the 1970 BN merger). The words [...] "St. Croix Valley" [...] are visible on the long hood. The paint scheme was previously green with yellow striping. [...] SCXY 1352, an EMD GP8, is also painted {{in the same fashion}} as SCXY 1363. [...] In 2014 in the line added two SD40M-2's (SD45 bodies). SCXY 1326 and then SCXY 1325 were aqquired to help with additional traffic. Both engines were painted into the SCXY paint scheme by the WSOR paint shops in Horicon Wisconsin.|$|E
5000|$|Farfalle come {{in several}} sizes, {{but they all}} have a {{distinctive}} [...] "bow tie" [...] shape. Usually, the farfalle are formed from a rectangle or oval of pasta, {{with two of the}} <b>sides</b> <b>trimmed</b> to a ruffled edge and the center pinched together to make the unusual shape of the pasta. A ridged version of the pasta is known as farfalle rigate. Though usable with most sauces, farfalle are best suited to cream and tomato sauces.|$|R
5000|$|The Gentry was {{a limited}} edition 205, {{although}} arguably not a GTI model {{as it used}} a detuned [...] 1.9 litre engine with auto gearbox. Only 300 models were made in Sorrento Green and Aztec Gold (sometimes called Mayfair Beige). They came with full-leather and real wood trim, power assisted steering, ABS and heated mirrors. The Gentry came with the same body <b>side</b> <b>trims</b> as the GTI, {{which led to the}} Gentry often being mistaken for a GTI.|$|R
5000|$|One type {{of passive}} trimmer uses a {{pressure}} chamber to enable resistor trimming in a single run. The LTCC boards are contacted by test probes on the assembly <b>side</b> and <b>trimmed</b> with a laser beam from the resistor <b>side.</b> This <b>trimming</b> method requires no contact points between the resistances, because the fine pitch adapter contacts the component {{on the opposite side}} of where the trimming occurs. Therefore, the LTCC can be arranged more compactly and less expensively.|$|R
2500|$|Minor styling changes {{took place}} again in 1969, with grilles gaining {{a pattern of}} finely spaced, slim {{vertical}} bars overlaid by two wider horizontal bars, which jutted forward at their inboard edges. Front marker lights became far shorter, and square. Inside, front outboard passengers received new headrests. [...] The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and locked {{the steering wheel and}} selector lever when the key was removed (a security feature which became mandatory for the 1970 model year). [...] Chrome <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> was revised, as well. At the rear, the reverse lights moved from the rear bumper to new three-section tail-light lenses. Sales for 1969 improved again, to 52,872.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950 Imperial was {{essentially}} a New Yorker with a custom interior. It had a Cadillac-style grille treatment that included circular signal lights enclosed in a wraparound ribbed chrome piece. <b>Side</b> <b>trim</b> was similar to last year's model, but the front fender strip ended at the front doors and the rear fender molding was at the tire top level and integrated into the stone guard. Unlike the standard Imperial, the Imperial Crown had a side treatment in which the rear fender moldings and stone guard were separate. Body sill moldings were used on all Imperials, but were of a less massive type on the more massive Crown models. A special version of the limousine was available. It featured a unique leather interior and a leather-covered top that blacked out the rear quarter windows. Power windows were standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E
2500|$|For 1961, new 2-door {{sedan and}} hardtop models were released, but no {{changes were made}} to the 4-door sedan and wagon sheet metal. The {{interior}} and exterior trim were changed to provide model year differentiation, a mild form of planned obsolescence. The radiator grille stamping was the same as in 1960, but for 1961 it was painted with a pattern of black squares. The central grille ornament was still pulled from the bottom to release the hood, but it was now faced with an emblem having a white field with the blue-and-red stylized [...] "V" [...] Valiant logo, rather than 1960's red field with gold script [...] "Valiant" [...] callout. The <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> was changed; a [...] stainless spear was placed at the rear of each tailfin crease, a hockey stick-shaped trim was applied to the lower break line, and the front fender/door crease was capped with a long stainless spear. The tailfins were each topped with three transverse chrome strips, and a large horizontal emblem containing a round plastic [...] "V200" [...] callout was centered in the deck lid's spare-tire stamping. Matching round [...] "V200" [...] callouts were placed in round housings at the midpoint of the front fender spears. Inside the car, the instrument cluster was largely carried over, but 1960's black gauges with white callouts gave way to 1961's white gauges with black callouts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} labeled [...] "barely watchable" [...] by DVD Verdict, which {{concluded}} [...] "There's very little redeemable about Don't Open Till Christmas, but for exploitation die-hards, Dick Randall's productions are always worth watching {{for a lot}} of blood, sex, and a few laughs". Hysteria Lives! gave Don't Open Till Christmas a one and a half out of five, writing [...] "Words can hardly begin to say how truly bad this movie is!

50|$|MU-7 Platinum models {{commenced}} {{on market}} by 1 November. Frontal changed a bit by platinum tone. Revamped fenders and <b>side</b> <b>trims</b> (by lower tone). But emphasized much in inner accessories. Such as new DVD/VCD/MP3/DiVX player with 2 USB slots via 2 units of 8.1' touch-screen (one at console {{and one at}} second row ceiling), built-in Bluetooth and Graphic Equalizer function. All this applied to highline Primo and Activo models. All models also received platinum painted engines. MOVE suspension for Activo and Primo also retooled. S model receives automatic transmission as optional.|$|R
2500|$|The {{downturn}} of the Mexican economy {{early in}} 1982 {{and a government}} decree banning the importation of [...] "luxury" [...] automotive accessories hit the country's auto industry. The 1982 VAM Gremlin returned as a slightly consolidated model. Both trim levels incorporated amber front parking lights and the AMC square pattern grille design {{that was used in}} U.S. domestic Eagle models. The base model incorporated chromed headlight bezels with blacked out internal areas while the X model were completely blacked out as also was the hood trim molding. The [...] I6 was upgraded {{for the first time since}} 1976, receiving a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio and net output of [...] at 4000rpm. This was achieved through a new head design that incorporated smaller spark plug outlets and a plastic valve cover. The A904 model automatic transmission was replaced in favor of the A998 model with wider gear ratios. The base model was similar to the prior year's except for new <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> and front end design. The X model saw the return of side decals the form of four thin stripes starting at the base of the B-pillar trim molding running all the way to the front edge of the fenders near the marker lights. A new silver [...] "GX" [...] decal appeared between the rear window and the right side tail light. For some reason, the sports steering wheel was replaced by the base design. The model was restricted to a three-speed automatic transmission with the novelty of the AMX/GT's console-type shifter boot and the rear differential changed to a [...] 3.07:1 ratio as used the year before with the now-unavailable four-speed manual.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953 the Imperial {{model was}} renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, {{it had a}} {{different}} wheelbase, taillights, and <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the [...] "ordinary" [...] Chryslers. This {{was also the first}} year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment electric windows, electric division window, floor level courtesy lamps, rear compartment heater, fold-up footrests, seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On March 10, 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan. The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase [...] longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was about the only thing new on the 1953 [...] Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders. Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system) and Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, called PowerFlite, became available late in the model year, being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns. Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one. A padded dash was standard.|$|E
