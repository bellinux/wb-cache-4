5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{commented that}} she had co-written the track during summer 2013; she sings [...] "10 years old without a voice / I feel like nothing's really changed / Now I'm just a little older" [...] during the second verse, which she {{revealed}} {{was inspired by a}} two-year period in which she did not speak because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had had nothing to offer.|$|E
500|$|In My Life So Far, Fonda {{stated that}} she {{considers}} patriarchy to {{be harmful to}} men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were [...] "anti-male". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she [...] "still loves men", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.|$|E

500|$|Aki Ross's voice actor, Ming-Na Wen, was {{selected}} for a perceived fit between her personality and Aki's. Ming-Na, who found the role via her publicist, said <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had given birth with her voice to the character. She gradually accustomed herself {{to the difficulty of}} working without the presence and spontaneity of real actors, and commented that the voice-acting work did not take much time, as she would just go into the studio [...] "once or twice a month for about four months" [...] with no need for make-up and costuming sessions. The workload was so light it did not interfere with her acting commitments in the television series ER.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} show was set in Miami, filming took place at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Stock {{exterior}} shots of Miami {{were used for the}} opening credits and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a multiple-camera setup, with each episode last roughly 20 to 22 minutes excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with Billboard, she explained that while filming the first season <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> [...] "just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it's just a different world". Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the [...] "certain beats you have to learn", Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was Chip Fields, who visited the show's set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with Grazia, she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: [...] "I was the youngest person on set and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I look back and wish I was more dedicated. But I learned from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Byrd had no history of drug {{addiction}} or abuse and no criminal record, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> {{had no choice but}} to agree to drug court supervision or go to prison.

50|$|Gennie soon becomes {{close to}} her father and his family, {{although}} her half-sister Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) is initially resentful of her presence and the attention she gets from Shadrach. Gennie tries to prove she is a true Dingle, and finally does so when she steals a client from Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell), making money in the process. She also helps Eli and their cousin Sam (James Hooton) burn down Pollard's factory. After growing close to Eli, they share a kiss but he tells her {{that he is not}} attracted to her and she insists she isn't attracted to him. Soon, Gennie moves in with the Dingles, which upsets her adoptive mother, Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop), who is concerned about Gennie not having a job and her change in character. Chas convinces Brenda that Gennie is working at the vets, and for a short time, she does work there. On her way to a call out, Gennie runs over and kills a sheep. She and Eli are arrested for stealing the vet’s drugs, but are released when the locum vet, Josh, explains that she was taking the drugs to the farm. After this incident, her mother again tries to persuade her to come home, but Gennie refuses, saying <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> fitted in with the Dingles.|$|R
2500|$|According to Lopez, she {{initially}} didn't want [...] "Jenny {{from the}} Block" [...] or [...] "All I Have" [...] {{to be released}} as singles from the album. She felt that the tracks were too similar to her previous singles such as [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] and [...] "I'm Real"; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "visiting old territory". [...] "Those tracks were like a different era for me, and I didn't want people to perceive it like I'm just trying {{to capitalize on the}} same thing. But the record company was like, 'Who cares what they think, those are hits mama!'". Lopez, who stated she [...] "calls the shots", eventually agreed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crew of the}} A300 and the GIGN forces {{received}} high national honours.

[...] Bernard Delhemme returned to flying and worked for Air France for nine years before retiring. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard said that she [...] "kept seeing the faces" [...] of the three passengers who had been executed; when she received her medal she realised that she had helped save 173 people; this allowed her to mourn and get over the incident. Burgniard said {{that she does not}} wear the medal, but that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> deserved it. Burgniard, who also received a message of thanks from the airline, never again worked for Air France. Flight attendant Christophe Morin stopped working for Air France and began to work for a charitable organisation.|$|E

[...] During yet another interview with Radio.com backstage at the CBS Radio We Can Survive concert at the Hollywood Bowl on 24 October 2014, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Ellie Goulding and after meeting several times she was approached by Goulding about a song that would become [...] "Heavy Crown", recalling [...] "she played it for me and I was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration," [...] because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] Most notably, the track shows off an edgier side of Goulding, whose voice Azalea called [...] "unique and ethereal sounding." [...] "She loved it because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> doesn't do things that are as aggressive as our song together," [...] Azalea explained.|$|E

60|$|While {{he began}} the {{narrative}} Ruth studied him carefully. He looked very virile and handsome with his bronzed skin, his steady eyes, and his figure fined down by privation and toil.

40|$|Steph Hutchison 2 ̆ 7 s solo WORK is fuelled by an {{interest}} in pushing the body to its physical limit. A hybrid performance, interweaving dance, circus arts, improvisation, sports and theatre, WORK is inspired by the physical journey of Julie Moss. In 1982, Julie Moss competed in her first Ironman without ever completing the total distance before. What began as a lark became a struggle for survival and a test of human will. Each time <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> quitting, <b>she</b> thought it was her 2 ̆ 7 ego trying to self-sabotage, 2 ̆ 7 but her real self was 2 ̆ 7 that voice that said; "just keep moving forward. There is no limit. " Hutchison explores the notion of dance as extreme sport and emphatically engages her body in rigorous physical practices. Her attention is to muscularity {{and the performance of}} effort, work and labour, to the point of physical exhaustion. Using circus apparatus such as tissu, rope and acrobatic mats, Steph pushes to and beyond the limits of her physical ability during the performance. In preparation for the show, she puts herself through intense bootcamp style training, classical and contemporary dance training and teaches herself new acrobatic tricks. Her aim is to push herself past exhaustion to another level...|$|R

50|$|According to C.P. Ellis, Ann Atwater had a {{bold and}} strong personality. Her voice {{was deep and}} {{powerful}} and {{had the ability to}} energize her audience. These personality traits allowed her to be the effective leader she was. She was not afraid to voice her opinions loudly and proudly. She was also not afraid to tell anyone to “go to hell if <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. <b>She</b> realized that the most effective method at getting people to listen to her was to “holler at them” When she called a meeting she meant business. In one meeting with a councilman, Atwater recalls that when he was not taking her seriously as she was trying to make her points, she would hit him on the head, surprising him so much that he would listen to her afterwards. In other situations like city council meetings, Atwater would express her opinions but the councilmen would not want to listen to a black women talk, so they would turn their chairs away from her. In response she would turn those chairs back around herself so they would face her. Her bold actions surprised many of the councilmen {{to the point that they}} had to listen to her. Some people may not have liked how demanding and outspoken she was, but those qualities enabled her to be the successful activist she was.|$|R
