Before leaving the witness stand, proper notification will be given to the expert witness to see if he is dismissed or if he will be recalled later.|$|E

You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing".

He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E
