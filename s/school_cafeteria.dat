5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or <b>school</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is design a {{collection}} of action, which will speed up distributional ways between regional grocery producers and <b>schools</b> <b>cafeterias</b> {{in the district of}} Jindrichuv Hradec {{and at the same time}} supports higher regional, fresh, seasonal and ecologist products in <b>schools</b> <b>cafeterias</b> via the website Regional Agrarian Chamber of the South Bohemian Region "Map of products" (interactive regional map of suppliers of foods and different <b>schools</b> <b>cafeterias</b> at www. produktova-mapa. cz). Not such a long distributional truck trips are much healthier for the milieu. Better quality of foods have major positive impact on health of children and teenagers and their eating habits. Regional products distribution is great way to independency. Study of documents, questionnaires of <b>schools</b> <b>cafeteria</b> employees and regional food producers, consultations with people they are interested were bedding for SWOT analysis potential "Map of products" and creating a lists of regional food producers, whom are or could by distributers for <b>schools</b> <b>cafeterias.</b> From study emerges that "Map of products" is very beneficial in shortening ways between distributers and different cafeterias in South Bohemia region. Strengths and opportunities already today outweigh the weaknesses and threats. The main opportunities emergent from results are 92 % of certain <b>school</b> <b>cafeterias</b> are serving at least one time a week food from the same region. 70 % certain regional producers are interested in supplying these cafeterias. There is a 1 650 000 students eating at the cafeterias. If following suggested strategies and steps we can prevent form weak parts of project and turn it in to a solid strong successful proceeding. For that we have build a list of accommodating regional producers for <b>school</b> <b>cafeterias</b> from district Jindrichuv Hradec. And also "Map of products" can be used as an example in improving in regional food production and also in other areas of the Czech Republic...|$|R

25|$|Until 1941 Riverside did {{not have}} a <b>school</b> <b>cafeteria</b> and lacked a full library.

The two largest bombs built were found in the <b>school</b> <b>cafeteria</b> and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only {{partially}} detonating. It was estimated that if any of the bombs placed in the cafeteria had detonated properly, the blast could have caused extensive structural damage to the school and would have resulted in hundreds of casualties.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the <b>school</b> <b>cafeterias</b> in the Federal District of Brazil {{with respect to}} the promotion of healthy eating in schools. Methods: This is a descriptive, analytical, cross-sectional study, with a representative sample of <b>schools</b> with <b>cafeterias</b> in the Federal District, Brazil (n= 202). The data were collected from April to November 2010 by means of on-site interviews and a structured questionnaire. The Pearson's chi-squared and Student's t tests were used. Results: A higher prevalence of outsourcing, and few employees and dieticians were observed. The prevailing foods were baked sausage, cheese, or chicken rolls or pastries. It was also found that 42. 2 % of the schools influence the menu of the cafeterias, and 58. 6 % of the representatives believe in the possibility of influencing the students' eating habits. However, 68. 0 % of the respondents do not believe in the economic feasibility of completely healthful <b>school</b> <b>cafeterias.</b> Approximately 30. 0 % of the respondents carry out activities to promote healthy eating. Conclusion: Most of the <b>school</b> <b>cafeterias</b> in the Federal District do not encourage healthful eating. The high prevalence of outsourced services with little interference from the school community gives high autonomy to the cafeteria's owner, whose priority is the pursuit of profit {{at the expense of the}} students' nutritional education. Improving the nutritional quality of school foods should be a continuous interactive effort of the food suppliers, principals, students, parents, and government authorities...|$|R
