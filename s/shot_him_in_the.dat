5|$|On Monday, June 16, 1856, Strang was waylaid around 7:00 PM on {{the dock}} at the harbor of St. James, chief city of Beaver Island, by Wentworth and Bedford, who <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back. All of this {{was carried out in}} full view of several {{officers}} and men of the , a US Naval vessel docked in the harbor. Not one person on board the ship made any effort to warn or to aid the intended victim.|$|E
5|$|At 10:23, {{the judge}} raised a {{security}} alarm. Judicial officers, {{and a federal}} police officer {{who was in the}} court building testifying in an unrelated case, arrived at the scene; however, during the ongoing commotion the police officer mistook Okaz for the attacker and <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper leg. Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant. While under arrest, Wiens resisted and begged the police officer to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E

25|$|Arenas Gaspar {{took charge}} {{of one of the}} {{artillery}} batteries and opened fire, which halted the enemy advance and allowed his men to reach Monte Arruit. Unfortunately one of the Riffians was able to get close enough to Arenas Gaspar, <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head, and killed him.|$|E
50|$|The mutiny {{was hailed}} as a success for Irish republicanism. Smyth was later assassinated when six IRA men <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> smoking room of the Cork and County Club.|$|R

Koyama was arrested by Japanese police later and he claimed that he desired for the war to continue.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, {{two more}} victims died within six minutes of each other. Neal Moynihan, 19, was killed while walking near the Civic Center while shopping. A man had walked {{in front of}} him, and <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, neck, and heart. The killer (or perhaps a {{different}} killer, per authors Cohen and Sanders) then chased down 50-year-old Mildred Hosler as she was heading to her bus stop, and also shot her four times.|$|E
25|$|On May 23, 1974, David Frank Kamaiko, a 22-year {{man from}} Greenwich Village {{claiming}} {{to be a member}} of the Jewish Defense League, hijacked a helicopter from the East 34th Street Heliport and demanded $2 million in ransom. After landing on top of the Pan Am Building, the pilot tried to escape and Kamaiko <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arm.

50|$|The duel {{took place}} on 12 April 1863 in a forest near Rawicz, outside the village of Izbice. It is {{doubtful}} whether Bobrowski could even see his opponent. Grabowski <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> directly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart, and Bobrowski died on the spot.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{opposition to}} Somoza {{came from the}} educated {{middle class and the}} normally conservative wealthy, such as Pedro Joaquín Chamorro. On September 21, 1956, Rigoberto López Pérez sneaked into a party attended by the President and <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest. In his memoirs Nicaragua Betrayed, Anastasio Debayle (Somoza's son) claims that Chamorro had knowledge of the assassination plot. While the assassin quickly died in a hail of gunfire, Somoza himself died a few days later, in an American hospital in the Panama Canal Zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{story that}} Vlad {{had told the}} young woman was as follows: he and Nödtveidt met Meddour in a street of Göteborg, and invited him to follow them to Keillers Park. There, they first tried to immobilise him with an {{electroshock}} weapon (Taser), which somehow did not succeed. Meddour tried to run away, but Vlad <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back with a pistol. While Meddour {{was lying on the}} ground, Vlad handed the gun to Nödtveidt, who shot a second bullet to the head.|$|E
25|$|In October 1960, Gaggi {{committed}} {{his first}} murder for the Gambino family. He {{served on a}} hit squad that murdered mobster Vincent Squillante, who is suspected of killing Scalise. According to Montiglio, Gaggi described the murder: “We surprised him (Squillante) in the Bronx. We <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head, stuffed him in the trunk, then dumped him for good.” In this case, “dumped him for good” meant that they hauled the body to {{the basement of a}} building, loaded it into a trash incinerator, and cremated it. After the Squillante murder, Gaggi was inducted into the Gambino family.|$|E
50|$|On 17 April 1987, just as Carlton {{arrived at}} his Kingston home and walked across his yard, a gunman stepped up behind <b>him</b> and <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> twice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head. He was dead on arrival at a Kingston {{hospital}} at age 36.|$|R

25|$|After {{failing to}} {{convince}} Uglúk, the Uruk-hai captain, {{to lead the}} expedition east to safety in Mordor, he leaves and returns with 20-40 peers from Mordor, claiming a brotherly desire to help their fellow Orcs. However, Grishnákh's actual plans for the two captives, Merry and Pippin, were in conflict with Uglúk's orders to deliver them to Saruman unharmed. He was killed when the Orcs were attacked by Éomer's Men. He tried to smuggle the Hobbits away from the Uruk-hai and into Fangorn Forest: a Rohirrim rider <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand before killing him with a spear.|$|E
25|$|On the {{following}} day at 7:15a.m., Borel arrived {{at the home of}} his friend Alan Guillemette. When Guillemette's mother opened the door Eric asked her to wake him. The two had a lengthy discussion in the garden, and apparently Eric wanted something from Guillemette, but when he declined and turned {{to go back into the}} house, Eric <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back, mortally wounding him. From 7:30a.m. onwards, Borel started shooting people at random. No one grew suspicious of his rifle until he started his rampage, since it was hunting season and the sight of rifles outside was to be expected.|$|E
25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E
60|$|Tom Loker came on. George {{waited until}} he was near enough, then he fired. <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> hit <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side. But, though wounded, he would not go back. With a yell {{like that of a}} mad bull he came leaping on, and sprang right in among them.|$|R
50|$|However, on 27 March, Teeling {{shot and}} killed William Johnson, {{a member of the}} Citizens' Defence Force. It seems a drunk Teeling objected to the fact that Johnson had brought a bag of {{tomatoes}} into the bar at the Theatre Royal and <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing altercation.|$|R
50|$|Eaves played just 10 games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2011-12 {{season before}} {{suffering}} a broken jaw and a concussion {{in a game}} against the Nashville Predators on November 26, 2011.

25|$|The 40 wounded men {{who could}} not walk were {{executed}} inside the fort compound. Fannin {{was the last to}} be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: he asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face and burned Fannin's body along with the other Texans who died that day.|$|E
25|$|Nine days later, on October 12, {{gang members}} {{converged on the}} jail where Dillinger was being held. Pierpont, Makley, and Russell Clark entered the facility, while Ed Shouse {{remained}} outside as a lookout. The three men confronted Sheriff Jesse Sarber—in the presence of Deputy Wilbur Sharp and Sarber's wife—and stated that they were from Indiana State Prison with a transfer request for John Dillinger. When the sheriff asked to see their credentials, Pierpont <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abdomen. Makley and one other man then physically assaulted the sheriff, mortally injuring him. They locked the deputy and Sarber's wife in a cell and left Sarber for dead while they made their escape.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, two unarmed black motorists, Robert Russ and LaTanya Haggerty, were both fatally shot in {{separate}} incidents involving the Chicago Police. In the first incident, Russ, an honor student and star football player for Northwestern University, was shot inside of his car. This followed a high-speed chase and what the police claim was a struggle with the officer who <b>shot</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second, Haggarty, a computer analyst, was shot by a female officer. Charges of racism against the CPD persisted, {{despite the fact that}} officers in both incidents were also black. Both shootings resulted in lawsuits and Haggerty's family reached an $18 million settlement with the city.|$|E
