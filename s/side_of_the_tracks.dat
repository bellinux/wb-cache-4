5|$|In January 2001, {{because of}} {{to changes in}} Amtrak rules, {{passengers}} were no longer allowed to cross tracks to access trains. New platforms were opened on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> at Branford and Westbrook at approximately the same locations.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on May 24, 2004, {{construction}} of new platforms began at Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both consist of a single high-level platform on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The new Guilford station, which has platforms {{on both sides of}} the tracks (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. Construction at Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished with the opening of the rebuilt station platform on July 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Michigan Central Depot, {{from which}} the area took its name, no longer stands, but it was between the northeast <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> and {{the west side of}} River Street, directly across from the freighthouse, since replaced by a parking lot. The freighthouse, built in 1878, does still stand, and the area immediately around the freighthouse is home to the Depot Town Farmers' Market, one of two farmers' markets in Ypsilanti. Also in the freighthouse courtyard, a caboose sits parallel to Rice Street.|$|E
50|$|The line runs on <b>the</b> {{left-hand}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> {{as opposed}} to <b>the</b> right-hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> like all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines do.|$|R
30|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> beam have rigid central catenaries.|$|R
50|$|His helmet was {{recovered}} from <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5|$|The station depot was {{replaced}} by a wooden one-story depot, referred to by locals as a shack, along the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in downtown Turner. The new station itself lasted around {{the same amount of time}} that its predecessor station depot had; however, the widow of Edward Henry Harriman (d. September 9, 1909), a local railroad executive whose Arden estate was in the nearby hills, donated land in February 1910 in a different portion of Turner to build a brand new station to the east. The old one-story depot had a roof and structural supports that were aging and on the verge of collapsing to the ground.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 1890s, {{the station}} was {{frequently}} overcrowded and North Philadelphia and the northern suburbs grew in population. The completion of the Delair Bridge in 1896 allowed passengers to ride trains directly to the summer resorts of southern New Jersey (rather than taking a ferry to Camden) further increased traffic on the line. George B. Roberts, president of the railroad, used his social connections to hire Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr. to construct a new station. The new station was constructed on a former freight yard on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> (across from the previous station), where there was more space for the station. The site also provided better connections for passengers using newly electrified streetcars on Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street to reach the station.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, {{with the}} {{cemetery}} fully operational and a planned new lunatic asylum near Brookwood likely to boost traffic, the LSWR agreed {{to build a}} mainline station at Brookwood, along with an improved Necropolis Junction and a goods yard, provided the LNC supplied the necessary land and built the approach road and stationmaster's house for the new station. The new station, called Brookwood (Necropolis) railway station (the suffix was gradually dropped), opened on 1 June 1864. A substantial commuter village grew around the northern (i.e. non-cemetery) side of the new station, and the station building (on the northern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks)</b> was enlarged in 1890. In conjunction with these works, a branch line was added in 1890 from a bay platform to the National Rifle Association's shooting range at Bisley, running west {{to the north of}} the LSWR main line before curving north to Bisley.|$|E
50|$|The long {{platforms}} {{remain at}} either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> bed.|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, {{the borough}} {{purchased}} {{the land around}} the depot from the Erie Railroad. A year later, the deal was completed, giving <b>the</b> borough both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> land was created into parking lots for automobiles. Like before, the Allendale Garden Club, {{as well as the}} Borough Council, re-landscaped the grounds. They planted new flowers and plants on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> Erie Railroad ceased to exist on October 17, 1960, when it merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad to create the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} one {{low-level}} side platform on <b>the</b> east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5|$|In August 2007, the MBTA {{published}} a feasibility study exploring {{the possibility of}} rebuilding Yawkey as a full-service station. The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60%, from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937. On November 15, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station, originally {{expected to be completed}} in the spring of 2012. The new station has two full-length high-level platforms that provide level, handicapped-accessible boarding for all passengers; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility. The two 700-foot-long platforms (a side platform between the tracks plus a side platform on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks)</b> are connected with an overpass, and passengers no longer have to cross the tracks to access certain outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the city}} and Amtrak {{attempted}} to fund a second renovation with a private partner, but plans fell through. In 1991, Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> {{in front of the}} passenger tunnel. Access from the south was blocked off. In 1999, the original station building was renovated at a cost of $7 million for use as commercial space. The front parking lot was expanded on a slope to the west; it covered much of the ground level (similar to the station before 1915). The mechanical building and the covered ramp to the trolley station were removed. A strip mall was built just to the east, with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station. The passageway from the subway station, long closed, was likely buried at this time. The 1901-built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Boston and Maine Railroad built a new, {{more modern}} station in 1952 but reused the 1914-built platforms. This single-story {{building}}, {{located on the}} south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> at Mt. Vernon and Exchange streets, {{was in the same}} flat-roofed brick style as Winchester Center and Wedgemere built five years later. The building was the first on the Boston & Maine system to have radiant heat, and also included a restaurant and newsstand. The 1895-built station was demolished to make room for a parking lot. Saugus Branch service ended in May 1958, leaving through service on the Eastern Route as the only trains serving Lynn. Around this time, the third and fourth tracks through the station were removed due to reduced traffic, leaving the station with effectively two side platforms serving two tracks.|$|E
50|$|Thunderbird {{operates}} {{with two}} open-air steel and fiberglass trains, each with five cars of four seats each, with two on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> Each train holds 20 riders and the ride has {{a capacity of}} about 1,140 riders per hour. Because the seats are on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> a cantilevered steel arm is used to support the wings.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a single island {{platform}} reached by footbridge from either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> station retains its original Southern Railway buildings in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} one 10-car long side {{platform}} on <b>the</b> south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5|$|The new {{station was}} {{constructed}} in an Art Deco/Streamline Moderne design by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell. Like Holden's other designs for London Underground in the 1930s, East Finchley station was inspired by European architecture (particularly Dutch) that Holden had seen on trips to the continent during that decade. The track here runs roughly north-west to south-east. The imposing station building, built on rising ground adjacent to the railway bridge over High Road (A1000), has three entrances. The two main entrances to the ticket hall are on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> facing High Road and the third, minor entrance, is on the south side. The entrances are linked by a passage under the tracks which provides access up to the platforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the well-connected {{owners of}} Cross Sound Ferry {{proposed}} a footbridge from the Water Street parking garage to the ferry slips so that ferry passengers {{would not have}} to cross Water Street and the tracks at grade. Amtrak saw the project as an opportunity to build a new elevated station nearby and contributed $1 million to the design of the bridge. However, Amtrak reversed course in 1999 and decided to keep using Union Station; in 2001, the railroad declined to fund the footbridge. Also in 2001, Amtrak built a pair of high-level platforms to serve the new Acela Express high-speed service, thus adapting the 19th-century station for 21st-century usage. Catenary wires were installed over the tracks as part of the introduction of the Acela. Later that year or early in 2002, the 1899-built freight house on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> was torn down as part of redevelopment sponsored by the New London Development Corporation. The freight house had previously been used by Amtrak maintenance-of-way crews, and before that by the Fishers Island Ferry District.|$|E

5000|$|At Watkins Glen, with Stewart {{having already}} {{clinched}} his third World Championship, Cevert was killed during Saturday morning qualifying, while battling for pole position with Ronnie Peterson. In the fast right-left uphill combination called [...] "The Esses", Cevert's {{car was a}} little too far over towards <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> getting a bump from the kerbs. [...] This made it swerve towards <b>the</b> right-hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> where it touched <b>the</b> <b>track's</b> signature powder blue safety barriers causing it to spin and crash into the barriers on <b>the</b> other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at a near 90° angle, uprooting and lifting the barrier. Cevert died instantly of massive injuries inflicted by the barrier.|$|R
50|$|The old Schofields station {{consisted}} <b>of</b> {{a single}} <b>side</b> platform with street level access on <b>the</b> eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> A pedestrian level crossing to <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform allowed access to <b>the</b> other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> An interesting feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station was the adjacent grain and produce facility that protruded into the railway platform. The old station closed on 3 October 2011.|$|R
5|$|MD222 heads westfarmland, {{crossing}} Happy Valley Branch before {{passing the}} entrance to the former United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, which contains the Edward W. Haviland House and the original campus of the Tome School. The highway descends from a high bluff to the Susquehanna River, during which southbound MD 222 has a climbing lane. Upon entering the town limits of Port Deposit, MD222's name changes to Main Street and the highway makes a sharp turn to the north to parallel the river and Norfolk Southern Railway's Port Road Branch. The state highway intersects MD276 (Centre Street) in the center of Port Deposit. MD222 passes the Paw Paw Building and intersects Granite Avenue before crossing Rock Run and passing under a low railroad bridge to the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> The highway leaves the town of Port Deposit and continues north as Susquehanna River Road, closely paralleling the river and passing through a unit of Susquehanna State Park along the river. Soon after crossing Octoraro Creek, MD222 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with US1 (Conowingo Road) at the eastern end of Conowingo Dam. Following US1 northeast to the community of Conowingo leads to the southern terminus of US222 and the northern terminus of MD222Truck.|$|E
5|$|The 1872 Central Square station {{burned in}} 1889 and was {{replaced}} with a temporary station until a new depot with a 75-foot clock tower was built in 1895 on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> off Union Street. This station had two side platforms to serve the line's two tracks. As early as 1901, the city began planning to eliminate the numerous grade crossings in downtown Lynn. With 150 trains per day on the main line and 40 on the Saugus Branch, some streets were blocked {{for as long as}} half of daylight hours. After legal issues, construction of an elevated viaduct began in September 1909. However, the New Haven Railroad briefly gained control of the Boston and Maine at this time, and intended to fully four-track the line through Lynn in conjunction with plans including a possible railroad tunnel under the harbor. The municipality initially intended to force the railroad to depress the four-track line below grade, but later reached an agreement with the railroad to modify the two-track viaduct for four tracks.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Railway Act 1885 {{had given}} Watkin {{permission}} {{to extend the}} line from Chesham {{to connect with the}} LNWR at Tring. Thus, although it was the terminus of the line, Chesham station was designed with a revival of the LNWR extension scheme in mind. The small station building was set to one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> to allow for a possible extension onwards. The station had a single platform, with a run-around loop and turntable alongside, together with a coaling station and water tank. The station was lit by gas light until 1925; the local gas works, which consumed around 5,000tons of coal each year, threatened to withdraw their coal traffic from the line if the station were fitted with electric lighting. While Chalfont Road station initially served a sparsely populated rural area (the village of Little Chalfont had not yet grown around the station), Chesham station was busy, and {{at the time of its}} opening had a full staff of a stationmaster, two ticket inspectors, two clerks, two porters and two collectors.|$|E

25|$|Outside the Tricity, on the Gdynia Cisowa-Wejherowo line SKM uses stops {{built more}} recently, mostly with two {{platforms}} on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> two platforms are connected by underground or overhead pedestrian passageways.|$|R
5|$|The station, {{owned by}} British Rail, opened on 1 May 1972. Services were {{operated}} by the Western Region until British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, after which Parkway was served by the InterCity and Regional Railways divisions. The original structures, built by Stone & Co. of Bristol, were basic – two island platforms connected by an open metal footbridge, with a wood and brick building containing the booking facilities and waiting rooms. Platform 1 (the modern platform 3), on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> was for trains towards London and Birmingham, and platform 2 was for trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. The station opened with a 600-space car park and a fastest journey to London of 95 minutes, which was subsequently reduced to 75 minutes {{with the introduction of}} the new High Speed Trains in the mid-70s. Platform canopies were added in 1973, along with a cover for the footbridge. Further minor improvements were implemented over the next thirty years, including a new booking office and small extensions to the car park.|$|E

50|$|This race is {{best known}} for its first corner {{incident}} involving world championship contenders Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. Senna secured the pole, but was unhappy with <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> it was situated on, claiming that pole should always be on the racing line. He and Gerhard Berger then went to the Japanese stewards, to request a change of position <b>of</b> pole to <b>the</b> cleaner left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> stewards initially agreed but an injunction by FISA president Jean Marie Balestre later that night rejected the decision and the original pole position remained on the dirtier, less grippy right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist, Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing <b>the</b> yellow line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna.|$|R
