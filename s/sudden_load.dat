Our results showed that <b>sudden</b> external <b>loading</b> generated the smallest impact when subjects adopted “Staggered Stance”.

Compared with “Narrow Stance”, the decreases were 15. 1 %, 3. 2 %, and 16. 2 % respectively. Heavier load weight resulted in larger spinal impact.

40|$|<b>Sudden,</b> {{unexpected}} <b>loading</b> on the {{low back}} {{is associated with a}} high incidence of low back pain. Experiments in which <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> was applied during standing revealed increased compression forces on the spine and increased trunk angle, which may cause injury to the spine and hence explain this association. During a more dynamic daily activity, i. e. lifting, this could not be demonstrated, which may be due to experimental constraints. We therefore reinvestigated the loading of the low back when subjects were lifting an unexpectedly heavy object. Ten males lifted boxes, weighing 1. 6 or 6. 6 kg, at a self-selected lifting velocity. In some trials the mass of these boxes was unexpectedly increased by 10 kg. The ground reaction forces, body movements and trunk muscle activity were measured and from these, the L 5 /S 1 torques and compression forces were estimated. Underestimation of the mass did not lead to an increase in low back loading. This finding was independent of the mass the subjects were expecting to lift. In conclusion, no evidence was found to support inference regarding causality of the association between <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> and low back pain during whole body lifting movements.

40|$|<b>Sudden</b> {{unexpected}} <b>loading</b> {{and high}} frequency repetitive lifting {{have been identified}} as risk factors for low back injury. Despite the risk that such factors pose, there is a dearth of literature concerning the influence of posture and fatigue on muscular, postural, subjective and physiological responses in these situations. The primary aim of this thesis was {{to examine the effects of}} posture and lifting-induced fatigue on neuromuscular, postural, psychophysical and physiological responses to <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> and repetitive lifting. The first two studies in this thesis focused on muscular and postural responses to <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> of a hand-held box in an upright and stoop standing posture. Trials were performed with and without visual warning and following lifting-induced fatigue. <b>Sudden</b> <b>loading</b> in an upright posture resulted in co-activation of oblique abdominal and erector spinae musculature, with relatively simultaneous joint initiation of the lower limb and lumbar spine. In contrast, <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> in the stoop posture produced minimal abdominal muscle contribution. Maximal angular joint excursion was significantly less in the stoop than that in the upright posture. Prior exposure and warning primarily affected postural responses in the upright posture with earlier activation of the trunk and lower limb musculature resulting in a reduction in joint excursion. Such a mechanism may enhance postural stability. However, the influence of warning on reducing joint motion was compromised when fatigued. Studies three and four of the thesis focused on the effects of self-selected lifting posture (squat, mixed and stoop) and fatigue during repetitive lifting on psychophysical, physiological, neuromuscular and lumbar spine kinematic responses. Study three compared lifting postures using ratings of perceived exertion and heart rate response patterns. Similar subjective and physiological responses were found for different lifting postures, with a progressive rise in ratings of perceived exertion and heart rate measures throughout the task. All postures exhibited evidence of erector spinae muscle fatigue at the end of the task. Study four examined the effect of self-selected lifting posture on lumbosacral kinematics and associated trunk muscle activation patterns during lifting and lowering, pre and post fatigued. When compared to squat lifting, individuals who self-selected a stoop lifting technique displayed different lower erector spinae activation patterns. The stoop lifters also flexed their lumbar spines at faster velocities and adopted greater lumbosacral flexion than squat lifters, which could potentially place greater strain on the passive structures of the spine. Fatigue influenced lumbosacral motion patterns of stoop and mixed lifters to a greater extent than squat lifters, resulting in a decreased range and velocity of lumbar extension. Findings from this thesis provide insight into the underlying neuromuscular control of the trunk during high risk manual handling activities. It provides important information concerning the possible mechanism of postural and fatigue related musculoskeletal injury. This will assist the development of training and rehabilitation programmes targeted at neuromuscular, physiological, biomechanical and psychophysical requirements of manual handling tasks...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whole-body and trunk postural control to <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> at the hands, with a special focus on the implications of loading to spinal stability. Seventeen females experienced the effects of load symmetry, both symmetrical and asymmetrical, in combination with expected and unexpected anticipation. The dependent variables were pre average, anticipatory, peak and time-to-peak responses from four trunk and three leg muscles bilaterally. Pre-activation of trunk and leg agonistic muscles served to reduce the overall postural disturbance caused by <b>sudden</b> <b>loading.</b> An increase in antagonistic co-activation was observed in both the anticipatory and reflex-mediated compensatory responses to the load perturbation. It is proposed that muscle stiffness and co-activation strategies affect both trunk and whole-body stability. The results provide insight into several common mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of whole-body equilibrium and spinal stability.

50|$|If {{the heating}} plant is only {{working at a}} small {{fraction}} of its maximum and the turndown ratio is too low, at some point the burner will still need to be shut off when the desired pressure/temperature is achieved. This in turn leads to a rapid reduction in temperature/pressure, requiring the boiler to restart. Cycling frequency can be as high as 12 times per hour. This is undesirable, as flue gases are purged during both the shut-down and start-up phases, leading to energy losses and therefore inefficiency. Additionally, typical startup times for boilers are in the order of one to two minutes, leading to an inability to respond to <b>sudden</b> <b>load</b> demands.|$|E
50|$|Referred to as {{assisted}} braking, or incorrectly as 'auto-locking', {{under the}} right conditions these devices use a <b>sudden</b> <b>load</b> on the rope to engage a camming mechanism (known as mechanically assisted breaking devices) or pull the belay carabiner into a pinch point (known as geometrically assisted breaking devices) to prevent the rope from passing through the belay device. Use of such belay devices should never be instructed as self- or auto-locking, but as assisted braking. There do exist rare conditions where these devices' braking functions may not apply correctly, though accident statistics show that these incidents are often user-error. An icy, muddy, worn, too-thin of a rope, or possibly other conditions, such as insufficient training and experience, may affect a device's braking function.|$|E

40|$|External {{perturbation}} of {{the trunk}} via <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading is an established method to study control of spinal stability and postural equilibrium. As differential control of the deep and superficial lumbar multifidus occurs during predictable sagittal loading, we hypothesized that the deep and superficial components of the thoracic paraspinal muscles would also be differentially active during loading and unloading {{of the trunk}}. Variation in sagittal mobility between regions of the thorax and previous data of differences {{in control of the}} thoracic paraspinal muscles between regions in other tasks supported a hypothesis that there would be region-specific differences in responses to loading and unloading. This study used fine-wire electrodes to record electromyographic (EMG) activity from the right deep (multifidus/rotatores) and superficial (longissimus) muscles at 15, T 8, and T 11 in ten healthy subjects during predictable and unpredictable <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading of the trunk. EMG amplitude was calculated during 10 ms epochs for 50 ms before the onset of trunk perturbation and 150 ms after the perturbation. Contrary to our hypotheses, deep and superficial thoracic paraspinal muscles were similarly active (loading: p = 0. 470; unloading: p = 0. 137) and similarly affected by the degree of predictability at all levels. Thus, deep and superficial thoracic paraspinal muscles are recruited en bloc during sagittal plane trunk perturbations. This contrasts previous findings of differential control between the deep and superficial thoracic paraspinal muscles during rotational tasks, and provides evidence that discrete control of thoracic paraspinal muscle fascicles is specific to the direction of forces applied to the trunk.

40|$|Low {{back injury}} is {{associated}} with <b>sudden</b> movements and <b>loading.</b> Trunk motion after <b>sudden</b> <b>loading</b> depends on {{the stability of the}} spine prior to loading and on the trunk muscle activity in response to the loading. Both factors are not axis-symmetric. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the effects on trunk dynamics would be larger after an asymmetric than after a symmetric perturbation. Ten subjects lifted a crate in which, prior to lifting, a mass was displaced to the front or to the side without the subjects being aware of this. Crate and subject movements, crate reaction forces and muscle activity were recorded. From this, the stability prior to the perturbation was estimated, and the trunk angular kinematics and moments at the lumbo-sacral joint were calculated. Both perturbations only minimally affected the trunk kinematics, although the stability of the spine prior to the lifting movement was higher in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane. In both conditions the stability appeared to be sufficient to absorb the applied perturbation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
