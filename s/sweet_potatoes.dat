The objectives of the {{experiments were}} {{to determine the effects}} of four <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> cropping systems on the population density of <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> weevils (SPW) and on the diversity of other insects within these agroecosystems. Fewer SPW were found in intercropped <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> + corn (2 weevils per kg infected tubers), <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> + soybean (21 weevils), <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> + corn + soybean (8 weevils) than in monoculture <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (37 weevils); percentage of damaged tubers followed the same trend, ranging from 2. 6 % to 14. 0 % in intercropped <b>sweet</b> <b>potato,</b> to 21. 9 % in the <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> monoculture. However, the higher number of SPW and damaged tubers in the monoculture did not reduce yield below that in the intercropped plots. Insect and spider populations were more diverse in the intercropped <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> systems than in monoculture. Number of arthropods increased throughout the growing season.

5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes,</b> almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations.

However, to date no study has been completed regarding household consumption of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> and factors related to their consumption. The study detailed here therefore sought to establish the consumption of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato,</b> and to identify factors associated with its household consumption in the Integrating Orange Project areas in Chipata district of Zambia. The study randomly sampled 295 households, and collected information on the household characteristics, production, procurement, consumption and knowledge on orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato.</b> Cross tabulation chi square and one-way analysis of variance were used to identify associated consumption factors. The study found that 86. 8 % of the households ate orange-fleshed sweet potato; 49. 5 % ate it 1 to 3 days per week and 30. 2 % ate it at least 4 or more days per week, and only 13. 2 % did not consume orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> at all. A relationship was found between having children younger than five years old and consumption of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (P < 0. 001). Results showed that 8. 7 % of households with children (n= 183) never ate orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato,</b> versus 20. 5 % of households without children (n= 112). Production of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (n= 178) was found to have a relationship with household conusmption of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (P < 0. 001). Only 1. 1 % of households that produced orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> did not consume any, versus 31. 6 % who did not produce orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato.</b> Purchasing of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (n= 118) was found to have a relationship with its household consumption (P < 0. 001); 56. 2 % of the households that ate orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> 1 to 3 days during the previous week bought it, compared to only 27. 0 % of households who ate orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> more than 4 days per week among those that bought it. The respondent‘s knowledge of the health benefits of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> was found to have a relationship with its consumption in the household (P < 0. 001). Only 7. 8 % of the households where respondents knew the benefits of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (n= 215) never ate orange-fleshed potato, compared to 50. 0 % of households where the respondents did not know any benefit (n= 80). In contrast, 33. 5 % of the households where the respondents knew the health benefits ate orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> at least 4 days a week compared to only 7. 9 % of households where the respondents did not know any benefit. Overall, the study showed that most households consumed orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato.</b> The highconsumption might be due to seasonality, as the study was done during the harvesting season of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato.</b> Also, prodcution of orange-fleshed <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> was promoted in the study area through the Integrating Orange Project.

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes,</b> beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King.
