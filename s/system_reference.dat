The object also contains an object close procedure and a reference count to tell the object manager how many other objects in the <b>system</b> <b>reference</b> that object and thereby determines whether the object can be destroyed when a close request is sent to it. Every named object exists in a hierarchical object namespace.|$|E
25|$|Electrode {{locations}} and names are {{specified by the}} International 10–20 system for most clinical and research applications (except when high-density arrays are used). This system ensures that the naming of electrodes is consistent across laboratories. In most clinical applications, 19 recording electrodes (plus ground and <b>system</b> <b>reference)</b> are used. A smaller number of electrodes are typically used when recording EEG from neonates. Additional electrodes {{can be added to}} the standard set-up when a clinical or research application demands increased spatial resolution for a particular area of the brain. High-density arrays (typically via cap or net) can contain up to 256 electrodes more-or-less evenly spaced around the scalp.|$|E

50|$|A spatial <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> (SRS) or {{coordinate}} <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> (CRS) is a coordinate-based local, {{regional or}} global system used to locate geographical entities. A spatial <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> defines a specific map projection, {{as well as}} transformations between different spatial <b>reference</b> <b>systems.</b> Spatial <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> are defined by the OGC's Simple feature access using well-known text, and support has been implemented by several standards-based geographic information <b>systems.</b> Spatial <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be referred to}} using a SRID integer, including EPSG codes defined by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers.It is specified in ISO 19111:2007 Geographic information—Spatial referencing by coordinates, also published as OGC Abstract Specification, Topic 2: Spatial referencing by coordinate.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{electrode}} {{is connected}} to one input of a differential amplifier (one amplifier per pair of electrodes); a common <b>system</b> <b>reference</b> electrode {{is connected to}} the other input of each differential amplifier. These amplifiers amplify the voltage between the active electrode and the reference (typically 1,000–100,000 times, or 60–100 dB of voltage gain). In analog EEG, the signal is then filtered (next paragraph), and the EEG signal is output as the deflection of pens as paper passes underneath. Most EEG systems these days, however, are digital, and the amplified signal is digitized via an analog-to-digital converter, after being passed through an anti-aliasing filter. [...] Analog-to-digital sampling typically occurs at 256–512Hz in clinical scalp EEG; sampling rates of up to 20kHz are used in some research applications.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons & Dragons {{brand manager}} Ryan Dancey {{introduced}} a policy whereby other companies could publish D-compatible materials under the Open Gaming License (OGL). He was frustrated that game supplements suffered far more diminished sales over time than the core books required {{to play the}} game, then this would spread the cost of supplementing the game and would increase sales of the core books, which could only be published by WotC. [...] The new D rules {{became known as the}} d20 system, and a <b>System</b> <b>Reference</b> Document was published, containing all the rules needed to write a supplement or run a one-off game, but lacking the character advancement rules necessary for long-term play. [...] The open gaming movement and 3rd/3.5 edition D (2000, 2003) enjoyed a great deal of success, and although there was some criticism of the move a great many [...] have been released until around 2008.|$|E

40|$|It is {{considered}} two neutrinos {{moving in the}} opposite directions. In {{one and the same}} <b>system</b> of <b>reference,</b> one of the neutrinos is CP-transformed from another neutrino, so one of two neutrinos transits into antineutrino. As a consequence a half of neutrinos produced in the spherical shell transits into antineutrinos. From this one observes a half of neutrino flux produced in the sun that may provide a solution for the solar neutrino puzzle. Weak interactions violate P-invariance and C-invariance but conserve CP-invariance [1]. Due to this neutrinos are always left-handed, and antineutrinos are always right-handed. Take the first <b>system</b> of <b>reference</b> with the coordinate x and the second <b>system</b> of <b>reference</b> P-transformed from the second <b>system</b> of <b>reference</b> x → −x. Consider neutrino moving in the direction x. In the first <b>system</b> of <b>reference,</b> one observes the spin of neutrino- 1 / 2. In the second <b>system</b> of <b>reference,</b> one observes the spin of neutrino + 1 / 2. P-transformation is not defined for neutrino, so it is necessary to apply CP-transformation. From this it follows that, in the second <b>system</b> of <b>reference,</b> one observes antineutrino...|$|R
