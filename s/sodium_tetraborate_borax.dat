40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Boron and boron {{compounds}} {{have been}} long used for pressure treatment, dip-diffusion, and remedial treatments of wood {{because of their}} proven efficacy against fungi and insects. These materials are especially attractive because their high water solubility promotes deeper penetration into wood. Other useful properties of boron include its neutral pH, non-corrosiveness, lack of color or odor, and little or no effect on wood strength. Boron also has low-mammalian toxicity and minimal environmental effects. However, high water solubility limits outdoor applications because the boron will leach from the wood when it is exposed to rain or is in direct soil contact. Boron is widely used as a component in external remedial pastes, primarily as disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT). This boron compound has higher water solubility and only remains in wood 3 to 7 years after application. Using differing degrees of water solubilities in the paste system might result in longer-term protection.

40|$|Many steroid hormones can be {{considered}} as potential biomarkers and their determination in body fluids can create opportunities for the rapid diagnosis of many diseases and disorders of the human body. Most existing methods for the determination of steroids are usually time- and labor-consuming and quite costly. Therefore, the aim of analytical laboratories is to develop a new, relatively low-cost and rapid implementation methodology for their determination in biological samples. Due {{to the fact that there}} is little literature data on concentrations of steroid hormones in urine samples, we have made attempts at the electrophoretic determination of these compounds. For this purpose, an extraction procedure for the optimized separation and simultaneous determination of seven steroid hormones in urine samples has been investigated. The isolation of analytes from biological samples was performed by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with dichloromethane and compared to solid phase extraction (SPE) with C 18 and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) columns. To separate all the analytes a micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECK) technique was employed. For full separation of all the analytes a running buffer (pH 9. 2), composed of 10 mM <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> decahydrate (<b>borax),</b> 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 10 % methanol was selected. The methodology developed in this work for the determination of steroid hormones meets all the requirements of analytical methods. The applicability of the method has been confirmed for the analysis of urine samples collected from volunteers—both men and women (students, amateur bodybuilders, using and not applying steroid doping). The data obtained during this work can be successfully used for further research on the determination of steroid hormones in urine samples...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of cellulose based nanocomposites influences their final mechanical properties significantly. Obtaining good dispersion of hydrophilic nanocellulose materials in hydrophobic polymer matrix is challenging. Here two unique methods {{were developed to}} improve the dispersion of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) in polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) matrix. One is in-situ polymerization of vinyl acetate {{in the presence of}} CNCs, and the other one is crosslinking of PVAc by <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> (<b>Borax),</b> which restricts the movement of CNCs during the drying process. The results from atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that the in-situ CNC/PVAc emulsion has much better dispersion than the one produced by stirring. Moreover, the mechanical characterization indicates that the in-situ composite with 10 wt% CNC has higher strength compared to the stirred composite with the same CNC concentration. The mechanical properties of crosslinked PVAc materials can be varied by changing the pH and may be attributed to differences of the crosslinking degree. Further investigations of the restriction effect caused by borax are needed. Godkänd; 2015; 20160331 (shigen...|$|E

40|$|A corrosion-inhibiting {{mixture of}} {{compounds}} {{has been developed}} for addition to the water used to rinse metal parts that have been cleaned with aqueous solutions in preparation for adhesive bonding of the metals to rubber and rubber-like materials. Prior {{to the development of}} this corrosion inhibitor, the parts (made, variously, of D 6 AC steel and 7075 -T 73 aluminum) were rinsed by deionized water, which caused corrosion in some places on the steel parts especially in such occluded places as sealing surfaces and threaded blind holes. An integral part of the particular cleaning process is the deposition of a thin layer of silicates and silane primers that increase the strength of the adhesive bond. The corrosion inhibitor is formulated, not only to inhibit corrosion of both D 6 AC steel and 7075 - T 73 aluminum, but also to either increase or at least not reduce the strength of the adhesive bond to be formed subsequently. The corrosion inhibitor is a mixture of sodium silicate and <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate.</b> The <b>sodium</b> silicate functions as both a corrosion inhibitor and a bond-strength promoter in association with the silane primers. The <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> buffers the rinse solution at the optimum pH and functions as a secondary corrosion inhibitor for the steel. For a given application, the concentrations of sodium silicate and <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> must be chosen in a compromise among the needs to inhibit corrosion of steel, inhibit corrosion of aluminum, and minimize cosmetic staining of both steel and aluminum. Concentrations of sodium silicate in excess of 150 parts of silicon per million parts of solution (ppm Si) have been determined to enhance inhibition of corrosion; unfortunately, because of the alkalinity of sodium silicate, even a small concentration can raise the pH of the rinse solution to such a level that aluminum becomes corroded despite the inhibiting effect. The pH of a solution that contains a high concentration of sodium silicate can be decreased by adding <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate.</b> On the other hand, the addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> increases the concentration of dissolved solids to such a high level that cosmetic staining becomes an issue...|$|R

30|$|The use of alkali {{has proven}} to reduce the {{adsorption}} of anionic surfactants (Hirasaki et al. 2008). Alkali increases the pH and decreases the number of positive sites available for the adsorption on the surface. Sodium carbonate is a conventional alkali used to achieve a low interfacial tension (IFT) by generating in situ surfactants by reacting with acidic compound present in the crude oil. It can also act as a sacrificial agent resulting in the decreased adsorption because it consumes the multivalent cations which would otherwise precipitate with surfactants and cause plugging in rock pores thereby reducing permeability (Grigg et al. 2004; Hirasaki et al. 2008). Another alkali, <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> which {{is also known as}} Borax is a novel alkali which can isolate multivalent cations by coordination rather than precipitation. <b>Sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> has a high salinity tolerance due to comparatively less ionic strength as compared to sodium metaborate (Lv et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Van Soest {{fractionation}} {{is widely}} employed to characterize exogenous organic matter. The soluble fraction of Van Soest fractionation (SOL, extracted using {{hot water and}} then neutral detergent) often increases in line with compost maturity, although it is generally considered as labile. We have developed an alternative extraction method that comprises four successive steps (extraction using hot water, <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate,</b> dichloromethane/methanol and chelating resin) in order to clarify the chemical nature of the SOL fraction and explain its biodegradability. This method was tested on municipal solid waste compost sampled during the thermophilic phase (MSWi) and after 8 months of composting (MSWm). Both methods extracted similar proportions of organic matter. The composition of the residues was similar in MSWm although differences were noted for the extraction of polysaccharides and lipids {{in the case of}} MSWi. The hot water extractable fraction decreased during composting. Its high biodegradability in MSWi was linked to the high polysaccharide content revealed by pyrolysis–GC/MS and FTIR spectroscopy. The increase in the <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> extractable fraction mainly explained the increase in the SOL fraction during composting. This was made up of N-containing compounds, polysaccharides and lipids in the immature compost, and a majority of N-containing compounds in the mature compost. During composting, the stabilization of organic matter in the SOL fraction extractable by <b>sodium</b> <b>tetraborate</b> and EDTA might principally involve N-containing structures through the formation of complexes of organic matter with metal ions, especially Ca 2 +, which may be broken down during extraction of the Van Soest soluble fraction.
