40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza</b> (Lespedeza cuneata), a {{perennial}} legume native to Asia, {{has been introduced}} in the United States for erosion control, providing forage to livestock and wildlife cover. It is drought tolerant, can grow {{in a range of}} soil types, and produces enormous amounts of seeds, which result in the establishment of the <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza</b> population very quickly. Native grasslands in the Great Plains are threatened by the spread of <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza,</b> which can damage forage or hay production leading to substantial economic costs to landowners. <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza</b> has been declared as a noxious weed by the state of Kansas. The current practice for controlling the growth of <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza</b> is by using herbicides. Although they are available, effective control can be expensive because of the scale of the problem and the necessity of repeated herbicide applications over many years to kill the new plants germinating from the long-lived seed bank. In this thesis, a dynamic nonlinear 0 - 1 integer programming model is developed to find economically efficient strategies to control the invasion of <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza.</b> Using empirical data, the model considers population growth rates, carrying capacity, seed dispersal, treatment costs, and economic loss due to invasion. The model minimizes the sum of damages to hay and forage due to the invasion of <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza</b> over time subject to two constraints: (1) the spread of invasive species over space and time, and (2) budget restricting the total cost of labor and herbicides used to prevent and control these invasive species. Finally, this thesis present results from different management scenarios as well as using various parameters considered in the model such as budget, dispersal rates, kill rates of the herbicides and initial infestation to provide insights regarding economically efficient strategies for controlling <b>Sericea</b> <b>Lespedeza</b> in the Great Plains...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> (Lespedeza cuneata) is {{classified}} as a noxious weed throughout the Great Plains. It produces copious amounts of seed annually and contains high levels of condensed tannins {{during much of the}} growing season, which deters grazing by large domestic herbivores. In Kansas alone, this plant infests approximately 600, 000 acres of native range, reducing native grass production by up to 92 %. Increased grazing pressure on <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> by beef cattle may slow its spread and facilitate some measure of biological control.

Advantages include increased forage quality, reduction of undesirable plants, improved wildlife habitat, removal of accumulated dead plant litter and relatively low costs. While spring is the commonly accepted time to burn, little research has been conducted on late-summer and fall burning for specific objectives that include targeting undesirable plant species and measuring potential effects on soil physical properties. The first part of this study was to evaluate the effect that prescribed burning has on population dynamics of <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> (Lespedeza cuneata [Dumont] G.

Change in botanical composition, plant density, frequency, and Daubenmire canopy cover estimates were calculated. <b>Sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> plant frequency across all clay upland burns decreased 2. 27 % and increased 4. 76 % across all loamy/limy upland burns the first growing season post-burn. Dogwood densities increased 3. 12 stems m[superscript]-[superscript] 2 on spring burns compared to a decrease of 0. 30 stems m[superscript]-[superscript] 2 on unburned plots the first growing season post-burn. Changes in frequency of other woody species the first growing season post-burn showed significant interactions between burn treatment and ecological site, and between ecological site and year.

40|$|Master of ScienceDivision of BiologyDavid A. HaukosSericea {{lespedeza}} (Lespedeza cuneata) is an invasive forb {{that reduces}} native grass and forb abundance in tall-grass prairie {{by up to}} 92 %. Controlling invasions is difficult because traditional land management tools used in the Flint Hills, broad spectrum herbicides, spring prescribed fire, and cattle grazing, are ineffective against sericea. Recent research has demonstrated, however, that mid- and late summer prescribed fire and spring fire with early season grazing by steers followed by late season grazing by sheep are effective at reducing sericea whole plant mass, number of seeds produced, and seed mass. Field results were from two separate experiments conducted in tall-grass prairie study sites in the Flint Hills. On a Geary County, Kansas, study site, the utility of 1) spring fire (control), 2) mid-summer fire, and 3) late summer fire on sericea control were compared. On a Woodson County, Kansas, study site, the utility of 1) spring fire with early season steer grazing followed by rest (control) and 2) spring fire with early season steer grazing and late season sheep grazing on sericea control were compared. At the same study sites, I measured responses by the native wildlife community to use of summer fire and sheep grazing, relative to their controls, to manage <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza.</b> Specifically, my objectives were to compare grassland songbird density, grassland songbird nest survival, and grassland butterfly species composition and density among treatments at both study sites. I also related patterns in the vegetation community of each treatment for each study site to respective patterns in grassland bird and butterfly communities. Within study sites, density, nest density, and nest success of grassland bird communities responded similarly to treatments and controls, with the exception that densities of Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savanarrum) were 3. 4 - and 2. 2 -fold greater in mid- and late summer fire plots than spring fire plots, respectively, in the Geary County study site. Species compositions of butterfly communities were similar across treatments within experiments, but grassland specialist species comprised only 8. 6 and 1. 2 % of all butterfly observations in the Geary County and Woodson County experiments, respectively. Grassland specialist butterfly species may benefit from summer fire, as their nectar sources were more abundant in Summer Fire plots than Spring Fire plots. Overall, within each experiment, grassland bird and butterfly communities were similar across treatments, suggesting that treatments did not negatively affect grassland songbird and butterfly communities. I additionally demonstrated that Dickcissel (Spiza americana) nest sites contain a lower proportion of sericea than random points, the first evidence that the invasion is detrimental to grassland songbird species. Lacking control, the continued sericea invasion will out compete cumulatively more forb plants resulting in declining quality of grassland bird nesting habitat on the landscape. Controlling <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> invasions will allow native forb species to increase in abundance and improve the condition of grasslands for native wildlife and livestock producers.

Previous work has demonstrated good efficacy of dried SL (hay, pellets) against small ruminant GIN, but information is lacking on consumption of fresh SL, particularly during the late summer–autumn period in the southern USA when perennial warm-season grass pastures are often low in quality. A study was designed {{to determine the effects of}} autumn (September–November) consumption of fresh SL forage, grass pasture (predominantly bermudagrass, BG; Cynodon dactylon), or a combination of SL + BG forage by young goats [intact male Spanish kids, 9 months old (20. 7 ± 1. 1 kg), n = 10 /treatment group] on their GIN infection status. Three forage paddocks (0. 40 ha) were set up at the Fort Valley State University Agricultural Research Station (Fort Valley, GA) for an 8 -week trial. The goats in each paddock were supplemented with a commercial feed pellet at 0. 45 kg/head/d for the first 4 weeks of the trial, and 0. 27 kg/head/d for the final 4 weeks. Forage samples taken at the start of the trial were analyzed for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content, and a separate set of SL samples was analyzed for CT in leaves, stems, and whole plant using the benzyl mercaptan thiolysis method. Animal weights were taken at the start and end of the trial, and fecal and blood samples were collected weekly for determination of fecal egg counts (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV), respectively. Adult GIN was recovered from the abomasum and small intestines of all goats at the end of the experiment for counting and speciation. The CP levels were highest for SL forage, intermediate for SL + BG, and lowest for BG forage samples, while NDF and ADF values were the opposite, with highest levels in BG and lowest in SL forage samples. <b>Sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> leaves had more CT than stems (16. 0 g vs. 3. 3 g/ 100 g dry weight), a slightly higher percentage of PDs (98...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyWalter H. FickPatch-burn grazing is a {{relatively}} new concept in terms of rangeland management. While numerous benefits have been associated with this system, in the tallgrass prairie of Kansas, cattle production and sustainability of rangeland are critical. In 2006, 253 ha at the KSU Bressner Range Research Unit in Woodson County, Kansas were subjected to spring patch-burn grazing (using one-third portions) and traditional full-burn grazing. Each treatment within the split-block design was replicated four times for 3 years. The objectives were to evaluate whether livestock performance would be compromised under this grazing system, to monitor the health of the rangeland, and to observe the usefulness of this tool as a potential control of the invasive plant <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> [Lespedeza cuneata (Dumont) G. Don]. In regards to cattle performance, burn treatments had no significant difference in average daily gain (p≥ 0. 10) in any of the 3 years. On average, cattle utilized 61 % of the current year’s forage production in patch-burned portions, which was higher (p≤ 0. 10) than that of unburned (30 %) and full-burn (41 %) portions. Results of the botanical composition show forb and woody plant composition did not differ between treatments, however differences (p≤ 0. 10) were present in grass composition. Total annual grasses increased 19. 1 percentage units under patch-burn and 2. 1 units under full-burn, while total perennial grasses decreased 18. 4 and 1. 1 units, respectively. When evaluated by treatment area (one-third portion), results indicated that the 3 -year cycle did allow enough time for recovery. At 2 years after treatment (2 -YAT), no significant difference in composition(p≥ 0. 10) was present between initial patch-burn portions and the full-burn pastures. Finally, in only 1 year of the study did cattle statistically consume a greater percentage of <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> plants (p≤ 0. 10) in the patch-burned portions (92 %) than in full-burned pastures (35 %). Biomass utilization did not differ (p≥ 0. 10) between burn treatments. Surprisingly, there was a trend for the number of plants in the sampled areas of the patch-burn portions to decrease throughout the cycle. However, {{at the conclusion of the}} 3 -year cycle, sericea densities did not differ(p≥ 0. 10) between treatments.

40|$|Chinese {{lespedeza}} is a warm season, perennial herbaceous plant. It has an erect growth form, {{ranging from}} about 3 to 5 feet in height, and leaves that alternate along the stem. Each leaf {{is divided into}} three smaller leaflets, about to 1 inch long, which are narrowly oblong and pointed, with awl-shaped spines. Leaflets are covered with densely flattened hairs, giving a grayish-green or silvery appearance. Mature stems are somewhat woody and fibrous with sharp, stiff, flattened bristles. Small (about in.) creamy white to pale yellow flowers emerge either singly or in clusters of 2 - 4, from the axils of the upper and median leaves. ECOLOGICAL THREAT Chinese lespedeza, sometimes called <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza,</b> is primarily a threat to open areas such as meadows, prairies, open woodlands, wetland borders and fields. Once it gains a foothold, it can crowd out native plants and develop an extensive seed bank in the soil, ensuring its long residence at a site. Established dense stands of lespedeza suppress native flora and its high tannin content makes it unpalatable to native wildlife as well as livestock. DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cessation {{of mining}} {{operations}} in Ducktown, TN, left 800 - 900 acres of barren copper mine tailings. Revegetation activities {{had met with}} limited success. In 1998, efforts for revegetation of the tailings materials began anew. The objective of this case history is to provide insight into decision making processes which resulted in conversion of 800 - 900 acres of barren mine tailings into a vegetated, productive landscape. Phase 1 began with intensive analyses of the tailings materials. Acid-base accounting registered a generally neutral to alkaline pH. Scattered areas were more acid with pH values measuring as low as 1. 9. Neutralization potential was adequate in most cases to counteract potential acid formation. Total elemental analysis indicated a maximum of 416 mg kg- 1 P (total) with essentially none plant available {{as measured by the}} bicarbonate P method. Utilizing these data, phase 2 was initiated with the installation of two one-acre plots with variables of 1) P treatments (0, 50, 100, and 200 lb acre- 1), 2) biosolid / non-biosolid applications, and 3) fescue / legumes (birdsfoot trefoil, <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza,</b> Korean lespedeza, and Kobe lespedeza).

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Controlling {{invasive}} species is a highly complex problem. The intricacy of the problem stems from the nonlinearity that is inherent in biological systems, consequently impeding researchers to obtain timely and cost-efficient treatment strategies over a planning horizon. To cope with {{the complexity of the}} invasive species problem, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that handles the problem as a full dynamic optimization model and solves it to optimality for the first time. We demonstrate the applicability of the model on a case study of <b>sericea</b> (<b>Lespedeza</b> cuneata) infestation by optimizing a spatially explicit model on a heterogeneous 10 -by- 10 grid landscape for a seven-year time period. We evaluate the solution quality of five different linearization methods that are used to obtain the MIP model, We also compare the model with its mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) equivalent and nonlinear programming (NLP) relaxation in terms of solution quality. The computational superiority and realism of the proposed MIP model demonstrate that our model has the potential to constitute the basis for future decision-support tools in invasive species management.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to find the effect of prolonged feeding of <b>sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> (SL) supplemented with sodium molybdate on changes in body weight, serum and liver concentration of trace minerals (TM), hematology, serum biochemistry, and gastrointestinal parasites. Thirty ram lambs (Katahdin and ¾ Katahdin × ¼ Romanov) were weaned; blood, liver, and fecal samples were collected and signs of internal parasitic infection on lambs were recorded. Lambs were supplemented with 900 g of alfalfa (n = 10; CON) or SL (n = 20) based supplement for 103 d. Within the SL group, half of the lambs were administered sodium molybdate (n = 10; SL+MO) to ameliorate a reduction of serum molybdenum concentrations observed previously. Body weight and body condition scores (BCS) were recorded every two wk. Supplementation of sodium molybdate (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) increased serum and liver concentrations of molybdenum in SL+MO lambs similar to that of CON diet fed lambs; however body weight was similar (P = 0. 74) between molybdenum supplemented and non-supplemented lambs. Serum and liver concentrations of TM, mainly molybdenum, zinc, copper, selenium, and cobalt were reduced in SL compared with CON fed lambs. Supplementation with SL reduced most of the hematological and serum biochemical values in SL lambs compared with CON fed lambs. Body weight, BCS, fecal egg counts and fecal oocyst counts were similar between the dietary treatments; however clinical signs associated with parasitic infection were reduced in SL compared to CON diet fed lambs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this review was investigated and identification structure, role of the tannins in plants structure. During growth and maturation period in plants some substances {{can be found in}} structure of them which they have essential role in plant fortune. These substances are called plants secondary metabolites. One of the most important of secondary metabolites is Tannins. The function of tannins in plants is a much discussed by previous researchers issue. A great deal of research with tannins has followed an approach that looks at biological relationships: taxonomy, phylogeny, biosynthesis, nutritional and physiological effects on herbivorous animals e. g. ruminants. Tannins are defined as phenolic compounds of high molecular weight ranging from 500 to more than 3000 which they found in plants leaves, bark, wood and bound to proteins that form insoluble or soluble tannin-protein complexes. They have been closely associated with plant defence mechanisms towards mammalian herbivores and insect. Tannins are divided into two main groups, according to their chemical structure and properties: hydrolysable (HT) and condensed tannins (CT). Hydrolysable tannins are usually found in lower concentrations in plants than CTs. Condensed tannins consist of flavanoid units (flavan- 3 -ol) linked by carbon-carbon bonds. They are found in many plant species such as Acacia spp, <b>Sericea</b> <b>lespedeza</b> as well as pasture species such as Lotus spp. In recent years many researchers demonstrated that tannins have positive effects on animals by anti microbial, anthelmintic, protein bypassed effects in ruminants...|$|E
40|$|Second place {{winner of}} poster presentations in the Natural Sciences and Engineering section at the 13 th Annual Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity Forum (URCAF) {{held at the}} Hughes Metropolitan Center, Wichita State University, April 9, 2013 Native grasslands in the Great Plains are {{threatened}} by the spread of <b>Sericea</b> (<b>Lespedeza</b> cuneata). Sericea is a non-native legume originating from Asia. Sericea infestations negatively impact the forage value and hay production from grasslands resulting in substantial economic losses to landowners. Furthermore, this invasion threatens the integrity of native and restored prairies as it chokes out native flora and alters the habitat. Although herbicides are available, effective control can be expensive because of {{the scale of the}} problem and the necessity of iterated application to combat the plant’s long-lived, extensive seedbank. Herein proposed is an optimization model to find economically efficient strategies to control the invasion of Sericea. Using empirical data, the model accounts for population growth rates, carrying capacity, seed dispersal, treatment costs, and economic loss due to invasion. The model is then utilized to minimize the discounted sum of damages, prevention/restoration, and control costs over time subject to two constraints: the spread of invasive species over space and time and the cost of resources to control and prevent Sericea. Results from model reflecting the outcome of different management scenarios are presented to give insight to economically efficient strategies for controlling Sericea in the Great Plains.
