While all CRT-based television systems produce such a noise, the higher number of lines per second in later standards produces frequencies (PAL's 15,625 Hz and NTSC's 15,734 Hz) {{that are at the}} upper end of the audible spectrum, which not all people are able to hear.

5000|$|The {{media for}} CD-RW has {{basically}} the same layers as CD-R media. The reflective layer is, however, a silver-indium-antimony-tellurium (AgInSbTe) alloy, which has in its original state, a polycrystalline structure and reflective properties. When writing the laser beam uses its maximum power (8 - 14 mW) to heat the material to 500-700 °C. This causes liquefaction of the material. In this state, the alloy loses its polycrystalline structure, assumes an amorphous state and lose its reflectivity. The lost reflectivity serves the same function as bumps on a manufactured CDs and the opaque spots on a CD-R which will {{be read as a}} [...] "0". The polycrystalline state of the disc forms the trenches, which is read as [...] "1". The <b>scanning</b> <b>signal</b> when reading is created by strong or weak reflection of the laser beam (not unlike the destructive interference of light caused by and used to read [...] "pits" [...] in pressed CD-ROMs). To erase the disc, the write beam heats the amorphous regions with low power to about 200 °C. The alloy is not melted, but returns to the polycrystalline state and is thus again reflective.|$|E

The medium-low-frequency periodic signal and multi-frequency harmonic signal (the large parameter signal) {{are common in}} mechanical failure, {{but it is difficult}} to achieve stochastic resonance in these signals detection. The signal modulation characteristic is used in this paper to transform the various frequency components into small parameter signals which satisfy the adiabatic approximation theory. On the basis of that, weak signal detection based on stochastic resonance theory is realized. Then a mixing circuit system based on stochastic resonance is designed, the circuit first makes a frequency selection processing with a mixer on the mixed signal between the measurable signal and a <b>scanning</b> <b>signal,</b> and then it is input to the nonlinear bistable system to realize signal detection based on stochastic resonance.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete design {{process of the}} mounting system, including the vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. According to the actual state of the mounting system, the 6 -DOF vibration model is established. The natural frequency and vibration mode are obtained using eigenvalue analysis. Considering the low-frequency vibration decoupling rate as the objective function, the design parameters (including mount hardness, thickness, and stiffness in all directions) that render the mounting system fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured are extracted, and the optimal parameters are used to design the mounting system. Subsequently, the mounting system is simulated and analyzed to study the vibration response. The torsional excitation of the shafting is calculated as the transmission excitation using the equivalent model, and the road excitation is simulated using the sinusoidal <b>scanning</b> <b>signal</b> based on the data of acceleration measured by the actual vehicle. A comprehensive analysis shows that the strength and dynamic characteristics of the front mount should be improved, and hence, topology optimization {{is applied to the}} metal frame. Finally, the vibration bench test of the mounting system is carried out to extract the acceleration signals in time domain and frequency domain of the upper and lower parts of the mounts. The data is analyzed and the vibration transmissibility is calculated using the corresponding root-mean-square values of acceleration. The results showed that the design process of the mounting system could well improve the vibration isolation performance.|$|E
