5|$|Hearing the <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} {{side of the}} river, Forbes uneasily moved {{towards the}} southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, the {{remaining}} Vertigo Tour concerts were postponed when {{the daughter of}} guitarist The Edge fell ill. During the interim, footage from the seven filmed shows was edited together, prompting the crew to request additional wide <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> back of the stadium and close-ups of the band members. When the tour was on its fifth leg in November 2006, an additional two shows were filmed in Melbourne to capture the extra footage. At the time, the songs appearing in the final cut of the film had already been selected and therefore only specific songs from the concerts were filmed.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2017, Judah {{announced}} that he would have his first fight in over 3 years on January 21 when he fights journeyman Jorge Luis Munguia (12-7, 4 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round bout at Sun National Bank Center in Trenton, New Jersey. The bout was an Internet-only pay per view. As expected, Judah won the bout via 2nd-round TKO. Judah connected with power <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opening bell, landed a left hook to the head of Munguia in round 2 which dropped it on his back. The referee stopped the fight at 1 minute and 27 seconds of the round.|$|E
5|$|Salo {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman, capable of being matched up against {{opposing}} team's top players, while also contributing offensively. His offensive game is characterized by his powerful slapshot. He has won numerous hardest shot titles with the Canucks in the team's SuperSkills competitions, clocking one shot at 102.7 miles-per-hour (163.5 kph) in 2012. As a result, he is used frequently on the powerplay, being set up by teammates for <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> point. A well-rounded defenceman, Salo also earns time on the penalty kill.|$|E

5|$|The film {{ran into}} {{production}} trouble in mid 2010 and {{was close to}} being shelved, with sources reporting that Thiagarajan sold the film to Santiago Martin to revive the project. The reports proved to be untrue, and Thiagarajan maintained {{that he was still}} the producer of the film. The film had also begun to surpass its budget, due to the casual nature of shooting and difficulties in creating historical sets. The first <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film and the video for three songs were unveiled publicly in March2011, with the publicity campaign initiated after this.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the first <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Royal Battery, the French {{defenses}} opposite fell silent, the only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries. British fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment, and at 16:30 flags of truce were raised over the city's bastions. Clermont's offer requested a 24-hour ceasefire to negotiate terms, but Braithwaite allowed only until 08:00 the following morning, during which time the construction of British earthworks would continue. Clermont, isolated and unsupported, accepted the terms, and the following morning Braithwaite's army entered the city and took possession, although the French garrison had seized liquor supplies during the night and were too drunk to surrender formally.|$|E
5|$|As a sophomore, Middleton led {{the team}} and {{finished}} ninth in the Big 12 in scoring at 14.3 points per game while also contributing 5.2 rebounds per game.

5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman naval {{presence}} at Beirut was completely annihilated, removing the only Turkish naval threat to Italian transports {{in the area}} and giving the Italians complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean Sea {{for the rest of the}} war. Casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy. Both Ottoman warships were sunk, with Avnillah alone taking 58 killed and 108 wounded. In contrast the Italian ships not only took no casualties, but no direct hits from the Ottoman warships as well. The damage was not restricted to the Ottoman naval vessels present at Beirut, as the city took heavy damage as well. Stray <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cruisers decimated the city. Fires broke out as a direct result of the stray gunfire, destroying several banks and part of the city's customs house as well as other buildings. Combined from the fires and shelling, 66 civilians were killed in the city along with hundreds of others wounded.|$|E
5|$|In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri {{plan their}} next heist. As Dixit's {{analysis}} has named Rio {{the location of}} Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, and Ali immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri {{to play a game}} of Russian roulette. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted <b>shots</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gun, neither is injured, because Aryan has not loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up {{on the top of a}} waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free.|$|E

Roy was named to the All-NBA Second Team on May 13, and was the first Blazer to make an All-NBA team since the 1991–92 season.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson's {{second game}} for the 2015–16 Michigan Wolverines men's {{basketball}} team, he posted 19 points on 6–6 shooting (5–5 3-point <b>shots)</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> floor against Elon. On December 12, Michigan defeated Delaware State 80–33, as Robinson made his first career start for Michigan by posting 11 points on 3–5 three-point shooting. At the time Robinson ranked third {{in the nation in}} three-point shooting percentage. Note that various sources have various eligibility thresholds. E.g., while BigTen.org only requires a minimum of 1.0 made per game, NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game. On December 23, Robinson tied his career high (set twice at Williams) with six assists against Bryant. The game marked the ninth consecutive game in which he made at least 3 3-point shots. Robinson entered conference play as the Big Ten leader in three-point field goal percentage and led the Big Ten Conference in both three-point field goals (52) and three-point field goal percentage (.565) through {{the first week of the}} Big Ten Conference schedule. On January 12, with leading scorer Caris LeVert sidelined, Michigan defeated (#3/#3) Maryland 70–67 as Robinson contributed 17 points on 5–9 three-point shooting. On January 23, Michigan defeated Nebraska 81–68, behind a game-high and season-high 21 points by Robinson. With the Cornhusker defense challenging his three-point shot, he scored more points inside the three-point line than outside it for the first time as a Wolverine. The January 27 game against Rutgers marked the 17th consecutive game in which Robinson made at least two three-point shots. Robinson made only one three-point shot in each the subsequent two games against Penn State and (#22/21) Indiana. Nonetheless, Robinson entered the February 6 Michigan–Michigan State men's basketball rivalry game against the #10-ranked 2015–16 Spartans as the Big Ten Conference leader in three-point shots made and three-point field goal percentage, but he was held to 0–3 three-point shooting in the game. The game marked the first time since the season opener, that Robinson did not make a single three point shot, ending a 22-game streak. On February 10, Michigan defeated Minnesota as Robinson posted a game- and season-high nine rebounds to go along with 14 points on 4-for-7 three-point shooting.|$|E
