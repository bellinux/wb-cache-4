Founded in 1875 Berkhamsted Cricket Club competes in the Herts League and in 2015 it ran twenty-five separate teams. The nine Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead Hockey Club teams are based just outside the town at the Cow Roast, playing their matches at Tring School. There are two Bowls clubs, Berkhamsted and Kitcheners. Berkhamsted and the surrounding area has a variety of road cycling and mountain biking routes, including traffic-free off-road routes in Ashridge Estate.

2500|$|When {{the modern}} Olympic Games were first held in 1896, {{not a single}} woman was allowed to compete. The International Olympic Committee did not promote gender {{equality}} in sports for its first fifty years, but it gradually began changing its views on the topic and followed the lead of many progressive countries that were starting to view women as equal in almost all spheres of life. This attitude {{has led to a}} positive trend in which women are becoming more involved in sports, especially evident at the Olympic level. Over time, as women gained more rights in other areas of their lives, this followed with more rights in areas regarding participation in sports. Not all countries have the same policies regarding women’s participation, but {{it can be said that}} women participation in sport has significantly increased over time. A country’s view on if women should be allowed to participate in sport involves the country’s culture and society. Sometimes culture and society do not move in lockstep with each other, though, which is what causes some women to be discriminated against for their desire to participate in sport. In some more traditional countries, sport is still considered a manly activity and not suitable for women participation.

50|$|Cultural {{barriers}} to <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> {{are by no}} means unique to Muslim societies. In a wide variety of contexts, researchers have found gender differences in people's belief in their own athletic abilities. On average, men and boys perceive themselves as more athletically competent than women and girls, which may increase their propensity to participate in sports. In adolescence, girls tend to have lower <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> rates, and this discrepancy increases with age. Additionally, women who participate in competitive sports are often negatively stigmatized as being lesbians, regardless of their actual sexuality.

40|$|Abstract: With {{regard to}} <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> in Europe, {{there are many}} {{national}} studies which are difficult to compare because of different ways of operationalizing <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> and different methods of analysis and statistical procedures. The aim {{of this paper is}} to check which determinants influence <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> in which way. With the help of data from the Eurobarometer 2004, regression analyses are carried out (1) for the whole European Union and (2) for all 25 member states separately. The advantage of these data is that they contain information about all 25 member states and, thus, results concerning <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> can be compared. In the European model, age, relationship, children and occupation negatively affect <b>sport</b> <b>participation,</b> while education years and town size have a significant positive influence on <b>sport</b> <b>participation.</b> The country-specific regression models show in some aspects different determinants of <b>sport</b> <b>participation.</b> Consequently, political advice with regard to the inclusion in the sport system has to refer to these peculiarities of <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> in the different European countries...|$|R

To date, research has focused exclusively on the morningness-eveningness dimension of chronotype, and {{little is known about the}} relationship between chronotype and various characteristics of <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> (e. g. training time). This investigation had three primary objectives: (1) to extend the current evidence base by exploring how <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> and PTLID relate to chronotype amplitude, (2) to explore how chronotype (morningness-eveningness and amplitude) relates to various characteristics of sport training and competition, and (3) to explore the independent and interrelated contribution of <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> and chronotype to PTLID. The sample included 976 non-athletes (493 women and 483 men) and 974 athletes (478 women and 496 men). Participants completed a battery of questionnaires targeting <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> characteristics, six positive PTLID (hope, optimism, perseverance, resilience, self-efficacy and trait emotional intelligence) and chronotype dimensions. Results showed that morningness-eveningness was negatively related to positive PTLID but was unrelated to <b>sport</b> <b>participation.</b> Greater diurnal fluctuations (amplitude dimension) were associated with lower positive PTLID values, lower <b>sport</b> <b>participation,</b> and shorter training durations.

40|$|RATIONALE: Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} determinants of physical activity in patients with chronic illnesses, like asthma. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether baseline maternal and paternal beliefs, support and parenting were associated with changes in <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> of adolescents with asthma, and investigate the moderating effect of sex. METHODS: In a population-based cohort study, during home visits in 2012 and 2013, 253 adolescents completed a questionnaire assessing their <b>sport</b> <b>participation.</b> Both parents reported their sport-specific parenting (support, general and asthma-specific beliefs, self-efficacy to encourage <b>sport</b> <b>participation).</b> The collected data was described using descriptive statistics. Path and multi-group analyses were used to examine whether baseline parental factors predicted change in adolescent <b>sport</b> <b>participation,</b> multi-group analyses examined the moderating effect of sex. For all analyses probability p value less than the accepted level of significance alpha= 0. 05 (p< 0. 05) were taken as significant effects. RESULTS: Few parental factors associated with changes in <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> of the adolescents, sex did not moderate the associations.

Research methods: A worldwide systematic review of English language evidence returned 1, 778 sources iteratively reduced by the author panel, on advice from an international review panel, to 21 included sources that were quality appraised and synthesised narratively. The evidence {{was used to examine}} the influence of a demonstration effect on <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> engagement and to interrogate <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> legacy policy for London 2012. Results and findings: There is no evidence for an inherent demonstration effect, but a potential demonstration effect, properly leveraged, may deliver increases in <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> frequency and re-engage lapsed participants. Despite setting out to use London 2012 to raise <b>sport</b> <b>participation,</b> successive UK governments’ policy failures to harness the potential influence of a demonstration effect on demand resulted in failure to deliver increased participation. Implications: If the primary justification for hosting an Olympic Games is the potential impact on <b>sport</b> <b>participation,</b> the Games are a bad investment. However, the Games can have specific impacts on <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> frequency and re-engagement, and if these are desirable for host societies, are properly leveraged by hosts, and are one among a number of reasons for hosting the Games, then the Games may be a justifiable investment in <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> terms...|$|R

The current study is a systematic review of 17 longitudinal studies examining the relationship between <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> and alcohol and drug use among adolescents. Results indicated that <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> is associated with alcohol use, with 82 % of the included studies (14 / 17) showing a significant positive relationship. <b>Sport</b> <b>participation,</b> however, appears to be related to reduced illicit drug use, especially use of non-cannabis related drugs.
