Their involvement in many physiological processes makes them interesting targets for drug development. Determination {{of the structure}} of these receptors will help to design more specific drugs, however, their structural characterization has so far been hampered by the low expression and their inherent instability in detergents which made protein engineering indispensable for structural and biophysical characterization. Several approaches to stabilize the receptors in a particular conformation have led to breakthroughs in GPCR structure determination. These include truncations of the flexible regions, <b>stabilization</b> <b>by</b> antibodies and nanobodies, fusion partners, high affinity and covalently bound ligands as well as conformational <b>stabilization</b> <b>by</b> mutagenesis.
