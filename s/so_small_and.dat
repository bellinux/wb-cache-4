5|$|Denning {{was born}} on 23 January 1899 in Whitchurch, Hampshire, to Charles Denning, a draper, and his wife Clara Denning (née Thompson). He was one of six children; his older brother Reginald Denning later became a noted staff officer with the British Army, {{and his younger brother}} Norman Denning became Director of Naval Intelligence and Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Intelligence). Denning was born two months earlier than {{expected}} and almost died at birth; he was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> weak that he was nicknamed 'Tom Thumb' and could fit in a pint pot. He was named after Alfred the Great by his sister Marjorie, and was baptised on 23 April 1899 at All Hallows Church, Whitchurch.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies. A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E

25|$|Those Karaites who {{are new to}} the Karaite {{lifestyle}} do {{not have}} such an inheritance or tradition and tend to rely heavily upon just the Tanakh and those practices mentioned in it, and to adapt Biblical practices to their cultural context. Karaite communities are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> generally isolated, that their members commonly adopt the customs of their host country. In Israel, too, traditional Karaites tend to be culturally assimilated into mainstream society (both secular and Orthodox).|$|E
25|$|The 1990s {{showed a}} major {{development}} in the health ministries of emerging nations, like Africa. As a result, these developing nations requested that those offering medical treatment have required registered qualifications. In order to provide academically recognized qualifications, Medical Service Ministries found {{that it would have}} to merge with a university. However, since class sizes were <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> the cost to run the school was only increasing, Medical Service Ministries decided to discontinue training in 1996.|$|E

25|$|During these {{sessions}} the Federalist Party was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> weak that partisan divisions mattered {{much less than}} the personal relationships that developed among the members. McLane quickly became a friend and admirer of William H. Crawford and Martin Van Buren, {{and at the same time}} became an opponent of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. These friendships were based more on personality than policy agreement, and were so important that McLane was one of Crawford’s strongest proponents in the presidential election of 1824. Once Crawford returned to Georgia, McLane, Van Buren, and the other Crawford supporters fell into the party of Andrew Jackson. This was all the easier for him given his existing friendship with Martin Van Buren, who became his mentor and advocate.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Luc Gabolde {{published}} an important study that statistically compared {{the number of}} surviving scarabs found under Thutmose I, Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. While monuments can be usurped, scarabs are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> comparatively insignificant that altering their names would be impractical and without profit; hence, they provide a far better insight into this period. Hatshepsut's reign {{is believed to have}} lasted for 21 years and 9 months. Gabolde highlighted, in his analysis, the consistently small number of surviving scarabs known for Thutmose II compared to Thutmose I and Hatshepsut respectively; for instance, Flinders Petrie's older study of scarab seals noted 86 seals for Thutmose I, 19 seals for Thutmose II and 149 seals for Hatshepsut while more recent studies by Jaeger estimate a total of 241 seals for Thutmose I, 463 seals for Hatshepsut and only 65 seals for Thutmose II. Hence, unless there was an abnormally low number of scarabs produced under Thutmose II, this would indicate that the king's reign was rather short-lived. On this basis, Gabolde estimated Thutmose I and II's reigns to be approximately 11 and 3 full years, respectively. Consequently, the reign length of Thutmose II has been a much debated subject among Egyptologists with little consensus given the small number of surviving documents for his reign.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} map a body's {{gravitational}} influence, {{it is useful}} to think about what physicists call probe or test particles: particles that are influenced by gravity, but are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> light that we can neglect their own gravitational effect. In the absence of gravity and other external forces, a test particle moves along a straight line at a constant speed. In the language of spacetime, this is equivalent to saying that such test particles move along straight world lines in spacetime. In the presence of gravity, spacetime is non-Euclidean, or curved, and in curved spacetime straight world lines may not exist. Instead, test particles move along lines called geodesics, which are [...] "as straight as possible", that is, they follow the shortest path between starting and ending points, taking the curvature into consideration.|$|E

500|$|Next {{came the}} action {{sequences}} {{and the battle}} for the Enterprise, a phase the filmmakers dubbed [...] "Borg Hell". Frakes directed the Borg scenes similar to a horror film, creating as much suspense as possible. To balance these elements he added more comedic elements to the Earth scenes, intended to momentarily relieve the audience of tension before building it up again. Leonetti reconfigured the lighting to reflect the takeover of the ship interiors. [...] "When the ship gets Borgified, everything is changed into more of a squared-off, robotic look with sharp edges but rounded images," [...] he explained. To give the corridor walls more shape, Leonetti lit them from underneath. Since the halls were <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> the ceilings would be visible in many of the shots, special attention was paid to hiding the light fixtures.|$|E
500|$|Jerry Alan West {{was born}} into a poor {{household}} in Chelyan, West Virginia. He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician. [...] West was a shy, introverted boy, who became even more withdrawn when his closest brother David died in the Korean War at age 22 when Jerry was 12. He was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent him from getting seriously hurt. Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as [...] "obsessive".|$|E

[...] Later, in Profiles of the Future, he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of his success in Camille, Sothern was given a part in Tom Taylor's Our American Cousin at Laura Keene's Theatre. This piece would later become famous as the play that Abraham Lincoln was {{watching}} when he was assassinated. Sothern's role was Lord Dundreary, a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. At first, he was reluctant to accept the role; it was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> unimportant that he felt it beneath him and feared it might damage his reputation. He mentioned his qualms to his friend, Joseph Jefferson, who had been cast in the leading role of Asa Trenchard in the play. Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: [...] "There are no small parts, only small actors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Street musicians {{began to}} breakdance in Yoyogi Park, {{including}} DJ Krush {{who has become}} a world-renowned DJ after arising from the Yoyogi Park scene. In 1986 an all hip hop club opened in Shibuya. While interest in hip-hop in Japan grew some during the 1980s and early 1990s, the rap scene remained fairly small and rather marginalized. One reason for the rap scene to remain <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> {{a little bit less}} popular compared to hip hop is {{because of the fact that}} the Japanese language does [...] "not contain stress accents and sentences must end with one of a few simple verb endings." [...] Ito Seiko, Chikado Haruo, Tinnie Punx and Takagi Kan were rappers that emerged from Japan at this time, and they proved to be rather successful.|$|E

[...] He also runs everything down. [...] "He's got a great heart", said Larry Stefanki, who coached Andy Roddick and has previously worked with John McEnroe, Marcelo Ríos, Fernando González and Tim Henman.

[...] It's like they're almost on cruise control and then want to play hard {{when it gets to}} 4-all or 5-all", Stefanki said. [...] "I think because Jesse's <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> he doesn't want to give any free points, he tries every point 100%. That's a big asset out there."

2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel <b>so</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E
2500|$|Right {{whales in}} the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic make {{a variety of}} vocalizations that have been {{researched}} extensively in the last decade. Because the numbers of right whales in the North Pacific are <b>so</b> <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> the whales are located in more remote areas, the study of North Pacific right whale vocalizations has had more challenges and there are fewer recordings. [...] All of the sounds recorded for North Pacific right whales have been recorded on the northern portion of their range—in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. It is unknown whether they made additional or different vocalization on their wintering grounds or on {{the western part of}} their range. From these relatively few samples it appears that right whales in the North Pacific make calls similar to those of other right whale species (Eubalaena spp.), although the calls may differ in some details and in the relatively frequency of usage of different calls.|$|E
