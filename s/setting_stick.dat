He was part of the first caravan to Aira and undertook several journeys to the newly established mission stations in Aira and Bedele. From 1941 to 1948 he was interned by the British occupying forces. Afterwards he returned to Germany, where he continued his work as missionary until he was banned by the leadership of the Hermannsburger Missionsanstalt.

50|$|Pitumarca {{is known}} internationally for its {{revival of the}} ticlla (discontinuous warp and weft) {{technique}}. This complex technique allows a weaver to change {{the color of their}} warp thread by inserting sticks into their warp. The weaver warps one color between one <b>set</b> of warp <b>sticks,</b> and another color between the following <b>set</b> of warp <b>sticks.</b> The weaver then weaves the two sections together to create a unified whole. The ticlla technique can be traced {{as far back as the}} Chavin culture, and was especially important to the Paracas and Nazca who created stunning textiles solely with ticlla. The technique is unique to the pre-Columbian cultures of Peru, and cannot be found anywhere else in the world.|$|R

In this paper, we present a new way for people to experience and express pixel art. Our digital art consists of a <b>set</b> of <b>sticks</b> made of acrylate resin, each of which refracts light from a parallel light source, in certain directions. Artistic users are able to easily rearrange these sticks and view their digital art through the refracted light projection on any planar surface. As we demonstrate in this paper, a user can generate various artistic images using only a single <b>set</b> of <b>sticks.</b> We additionally envision that our pixel art with rearrangeable sticks would have great entertainment appeal, e. g., as an art puzzle.

As a direct result, there exists an optimal swimming strategy to reach a desired configuration in minimum time. Numerical experiments for N= 3 (Purcell swimmer) suggest that the optimal strategy is periodic, namely a sequence of identical strokes.
