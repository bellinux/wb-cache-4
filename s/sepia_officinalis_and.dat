To test whether cuttlefish show behavioural responses to local water movements, juvenile Sepia officinalis were exposed to local sinusoidal water movements of different frequencies (0. 01 – 1000 [*]Hz) produced by a vibrating sphere. Five behavioural responses were recorded: body pattern changing, moving, burrowing, orienting, and swimming. Cuttlefish responded to a wide range of frequencies (20 – 600 [*]Hz), but not to all of the frequencies tested within that range. No habituation to repeated stimuli was seen. Results indicate that cuttlefish can detect local water movements (most likely with the epidermal head and arm lines) and are able to integrate that information into behavioural responses...|$|E

40|$|The ink gland of the {{cuttlefish}} <b>Sepia</b> <b>officinalis</b> {{has traditionally}} been regarded as a convenient model system for investigating melanogenesis. This gland {{has been shown to}} contain a variety of melanogenic enzymes including tyrosinase, a dopachrome-rearranging enzyme and peroxidase. However, whether and to what extent these enzymes co-localize in the melanogenic compartments and interact is an open question. Using polyclonal antibodies that recognize the corresponding Sepia proteins, {{we have been able to}} demonstrate that peroxidase has a different subcellular localization pattern from tyrosinase and dopachrome-rearranging enzyme. Whereas peroxidase is located in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in the matrix of premelanosomes and melanosomes, tyrosinase and dopachrome-rearranging enzyme are present in the rough endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport system, at the level of trans-Golgi cisternae, trans-Golgi network and coated vesicles, and in melanosomes on pigmented granules. These results fill a longstanding gap in our knowledge of the melanin-producing system in Sepia and provide the necessary background for dissection at the molecular level of the complex interaction between melanogenic enzymes. Moreover, the peculiar and complex organization of melanin in an invertebrate such as <b>Sepia</b> <b>officinalis</b> is surprising <b>and</b> could provide the basis for understanding the process in more evolved systems such as that of mammals...|$|R

The {{relationship}} between the fish stock on the continental shelf and the Bane d'Arguin {{is important for the}} management of the Mauritanian marine living resources.

At a low location on the tidal flat we caught significantly (p= 0. 006) more fish specimens with a sliding net compared to a location higher on the tidal flat. For the fykes there was no difference. The fish species were mainly predating on amphipods, shrimps, bivalves and gastropods. Most of the prey species were intertidal species caught at the tidal flat.

40|$|Fish is a {{good source}} of {{high-quality}} protein, vitamins and other essential nutrients, especially essential fatty acids (EFAs), known as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Nutritionists have suggested an intake of 35 g or more of fish daily and two fatty fish-meals per week as to reduce the relative risk of death from coronary heart diseases. However, fish consumption also has been identified as one of the primary route of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

Doxycycline also demonstrated significantly greater affinity for native epidermal skin than for delipidised skin showing that doxycycline, a charged polar molecule, has affinity for the intercellular lipid matrix in addition to the proteinaceous domain. For native skin it was estimated that saturation would be reached at approximately 140 μg cm− 2; for delipidised skin it was estimated to be 60 μg cm− 2.
