5000|$|It is {{apparent}} {{that the effects of}} habitat fragmentation across all habitat types selected by sharp-tailed grouse are impacting this species. The management of sharp-tailed grouse habitat has changed over the years from observational (making sure current habitat is maintained) to more hands on approach. The management of lekking habitat and winter habitat are not as clearly defined in the literature as nesting and brood rearing habitat assessment and management. The development of the Robel pole and cover boards has become a key tool in habitat assessment providing land managers a means to inventory and study habitat preferences based on vegetation structure and density. The Robel pole has become the more favored of the two methods in recent years for habitat assessment. The United States forest Service (USFS) uses visual obstruction readings (VOR) to <b>set</b> <b>stocking</b> densities for cattle based on the current years standing residual vegetation [...] This method is currently conducted on the USFS Little Missouri Grasslands, Sheyenne National Grasslands, Cedar River National Grassland, and Grand River National Grassland, all found in the Dakota Prairie National Grasslands in North and South Dakota(Forest Service, Northern Region (USDA).2001) [...]The Robel pole is a non-destructive method for inventorying vegetative biomass (Robel 1970; Benkobi et al. 2000). This method was used to create a habitat suitability index based on vegetation visual obstruction (VO), ranging from 0-30.5 cm with a suitability index rating of 0-1.0 (Prose 1987). Studies of nesting habitat by Prose et al. (2002) in the Nebraska Sandhills found that nesting sharp-tailed grouse selected nest sites with visual obstruction readings (VOR) of more than 4 cm. Similarly, Clawson and Rottella (1998) observed that 58% of nests (432 of 741) in Southwestern Montana were located in sites with an average VOR of 24 cm. The other nests in this study were located in sites with VOR’s of 11-18 cm. Reece et al. (2001) observed that sites with a VO of less than 5 cm near possible nesting locations indicated a decline in quality nesting habitat as average VO declined. The use of the Robel pole to assess habitat for sharp-tailed grouse has given managers a target height of vegetation structure to have {{at the end of the}} grazing season. This allows managers to set the appropriate stocking rate to best attain a desired vegetation height. As a rule of thumb, the average VOR reading for suitable grouse nesting habitat is 3.5in (8.89 cm). Lekking habitat can be managed by burning, mowing, clear cutting, and grazing across the entire range of the sharp-tailed grouse subspecies. Ammann (1957) found that leks that contained woody vegetation did not exceed 30% of the total lek area. Similarly, Moyles (1989) found a negative correlation with increased in aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) on lekking sites and the number of displaying males present. Trees may provide perches for avian predators but further work needs to be done on the effects of tree encroachment (Manzer and Hannon 2005).|$|E

The pasture was submitted to two forage offers (10 and 20 kg of dry matter by 100 kg live weight) in two grazing methods (<b>set</b> <b>stocking</b> and rotational). The parasitic infestation was analyzed in litter and in different forage strata: above 15, 10 – 15, 5 – 10, 2. 5 – 5, and 0 – 2. 5 cm; parasitic burden in sheep was evaluated through parasitological tests; and marked tillers were used for selective diet evaluation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{combinations}} of different fertiliser rates and grazing methods applied to phalaris-based pastures on an acid, saline, yellow sodosol on the Dundas Tablelands of western Victoria (mean annual rainfall 623 mm) were measured from 1997 to 2000. The {{objective was to}} help identify management systems that improve phalaris growth and persistence, water use, and animal production, and thereby the productivity and sustainability of grazing systems. Pastures were either set stocked with low [mean 6. 4 kg phosphorus (P) /ha. year] or high (mean 25 kg P/ha. year) fertiliser rates, or rotationally grazed with high fertiliser (mean 25 kg P/ha. year). Rotational grazing was implemented as either a simple ' 4 -paddock' system (fixed rotation length), or a more intensive system where rotation length varied with pasture growth rate. Unreplicated paddocks of volunteer pasture (dominated by onion grass and annual grass weeds) receiving an average of 8 kg P/ha. year were also monitored. All treatments were stocked with spring-lambing Merino ewes. Stocking rate was an emergent property of each treatment, and was driven by pasture quality and availability. Total pasture herbage accumulation ranged from 7150 to 9750 kg DM/ha. year and was significantly lower on the set-stocked, low-fertility treatment than on all other treatments. A significant treatment. day effect in the spline analysis of herbage mass was explained by a trend toward higher pasture mass in the rotationally grazed treatments than set-stocked treatments from the break of season until mid-spring. Rotational grazing led to significantly higher phalaris herbage accumulation than <b>set</b> <b>stocking</b> (mean 3680 v. 2120 kg DM/ha. year), but significantly lower subterranean clover herbage accumulation (1440 v. 2490 kg DM/ha. year). Despite the stronger growth of deep-rooted phalaris in the rotationally grazed treatments, maximum soil water deficits {{at the end of}} summer differed only slightly between treatments, with the difference between driest and wettest treatments amounting to only 14 mm. Summer growth of phalaris was apparently insufficient to generate significant differences in soil water extraction at depth, even when phalaris content was increased by rotational grazing, and re-wetting of the soil profile occurred at a similar rate for all treatments. Rotationally grazed treatments supported higher stocking rates than set-stocked treatments at high fertiliser rates (mean 14. 9 v. 13. 7 ewes/ha), but apparent losses in pasture feeding value due to lower legume content under rotational grazing meant that there were few significant differences between treatments in lamb production per hectare. The experiment showed that grazing method can have a substantial and rapid effect on pasture botanical composition. There are clear opportunities for producers to use temporal and spatial combinations of <b>set</b> <b>stocking</b> and rotational grazing to manipulate herbage mass and pasture composition within broad target ranges for achieving both animal production (e. g. high per-head animal performance) and sustainability (e. g. persistence of perennial grasses) objectives. Rigid application of either <b>set</b> <b>stocking</b> or rotational grazing imposes limitations on both pasture and animal production, and neither grazing method will optimise system performance under all conditions. The experiment also demonstrated that management and land-use changes that have much greater potential to increase water use than those examined here will be needed to ensure the sustainability of pasture systems in the high rainfall zone of western Victoria...|$|E

We conducted a 2 -yr study on Lassen National Forest, California, to aid development of cattle grazing strategies to enhance aspen regeneration.

Aspen suckers had greater nutritional quality compared to aspen understory and meadow vegetation regardless of season or year. Nutritional quality declined with season in all three vegetation types. Early-growing season foraging by cattle focused on meadow and aspen understory vegetation. Mid-growing season decreases in meadow and aspen understory nutritional quality coincided with a marked increase in utilization of aspen suckers.

The reduction in ryegrass tiller population from 5720 /m² in the infrequently and laxly grazed treatments to 4150 / m² in the frequently hard grazed pastures indicated the severity of that hard grazed treatment.

Botanical assessments were carried out on grassland plots with S. jacobaea occurrence and on neighbour plots without S. jacobaea. For these plots, we analysed the soil nutrients and the details of management practice such as type and intensity of management and fertiliser application (mainly slurry). The most impor-tant factors influencing the occurrence of S. jacobaea were related to management: There was a considerably high risk for the occurrence of the species on parcels with low nitrogen fertilisation, continuous-extensive grazing (<b>set</b> <b>stocking),</b> and a high openness of the sward.

40|$|Native grasses {{are more}} {{productive}} and persistent under rotational grazing than continuous grazing. Most hill country in SA, however, is continuously grazed. Graziers can immediately improve the productivity and persistence of their native grass pastures by, in simplest form, running {{twice the number}} of animals for half the time rather than <b>set</b> <b>stocking.</b> To fully implement rotational grazing, additional subdivisional fencing is generally required. With the current low profitability of sheep and beef cattle, graziers are unlikely to be able to recoup investment for subdivision. Graziers have tended to maintain stock numbers in spite of reduced fertiliser application. This has effectively increased stocking rates, putting even more pressure on native grasses. Native grass pastures should either be fertilised annually at maintenance, or the stocking rate reduced to offset the lowered pasture production. Without an increase in commodity prices, there is no easy solution to these issues. Hill country pastures are particularly at risk in the long-term due to the high cost of management and fencing and their environmental sensitivity. In spite of the remarkable persistence of native grasses, they are declining in most of the state’s hill country. Once they are lost, they are gone forever – current technology cannot commercially re-establish them.

In this paper we analyze a decentralized dealer network in which each independent dealer is given the flexibility to share his inventory. We model inventory sharing as a multiple demand classes problem in which each dealer faces his own customer demand with high priority, and inventory-sharing requests from other dealers with low priority. Assuming that each dealer uses a base-stock and threshold-rationing policy for his inventory-stocking and inventory-sharing decisions, we explicitly model the interactions between the dealers through inventory sharing and obtain a closed-form cost function for each dealer based on the steady-state distribution of the inventory levels at the two dealers. We then provide a detailed supermodularity analysis of the inventory-sharing and inventory-rationing game in which each dealer has a two-dimensional strategy <b>set</b> (<b>stocking</b> level and rationing level). We show that the full-sharing game (in which dealers precommit to sharing all of their on-hand inventory) and the fixed-sharing-level game (in which dealers precommit to sharing {{a portion of their}} on-hand inventory) are supermodular, and thus a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist. For the rationing game (in which dealers precommit to their stocking levels), we show that there exists a dominant strategy equilibrium on the dealers' sharing (rationing) levels. Finally, a comprehensive computational study is conducted to highlight the impact of the manufacturer's incentives, subsidies, and/or transshipment fees on the dealers' sharing behavior. inventory sharing and rationing, inventory competition, decentralized supply chains, noncooperative games...|$|E

40|$|In spring-lambing flocks an {{important}} {{objective is to}} achieve high lamb growth rate on pasture so that most lambs are drafted for slaughter by September. Lamb growth rate can vary greatly {{depending on the type}} of pasture being grazed. A series of grazing trials was carried out to assess the effect of pasture type, sward height, herbage allowance and concentrate supplementation on lamb growth rate pre and post weaning. Sward height was a useful indicator of the suitability of pasture for sheep grazing. A height of about 6 cm was near optimum for <b>set</b> <b>stocking</b> until late May. A decline in lamb growth rate frequently experienced in the month pre-weaning in June can largely be prevented if sward height is increased to 6 to 8 cm, or the flock grazed on aftergrass at a similar height. With rotational grazing, tight grazing to a residual sward height of 4 cm was beneficial in preventing the pasture becoming stemmy in June but reduced lamb weaning weight. Tight grazing in April when pasture is leafy is less restrictive on lamb growth than in June when the base of the sward is more stemmy. Post grazing heights of 4, 5 and 6 cm for April, May and June respectively, are suggested as a guide in order to achieve high lamb growth. There was a response to creep-feeding lambs. When concentrates were offered at 250 g/lamb/day from age 5 to 14 weeks the extra liveweight at weaning was associated with feed conversion ratios of 4. 4 to 6. 3 Creep grazing increased lamb weaning weight by over 2 kg and facilitated grazing the pastures tightly in June without penalising lamb growth. Lamb growth to weaning was better on pasture not grazed by sheep in the previous year and this benefit was at least partly attributable to lower level of parasites on the pasture. Lamb growth rate on pasture post-weaning varied greatly, from under 100 to over 200 g/day {{depending on the type of}} pasture grazed. For <b>set</b> <b>stocking</b> a sward height of 8 to 9 cm was required to maximise lamb growth. For rotational grazing, swards should be grazed down to about 6 cm. However the effect of sward height is modified by previous grazing management, in that tight grazing pre-weaning results in a more leafy pasture and higher lamb growth at comparable sward heights post-weaning. Pasture type also affected lamb growth. There was little difference between old permanent pasture and a mainly perennial ryegrass pasture when grazed at similar sward heights, or when lambs were given similar herbage allowances. However growth rates were considerably higher on grass/clover swards at equivalent allowances or similar sward heights. There was a close relationship between herbage allowance and lamb growth, with highest growth rate achieved at an allowance of about 5 kg of dry matter per lamb per day. Concentrate supplementation of weaned lambs on pasture (at 250 to 550 g/lamb/day) increased liveweight, carcass weight and kill-out proportion. Response to concentrates was slightly better on short grass. Feed conversion ratio for carcass gain ranged from 7 to 12 on short grass, 7 to 20 on long grass and was 14 when concentrates were offered ad libitum. Concentrate supplementation resulted in a higher proportion of lambs being drafted off pasture by late September (90 to 100 %) compared with 60 to 65 % for lambs on grass only.

It highlights the ability of large agricultural producers to <b>set</b> <b>stocks</b> at strategic levels to influence the price of agricultural goods (and hence the income distribution) and the ability of manufacturers to raise their profit margins. In both cases, access to credit is essential, thus forming the link to endogenous money theory. This gives monetary policy a critical rol...|$|R
