2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to make desecration of the Australian flag a crime. In 1953, during the second reading debate on the Flags Act, {{the leader of the}} Opposition, Arthur Calwell, unsuccessfully called for provisions {{to be added to the}} bill to criminalise desecration. Michael Cobb introduced private member's bills in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 to ban desecration, but on each occasion the bill lapsed. In 2002, the leader of the National Party, John Anderson, proposed to introduce laws banning desecration of the Australian flag, a call that attracted support from some parliamentarians both in his own party and the senior Coalition partner, the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister, John Howard, rejected the calls stating that [...] "...in the end I guess it's part of the sort of free <b>speech</b> <b>code</b> that we have in this country". In 2003, the Australian Flags (Desecration of the Flag) Bill was tabled in Parliament by Trish Draper without support from Howard and subsequently lapsed. In 2006, following a flag-burning incident during the 2005 Cronulla riots and a burnt flag display by a Melbourne artist, Liberal MP Bronwyn Bishop introduced the Protection of the Australian National Flag (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2006. This bill sought to make it [...] "a criminal offence to wilfully destroy or otherwise mutilate the Flag in circumstances where a reasonable person would infer that the destruction or mutilation is intended publicly to express contempt or disrespect for the Flag or the Australian Nation." [...] The bill received a second reading but subsequently lapsed and did not go to vote in the House of Representatives.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This chapter {{addresses}} {{issues associated}} with automatic speech recognition (ASR) over mobile networks, and introduces several techniques for improving speech recognition performance. One of these issues is the performance degradation of ASR over mobile net-works that results from distortions produced by <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> algorithms employed in mobile communication systems, transmission errors occurring over mobile telephone channels, and ambient background noise that can be particularly severe in mobile domains. In particular, <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> algorithms have difficulty in modeling speech in ambient noise environments. To overcome this problem, noise reduction techniques can be integrated into <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> algorithms to improve reconstructed speech quality under ambient noise conditions, or <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> parameters can be made more robust with respect to ambient noise. As an alternative to mitigating the effects of <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> distortions in the received speech signal, a bit-stream-based framework has been proposed. In this framework, the direct transformation of <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> parameters to <b>speech</b> recognition parameters is performed {{as a means of}} im-proving ASR performance. Furthermore, it is suggested that the receiver-side enhancement of <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> parameters can be performed using either an adaptation algorithm or model compensation. Finally, techniques for reducing the effects of channel errors are also discussed in this chapter. These techniques include frame erasure concealment for ASR, soft-decoding, and missing feature theory-based ASR decoding...|$|R

Despite {{enormous}} {{advances in}} digital communication, {{the voice is}} still the primary tool with which people exchange ideas. However, uncompressed digital speech tends to require prohibitively high data rates (upward of 64 kbps), making it impractical for many applications. <b>Speech</b> <b>coding</b> {{is the process of}} reducing the data rate of digital voice to manageable levels. Parametric speech coders or vocoders utilise a-priori information about the mechanism by which speech is produced in order to achieve extremely efficient compression of speech signals (as low as 1 kbps). The greater part of this thesis comprises an investigation into parametric <b>speech</b> <b>coding.</b> This consisted of a review of the mathematical and heuristic tools used in parametric <b>speech</b> <b>coding,</b> as well as the implementation of an accepted standard algorithm for parametric voice coding. In order to examine avenues of improvement for the existing vocoders, we examined some of the mathematical structure underlying parametric <b>speech</b> <b>coding.</b> Following on from this, we developed a novel approach to parametric <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> which obtained promising results under both objective and subjective evaluation. An additional contribution by this thesis was the comparative subjective evaluation of the effect of parametric <b>speech</b> <b>coding</b> on English and Xhosa speech.
