5|$|Former McKinsey <b>senior</b> <b>executives,</b> Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though {{the manner in which}} it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the layoff of Icos employees, {{other aspects of the}} acquisition were equally controversial, such as assertions that Icos was being sold too cheaply and that conflicts of interest existed. The latter related to Icos <b>senior</b> <b>executives,</b> who– despite poor stock performance, in part from failed clinical development programs and an inability to successfully license drugs over the preceding years– were to be massively compensated upon a successful acquisition.|$|E
5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his <b>senior</b> <b>executives</b> hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} of <b>senior</b> <b>executive</b> compensation {{in real estate}} investment trusts (REITs) has found REIT size as the sole statistically significant determinant of compensation. This research finds that size is only one of several determinants of equity REITs (EREIT) <b>senior</b> <b>executive</b> compensation. In addition to size as measured by EREIT market value, the designation of the EREIT as a retail EREIT, the percentage of stock owned by the <b>senior</b> <b>executive,</b> the dollar amount of dividends paid to the <b>senior</b> <b>executive</b> and the number of years since an EREIT’s initial public offering were found to be significant factors impacting <b>senior</b> <b>executive</b> compensation. The results also contrast with the general executive compensation literature that shows proxies for size as the primary determinants of executive compensation. This research indicates the need for industry specific compensation models to account for variation in executive compensation. ...|$|R

5|$|The bank's {{expansion}} strategy hit {{trouble with}} {{the stock market crash}} of 1987 and involvement in the financial scandal surrounding the collapse of Blue Arrow. The Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair was critical of the bank's management and resulted in the resignation of several members of the board, including then chairman Lord Boardman. Later, the bank would divest its overseas subsidiaries. The North American operations were sold to Fleet Bank and Hong Kong Bank of Canada, and the Australian and New Zealand branches were sold to Salomon Smith Barney and the National Australia Bank. Thereafter the bank concentrated on its core domestic business as the restyled NatWest Group, reflecting its modern positioning as a portfolio of businesses. In 1993, the NatWest Tower was devastated by a Provisional IRA bomb and the bank vacated the building and later sold it. Then, in 1997, NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm formed in 1992, revealed that a £50m loss had been discovered, revised to £90.5m after further investigations. Investor and shareholder confidence was so badly shaken that the Bank of England had to instruct the board of directors to resist calls for the resignation of its most <b>senior</b> <b>executives</b> in an effort to draw a line under the affair. The bank's internal controls and risk management were severely criticised in 2000 and its aggressive push into investment banking questioned, after a lengthy investigation by the Securities and Futures Authority. The bank's move into complicated derivative products that it did not fully understand seemed to indicate poor management. By the end of 1997 parts of NatWest Markets had been sold, others becoming Greenwich NatWest in 1998.|$|E
