Purpose: This study aims {{to compare}} {{the effects of a}} manual high velocity, low {{amplitude}} spinal manipulation and a mechanical force, manually assisted spinal manipulation in the treatment of sub acute lumbar facet syndrome with regards to pain, disability, lumbar spine range of motion and pressure pain threshold. These effects were based on two questionnaires, the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Oswestry Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire, lumbar spine range of motion readings using a digital inclinometer and pressure pain threshold readings taken with an algometer. Method: Thirty participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group received a manual lumbar spine manipulation using the Diversified Technique. The second group received lumbar spine <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> {{with the use of the}} Activator Adjusting Instrument. Treatment occurred over a three week period, with participants receiving treatment six times out of a total of seven consultations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of <b>spinal</b> disorders. <b>Manipulative</b> techniques are under debate because of the possibility of adverse events. To date, the efficacy of manipulations compared to sham manipulations is unclear. The purpose of the study is: to assess the efficacy of <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> compared to sham in adults with a variety of complaints. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, Central) along with a hand search of selected bibliographies were searched from inception up to April 2012. RESULTS: In total 965 references were screened for eligibility and 19 RCTs (n = 1080) met the selection criteria. Eight studies were considered of low risk of bias. There is moderate level of evidence that <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> has a significant effect in adults on pain relief immediately after treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] - 0. 68, 95 % confidence interval (- 1. 06 to - 0. 31). There is low level of evidence that <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> has a significant effect in adults on pain relief (SMD - 0. 37, - 0. 69 to - 0. 04) at short- term follow-up. In patients with musculoskeletal disorders, we found moderate level of evidence for pain relief (SMD - 0. 73, - 1. 21 to - 0. 25) immediate after treatment and low level of evidence for pain relief (SMD - 0. 52, - 0. 87 to - 0. 17) at short term-follow-up. We found very low level of evidence that <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> has no statistically significant effect on disability and perceived (asthma) recovery. Sensitivity analyses did not change the main findings. No serious adverse events were reported in the <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> or sham group. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> has a clinical relevant effect on pain, but not on disability or perceived (asthma) recovery.

2500|$|Spinal manipulation, which chiropractors call [...] "spinal adjustment" [...] or [...] "chiropractic adjustment", is {{the most}} common {{treatment}} used in chiropractic care. Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint. Its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion. High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation. Clinical skill in employing HVLA-SM thrusts depends on the ability of the practitioner to handle the duration and magnitude of the load.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy,</b> physiotherapy, treatment by the general practitioner, and placebo therapy in patients with persistent non-specific back and neck complaints. DESIGN [...] Randomised clinical trial. SETTING [...] Primary {{health care in the}} Netherlands. PATIENTS [...] 256 patients with non-specific back and neck complaints of at least six weeks' duration who had not received physiotherapy or <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> in the past two years. INTERVENTIONS [...] At the discretion of the manipulative therapists, physiotherapists, and general practitioners. Physiotherapy consisted of exercises, massage, and physical therapy (heat, electrotherapy, ultrasound, shortwave diathermy). <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> consisted of manipulation and mobilisation of the spine. Treatment by general practitioners consisted of drugs (for example, analgesics), advice about posture, home exercises, and (bed) rest. Placebo treatment consisted of detuned shortwave diathermy (10 minutes) and detuned ultrasound (10 minutes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in severity of the main complaint and limitation of physical functioning measured on 10 point scales by a blinded research assistant and global perceived effect measured on a 6 point scale by the patients. RESULTS [...] Many patients in the general practitioner and placebo groups received other treatment during follow up. Improvement in the main complaint was larger with <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> (4. 5) than with physiotherapy (3. 8) after 12 months' follow up (difference 0. 9; 95 % confidence interval 0. 1 to 1. 7). <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> also gave larger improvements in physical functioning (difference 0. 6; - 0. 1 to 1. 3).

For this we conducted a cross-sectional, population survey on a representative sample of 1, 067 adults from the six states and two territories of Australia in 2005 by computer-assisted telephone interviews. The sample was recruited by random digit dialling. Results Over a 12 -month period, approximately one in four adult Australians used either acupuncture (9. 2 %), chiropractic (16. 1 %) or osteopathy (4. 6 %) at least once. It is estimated that, adult Australians made 32. 3 million visits to acupuncturists, chiropractors and osteopaths, incurring personal expenditure estimated to be A$ 1. 58 billion in total.

40|$|Abstract Background Our recent {{investigations}} {{have demonstrated that}} cell cultures from subjects, who received a single <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulative</b> treatment in the upper thoracic spine, show increased capacity {{for the production of}} the key immunoregulatory cytokine, interleukin- 2. However, it has not been determined if such changes influence the response of the immune effector cells. Thus, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to determine whether, in the same subjects, spinal manipulation-related augmentation of the in vitro interleukin- 2 synthesis is associated with the modulation of interleukin 2 -dependent and/or interleukin- 2 -induced humoral immune response (antibody synthesis). Methods A total of seventy-four age and sex-matched healthy asymptomatic subjects were studied. The subjects were assigned randomly to: venipuncture control (n = 22), <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulative</b> treatment without cavitation (n = 25) or <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulative</b> treatment associated with cavitation (n = 27) groups. Heparinized blood samples were obtained from the subjects before (baseline) and then at 20 minutes and 2 hours post-treatment. Immunoglobulin (antibody) synthesis was induced in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulation with conventional pokeweed mitogen or by application of human recombinant interleukin- 2. Determinations of the levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M production in culture supernatants were performed by specific immunoassays. Results The baseline levels of immunoglobulin synthesis induced by pokeweed mitogen or human recombinant interleukin- 2 stimulation were comparable in all groups. No significant changes in the production of pokeweed mitogen-induced immunoglobulins were observed during the post-treatment period in any of the study groups. In contrast, the production of interleukin- 2 -induced immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M was significantly increased in cultures from subjects treated with spinal manipulation. At 20 min post-manipulation, immunoglobulin G synthesis was significantly elevated in subjects who received manipulation with cavitation, relative to that in cultures from subjects who received manipulation without cavitation and venipuncture alone. At 2 hr post-treatment, immunoglobulin M synthesis was significantly elevated in subjects who received manipulation with cavitation relative to the venipuncture group. There were no quantitative alterations within the population of peripheral blood B or T lymphocytes in the studied cultures. Conclusion <b>Spinal</b> <b>manipulative</b> treatment does not increase interleukin- 2 -dependent polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis by mitogen-activated B cells. However, antibody synthesis induced by interleukin- 2 alone can be, at least temporarily, augmented following spinal manipulation. Thus, under certain physiological conditions <b>spinal</b> <b>manipulative</b> treatment might influence interleukin- 2 -regulated biological responses. </p...|$|R

Patients were treated with UMC (NSAID's, corticosteroid injection or referral to physical therapy) and were allocated at random (yes/no) to <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> (manipulation and mobilization). Patient perceived recovery, severity of main complaint, shoulder pain, disability and general health were outcome measures. Data about direct and indirect costs were collected by means of a cost diary. Results <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> as add-on to UMC accelerated recovery on all outcome measures included. At 26 weeks after randomization, both groups reported similar recovery rates (41 % vs. 38 %), but the difference between groups in improvement of severity of the main complaint, shoulder pain and disability sustained. Compared to the UMC group the total costs were higher in the manipulative group (â‚¬ 1167 vs. â‚¬ 555). This is explained mainly by the costs of the <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> itself and the higher costs due sick leave from work.

40|$|Background: Dysfunction of the cervicothoracic {{spine and}} the {{adjacent}} ribs (also called the shoulder girdle) {{is considered to}} predict occurrence and poor outcome of shoulder symptoms. It can be treated with <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy,</b> but scientific evidence for the effectiveness of such therapy is lacking. Objective: To study the effectiveness of <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> for the shoulder girdle in addition to usual medical care for relief of shoulder pain and dysfunction. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: General practices in Groningen, the Netherlands. Patients: 150 patients with shoulder symptoms and dysfunction of the shoulder girdle. Interventions: All patients received usual medical care from their general practitioners. Only the intervention group received additional <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy,</b> up to 6 treatment sessions in a 12 -week period. Measurements: Patient-perceived recovery, severity of the main complaint, shoulder pain, shoulder disability, and general health. Data were collected during {{and at the end}} of the treatment period (at 6 and 12 weeks) and during the follow-up period (at 26 and 52 weeks). Results: During treatment (6 weeks), no significant differences were found between study groups. After completion of treatment (12 weeks), 43 % of the intervention group and 21 % of the control group reported full recovery. After 52 weeks, approxi-mately the same difference in recovery rate (17 percentage points) was seen between groups. During the intervention and follow-up periods, a consistent between-group difference in severity of the main complaint, shoulder pain and disability, and general health favored additional <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy.</b> Limitations: The sample size was small, and assessment of end points was subjective. Conclusion: <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> for the shoulder girdle in addition to usual medical care accelerates recovery of shoulder symptoms.

40|$|Background: Shoulder {{complaints}} {{are common in}} primary care and have unfavourable long term prognosis. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> of the cervicothoracic spine and the adjacent ribs in addition to usual medical care (UMC) by the general practitioner {{in the treatment of}} shoulder complaints. Methods: This economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized trial in primary care. Included were 150 patients with shoulder complaints and a dysfunction of the cervicothoracic spine and adjacent ribs. Patients were treated with UMC (NSAID's, corticosteroid injection or referral to physical therapy) and were allocated at random (yes/no) to <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> (manipulation and mobilization). Patient perceived recovery, severity of main complaint, shoulder pain, disability and general health were outcome measures. Data about direct and indirect costs were collected by means of a cost diary. Results: <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> as add-on to UMC accelerated recovery on all outcome measures included. At 26 weeks after randomization, both groups reported similar recovery rates (41 % vs. 38 %), but the difference between groups in improvement of severity of the main complaint, shoulder pain and disability sustained. Compared to the UMC group the total costs were higher in the manipulative group ((sic) 1167 vs. (sic) 555). This is explained mainly by the costs of the <b>manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> itself and the higher costs due sick leave from work. The cost effectiveness ratio showed that additional manipulative treatment is more costly but also more effective than UMC alone. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows that a 50 %-probability of recovery with AMT within 6 months after initiation of treatment is achieved at (sic) 2876. Conclusion: <b>Manipulative</b> <b>therapy</b> in addition to UMC accelerates recovery and is more effective than UMC alone on the long term, but is associated with higher costs...|$|R
