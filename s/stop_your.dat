Some even gathered at the Western Wall in a public prayer of mourning because of the center. They also gathered at the hotel at which the BYU President was staying at one point, carrying signs saying: [...] "Conversion is Murder!" [...] and [...] "Mormons, <b>stop</b> <b>your</b> mission now". Despite {{the intensity of the}} Haredi opposition, at no point did the protests become physically violent. In late 1985, the Haredim motioned for a no-confidence vote against the leading Labor Party. Prime Minister Shimon Peres organized a committee of eight, four for the center and four against, to debate the issue {{and come up with a}} solution either for or against the center's presence. Another committee was formed to look into the allegation that the money the church had put into Jerusalem was a bribe to gain Mayor Kolleck's support for the center (the committee found the church [...] "Not Guilty"). A subcommittee of the Knesset requested that the LDS Church issue a formal promise not to proselytize Jews. Some Israelis considered this discriminatory, as no other Christian church had been asked to do this in Jerusalem. Church leaders, however, agreed to comply and sent a formally signed statement soon after. Some Jews in the area were still uneasy and doubted the church's intent, [...] believing that religious belief among Mormons would supersede adherence to the law. One protestor stated that [...] "converting the sons of Judah, us, is a basic article of their faith[...] [...] [...] They regard themselves as sons of Joseph and believe there will be no Second Coming for as long as we and they do not fuse." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to you to help me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such as a calamity as a European war, I beg you {{in the name of}} our old friendship to do what you can to <b>stop</b> <b>your</b> allies from going too far." ...|$|E
