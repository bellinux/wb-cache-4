5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
25|$|Fleming is {{permitted}} to use the computer facilities at the London Institute of Electronics, where he is aided by Christine (Julie Christie). Using the computer to decode the message, Fleming realises that the message contains a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> {{for the construction of}} another more advanced computer. The message also contains another programme for the computer to run, and data to process. Bridger meanwhile, has sold out to an international conglomerate called Intel, represented by the sinister Kaufmann (John Hollis). The British government decides to build the computer at a military establishment at Thorness in Scotland. The computer is switched on and begins to output its first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions.</b>|$|E

25|$|MIPS I has thirty-two 32-bit {{general-purpose}} registers. Register $0 is hardwired to {{zero and}} writes to it are discarded. Register $31 is the link register. For integer multiplication and division instructions, which run asynchronously from other instructions, {{a pair of}} 32-bit registers, HI and LO, are provided. There is a small <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> for copying data between the general-purpose registers and the HI/LO registers.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{over the}} years, RISC {{instruction}} sets {{have grown in}} size, and today {{many of them have}} a larger <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> than many CISC CPUs. Some RISC processors such as the PowerPC have instruction sets as large as the CISC IBM System/370, for example; conversely, the DEC PDP-8—clearly a CISC CPU because many of its instructions involve multiple memory accesses—has only 8 basic instructions and a few extended instructions.|$|E

5000|$|A point <b>of</b> confusion: two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> {{instructions:}} Unlike the UTM, the RASP {{model has}} two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> - the state machine table <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> (the [...] "interpreter") and the [...] "program" [...] in the holes.

5000|$|In a lone dissent, Justice Stevens {{disagreed}} with the Supreme Court's major opinion that the abstract software was analogous to an abstract <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruction,</b> i.e., a blueprint, {{and could not be}} regarded as a [...] "component".|$|R
25|$|Later, the Alpha {{included}} byte-word extensions, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> {{to manipulate}} 8-bit and 16-bit data types. These instructions were first {{introduced in the}} 21164A (EV56) microprocessor and are present in all subsequent implementations. These instructions performed operations that previously required multiple instructions to implement, which improved code density {{and the performance of}} certain applications. BWX also made the emulation of x86 machine code and the writing of device drivers easier.|$|E
25|$|The {{instruction}} {{set for the}} floating point coprocessor also had several instructions added to it. An IEEE 754-compliant floating-point square root instruction was added. It supported both single- and double-precision operands. A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> that converted single- and double-precision floating-point numbers to 32-bit words were added. These complemented the existing conversion instructions by allowing the IEEE rounding mode to be specified by the instruction instead of the Floating Point Control and Status Register.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of a pinball machine's {{construction}} involves the wiring for the game's electronic system. A color-coded wiring arrangement is wrapped around pins and connectors on a circuit board. Technicians then follow through using a meticulous <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> {{to ensure that the}} almost-half mile of wire is engineered properly. During this time the playing field is set onto foam strips and a bed of nails. The nails are then pressed in the playing board as the bed raises and compresses them against the header. Afterward anchors come and are hammered into place. The anchors help secure a metal railing that keeps the balls from exiting the playing field.|$|E

25|$|Leopold (then 19 years old) and Loeb (18) {{settled on}} the {{kidnapping}} and murder {{of a young boy}} as their perfect crime. They spent seven months planning everything from the method of abduction to disposal of the body. To obfuscate the precise nature of their crime and their motive, they decided to make a ransom demand, and devised an intricate plan for collecting it, involving a long series of complex delivery instructions to be communicated, one set at a time, by phone. They typed the final <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> involving the actual money drop {{in the form of a}} ransom note, using the typewriter stolen from the fraternity house. A chisel was selected as the murder weapon, and purchased.|$|E
25|$|Because the Kentucky {{settlers}} {{lacked the}} authority, manpower, and supplies {{to launch the}} expedition themselves, in October 1777 Clark traveled to Williamsburg via the Wilderness Road to meet with Governor Henry, joining along the way a party of about 100 settlers who were leaving Kentucky because of the Indian raids. Clark presented his plan to Governor Henry on December 10, 1777. To maintain secrecy, Clark's proposal was only shared {{with a small group}} of influential Virginians, including Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, and George Wythe. Although Henry initially expressed doubts about whether the campaign was feasible, Clark managed to win the confidence of Henry and the others. The plan was approved by the members of the Virginia General Assembly, who were only given vague details about the expedition. Publicly, Clark was authorized to raise men for the defense of Kentucky. In a secret <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> from Governor Henry, Clark was instructed to capture Kaskaskia and then proceed as he saw fit.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 14th century, {{the first known}} waffle recipe was penned in an {{anonymous}} manuscript, Le Ménagier de Paris, written by a husband as a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> to his young wife. While it technically contains four recipes, all are {{a variation of the}} first: Beat some eggs in a bowl, season with salt and add wine. Toss in some flour, and mix. Then fill, little by little, two irons at a time with as much of the paste as a slice of cheese is large. Then close the iron and cook both sides. If the dough does not detach easily from the iron, coat it first with a piece of cloth that has been soaked in oil or grease. The other three variations explain how cheese is to be placed in between two layers of batter, grated and mixed in to the batter, or left out, along with the eggs. However, this was a waffle / gaufre in name only, as the recipe contained no leavening.|$|E

500|$|Ono's small {{book titled}} Grapefruit is another seminal piece of {{conceptual}} art. [...] First published in 1964, the book reads as a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> {{through which the}} work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is [...] "Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies." [...] Grapefruit has been published several times, most widely distributed by Simon & Schuster in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. , art critic for The Village Voice and Vogue, called Grapefruit [...] "one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960's." [...] He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner came in and [...] "did virtually the same things" [...] she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.|$|E
500|$|Between 1948 and 1950, she {{developed}} a theory by which these mobile elements regulated the genes by inhibiting or modulating their action. She referred to Dissociator and Activator as [...] "controlling units"—later, as [...] "controlling elements"—to distinguish them from genes. She hypothesized that gene regulation could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical genomes have cells of different function. McClintock's discovery challenged {{the concept of}} the genome as a static <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> passed between generations. In 1950, she reported her work on Ac/Ds and her ideas about gene regulation in a paper entitled [...] "The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize" [...] published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In summer 1951, she reported her work on the origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize at the annual symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, presenting a paper of the same name. The paper delved into the instability caused by Dc and As or just As in four genes, along with the tendency of those genes to unpredictably revert to the wild phenotype. She also identified [...] "families" [...] of transposons, which did not interact with one another.|$|E
500|$|Acton's book {{is divided}} into {{chapters}} with brief, often single word titles such as [...] "Fish". In a marked departure from eighteenth century English cookery books like Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, these are written as connected wholes. The chapter on fish begins with an essay on how to choose fish for freshness; there follows some {{advice on how to}} bake fish, and on the kinds of fat best used for frying fish. Suitable pans are illustrated. The recipes follow; these too are written as stories rather than simply as instructions. Where appropriate, recipes end with a list of ingredients, as well as the cooking time, in marked change from eighteenth century practice. Recipes are grouped, in the case of fish by species, and they form a connected story. Acton adds comments where she sees fit, indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from, and how much she likes it. For example, she begins her account of the John Dory with a recipe which is more of an introductory essay than a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions,</b> though given the simplicity of the recipe, it says all that a cook would need to know on the matter: ...|$|E

2500|$|A common {{misunderstanding}} of the phrase [...] "reduced instruction set computer" [...] is the mistaken idea that instructions are simply eliminated, resulting in a smaller <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some CPUs {{have been}} {{specifically}} designed {{to have a very}} small <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> [...] but these designs are very different from classic RISC designs, so they have been given other names such as minimal instruction set computer (MISC), or transport triggered architecture (TTA), etc.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{algorithms}} may {{complete the}} same task {{with a different}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> in less or more time, space, or 'effort' than others.
