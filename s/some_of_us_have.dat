Chapter VI cites the Book of Job, ii. 13); {{there is an}} allusion to the elder brother in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity ("that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own") (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads the Apocalypse to cope with her condition and interprets the parable of Dives and Lazarus so simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: [...] "It won't be division enough, in that awful day, that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> been beggars here, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> been rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 19). Margaret and John follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their [...] "unworthiness" [...] (Pollard, 1967). Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 39). Francis de Sales encourages her to seek [...] "the way of humility" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 41), despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimise and rationalise her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, {{on the brink of}} ruin like Job, tries not to be outraged while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation ("Not for you, John! God has seen fit to be very hard on you, very") and gives fervent thanks for the [...] "great blessing" [...] his existence gives her (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 50).|$|E
