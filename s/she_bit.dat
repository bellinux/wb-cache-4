500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, and she was so excited about the role <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> her script {{to make sure it was}} real. When filming ended, Duvall gave her a blue cowgirl shirt as a gift with a card that read, [...] "You really were Rosa Lee".|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
