50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The crank pins of the jackshafts drove - via a coupling rod - the crank pins {{of the two}} outer drive axles of the bogie. The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the crank pins of the two inner drive axles via a second coupling rod. Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the drive axles. From a maintenance point of view this kind of drive was cheaper than a complex <b>split</b> <b>coupling</b> rod, but during service it was considerably more bumpy. For this reason primarily, the locomotive was not used for high speed operation.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with elucidating a relationship between two common coupling methods for the continuous time Markov chain models utilized in the cell biology literature. The couplings considered here are primarily used in a computational framework by providing reductions in variance for different Monte Carlo estimators, thereby allowing for significantly more accurate results for a fixed amount of computational time. Common applications of the couplings include the estimation of parametric sensitivities via finite difference methods and the estimation of expectations via multi-level Monte Carlo algorithms. While a number of coupling strategies have been proposed for the models considered here, {{and a number of}} articles have experimentally compared the different strategies, to date there has been no mathematical analysis describing the connections between them. Such analyses are critical {{in order to determine the}} best use for each. In the current paper, we show a connection between the common reaction path (CRP) method and the <b>split</b> <b>coupling</b> (SC) method, which is termed coupled finite differences (CFD) in the parametric sensitivities literature. In particular, we show that the two couplings are both limits of a third coupling strategy we call the "local-CRP" coupling, with the <b>split</b> <b>coupling</b> method arising as a key parameter goes to infinity, and the common reaction path coupling arising as the same parameter goes to zero. The analysis helps explain why the <b>split</b> <b>coupling</b> method often provides a lower variance than does the common reaction path method, a fact previously shown experimentally.

40|$|Abstract- Composite {{materials}} {{are more and}} more used for primary structures in aerospace components. Examples are the new aeroplanes Boeing 787 and the Airbus A 350 which are mostly produced out of composites. In order {{to take advantage of the}} specific properties of composites the complexity of the structures increases more and more. On the other hand the costs for inspection after fabrication and especially in service have to decrease. Cost effective NDT-methods have to be implemented. This paper presents the possibilities of guided waves inspection techniques for complex composite components. Guided waves such as Lamb waves can be easily excitated and received by applied piezo-elements and penetrate large areas so that complex structures in principle can be inspected (SHM). However, for each frequency in minimum two different wave modes exist so that the responses are difficult to evaluate. The Lamb wave research is carried out within the EU project AISHA. The ultrasonic imaging technique is successfully used for the visualisation of the Lamb wave propagation. This combination between SHM and ultrasonic technique provides the optimisation of the sensor and actuator placement and also an interesting method for in-field inspection of air aerospace components. The coupling of the scanning receiver transducer can be carried out with water <b>split</b> <b>coupling</b> as well as with air (non contact) ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, design {{requirements}} for a dynamically viable, four-square type gear test machine are investigated. Variations of four-square type gear test machines {{have been in}} use for durability and dynamics testing of both parallel- and cross-axis gear set. The basic layout of these machines is illustrated. The test rig is formed by two gear pairs, of the same reduction ratio, a test gear pair and a reaction gear pair, connected to each other through shafts of certain torsional flexibility to form an efficient, closed-loop system. A desired level of constant torque is input to the circuit through mechanical (a <b>split</b> <b>coupling</b> with a torque arm) or hydraulic (a hydraulic actuator) means. The system is then driven at any desired speed by a small DC motor. The main task in hand is {{the isolation of the}} test gear pair from the reaction gear pair under dynamic conditions. Any disturbances originated at the reaction gear mesh might potentially travel to the test gearbox, altering the dynamic loading conditions of the test gear mesh, and hence, influencing the outcome of the durability or dynamics test. Therefore, a proper design of connecting structures becomes a major priority. Also, equally important is the issue of how close the operating speed of the machine is to the resonant frequencies of the gear meshes. This study focuses on a detailed analysis of the current NASA Glenn Research Center gear pitting test machine for evaluation of its resonance and vibration isolation characteristics. A number of these machines as the one illustrated has been used over last 30 years to establish an extensive database regarding the influence of the gear materials, processes surface treatments and lubricants on gear durability. This study is intended to guide an optimum design of next generation test machines for the most desirable dynamic characteristics...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a mesoscopic normal metal, where the spin degeneracy is lifted by a ferromagnetic exchange field or Zeeman <b>splitting,</b> <b>coupled</b> to two superconducting reservoirs. As {{a function of}} the exchange field or the distance between the reservoirs, the supercurrent through this device oscillates with an exponentially decreasing envelope. This phenomenon is similar to the tuning of a supercurrent by a non-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution between two voltage-biased reservoirs. We propose a device combining the exchange field and non-equilibrium effects, which allows us to observe a range of novel phenomena. For instance, part of the field-suppressed supercurrent can be recovered by a voltage between the additional probes. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figures, Europhys.

50|$|Typically, an exit clause is {{triggered}} {{in situations}} where a business partnership has severely deteriorated, and so the situation is often likened to a divorce. In {{the same way that}} drawn-out battles between a <b>splitting</b> <b>couple</b> can often leave children with emotional damage, so too can a business be damaged by drawn-out fighting between its owners. For this reason, experts in the area emphasize the importance of including an exit clause in a firm's shareholders' agreement in order to minimize the negative impact of a business-divorce. As with a prenuptial agreement, it is important to set out an exit clause early on in a business relationship when interests are still aligned and partners still like each other.|$|R

The separability of exciton and biexciton energy levels is ascribed to the corresponding direct, exchange and correlation energies calculated here through configuration interaction method. We demonstrate the possibility of enhancing photon entanglement concurrence via providing an energy coincidence for biexciton-exciton (XX → X) and exciton-ground (X → 0) emissions within the weak coupling regime.
