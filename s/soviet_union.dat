5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> would assume the office, though the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> never {{participated in}} the Eurovision Song Contest, but it made several {{attempts}} in the late 1980s. In 2009, Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education for the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due {{to the number of}} political reforms made by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> would impact on the relationships between the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and the capitalist countries of the west. Valery Leontyev was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the Communist Party of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> never entered the contest before dissolving.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> the Armenian SSR {{transformed}} from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> ceased to exist.

Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims {{from around the world}} to participate in the jihad against the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E

During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. The <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically advanced than the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E

5|$|The full {{understanding}} {{of the history of}} the late <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and of its successor, the Russian Federation, requires the assessment of the legacy of Leonid Brezhnev, the third General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> (CPSU) and twice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Leonid Brezhnev was the leader of the CPSU from 1964 until his death in 1982, whose eighteen-year reign was recognised as the time of social and economic stagnation in the late <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E
5|$|The secret {{protocol}} {{contained in}} the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> had relegated Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence.

(At about the same time, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> was exerting similar pressure on Finland.) About 30,000 Soviet troops entered the Baltic states during June 1940, followed by arrests of their leaders and citizens.|$|E
5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy.

While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E
