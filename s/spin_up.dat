5|$|For contact or semi-detached binaries, the {{transfer}} of mass from a star to its companion can also result in a significant transfer of angular momentum. The accreting companion can <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> {{to the point where}} it reaches its critical rotation rate and begins losing mass along the equator.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E
25|$|Each {{electron}} {{also has}} a spin quantum number, s, which describes the spin of each electron (<b>spin</b> <b>up</b> or spin down). The number s can be + or −.|$|E

25|$|Given that Shift must be {{held down}} until Windows checks for it, {{it may be a}} {{considerable}} amount of time before it becomes effective. The time taken primarily depends on the time to recognise the new hardware and the time taken for CD-ROMs to <b>spin</b> <b>up.</b> It is unsafe to rely on this method.|$|E
25|$|In the Stern-Gerlach {{experiment}} discussed above, {{the spin}} {{of the atom}} about the vertical axis has two eigenstates: up and down. Before measuring it, we {{can only say that}} any individual atom has equal probability of being found to have <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> or spin down. The measurement process causes the wavefunction to collapse into one of the two states.|$|E

The Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM's) were liquid fueled and required considerable time to fuel and <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> their inertial platforms before launch, during which time they were open to air attack. This meant that a Soviet sneak attack by bombers on the ICBM bases, combined with using their own ICBMs against Strategic Air Command's bomber bases could significantly damage the Air Force's strike capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The eigenstates of spin {{about the}} {{vertical}} axis are not simultaneously eigenstates of spin about the horizontal axis, so this atom has equal probability of being {{found to have}} either value of spin about the horizontal axis. As described in the section above, measuring the spin about the horizontal axis can allow an atom which was <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> to become spin down: measuring its spin about the horizontal axis collapses its wave function {{into one of the}} eigenstates of this measurement, which means it is no longer in an eigenstate of spin about the vertical axis, so can take either value.|$|E

25|$|The second {{satellite}} launch {{attempt on}} April 24, 1970 was successful. A CZ-1 {{was used to}} launch the 173kg Dong Fang Hong I (东方红一号, meaning The East Is Red I), also known as Mao-1. It was the heaviest first satellite placed into orbit by a nation, exceeding the combined masses of the first satellites of the other four previous countries. The third stage of the CZ-1 was specially equipped with a 40 m2 solar reflector (观察球) deployed by the centrifugal force developed by the <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> orbital insertion solid propellant stage. Therefore, the faint magnitude 5 to 8 brightness of the DFH-1 made the satellite (at best) barely visible with naked eyes was consequently dramatically increased to a comfortable magnitude 2 to 3.|$|E
25|$|Start {{with one}} setting exactly {{opposite}} to the other. All the pairs of particles {{give the same}} outcome (each pair is either both <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A {{small fraction of the}} pairs, say f, now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2f.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., <b>spin</b> <b>up,</b> spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

2500|$|To {{describe}} the experiment with spin + particles mathematically, it is easiest to use Dirac's bra–ket notation. As the particles {{pass through the}} Stern–Gerlach device, they are being observed by the detector which resolves to either <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> or spin down.

2500|$|Suppose {{now that}} instead of one {{particle}} in this box we have N particles in the box and that these particles are fermions with spin 1/2. Then not more than two particles can have the same energy, i.e., two particles can have the energy of , two other particles can have energy [...] and so forth. The reason that two particles can have the same energy is that a [...] particle can have a spin of 1/2 (<b>spin</b> <b>up)</b> or a spin of −1/2 (spin down), leading to two states for each energy level. In the configuration for which the total energy is lowest (the ground state), all the energy levels up to n=N/2 are occupied and all the higher levels are empty.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spinning}} charge {{generates a}} magnetic field that results in a magnetic moment proportional to the spin. In {{the presence of an}} external magnetic field, two spin states exist (for a spin 1/2 nucleus): one <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> and one spin down, where one aligns with the magnetic field and the other opposes it. The difference in energy (ΔE) between the two spin states increases as the strength of the field increases, but this difference is usually very small, leading to the requirement for strong NMR magnets [...] (1-20 T for modern NMR instruments). [...] Irradiation of the sample with energy corresponding to the exact spin state separation of a specific set of nuclei will cause excitation of those set of nuclei in the lower energy state to the higher energy state.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exception}} to this general trend is the helium-4 nucleus, whose binding energy is {{higher than that of}} lithium, the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are fermions, which according to the Pauli exclusion principle cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a <b>spin</b> <b>up</b> particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons, so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states. [...] Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single particle in nuclear physics, namely, the alpha particle.|$|E

As the detector was spun, the infrared target's position could be measured as it crossed the strips in the sensor's field of view. The MHV infrared detector was cooled by liquid helium from a dewar installed {{in place of the}} F-15's gun ammunition drum and from a smaller dewar located in the second stage of the ASM-135.
