After trying various methods I found [...] {{that the best}} results could be got by {{covering}} the foot {{by means of a}} [...] soft <b>stencil</b> <b>brush</b> with a composition of lampblack, soap, syrup, and [...] blue-black ink; wiping it gently from heel to toe with a [...] smoothly-folded silk handkerchief to remove the superfluous pigment, [...] and then applying a moderately flexible paper, supported on a soft [...] pad, direct to the foot." ...|$|E
40|$|I was {{commissioned}} by Western Australian designer Becky Chilcott to design and produce hand printed typographic artwork for the branding and design promotion for the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra 2014 season. The interaction of the players with historic and often metal instruments and classical music was the conceptual inspiration {{for the use of}} hand stenciled historic brass letter forms. I stippled the letters using a <b>stencil</b> <b>brush</b> and acrylic ink {{to create a sense of}} the hand made. My collaborator scanned and digitally incorporated the letters into a modern design context for production. It was widely disseminated in a number of media.

Later he added some other irregular forms tending towards the lyrical abstraction.

25|$|On 14 January 1949, {{staff at}} the Adelaide railway station {{discovered}} a brown suitcase with its label removed, which had been checked into the station cloakroom after 11:00a.m. on 30 November 1948.

5000|$|Unlike monoprinting, monotyping {{produces}} a unique print, or monotype, {{because most of}} the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. A second print from the original plate is called a [...] "ghost print" [...] or [...] "cognate". <b>Stencils,</b> watercolor, solvents, <b>brushes,</b> and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with no preliminary sketch.|$|R
