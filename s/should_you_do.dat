Is this Moorfields {{to muster}} in? or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of {{fornication}} is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one christening will beget a thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> puppy, if {{your hands}} were unbound?" [...] He took his {{prisoner}} by the breast of his doublet and shook him. [...] "Answer me! What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> Tchah! You empty windbag! You...." [...] And {{then came a}} torrent of words unknown to mademoiselle, yet of whose foulness her intuitions made her conscious.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said she}} at length, [...] "I am very {{glad that you}} have got good credit. What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with the money, if you {{borrowed}} it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{around the}} {{friendship}} sake <b>should</b> <b>you</b> it <b>do</b> = 'For {{the sake of}} friendship, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it.' ...|$|R
50|$|Indeed, as Aristotle says in {{his writing}} {{entitled}} Protrepticus, in which he exhorts the youth to do philosophy - he says this: if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> philosophy, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> philosophy, and if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>do</b> philosophy, then <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> philo-sophy. Therefore in every case <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> philosophy. For if philosophy exists, then positively we are obliged to do philosophy, since it truly exists. But {{if it does not}} truly exist, even so we are obliged to investigate how it is that philosophy does not truly exist. But by investigating we would be doing philosophy, since to investigate is the cause of philosophy.|$|R

6000|$|DEAR MR. CLEMENS,--You {{have the}} thanks of the Association, and the terms shall be as you say. But why give all of it? Why not reserve a portion--why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this work wholly without compensation? ...|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "That isn't the point, Willis. I couldn't ask {{the man to}} drink; I should {{consider}} it immoral. Besides, what <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if the cook came while I was away? You wouldn't know her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if {{you were}} like me--feeling that you were wrong and miserable, and {{dreading}} everything to come?" [...] It seemed that she was hurrying to make the utmost use of this opportunity to speak as she would.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shouldn't {{it be the}} reverse? You {{deserve the}} thanks for the way you helped me, though I am sorry it was {{necessary}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Let me see your hands," [...] I said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ancient? {{it is not}} {{four hundred}} years since Perugino died. But I <b>should</b> suppose <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not intend to ignore classic art?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then what <b>should</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> {{with the}} greetings? <b>Should</b> <b>you</b> have {{kept them in}} compensation? My {{sentence}} is that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> give back the roubles, and that your comrade gives you a greeting.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if you hadn't got a gun,--we {{might have}} gone out, you know, not thinking, just as we go fishing; and then a great lion might run toward us roaring, and we couldn't get away from him. What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Tom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did you do?" [...] she demanded. [...] "No, {{perhaps you}} had luck. Perhaps it's {{not fair to}} ask you that. It wouldn't apply. What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if you were me, {{if you had the}} chance {{to get out of it}} all the way that she has?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. Mrs. Cheveley made {{an attempt}} to ruin your husband. Either to drive him from public life, or to make him adopt a dishonourable position. From the latter tragedy you saved him. The former you are now {{thrusting}} on him. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him the wrong Mrs. Cheveley tried to do and failed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, but {{my father}} was as good a man as old Davy Ramsay, and as well to pass in the world, my lord; and, therefore, why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not marry me? <b>You</b> have <b>done</b> me harm enough, I trow--wherefore <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>do</b> me this justice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why <b>you</b> <b>should.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> {{all that}} <b>you</b> could, {{and no one}} could have done better who had not been taught as I have, and I am sure that no one will think the least degree the worse of you because you had no chance with me. Why, I thrashed a couple of ruffians in Alexandria, armed with knives, in a quarter of the time that it took me to beat you." ...|$|R
60|$|BENTLEY. I <b>should</b> think <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Johnny {{was rather}} rough on me, though. He told me nobody here liked me; and I was silly {{enough to believe}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this?' {{she said}} reproachfully, {{as soon as}} they were alone. 'He's emptied it once, though it held enough for ten people; and now he's not {{contented}} wi' the small, but must needs call for more o' the strong! And a stranger unbeknown to any of us. For my part, I don't like the look o' the man at all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here are {{two hundred}} golden crowns," [...] he added, handing the bag to the seaman. [...] "With these {{you can either}} settle on shore, or can build a stout ship and pursue your calling. <b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so, call her the St. Nicholas, in remembrance of the {{gratitude}} of the Order of St. John for your having saved that fort from the Turks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why. It's {{not your}} fault. Very {{sporting}} of your brother and all that, of course, though I'm blowed if I'd {{have done it}} myself; but why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> anything? You're all right. Your brother stood out of the team to let you in it, and here you are, in it. What's he got to grumble about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not so}} much--" [...] began Miss Wellwood, {{getting into}} a puzzle, and {{starting}} afresh. [...] "Indeed, my dear, my brother and I could not bear that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not like, only you see it would never <b>do</b> for <b>you</b> to {{seem to want to}} shut yourself up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't believe you. You {{brought him}} back because this man whom you call Fisher got to know of your plans. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> it because of me? Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> have put my {{interests}} before Mrs Ford's? I am nothing to you.' ...|$|R
50|$|B: The law <b>should</b> allow <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> {{that because}} this and that.|$|R
6000|$|... "All this is mine," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "and after I am gone it shall be yours. It was left to me as I will leave it to you, and in the {{meantime}} you may come and go as you choose and fill your pockets whenever you wish to. But there is one thing you must not do: you must never open that door yonder {{at the back of the}} room. <b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so, Ill-Luck will be sure to overtake you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Giovanni! my poor Giovanni!" [...] {{answered}} the professor, with a calm expression of pity, [...] "I know this wretched girl {{far better than}} yourself. You shall hear the truth in respect to the poisoner Rappaccini and his poisonous daughter; yes, poisonous as she is beautiful. Listen; for, even <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> violence to my gray hairs, it shall not silence me. That old fable of the Indian woman has become a truth by the deep and deadly science of Rappaccini and {{in the person of}} the lovely Beatrice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's got his plaything. That's all {{he cares}} about. I've {{been with him}} and his family almost from a baby, and have grown old a-serving him, and it don't matter to him whether I goes into the hedges and ditches, or where I goes. They say that service is no heritance, and they says true. I'm to go to-- But don't mind me. He won't, and why <b>should</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Do</b> you think you'll ever do half as much for him as I've done? He's got his {{troubles}} before him now;--that's the worst of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come again, {{my young}} friend," [...] he said cordially, [...] "and show {{some of these}} others how a young German <b>should</b> shoot! <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not need practice, but it does me good {{to see a man}} hold a rifle as <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> So!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What else am I to say? Is it {{possible}} that I should start suddenly upon such a journey, or that I <b>should</b> see <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> so, without asking the reason why? Or can I suppose if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not tell me, but {{that there is some}} reason why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not trust me?" ...|$|R
50|$|What <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> is {{invite her}} round for dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{the same}} thing;--rancour against Mr. Gresham because he had allowed the other man's counsel to prevail with him. The action of no {{individual}} man should be to you of sufficient consequence to guide your conduct. If you accept office, you should not take it as a favour conferred by the Prime Minister; nor if you refuse it, <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so from personal feelings in regard to him. If he selects you, he is presumed to do so because he finds that your services will be valuable to the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|Since these volumes {{are sure}} {{of a place}} in your marvellous library I trust that with your {{unrivalled}} knowledge of the various editions of Wilde you may not detect any grievous error whether of taste or type, of omission or commission. But <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so you must blame the editor, and not those who so patiently assisted him, the proof readers, the printers, or the publishers. Some day, however, I look forward to your bibliography of the author, in which you will be at liberty to criticise my capacity for anything except regard and friendship for yourself.--Sincerely yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{is always}} unpleasantness about this tandem. It is {{the theory of}} the man in front that the man behind does nothing; it is equally {{the theory of the}} man behind that he alone is the motive power, the man in front merely doing the puffing. The mystery will never be solved. It is {{annoying}} when Prudence is whispering to you on the one side not to overdo your strength and bring on heart disease; while Justice into the other ear is remarking, [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it all? This isn't a cab. He's not your passenger:" [...] to hear him grunt out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{tell you}} frankly, now that I {{come to think}} of it, that I <b>should</b> prefer <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not see M. de Kercadiou with me. Your duty to your client cannot be a help to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I want <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{stop when}} <b>you</b> <b>do</b> git to him. Will you? I {{want to speak}} to him, and ask him all about those folks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} our {{conversation on the}} first evening of our coming here, as to the impossibility of your <b>doing</b> anything, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> remain out here after leaving the army. There was one solution to which <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not allude. Many Scottish and Irish soldiers, both in this country, in France, Austria, and Germany, have married well. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>do</b> the same?" ...|$|R
