As he went he saw, in a shop window, a beautiful stick of olive wood, with an ebony crook. It was marked ten francs, and he coveted it greatly, but reflected with a sigh that having spent so much on others he could afford nothing for himself, for Godfrey was an unselfish soul. Instead he bought a collar of <b>Swiss</b> <b>lace</b> for Mrs. Parsons. Immediately {{after he left the}} lace shop he became aware that he was being shadowed. He heard no footfall, and he saw no one, but he knew that this was so; he could feel it down his back, and in a cold wind which blew across his hands, as it had done always at the Villa Ogilvy s√©ances.|$|E

This tradition, dating back hundreds of years, {{led to the development}} of distinctive <b>Swiss</b> <b>lace,</b> an intricate, interlaced pattern of threads, looped, twisted or braided to other threads, known throughout the world for its quality and workmanship. Handmade <b>Swiss</b> <b>lace</b> was often used in decorative clothing, curtains, table linens and many other applications.|$|E

50|$|Born {{and raised}} in Philadelphia, Daniel Guggenheim was sent to Switzerland {{as a young man}} to study the <b>Swiss</b> <b>lace</b> and {{embroidery}} business, and to serve as a buyer for his father's import firm. The discovery of high-grade silver-lead ore in the Guggenheim mines in Leadville, Colorado in 1881 became the foundation for the Guggenheim fortune in mining. In 1884, Daniel returned to the US to help manage the family's booming mining and smelting business. Daniel helped to establish the Guggenheim mining and smelting business in Mexico, which by 1895 was earning profits of $1 million a year.|$|E
5000|$|Lace wigs {{are quickly}} {{becoming}} one of the most sought after wigs among wig wearers. The illusion of hair growing from the scalp is the feature that makes this wig {{the best of the best}} when it comes to wearing fake hair. These wigs are made with a French or <b>Swiss</b> <b>lace</b> material base. They are made as a full lace or partial lace front with a stretch weft back. Each hair strand is individually stitched into a lace material which creates the natural look of hair at the base. This is where the term [...] "hand tied" [...] originates.|$|E
