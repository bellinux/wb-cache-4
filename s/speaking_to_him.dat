25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} at 02:52 UTC.

Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as chilla-nashini. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave without <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for Jumu'ah (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.|$|E

500|$|Symeon {{repeatedly}} {{describes the}} experience of divine light in his writings, as both an inward and outward mystical experience.
