5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of <b>South</b> <b>Africans,</b> and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

5|$|Van der Byl {{took over}} {{at a time when}} South Africa was putting {{increasing}} pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March 1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town to explain why the Rhodesian government had detained Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with South Africa. The South Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle of}} the street. The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> still {{view it as a}} symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{started the}} Test series against South Africa poorly. Suffering from a throat infection, he scored three in both innings and took 1/46 in an Australian victory. In the Second Test at the MCG, Miller {{performed}} consistently with bat and ball, taking 4/62 and 3/51 and scoring 52 and 31. In {{the course of}} the match, he passed the all-round double of 1000Test runs and 100Test wickets when he dismissed John Waite in the second innings, but this was not enough to prevent defeat. In the Third Test, Miller scored 55, putting on 168 with Harvey, and took 3/48 and 2/33 in an innings victory. Australia's fortunes took {{a turn for the worse}} in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Miller scored nine and injured his back after two overs with the ball. Lindwall also broke down. Without their spearheads, Australia were unable to bowl out the <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> and match was drawn. Both were ruled out of the Fifth Test and the <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> levelled the series despite conceding 520 runs during the first innings. Australia's bowlers were unable to stop the South African batsmen without their new ball pair.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1969, Cardiff {{played host to}} {{the sixth}} touring South Africa team.

John was unavailable for the encounter having fractured a rib while playing for the Barbarians against an Oxford University Past and Present eleven days earlier. His place was taken by Beverley Davies and Cardiff lost 17–3. John recovered {{in time for the}} South Africa against Wales match on 24 January, and was selected alongside Edwards. The game was played in atrocious muddy conditions, and a last minute try from Edwards snatched a 6–6 draw Both John and Edwards had a substandard game that day, but they combined well in the last move of the game to avoid defeat. A week later on 31 January, John and Edwards faced the <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> again, this time as part of the Barbarians.
