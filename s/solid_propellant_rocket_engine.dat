40|$|Data were {{obtained}} for a resonance tube having a vent at the center in the lateral boundary, an average flow being introduced at the ends. Experiments were done for both circular and slot vents, over ranges of both frequency and Mach number. It was demonstrated that a subsonic exhaust vent in the lateral boundary of a cold flow resonance tube provides a gain of acoustic energy for the fundamental mode within the resonance tube. The gain of acoustic energy increases approximately linearly with the Mach number, as predicted by the one-dimensional analysis. The one-dimensional result gives the values for the slope representing the variation of the attenuation coefficient of the exhaust vent {{with respect to the}} average Mach number of the flow within roughly 30 % of those measured. It has been verified that the subsonic vent produces a gain proportional to the average Mach number, proportional to the frequency, and independent of the shape.
