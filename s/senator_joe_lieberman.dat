25|$|Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was ineligible {{to serve}} a third term due to term {{limitations}} in the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution, and Vice President Gore was able to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease.

Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose <b>Senator</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Lieberman</b> as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky sex scandal two years prior.|$|E
25|$|Daschle {{also served}} as a {{panelist}} on the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a body that recommended changes to U.S. policy to strengthen national biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former <b>Senator</b> <b>Joe</b> <b>Lieberman</b> and former Governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.|$|E
