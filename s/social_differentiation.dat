For example, a cauldron found in Trialeti is nearly identical to the one from Shaft Grave 4 of Mycenae in Greece.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} in the region arises chiefly from <b>social</b> <b>differentiation</b> and conflict between Rohingya Muslims and local Rakhine Buddhists. During World War II in Burma (present-day Myanmar), Rohingya Muslims (allied with the British and promised a Muslim state in return) fought against local Rakhine Buddhists, who were allied with the Japanese. Following independence in 1948, the newly formed union government of the predominantly-Buddhist country denied citizenship to the Rohingyas, subjecting them to extensive systematic discrimination in the country. This has widely been compared to apartheid by many international academics, analysts and political figures, including Desmond Tutu, a famous South African anti-apartheid activist.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman {{conquest of}} Bosnia marked {{a new era}} in the country's history and {{introduced}} tremendous changes in the political and cultural landscape of the region. Although the kingdom had been crushed and its high nobility executed, the Ottomans nonetheless allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity - a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans. Within this sandžak (and eventual vilayet) of Bosnia, the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of <b>social</b> <b>differentiation</b> by class and religious affiliation.|$|E
25|$|The Jarabarriu, {{the final}} stage of the Chavín Horizon, lasted from about 400 to 250 BCE. Chavín culture had a {{dramatic}} increase in population. The settlement pattern changed to a proto-urban pattern, consisting of a center of lowland valley peoples and smaller satellite communities in the surrounding higher altitude areas. The culture showed specialization and <b>social</b> <b>differentiation.</b> The people who lived in the east at Chavín de Huantar are thought to have had lower prestige than the communities around the ceremonial center. A diverse and intense production of ceramics is suggested during the Jarabarriu phase, when the valley was heavily populated and the ceramic style more defined. Satellite communities also developed centers of production during this phase.|$|E

25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>differentiation</b> in Great Moravia {{reached the}} state of early feudalism, {{creating}} the social basis for development of later medieval states in the region. The question what happened to Great Moravian noble families after 907 is still under debate. On the one hand, recent research indicates that {{a significant part of}} the local aristocracy remained more or less undisturbed by the fall of Great Moravia and their descendants became nobles in the newly formed Kingdom of Hungary. The most prominent example are the powerful families of Hunt and Pázmán. On the other hand, both Anonymous and Simon of Kéza, two chroniclers of the early history of Hungary, recorded that the prominent noble families of the kingdom descended either from leaders of the Magyar tribes or from immigrants, and they did not connect any of them to Great Moravia. For example, the ancestors of the clan Hunt-Pázmán (Hont-Pázmány), whose Great Moravian origin has been advanced by Slovak scholars, were mentioned by Simon of Kéza to have arrived from the Duchy of Swabia to the kingdom in the late 10th century.|$|E
500|$|There is also {{a strong}} anti-imperialist vein in the film's satire. The film scholar Matthew Solomon notes that {{the last part of}} the film (the parade and {{commemoration}} sequence missing in some prints) is especially forceful in this regard. He argues that Méliès, who had previously worked as an anti-Boulangist political cartoonist, mocks imperialistic domination in the film by presenting his colonial conquerors as bumbling pedants who mercilessly attack the alien lifeforms they meet and return with a mistreated captive amid fanfares of self-congratulation. The statue of Barbenfouillis shown in the film's final shot even resembles the pompous, bullying colonialists in Méliès's political cartoons. The film scholar Elizabeth Ezra agrees that [...] "Méliès mocks the pretensions of colonialist accounts of the conquest of one culture by another," [...] and adds that [...] "his film also thematizes <b>social</b> <b>differentiation</b> on the home front, as the hierarchical patterns on the moon are shown to bear a curious resemblance to those on earth." ...|$|E
40|$|Like {{in other}} {{countries}} of the European periphery, deep social and economic change has taken place {{over the last few}} decades in rural Portugal.

But as others including Townsend and Davidson 2 have pointed out, {{a variety of other}} factors {{play an important role in}} determining social class. In developing countries where the majority of the population do not enter conventional occupational categories, classification by occupation is not very useful. In such circumstances, <b>social</b> <b>differentiations</b> may be far more complex, and there is a particular need for a more appropriate social classification than occupation alone. An index of social deprivation, measuring relative poverty among low income families in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, has just been developed. s Indicators used to derive the social deprivation index include family size, crowding in the home, family income, marital status of the mother, mother's education, family possessions, housing, sanitation and source of water supply. In a small household study 191 mothers living in squatter areas with an innovative action programme 4 were interviewed. Obstetric outcome was enquired about and validated against records. High social deprivation measured by this index correlated with poor obstetric outcome, ID particular with anaemia during pregnancy, eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage. Yours faithfully...|$|R

In Burundi, {{by the end}} of the igth century, {{the forms}} taken by the {{exercise}} of power as well as the complex relationship between producers and their exploiters can be explained by the structure of subordination. Political relationships linked with access to the land were the most generai expression of personal dependence. They implied a network of tribute relationships (Mehrarbeit) which supported in part the operation of royal and princely estates. Quantitative data drawn from a wide representative corpus allows an analysis of taxes in kind and labour levies: their origins, their local and historical variations according to <b>social</b> <b>differentiations,</b> their weight in the daily life of the rural masses and the way in which they were accepted. This leads to a twofold, self-contradictory and inconciliable version for the labour levies: a corvee for some, a trifle for others.

500|$|The {{placement}} of artifacts and materials within an Archaic burial site indicated <b>social</b> <b>differentiation</b> based upon status. There is a continuous record of occupation of [...] by Aboriginal people {{dating from the}} early Holocene period, 10,000–9,000 years ago. Archaeological sites at Stave Lake, Coquitlam Lake, Fort Langley and region uncovered early period artifacts. These early inhabitants were highly mobile hunter-gatherers, consisting of about 20 to 50 members of an extended family. The Na-Dene people occupied much of the land area of northwest and central North America starting around 8,000BCE. They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples, including the Navajo and Apache. They had villages with large multi-family dwellings, used seasonally during the summer, from which they hunted, fished and gathered food supplies for the winter. The Wendat peoples settled into Southern Ontario along the Eramosa River around 8,000–7,000BCE (10,000–9,000years ago). They were concentrated between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. Wendat hunted caribou to survive on the glacier-covered land. Many different First Nations cultures relied upon the buffalo starting by 6,000–5,000BCE (8,000–7,000years ago). They hunted buffalo by herding migrating buffalo off cliffs. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, near Lethbridge, Alberta, is a hunting grounds that was in use for about 5,000 years.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} how children challenge the boundaries adults place on them, {{out of concern}} for their safety, through child-specific cultural practises. The thesis argues that these boundaries emerge from contemporary changes in the perception of risk to children and have driven the systematic limitation of spaces that children are allowed to experience on their own. Based on data collected among elementary school-age children during twelve months of fieldwork (2008 - 2009), across multiple sites in the city of Vancouver, Canada, I argue that children creatively adapt to spatial and social limits imposed on them through play, consumption and exchange. Moreover, the research demonstrates that through gathering social knowledge and experimenting with self-presentation and systems of social order, children create a sophisticated peer culture. This incorporates <b>social</b> <b>differentiations</b> and hierarchies that differ from those of adult society however, are interdependent with it. My work thus challenges the position of children as objects and ‘anecdotes’ in anthropology: considered ‘works in progress’ and lacking full status as persons in society.

This kicks off a work program which aims to account how such areas differentiate and how they develop a wide range of institutional arrangements that involve players who defend their own interests. This results in meso-level areas for which the macroeconomic functionality is not decisive (hence the concept of half-functionality).
