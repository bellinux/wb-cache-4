40|$|Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is a {{high-performance}} {{engineered wood product}} made of several wood veneers bound together mostly in grain direction. Veneers are obtained thanks to peeling process. This cutting process induces lathe checks of the veneer with variable depth and spatial frequencies. In this work, we studied the influence of lathe checks on the mechanical properties of LVL thanks to a finite element model of LVL beams made of checked veneers. The checks were modelled as free spaces in the cross-section. Several typical check depths and frequencies were compared, with the beam tested edgewise or flatwise. The {{results show that the}} longitudinal modulus of elasticity and the shear modulus <b>in</b> flatwise <b>bending</b> are marginally affected by checking, while the shear modulus of the LVL beam is significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> if the check depth is important. This phenomenon is due to high shear deformations <b>in</b> the <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> case, because checks are mainly horizontal in this state. Therefore, the check depth may also affect the resistance of LVL <b>in</b> <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending,</b> thus experimental testing of this assumption will be done...|$|R

40|$|When using timber for {{construction}} purposes {{it is important}} to know its strength. One way to do this is by sorting the boards into strength classes that are defined by European standards.  A commonly used method for strength grading is based on dynamic excitation in the longitudinal direction of the board to obtain an average dynamic longitudinal modulus of elasticity (MOE). This in turn correlates with the bending strength of the board in such a way that it can be used as an indicating property (IP) to bending strength. The use of MOE as an IP has proven to give the highest coefficient of determination (R 2) to both <b>bending</b> and tensile <b>strength</b> <b>in</b> boards. Through the research described in this thesis, one might find that both reducing the length of a board to half its initial length and by removing the part containing the lowest local MOE <b>in</b> <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> provided similar results, the axial dynamic MOE remaining within a 1 % tolerance whereas the lowest IP based on local MOE <b>in</b> <b>edgewise</b> <b>bending</b> increased by 6 – 7 %...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to simple metals, semiconductors {{have to be}} viewed as molecular networks with valence electrons strongly concentrated near atoms and along bonds. Disturbing these networks results (with increasing perturbation <b>strength)</b> <b>in</b> <b>bending,</b> stretching and breaking of the bonds. This simple picture has to be augmented by intermediate situations, such as the formation of new types of bonds which can stabilize configurations with changed atomic coordination numbers. Typically, the energy required to completely break a semiconductor bond is ~ 1 eV/atom. Large elastic distortions can therefore be accommodated to avoid breaking of bonds or to favor the formation of new types of weaker bonds. A beautiful example of this behavior is the formation of π-bonds in order to stabilize the Si(111) (2 x 1) surface 1.

Polishing machined edges, and/or tension side failure surfaces, was detrimental to specimen strength characterization instead of yielding a higher, more accurate, strength {{as a result of}} removing inherent manufacture and handling flaws. Transverse tension strength was sensitive to span length due to the classical weakest link effect. However, strength was less sensitive to volume changes achieved by increasing specimen width. The Weibull scaling law over-predicted changes <b>in</b> transverse tension <b>strengths</b> <b>in</b> three point <b>bend</b> tests and under-predicted changes <b>in</b> transverse tension <b>strengths</b> <b>in</b> four point <b>bend</b> tests.
