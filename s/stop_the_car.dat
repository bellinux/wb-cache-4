5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials try to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong {{into one of the}} officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E
25|$|Lifsh {{believed}} {{he had the right}} of way to proceed through the intersection because of the police escort. Lifsh said he deliberately steered his car away from adults on the sidewalk, toward the wall, a distance of about , in order to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Lifsh later commented that the car did not come to a full stop upon impact with the building, but rather slid to the left along the wall until it reached the children.|$|E

25|$|In 1881 the Dunedin cable tramway system {{opened in}} Dunedin, New Zealand {{and became the}} first such system outside San Francisco. For Dunedin, George Smith Duncan further {{developed}} the Hallidie model, introducing the pull curve and the slot brake; the former was a way to pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too sharp to allow coasting, while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Both of these innovations were generally adopted by other cities, including San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|All four aspects may drive SA processes. Being {{aware of}} the status of {{particular}} objects (cues), one might infer that particular situations are on-going, and frame the objects accordingly. The cues then drive re-framing of situations. Having a particular frame, or pre-conception of a situation, this may drive the perception of objects. E.g. having noticed that a landing is about to occur, an Air Traffic Controller will usually look for specific objects in the environment and update the awareness of their status. Further, having realized the implications of objects of their status, this drives the process of what to attend to next. E.g. knowing that a vehicle is approaching a runway where a landing is about to take place, an Air Traffic Controller may monitor its progress. Event horizon awareness may also guide SA, e.g. if one plans to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at a gas station, one may look for gas station signs.|$|E
25|$|An {{argument}} {{breaks out}} between Natasha and Andrew, which Summer and Ed join in on. Ed asks Andrew how {{he sold the}} app without Natasha's signature and they all realise that he forged it. Chris struggles to stay focused and asks everyone to calm down, while Natasha wants him to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> She then decides {{to call the police}} and Andrew reaches back to stop her, but jostles Chris' arm causing him to lose control of the car. It runs off the road and hits an embankment, before flipping over and coming to a rest upside down. Natasha pulls Ed from the wreckage, while Chris helps a shocked Summer out and then returns to check an unconscious Andrew. On his way home, Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) drives past the crash site and is flagged down by Natasha. He calls an ambulance and begins assessing everyone. Rhys tells Chris to keep the others warm and awake.|$|E

25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to be breaking up. She is seen sitting in the backseat of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few shopping bags. During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's rear-view mirror. She later realises that he makes her happy and moves to the driver's seat, to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back to the bus stop.|$|E
25|$|On July 20, 1918, {{the last}} day to do so, Colter officially entered the gubernatorial race when he filed his {{petition}} with the Arizona Secretary of State. On the final day, Lamar Cobb added his name {{to the list of}} Democratic primary candidates, bringing the total to five. In mid-August, in an effort to consolidate the conservative arm of the Democratic party in an attempt to thwart Colter's candidacy, Moeur withdrew from the race, asking his supporters to throw their support behind Osborn. Shortly thereafter, also in August, Cobb also withdrew from the race. In late August, {{on his way to a}} campaign <b>stop,</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in which Colter was traveling struck a steer on the road between Bisbee and Tombstone. The car was traveling at 40-mile per hour, and Colter was thrown from the vehicle, resulting in severe bruising and a concussion. After a brief stop in Tombstone, the party continued on to Tucson, where Colter remained resting in his hotel room for several days, cancelling campaign stops.|$|E
25|$|On {{the final}} lap of the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, leader Carl Edwards swerved {{into the path}} of Brad Keselowski in order to prevent Keselowski from passing; Keselowski turned Edwards into the air and Edwards's car bounced off of the hood of Ryan Newman's car and flipped into the catch fence, then came to a rest {{in the middle of the}} track further down. Edwards was uninjured, but the crash was {{compared}} to an accident at Talladega in 1987 where Bobby Allison went airborne and hit the catch fence in a similar location. Allison's crash (coming at speeds 20 MPH faster than Edwards' crash) ripped out a 100-foot section of the catch fence, while Edwards' crash only bent the support poles. Seven spectators were injured in Edwards' accident from debris. The aftermath of the accident spawned questions about the aerodynamic features of the CoT, the nature of pack racing with restrictor plates, and the safety features of Talladega Superspeedway. Video replay showed that despite deploying, the car's roof flaps did nothing to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> from flipping– a common failing of the devices dating to their very first month in use– and the second hit from Newman flipped the car higher.|$|E

She managed to shake him off, but Thomas ordered Roman {{to turn off the}} main road and they {{assaulted}} her again. Roman <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and urged <b>the</b> other men to stop; they hesitated, but as another car full of potential witnesses passed them Thomas decided that they could not leave her alive. Roman <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at <b>the</b> parking lot of restaurant Girenbad.|$|R

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|The first radar (instead of {{previous}} lidar) sensor on a Lexus sedan allowed the new Dynamic RADAR Cruise Control {{to work in}} any weather conditions. The millimeter-wave radar technology also enabled the first Pre-Collision System (PCS) on a Lexus sedan (with partial autonomous braking only on the Japanese market Toyota Celsior version). A [...] "low-speed tracking mode" [...] was added in 2004. The low-speed tracking mode was a second mode that would warn the driver if the car ahead stopped and provide braking; it could <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> but then deactivated.|$|E
500|$|Gran Trak 10 is a single-player racing {{video game}} in which the player drives a race car along a race track, shown from above. The player {{controls}} the car with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and gear stick, as in a real car. The gear shifting requires the player to shift between reverse, first, second, and third gears as needed, but the pedals are digital controls rather than analog, so the player cannot control his speed by applying differing levels of pressure. The steering wheel turns the car only while it is being turned, rather than having a neutral [...] "straight" [...] position. Braking does not <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> instantly and turning while braking will cause the car to skid. The course is defined on the screen by walls of white dots representing pylons, which if hit <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and spin it. There is only a single track layout. The track contains one black path representing an oil slick, which prevents the player's car from turning. At {{the top of the}} screen are two numbers; the number on the right is the remaining time in the game, starting at 78 and counting down by 2s, while the number on the left is the number of checkpoints the player has passed, and counts up by 2s.|$|E

500|$|Evans {{remembered that}} the {{location}} work involving Gabriel, conducted in and around Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire {{in the autumn of}} 1968, proved to be arduous because the low levels of light hampered filming. On occasion, just two minutes of new footage would be recorded at each session. On the subject of the remote-control steering, he stated, [...] "I remember standing out of shot and having to 'drive' [...] down the road while it was out of view. Often I didn't know where it was, or where and when it had stopped." [...] A location unit member would be on hand to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with a large cushion if it went out of control.|$|E
500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car on lap two was {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and I was on the gravel because he pushed me into the gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|E
500|$|According to Dannemann, by 3 p.m. {{they had}} left the {{apartment}} to use a bank. They continued on to Kensington Market, where Hendrix signed an autograph for a young boy, purchased a leather jacket, and ordered some shoes. He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8 p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had [...] "regretted it ever since". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a Chelsea antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland Hotel, meeting Devon Wilson as she walked down King's Road. Hendrix asked Dannemann to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{so that he could}} get out and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening. Dannemann became jealous, giving Wilson a cold stare during the brief meeting. Later, Phillip Harvey invited Dannemann and Hendrix to tea; they accepted. Prior to their arrival at Harvey's, they briefly stopped by the Cumberland.|$|E

However, he received a nomination from four county councils (Fingal, Laois, Waterford and Dublin City), which is sufficient to gain a nomination. He was assisted by his rival, Labour Party candidate Michael D. Higgins, who urged his party colleagues on Dublin City Council to allow Norris onto the ticket [...] "in the interests of democracy." [...] When Norris heard this on the radio he instructed his driver to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{so that he could}} phone Higgins to express his appreciation.|$|E
2500|$|The four airmen {{were handed}} over to the Kiel Gestapo and after {{interrogation}} were told that they would be taken by road back to prison camp. On 29 March 1944, two or three black sedan cars arrived, Catanach was taken in the first car with three Gestapo agents including SS-Sturmbannfuhrer Johannes Post a senior officer based there. Post had his driver <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in the countryside outside Kiel about 1630 hours and called Catanach out into a field where he promptly shot him. The second (and possibly a third) car drew up in the same place shortly afterwards and Post told his agents to get Christensen, Espelid and Fuglesang out, stating that they should take a [...] break before their long drive. [...] As the airmen walked into the field they almost stumbled over Catanach's body as they were also shot.|$|E
2500|$|A Tesla Model S {{caught fire}} after the vehicle hit debris {{on a highway}} in Kent, Washington, on October 1, 2013. According to the driver, he hit {{something}} while traveling in the HOV lane of Washington State Route 167, and exited because the car reported a problem {{and told him to}} stop. Flames began coming out of {{the front of the car}} at the end of the off-ramp, so the driver left the car. The fire was caught on video by a witness [...] and posted on several websites. [...] According to the Kent Fire Department incident report, initial attempts to extinguish the fire with water were unsuccessful, as the fire reignited underneath the vehicle after appearing to be extinguished. Then, the firefighters cut a hole to apply water directly to the burning battery. According to Tesla Motors, the car owner was alerted by onboard systems to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and exit the vehicle, which he did without injury.|$|E
