5|$|Ole Bull State Park {{is located}} in the Kettle Creek watershed. It opened in 1925. The Susquehannock <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> {{is located in}} Potter County, near the creek's headwaters. Kettle Creek State Park {{is located in the}} watershed, near the Alvin R. Bush Dam. It is {{commonly}} visited by fishermen. Much of {{the lower part of the}} watershed is in Sproul <b>State</b> <b>Forest.</b> Tioga <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> and Elk <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> also occupy a small part of the watershed, on the northeastern and edges, respectively.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon <b>State</b> <b>Forest,</b> and ten in Elk <b>State</b> <b>Forest.</b> The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be a}} problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk <b>State</b> <b>Forest,</b> north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes near or through the sites of several former CCC camps.|$|E
40|$|While {{over time}} <b>state</b> <b>forests</b> have {{become synonymous with}} state parks, they have {{different}} purposes. The purpose of the <b>state</b> <b>forests</b> differ from <b>state</b> parks because state parks are for recreational use, while <b>state</b> <b>forests</b> are for timber management and conservation. By compiling information from newspapers, magazine articles, and personal interviews, the history of Harrison-Crawford <b>State</b> <b>Forests</b> is made more transparent. By combining these resources "Harrison Crawford State Forest: A Wealth of History and Mystery" helps readers understand why the forests were established, why they are managed the way they are, and the unique features the forest offers.

5|$|Myles Standish <b>State</b> <b>Forest,</b> the Commonwealth's {{second largest}} <b>state</b> <b>forest,</b> {{is located in}} Plymouth. It is a camping and hiking destination, and {{contains}} 16 freshwater lakes and ponds. Ellisville Harbor State Park, located in the extreme southern portion of the town, contains a natural beach inside Cape Cod Bay.

Small campfires are allowed, except from March to mid-May and October through November, or by order of the district forester, when self-contained stoves are allowed.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not the}} end of the controversy. A letter {{campaign}} led to {{the name}} of the park being changed to Whirls End <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> Park in 1936; opponents of the new name launched another letter-writing campaign to revert the name to Worlds End <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> Park. This matter was brought before the State Geographic Board, which supervised the official naming of places. The board ruled that the name be changed once again to Worlds End <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> Park in 1943. The word Forest was dropped on November 11, 1954, when the park was officially named Worlds End State Park by the Pennsylvania Geographic Board. This has been the official name ever since, but the names Whirls End and Whirls Glen are still used, and are synonymous with Worlds End.|$|E

5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and <b>state</b> <b>forest,</b> and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration {{chose to}} make Clark <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> a {{training}} {{center for the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, and also made it Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November1933.

The state forest's proximity to the Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot was key in the decision to focus so much attention on it.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Plymouth Pinelands, {{the town}} of Plymouth has many {{distinct}} geographical features. The town's Atlantic coast is characterized by low plains, while its western sections are extremely hilly and forested. Plymouth contains several small ponds scattered throughout its western quadrant, the largest being the Great Herring Pond (which is partly in {{the town of}} Bourne). A major feature of the town is the Myles Standish <b>State</b> <b>Forest,</b> which is in the southwestern region. Cachalot Scout Reservation, operated by the Cachalot District of the Narragansett Council of the Boy Scouts of America, lies adjacent to the <b>state</b> <b>forest</b> lands. There is also a smaller town forest, as well as several parks, recreation areas and beaches.|$|E

40|$|Today, the company, in {{addition}} to meeting its economic goals, {{should be involved in}} the implementation of the concept of corporate social responsibility. <b>State</b> <b>Forests</b> is not an exception in this respect, on the contrary – its existence, by definition, has dictated inscribing in the mission, vision and strategy of this company a responsibility to society, both to present and future generations. To date, <b>State</b> <b>Forests</b> has not developed a uniform framework for reporting socially responsible activities. Despite the many scattered documents indicating their contribution in this regard, <b>State</b> <b>Forests</b> has not included in its report a set of information on these issues. The aim of the article is to point out that social responsibility in such an entity as <b>State</b> <b>Forests</b> National Forest Holding is an extremely important area having long-term conse-quences for the contemporary and future generations. The article demonstrates the need for corporate social responsibility accounting and proposes a general structure of a report on social responsibility of <b>State</b> <b>Forests</b> for the current and future stakeholders.

5|$|SR666 {{begins at}} a traffic signal with SR60 and SR146, on the {{northeast}} side of Zanesville. The route heads east as a two-lane highway, before curving northeast. While passing through Zanesville the route passes woodland, with some commercial businesses. The highway makes a sharp curve due west, before another sharp curve northeast. After the second curve the route leaves Zanesville, running parallel to the Muskingum River and an Ohio Central Railroad track. The road makes a sharp curve northwest and passes under the Ohio Central Railroad track. After passing under the railroad track the route curves north-northeast and the railroad track curves due east. The roadway passes through the Zanesville <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> Nursery, followed by a curve northwest, passing through the <b>state</b> <b>forest</b> nursery again. After leaving the <b>state</b> <b>forest</b> nursery, the highway passes through farmland heading due north. The route curves northeast passing through the <b>state</b> <b>forest</b> nursery {{for the last time}} and the highway has an intersection with County Road 40 (CR40), in rural Jefferson Township. Following this intersection, SR666 turns due west, before curving towards the north. This section of roadway passes mostly through farmland, with wooded areas when the route is close to the river. SR666 ends at an intersection with SR208 near Dresden, on the east bank of the Muskingum River.|$|E
5|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps, encamped {{in nearby}} Pachaug <b>State</b> <b>Forest,</b> {{developed}} the state {{park in the}} 1930s. Their efforts included adapting the Avery House for park use. Hopeville Pond was designated as a state park in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The state {{established}} a tree nursery in the Moshannon <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> in 1911, {{which became the}} largest in Pennsylvania before it closed in 1980. In addition to planting millions of trees, in 1913 the state encouraged use of <b>state</b> <b>forest</b> lands by allowing permanent leases for camp sites; when the state stopped issuing new permits in 1970, 4,500 campsites had been leased. The Pennsylvania Game Commission began purchasing land for state game preserves in 1920, and by 1941, State Game Lands 34, which is partly in Quehanna Wild Area, had been established. Despite these conservation efforts, major forest fires swept the Moshannon and Elk state forests in 1912, 1913, 1926, and 1930, and minor fires occurred in other years.|$|E

The U.S. Highway also passes near McColley's Chapel and crosses Gravelly Branch, one of {{the headwaters of the}} Nanticoke River, north of Redden. US 113 curves north and passes by the Ellendale <b>State</b> <b>Forest</b> Picnic Facility, a picnic area accessible from the northbound direction that the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed in the late 1930s for tourists and long-distance travelers. West of Ellendale, which flourished in the late 19th century as a railroad town at the junction of perpendicular rail lines, the highway intersects DE16 (Beach Highway) and passes Teddy's Tavern, which was built in 1923 as the Blue Hen Garage to serve travelers on the DuPont Highway.|$|E
