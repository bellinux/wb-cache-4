40|$|Cannibalisation {{refers to}} a {{maintenance}} action where an unserviceable part in an inoperative platform {{is replaced by a}} <b>serviceable</b> <b>part</b> of the same type from another platform. It helps a fleet meet operational requirements when spares are in short supply but leads to more maintenance tasks to be carried out. In practice, cannibalisation may be performed in an unrestricted manner, or through the use of cannibalisation birds. A cannibalisation bird is a platform which is selected as the primary source of cannibalisation, while any inoperative platform can be a cannibalisation source under the unrestricted policy. In order to aid fleet managers in making cannibalisation-related decisions, this paper presents a hierarchical coloured Petri net (HCPN) model of a fleet operation and maintenance process which considers mission-oriented operation, multiple level maintenance, multiple cannibalisation policies (no cannibalisation, unrestricted cannibalisation and cannibalisation bird), maintenance scheduling and spare inventory management. The model is applied to an example fleet to compare the effects of different cannibalisation policies on fleet performance using a number of performance measures related to reliability and maintenance and to optimise the number of cannibalisation birds used and the length of time that a platform is taken as a cannibalisation bird for the fleet...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{emergency}} repair model. We model {{a situation where}} failed parts arrive at a repair shop according to a Poisson process. If the stock on hand of <b>serviceable</b> spare <b>parts</b> exceeds a given emergency trigger level, the failed part is sent into normal repair. Otherwise the failed part is sent into an alternative emergency repair channel. Upon arrival failed parts are exchanged for <b>serviceable</b> spare <b>parts,</b> if available. Otherwise the demand is backordered. A backorder {{is filled with the}} first part that becomes available from either one of the repair processes. The repair times (including transportation time) are assumed to be exponentially distributed. We analyze the impact of using emergency repair on two service measures: the fraction of demand that is satisfied from stock on hand and the expected duration of a backorder. We calculate the initial stock level and the emergency trigger level that minimize the total cost for a given emergency repair rate. The proposed policy is compared with two other policies: (1) emergency repair is not used and (2) emergency trigger level is zero. We find that significant service improvements and cost reductions can be obtained by using our emergency repair policy. We also present simulation results showing that the distribution of the repair times has a negligible effect on the relevant service measures. Finally, we compare our results with the results of an emergency supply model by Muckstadt and Thomas [1] Again we observe significant cost reductions when using our policy...|$|R

5000|$|To {{manufacture}} the Comstar wheels Honda used an extruded aluminium-alloy rim made by D.I.D {{that was}} {{fastened to the}} spokes using aluminium rivets. The spoke pieces were bolted to the rim with steel bolt and nut fastenings in either three, five or six pointed star configuration. What metal the spokes were made from depended {{on the model of}} motorcycle. The CB400T for example used steel for the spokes and alloy for the rim, whilst the CBX and the Super Dream used alloy for both the spokes and rims to further reduce unsprung mass. This type wheel was considered [...] "maintenance free" [...] with no user <b>serviceable</b> <b>parts</b> and Honda had [...] "Do Not Disassemble" [...] stamped on the wheel rim alongside other markings such as the fitment size. For its use on the NR500 GP machine, the wheels were made from magnesium with titanium used for the fasteners. Composite wheels were also cheaper to produce than their cast alloy equivalents.|$|E
50|$|As a sales {{incentive}} amid low customer demand {{during the}} Great Recession, Airbus had offered buy-back guarantees to airlines that chose to procure the A340. By 2013, the resale {{value of an}} A340 declined by 30% over ten years, and both Airbus and Rolls-Royce were incurring related charges amounting to {{hundreds of millions of}} euros. Some analysts have expected the price of a flight-worthy, CFM56-powered A340 to drop below $10 million by 2023. As an effort to support the A340's resale value, Airbus has proposed reconfiguring the aircraft's interior for a single class of 475 seats. As the Trent 500 engines are half the maintenance cost of the A340, Rolls-Royce proposed a cost-reducing maintenance plan similar to the company's existing program that reduced the cost of maintaining the RB211 engine powering Iberia's Boeing 757 freighters. Key to these programs is the salvaging, repair and reuse of <b>serviceable</b> <b>parts</b> from retired older engines. Airbus could offer used A340s to airlines wishing to retire older aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, claiming that the cost of purchasing and maintaining a second-hand A340 with increased seating and improved engine performance reportedly compared favourably to the procurement costs of a new Boeing 777.|$|E
50|$|In the British Army, forage caps {{were first}} {{regulated}} by the War Office in 1811 as a practical head dress that could be worn when out of action, {{in lieu of the}} cumbersome Shako that was otherwise stipulated when in full regimental dress. There is however evidence that they were worn before this date under regimental arrangements and they are specifically mentioned as early as 1768. Their construction was either knitted, or made up locally utilising still <b>serviceable</b> <b>parts</b> of worn out uniforms. Always round in shape, they initially had no peak, but many years later the idea of a peak was transferred from the shako to give the forage cap a more smart appearance. They were initially often in a blue-grey colour with a head band that may well have been in the facing colour of the regiment, but once standardised by war office regulation they began to take on a more uniform appearance and, when not in use, were rolled and carried strapped to the cartouche case. These crude but effective forage caps remained in use until replaced by a similar style of forage cap, known as a Kilmarnock Bonnet (from its place of manufacture), some time in the 1830s.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} determining stock levels of repairable items supporting a fleet of commercial aircraft operated by a transportation company in the Philippines. The items are characterised by infrequent demand, high cost and a hierarchical (or indentured) structure. The system has three re-supply sources of <b>serviceable</b> <b>parts,</b> namely, the in-house repair shop, the out-house repair shops, and the suppliers. Non-repairable items are scrapped and replaced with new items on a one-for-one basis. The model considers two levels of indenture represented by modules and components. The objective is to minimise the total expected steady-state annual cost of holding inventories and of aircraft delays. A minimum requirement on module availability is also applied. The formulation is such that the regular discrete optimisers available could not be readily used to solve it. The model is implemented on an illustrative problem, employing an integer search for the item stock levels within a limited range...|$|E
40|$|Cannibalisation is a {{maintenance}} activity that involves removing <b>serviceable</b> <b>parts</b> from inoperative platforms to replace unserviceable {{parts of the}} same type in other platforms. It can provide a significant benefit to fleet readiness, particularly if spare parts are in short supply. However, cannibalisation also has drawbacks: it brings an increased workload for maintenance crews and parts can be damaged during the cannibalisation process. For this reason, {{it is important to}} have a clear understanding of the effects that cannibalisation will have on fleet operation and maintenance. Accurate models are needed to predict the effects of cannibalisation on fleet performance and to provide fleet managers with trustworthy information on which to base maintenance decisions relating to cannibalisation and spare parts provision. This paper presents a coloured Petri net (CPN) model of fleet cannibalisation that takes account of fleet operation and a number of factors relating to maintenance. An example fleet is modelled and measures of average fleet readiness and maintenance cost are used to evaluate the effects of cannibalisation on fleet performance. The model is used to assess the impact of a number of maintenance factors and fleet size on the use of cannibalisation and fleet performance...|$|E
40|$|Objective: For {{the purpose}} of {{developing}} Korean herbalogy of the plants to Iridaceae in Korea, the literatures of the successive generations have been thoroughly investigated to prepare this article. Methods: The examined herbalogical books and research paper which published at home and abroad. Results: A list was made about Iridacease plant which are cultivated or grew naturally in Korea, after investigate the data on domestic and foreign Iridaceae plants. Out of those lists, serviceable plants were selected and with those available plants, their distributions were analysed and parts {{which can be used}} as medicines were divided into 3 categories such as oriental medicine name, scientific name and non-official name. Iridacease’s properties flavor, channels they use and effects were also noted, not to mention their toxicity. Iridacease (grew in Korea) was divided into 6 classes with 32 species. Out of those, 5 classes with 11 species were found serviceable which indicates 34 % of all. Out of all 32 specified Iridacease plants, Iris plants were found 27 species, which were shown the most.

40|$|We {{consider}} the service parts end-of-life inventory {{problem of a}} capital goods manufacturer in {{the final phase of}} its life cycle. The final phase starts as soon as the production of parts terminates and continues until the last service contract expires. Final order quantities are considered a popular tactic to sustain service fulfillment obligations and to mitigate the effect of obsolescence. In addition to the final order quantity, other sources to obtain <b>serviceable</b> <b>parts</b> are repairing returned defective items and retrieving parts from phase-out returns. Phase-out returns happen when a customer replaces an old system platform with a next generation one and returns the old product to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). These returns can well serve the demand for service parts of other customers still using the old generation of the product. In this paper, we study the decision-making complications stemming from phase-out occurrence. We use a finite horizon Markov decision process to characterize the structure of the optimal inventory control policy. We show that the optimal policy consists of a time varying threshold level for item repair. Furthermore, we study the value of phase-out information by extending the results to cases with an uncertain phase-out quantity or an uncertain schedule. Numerical analysis sheds light on the advantages of the optimal policy compared to some heuristic policies. spare parts;end-of-life inventory management;phase-out returns...|$|E
