The main purpose of carding is to individualise fibres thoroughly so that they can be spun into yarns. Therefore, the quality of the yarns spun and the quality of fabrics produced from them is largely determined by the effectiveness of the carding process. The design of the licker-in zone determines the degree of pre-opening, and so plays a major role in determining the carding efficiency. This work investigates and evaluates the influence and effectiveness of licker-in design in determining the quality of carded yarns and the fibre configurations in yarn with the two licker-in designs in use today, viz. the single and triple licker-in designs. Two Indian cotton fibre varieties with widely differing characteristics were processed on a commercial high-production card using the single and triple licker-in systems. The quality of yarns spun revealed that licker-in design indeed has a bearing on fibre, yarn and fabric quality. Test results show that whilst the triple licker-in system demonstrated a relative improvement in the yarn quality when processing the medium staple cotton of average fineness, the single licker-in was observed to be more suitable for the longer and finer variety. The analysis of the fibre configuration in yarns indicates that licker-in designs as well as the processing parameters such as licker-in speed and carding rate have an influence on the fibre configuration. Yarns spun using the material processed through the triple licker-in showed more disorder than those of the single licker-in. Finally, an investigation into the fibre opening at the licker-in using high-speed video photography indicates that the degree of opening and the fibre orientation on the licker-in surface before fibre transfer to the main carding cylinder is different between the two licker-in systems. The degree of opening and fibre orientation were also found to depend on the cotton variety, the production rate and licker-in parameters such as speed.

5000|$|The {{processes}} to make yarn <b>short-staple</b> yarn (typically <b>spun</b> from fibers from 0.75 to 2.0") are blending, opening, carding, pin-drafting, roving, spinning, and—if desired—plying and dyeing. In long staple spinning, the process may start with stretch-break of tow, a continuous [...] "rope" [...] of synthetic fiber. In open-end and air-jet spinning, the roving operation is eliminated. The spinning frame winds yarn around a bobbin. [...] Generally, after this step the yarn is wound to a cone for knitting or weaving.|$|R
50|$|The great wheel {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} types of {{spinning}} wheel. The fiber is held in the left hand and the wheel slowly turned with the right. This wheel is thus good for using the long-draw spinning technique, which requires only one active hand most of the time, thus freeing a hand to turn the wheel. The great wheel is usually used to <b>spin</b> <b>short-staple</b> fibers (this includes both cotton and wool), and can only be used with fibre preparations that are suited to long-draw spinning.|$|R
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand <b>spinning.</b> <b>Short-stapled</b> Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|R
