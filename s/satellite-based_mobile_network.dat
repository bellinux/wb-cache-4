Nested <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> have Router Advertisement (RA) confliction problem. In the nested <b>mobile</b> <b>networks,</b> a MR can receive the RA of a child MR {{as well as that}} of a parent MR. But the MR cannot distinguish which MR is its parent, i. e. intermediate MR to the Internet. To solve this RA confliction problem of nested <b>mobile</b> <b>networks,</b> this paper proposes hierarchical architecture of RA, HMRA. For the purpose of hierarchical management, we employ a field for age in the RA message. By setting the initial age of AR to max value and all MRs to zero, when new RA from the other MR is received, we can know the hierarchical relation by arranging the value of age field. The simulation result shows that a MR can recognize the RA from parent MR exactly. This scheme is essential for high degree nested <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> to find a route toward the Internet, and reduces route set up time for frequent <b>mobile</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

However, any single type of wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> cannot meet all types of service requirements. For example, no single type of existing wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> can provide both wide coverage and high bandwidth services. In order to provide more comprehensive services, an integrated heterogeneous wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> is introduced. It consists of several different types of wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> and can provide more connection options for mobile users than a single type of wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network.</b> However, the integrated heterogeneous wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> imposes great challenges in many perspectives. One of these challenges is to efficiently allocate resource for supporting multiple traffic (voice, video, data, and etc). Although a lot of resource allocation schemes have been proposed, they mostly focus on supporting multiple traffic in single type of network or supporting a single type of traffic in an integrated heterogeneous wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network.</b> Therefore, they may not be suitable for supporting multiple traffic in an integrated heterogeneous wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network.</b> In this paper, we propose two preemption-based resource allocation schemes to support multiple traffic in an integrated heterogeneous wireless and <b>mobile</b> <b>network.</b> In both schemes, we allow different types of traffic to have different priorities and higher priority traffic can preempt lower priority traffic. We evaluate the system performances of our proposed schemes by using extensive simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly improve the system performances.

A <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> is composed of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Network</b> Nodes (MNNs) and a Mobile Router (MR). Route optimization for MNNs in IPv 6 <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> is performed with Hierarchical Prefix Delegation protocol (HPD) and Reverse Routing Header (RRH). However, when a <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> that contains a lot of MNNs moves locally in a nested <b>mobile</b> <b>network,</b> problems such as handoff latency, signaling overhead and packet losses will occur. This paper proposes an Advanced Handoff Scheme (AHS) which overcomes the limitations in conventional solutions.

Furthermore, a Mobility Management Router (MMR) is allowed to update the binding information of all MNNs in a <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> without getting Binding Update messages (BUs) from the MNNs as the MMR receives a BU from the MR in the <b>mobile</b> <b>network.</b> The simulation is done by NS- 2.

40|$|This paper aims at {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> service evolution through a closer examination of the context of mobile handsets. It aims first to establish quantitatively that mobile handsets are a determinant of <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> service evolution patterns, and second, to develop a consistent perspective capable of explaining the evolution of various <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> services. Despite the fact that mobile handsets are indispensable to users of <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> services, surprisingly little is known about the role of these handsets in <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> service evolution. This paper provides quantitative evidence of a positive relationship between intra-network-carrier penetration rates for <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> service subscribers and mobile handsets designed for these services. The relationship is such that if one network service is diffused more than another, the mobile handsets related to the more diffused service are similarly more widely diffused in the market, and vice versa. The evidence is derived from an analysis of two <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> services in Japan, mobile Internet and third generation mobile, initiated by NTT DoCoMo and KDDI. There are no existing studies that consistently explain the mechanisms of different <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> service evolution patterns.

From this perspective, this positive relationship can be explained as the similarity or dissimilarity in essential technology ownership distribution across constituents.
