In order to protect are used the unique number which is applied to the case and closing <b>security</b> <b>seal</b> design (an insert). There are various options for the application of a unique number: laser marking (you can’t change the number or erase), pad printing, engraving.|$|E
50|$|The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is a {{voluntary}} supply chain security program led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) {{and focused on}} improving the security of private companies' supply chains with respect to terrorism. The program was launched in November 2001 with seven initial participants, all large U.S. companies. Large-scale <b>Security</b> <b>Seal</b> producers were included within the 'invited foreign manufacturers' segment of the ordinance. C-TPAT compliant security ties indicate they are compliant with international shipping security standards.|$|E
50|$|Bolt seals {{are used}} to secure {{shipping}} containers, trucks and trailers. A bolt seal used for securing containers must conform to the ISO 17712 high <b>security</b> <b>seal</b> {{in order to be}} accepted by customs all around the world in ocean shipping. The C-TPAT (Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) specifies ISO 17712 compliant security seals to be used. Bolt seals are generally closed by hand (by pushing the seal body and head together) and opened with the use of bolt cutters. This gives a strong and secure seal for transportation, while remaining convenient for staff in ports and warehouses.|$|E

50|$|In {{very much}} the same manner as with fire alarms, many {{emergency}} handles and levers, or handles that are not meant to be opened regularly, are enclosed in a thin metal or plastic <b>security</b> <b>seal.</b> The seal is thin, so as not to prevent the handle from being used (in due time), but only to alert maintenance/security personnel that the handle was indeed used.Many times, large sea-going shipping containers have such a metal ring or seal attached to them at the source port. After traveling at sea (and perhaps by land as well), the containers reach their destination, where each container is checked to have the seal properly in place (against a list of doublets - container/seal).|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Ernst Kaltenbrunner's {{personal}} Nazi <b>security</b> <b>seal</b> {{was found}} in an Alpine lake in Styria, Austria, 56 years after he had thrown it away {{in an effort to}} hide his identity. The seal was recovered by a Dutch citizen on vacation. The seal has the words [...] "Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD" [...] (Chief of the Security Police and SD) engraved on it. Experts have examined the seal and believe it was discarded {{in the final days of}} the war in May 1945. It was one of Kaltenbrunner's last acts as a free man. On 12 May 1945, Kaltenbrunner gave himself up, claiming to be a doctor and offering a false name. However, his mistress chanced to spot him as he was led away, called out his name and rushed to hug him. This action tipped off the Allied troops, resulting in his trial and execution. However, according to other sources, Kaltenbrunner's true identity was not discovered by chance. A first-hand account of the arrest from CIA documents clearly states that the American soldiers who arrested Kaltenbrunner were actively searching for him. The Americans were highly confident they had the right man when Kaltenbrunner was arrested, even before his mistress removed any lingering doubt.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} web of distrust, malware, and server compromises, convincing an online {{consumer}} that a website is secure, {{can make the}} difference between a visitor and a buyer. Third-party security seals position themselves as a solution to this problem, where a trusted external company vouches for the security of a website, and communicates it to visitors through a <b>security</b> <b>seal</b> which the certified website can embed in its pages. In this paper, we explore the ecosystem of third-party security seals focusing on their security claims, in an attempt to quantify the difference between the advertised guarantees of security seals, and reality. Through a series of automated and manual experiments, we discover a real lack of thoroughness {{from the side of the}} seal providers, which results in obviously insecure websites being certified as secure. Next to the incomplete protection, we demonstrate how malware can trivially evade detection by seal providers and detail a series of attacks that are actually facilitated by seal providers. Among other things, we show how seals can give more credence to phishing attacks, and how the current architecture of third-party security seals can be used as a completely passive vulnerability oracle, allowing attackers to focus their energy on websites with known vulnerabilities. status: publishe...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Security</b> <b>seals</b> are {{commonly}} employed on devices like electronic voting machines {{in an attempt}} to detect tampering.

50|$|Fixed-length seals {{tend to be}} more tamper {{resistant}} than variable length as there are no sliding parts, they simply 'click' into place to lock, which can make them easier to fit than variable length seals. Most fixed length seals can also be branded and numbered for extra security. Fixed length is often the choice of single use <b>security</b> <b>seals</b> for transport applications.|$|R
5000|$|Bags and {{envelopes}} {{are often}} closed by an integral {{pressure sensitive adhesive}} on the closing flap; removal of a release liner allows convenient closing of the bag. Several types of security features can {{be included in the}} flap structure which are designed to irreversibly indicate opening. [...] Separate security tapes are also used. Tamper-indicating <b>security</b> <b>seals</b> employ a variety of mechanisms for operation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.|$|R
5000|$|Customs {{accepted}} <b>seals</b> are <b>security</b> <b>seals</b> {{which the}} customs department {{of a given}} country will accept as a secure seal to be placed onto a container. This {{does not mean that}} all exporters or importers should place a customs accepted seal on their containers or trailers. Many businesses who transport high value goods like to use Customs Accepted Seals as these seals have been through rigorous testing and are of high quality.|$|R
50|$|Plastic <b>security</b> <b>seals</b> are {{manufactured}} normally in two styles; adjustable or fixed length. Adjustable length seals can fit many applications from securing {{the neck of}} a bag or mail sack to sealing chemical drums, first aid kits and fire extinguishers. They have an adjustable length much like a cable seal but offer a much higher security level and an audit trail due to sequential numbering and the ability on some seals to be bar-coded and have a company name and logo printed or laser etched on.|$|R
50|$|<b>Security</b> <b>seals</b> can {{be split}} into two main groups: {{single-use}} and reusable. Single use seals are typically made of plastic or metal, and the used material and production technology {{is the key to}} their <b>security</b> level. Reusable <b>seals</b> are usually electronic or mechanical rather than just made from plastic, and if purely plastic, only one part is reusable. Electronic and mechanical seals are generally used for the transportation industry, with seal fixed to the back of trucks, trailers and shipping containers. A reusable mechanical or electronic seal can be fitted to the rear or loading doors, extending a cable from itself through fixing points on the doors, and when sealed generating a unique number which is logged. When the door is next opened this number changes, so it provides tamper evidence for the load.|$|R

The goal of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview of findings regarding the persuasiveness of Internet seals and to reflect upon possible explanatory mechanisms for these effects. Future research directions and managerial implications for e-business are provided...|$|R

40|$|In most online {{commercial}} transactions, customers’ {{feeling of}} {{uncertainty about the}} success of an exchange {{can be attributed to}} its faceless and intangible character (Beldad et al. 2010). Uncertainty eventually may lead people to search for certain cues to minimize uncertainty’s discomforting effect and to aid them in deciding whether or not to engage in an exchange in which success is not guaranteed. Whenever people encounter uncertainty in an online exchange, they look for cues that could increase their confidence in the exchange partners. These confidence-enhancing cues or trustworthiness features, according to Beldad et al. (2010), may be either attributes of the exchange partner (e. g., reputation) or characteristics of the channel used for the online exchange (e. g., website design, <b>security</b> <b>seals)</b> ...|$|R

50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} local economy was {{dominated}} by fishing, weaving and handicrafts. In 1824 a steamship company began providing regular service, which allowed the economy to grow. Bad Horn in Horn was advertised as a spa and health resort. Towards {{the end of the}} 19th century cattle, dairy farming and fruit growing became common in the municipality. After the opening of the SBB line Romanshorn-Rorschach in 1869, the bleaching company, Radun AG (1888), and the oil and fat factory Sais (1916-17), were established in Horn. By 1920, industrial companies displaced much of the agricultural sector. After Radun AG closed the mill in 1989 and the oil factory shut down in 2000, only Unisto AG (later specializing in <b>security</b> <b>seals,</b> name badges and brand profiling) as well as Sabo Specialities, successor of Sais, continued to provide manufacturing jobs.|$|R
