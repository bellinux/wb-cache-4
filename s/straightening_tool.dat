50|$|Thrash also {{acknowledged}} common cultural clashes and {{challenges faced by}} African Americans through his portraiture as well. In his etching Saturday Night (Fig. 4), he depicts a female hairdresser readying herself for {{a night on the}} town. Her facial features and coloring distinctly label her as African American, and it is the act she is engaging in that is of utmost importance. The woman is straightening her naturally curly hair with a hot iron. She is conforming to physical standards foisted upon her by the dominant white society where straight hair is a marker of beauty. Though muscular, shapely, and attractive, she feels the need to engage in the laborious task of making her tightly coiled hair straight in order to prepare for the night in the public sphere. In fact, weariness at the task is written all over her face, the scratchy lines of the etching giving heavy shadow to the area underneath her eyes and the lines touching from her nostrils till the outsides of her lips. This technique of etching lends a weariness or faded quality to the entire piece, the woman and her world appearing to be worn down to a mere skeleton of their realities. Her left leg casually draped across her right and the ease with which she appears to hold the <b>straightening</b> <b>tool</b> signify the routine quality of this preparation, despite her apparent dissatisfaction at the procedure. Throughout all of this, she directly confronts the viewer with a strong gaze, as if the audience is her mirror. It is as if Thrash was literally reflecting his African American audience back at themselves, hinting at the psychological expense of attempting to conform to pre-existing white norms. Such an activity, though on the surface merely a shallow process of beautification, carries with it the idea of rejecting your natural physical state, or rather one’s blackness. To Locke and Thrash, this was not viewed as positive for African Americans considering that it the connotation of such an act of conforming to the aesthetical norms of white society puts the natural condition of blacks in a categorization of less than optimal, or ugly. Such a sentiment does not produce pride for the community or bolster the idea of the New Negro. However, Thrash’s acknowledgement of the common practice, reflecting it back to the community, is a step towards progressing towards a more positive, independent state.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. One of the {{promising}} directions of electromagnetic forming (EMF) is a contactless magnetic-pulse straightening {{of the automobile}} bodies. The efficiency {{and the quality of}} the straightening depend on design and operating principle of the <b>straightening</b> <b>tool.</b> In the modern technique of EMF a large number of the tools - inductor systems (IS) is used in different configurations with uneven distribution forces on the treatment object that in turn does not meet the needs of the effective process of straightening. There appears the urgent necessity to create IS with high uniformity of the induced field and a high concentration of attracting forces in the working area of the tool. The most effective IS are the Inductor Systems with an Attracting Screen (ISAS). One of the most important considerations when choosing a particular design ISAS is the study of the electrodynamics processes with definition of excited loads. The nature and the course of the electrodynamics processes in accordance with design features determine the effectiveness and the efficiency of the ISAS. Therefore, in ISAS an additional coil for the concentration of the attracting forces in the working area should be entered. Purpose. The numerical analysis of the induced fields and the currents in the experimental models of ISAS with an additional coil was made. Methodology. In the idealization of the «extremely low» frequencies of existing fields, there were received rated dependences for density of the induced currents and distributed attracting force in ISAS and the external additional coil, through the use of the calculated model in the cylindrical coordinate system. Results. Insertion of the additional coil placed over the accessory screen allows to concentrate and increase the amplitude of the attracting forces in the central part of the working area of the inductor system. Practical value. 1. Numerical analysis of fields and currents in experimental models of Induction Systems with Attracting Screen (ISAS) and additional coil, designed to align the metal coatings of vehicles was made. 2. It is shown that if in ISAS they insert additional coil placed over the accessory screen significantly increases the amplitude of excited forces of attraction. 3. It is shown that the parallel connection of the primary and additional coils in ISAS allows to concentrate the forces of attraction in the centre of the working area of the tool for straightening automobile bodies...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{repair and}} {{recovery}} vehicle body operations {{become more and}} more popular. A special place here is taken by equipment that provides performance of given repair operations. The most interesting things are methods for recovery of car body panels that allow the straightening without disassembling of car body panels and damaging of existing protective coating. Now, there are several technologies for repair and recovery of car body panels without their disassembly and dismantling. The most perspective is magnetic-pulse technology of external noncontact straightening. Basics of magnetic-pulse attraction, both ferromagnetic and nonferromagnetic thin-walled sheet metal, are explored.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{effectively}} improve penetration rates and enhance wellbore quality for vertical wells, a new Automatic Vertical Drilling Tool (AVDT) based on Eccentric Braced Structure (EBS) is designed. Applying operating principle of rotary steering drilling, AVDT adds offset gravity block automatic induction inclination mechanism. When hole <b>straightening</b> happens, <b>tools</b> take essentric moment {{to be produced}} by gravity of offset gravity lock to control the bearing of guide force, so that well straightening is achieved. The normal tool's size of the AVDT is designed as 215. 9  mm，other major components' sizes are worked out by the result of theoretical analysis, including the offset angle of EBS. This paper aims to introduce the structure, operating principle, theoretical analysis and describe the key components' parameters setting of the AVDT...|$|R
