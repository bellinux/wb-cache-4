5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>snakes</b> were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E

5000|$|The spine-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Hydrophis hardwickii [...] ), also {{commonly}} known as Hardwicke's <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> and Hardwicke's spine-bellied <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> is a species of venomous elapid <b>sea</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hydrophis cyanocinctus, {{commonly}} called the annulated <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> or the blue-banded <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> is {{a species of}} venomous <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> in the family Elapidae.|$|R
5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a marine environment, <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In <b>sea</b> <b>snakes,</b> the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|Other unique senses, such as {{electro-magnetic}} {{reception and}} pressure detection, {{have been proposed}} for <b>sea</b> <b>snakes,</b> but scientific studies {{have yet to be}} performed to test these senses.|$|E

5|$|Some octopuses, such as {{the mimic}} octopus, can combine their highly {{flexible}} bodies with their colour-changing ability to mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as lionfish, <b>sea</b> <b>snakes,</b> and eels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>snakes</b> do {{not occur}} in the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought that Pelamis would be found there {{were it not for}} the cold {{currents}} off Namibia and western South Africa that keep it from crossing into the eastern South Atlantic, or south of 5Â° latitude along the South American west coast. <b>Sea</b> <b>snakes</b> {{do not occur}} in the Red Sea, believed to be due to its increased salinity, so no danger exists of them crossing through the Suez Canal. A lack of salinity is also thought to be the reason why Pelamis has not crossed into the Caribbean via the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} the venom of four Sistrurus pit viper species found {{significant}} variation in the toxicity to mice. This variation {{was related to the}} proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species. The idea that Sistrurus venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for the difference in toxicity was the difference in muscle physiology in the various prey animals. Two lineages of elapid snakes, common <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> and Laticauda sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on teleosts, or ray-finned fish. A 2005 study found that both these lineages have a much simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the Australian continent, which have a more varied and complex diet. These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of Toxicocalamus longissimus, a terrestrial species, and Hydrophis cyanocinctus, a marine species, both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the marine species had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins. The venoms of the <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.|$|E
50|$|Acalyptophis is a genus of <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> {{containing}} a single species, Acalyptophis peronii, {{commonly known as}} the spiny-headed seasnake, Peron's <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> or the horned <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> endemic to the western tropical Pacific Ocean. It is the only <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> with spines on the head. Like other members of the family, Hydrophiidae or Elapidae, it is venomous.|$|R
50|$|Hydrophis lapemoides is {{a species}} of snake in the family Elapidae known {{commonly}} as the Arabian Gulf <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> and Persian Gulf <b>sea</b> <b>snake.</b> This <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> is native to the Indian Ocean from the Persian Gulf to the coasts of Thailand.|$|R
50|$|Hydrophis klossi, {{commonly}} known as Kloss's <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> is a species of venomous <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> in the family Elapidae.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are not on}} the CITES {{protection}} lists, however, one species, Laticauda crockeri, {{is classified}} as vulnerable, another, Aipysurus fuscus, classified as endangered, and two, Aipysurus foliosquama and Aipysurus apraefrontalis, are classified as critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>snakes</b> {{appear to}} be active both day and night. In the morning, and {{sometimes}} late in the afternoon, they {{can be seen at}} the surface basking in the sunlight, and they dive when disturbed. They have been reported swimming at depths over , and can remain submerged for as long as a few hours, possibly depending on temperature and degree of activity.|$|E
5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in the skin of its tail, {{allowing}} it to detect light and presumably ensuring it is completely hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> in this respect.|$|E
50|$|Hydrophis stricticollis, {{commonly}} called the collared <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> is {{a species of}} venomous <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> in the family Elapidae.|$|R

50|$|Hydrophis caerulescens, {{commonly}} known as the dwarf <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> is a species of venomous <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> in the family Elapidae.|$|R
5|$|Vision, chemoreception (tongue-flicking) {{and hearing}} are {{important}} senses for terrestrial snakes but these stimuli become distorted in water. The poor visibility, chemical dilution and limitation of ground-borne vibrations underwater suggest that <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> and sea kraits may have unique sensory abilities {{to compensate for}} the relative lack of other sensory cues.|$|E
5|$|All have paddle-like {{tails and}} many have {{laterally}} compressed bodies that give them an eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as <b>sea</b> <b>snakes,</b> comprising 62 species.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the Elapidae family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the waters off its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> should be handled with great caution.|$|E
50|$|Hydrophis fasciatus, {{commonly}} known as the striped <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> is a species of venomous <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> in the family Elapidae (Hydrophiinae).|$|R

50|$|The Graceful Small-headed <b>Sea</b> <b>Snake</b> or Slender <b>Sea</b> <b>Snake</b> Hydrophis {{gracilis}} is {{a species}} of Elapidae (Hydrophiinae-sea snake). Microcephalophis gracilis is a synonym of the snake.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes snakes have {{enlarged}} scales, either {{single or}} paired, under the tail; these are called subcaudals or urosteges. These subcaudals may be smooth or keeled as in Bitis arietans somalica. The {{end of the}} tail may simply taper into a tip (as {{in the case of}} most snakes), it may form a spine (as in Acanthophis), end in a bony spur (as in Lachesis), a rattle (as in Crotalus), or a rudder as seen in many <b>sea</b> <b>snakes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Hydrophiinae, {{commonly}} known as <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> or coral reef snakes, are a subfamily of venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for {{most or all of}} their lives. Most are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the genus Laticauda, which has limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The only genus {{that has}} {{retained}} the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, Laticauda, with only five species. These snakes {{are considered to}} be more primitive, as they still spend much of their time on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip. Laticauda species are also the only <b>sea</b> <b>snakes</b> with internasal scales, i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.|$|E
50|$|Hydrelaps (commonly {{known as}} the Black-ringed <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> Point Darwin <b>sea</b> <b>snake,</b> and Black-ringed {{mangrove}} snake) is a genus of seasnake in the family Elapidae that contains the sole species Hydrelaps darwiniensis.|$|R
50|$|The elegant <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> (Hydrophis elegans) is {{a highly}} venomous <b>sea</b> <b>snake</b> in the Elapidae family. They are found {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, Northern Territory of Australia, and Queensland Australia.|$|R
