It explicitly did not {{decide whether the}} President possessed the Constitutional power to convene military commissions like the one created to try Hamdan. Even if he possessed such power, those tribunals would either have to be sanctioned by the [...] "laws of war", as codified by Congress in Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or authorized by statute. As to the statutory authorization, {{there is nothing in}} the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) [...] "even hinting" [...] at expanding the President's war powers beyond those enumerated in Art. 21.

It appears that the bulk of voters fall into three groups of almost equal size ? about 30 per cent are classified as conservatives (voting No on all three issues), about the same proportion as liberals (Yes to Travel and Information and No on the <b>Substantive</b> <b>Issue)</b> and a slightly smaller proportion as pragmatists (Yes on all three issues). A measure of the proportion voting No for liberal reasons is derived which shows substantial regional variations. This measure is also shown to have a high negative correlation with the Fianna Fail share of the vote in each constituency...|$|R

500|$|Despite the {{discussion}} of <b>substantive</b> <b>issues,</b> the campaign's seriousness continued to come under attack.

[...] Republican strategist Ed Rollins questioned whether Trump could [...] "say the right things" [...] or [...] "be willing to let somebody put an organization together." [...] A New York Daily News/WNBC-TV poll showed that 74% of New Yorkers believed the campaign was being used only for Trump [...] "to promote himself." [...] Roger Stone commented that the perception problem would [...] "solve itself" [...] once the campaign would reveal the number of petition signatures it collected. [...] By mid-November, the campaign started receiving advice from political consultant Douglas Friedline, who ran Ventura's successful 1998 gubernatorial campaign. [...] Upon Friedline's advice, Trump assembled communications and campaign staff, and began planning events in strategic states. As a further step in organization, Trump set up a campaign website at the domain www.donaldjtrump2000.com and used Ventura's webmaster, Phil Madsen, to create an online community of supporters.|$|E
500|$|When The New York Times began {{publishing}} its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His {{words to}} National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included [...] "People have gotta {{be put to}} the torch for this sort of thing..." [...] and [...] "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail." [...] After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a Post editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist, asking them to stop publishing. When the Post refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States 403 US 713. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant <b>substantive</b> <b>issues.</b> While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.|$|E
500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the <b>substantive</b> <b>issues</b> raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Court of Appeal {{rejected}} Vellama's appeal on {{the preliminary}} ground {{of a lack}} of standing, it went on to consider the <b>substantive</b> <b>issues</b> raised. Disagreeing with the High Court's judgment, the Court of Appeal interpreted Article 49(1) of the Constitution as providing that the Prime Minister does not have unfettered discretion in deciding whether or not to call a by-election when a casual vacancy in an SMC arises. Noting the absence in Article 49(1) of a specific time frame within which a parliamentary vacancy must be filled, the Court held that the Prime Minister must do so with [...] "all convenient speed" [...] in line with the common law concept of reasonable time. However, given the polycentric nature of the decision, the Court felt it was undesirable to lay down specific considerations or factors which would determine whether the Prime Minister had or had not called a by-election in reasonable time.|$|E

2500|$|Section 56A of the SCA was {{repealed}} by the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 ("CPC") {{with effect from}} 2 January 2011. For criminal cases, sections 395(1) and 395(2)(a) of the CPC {{have the same effect}} as the repealed section 56A. Questions of law concerning the Constitution can be referred by a Subordinate Court to the High Court for its decision at any stage of proceedings. In Chee Soon Juan v. Public Prosecutor (2011), which concerned a criminal matter, the High Court held that since the Subordinate Courts lack the power to grant prerogative orders, they do not have jurisdiction to deal with the <b>substantive</b> <b>issues</b> of a constitutional challenge. Such questions should be referred to the High Court unless they are [...] "frivolous, or ... made for collateral purposes or to delay proceedings, or if they otherwise constitute an abuse of process". The Court also cautioned against section395 being used to circumvent the requirement that leave of court must be obtained to apply for prerogative orders (see below).|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 Miscavige, {{together}} with Marty Rathbun, visited the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters in Washington D.C. {{to arrange a}} meeting with Commissioner Fred T.

Prior to this meeting, Scientology had filed more than fifty lawsuits against the IRS and, according to The New York Times, [...] "Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig into the private lives of IRS officials and to conduct surveillance operations to uncover potential vulnerabilities... taken documents from an I.R.S. conference {{and sent them to}} church officials and created a phony news bureau in Washington to gather information on church critics. The church also financed an organization of I.R.S. whistle-blowers that attacked the agency publicly." [...] At the meeting with Commissioner Goldberg, Miscavige offered to cease Scientology's suits against the IRS in exchange for tax exemptions. [...] This led to a two-year negotiating process, in which IRS tax analysts were ordered to ignore the <b>substantive</b> <b>issues</b> because the issues had been resolved prior to review. [...] Ultimately, the church was granted recognition as a nonprofit religious or charitable organization in the United States, which creates a tax exemption for the Church of Scientology International and its organizations, and tax deductions for those who contribute to their programs. Senior Scientology officials and the IRS later issued a statement that the ruling was based on a two-year inquiry and voluminous documents that showed the church was qualified for the exemptions.|$|E
