40|$|Calmodulin, a {{multifunctional}} calcium-modulated protein, {{has been}} isolated from <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> tissue and from <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> messenger RNA translation products. The translation protein and the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> protein have been partially characterized and compared to vertebrate calmodulins. <b>Spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> calmodulin will quantitatively activate bovine brain phosphodiesterase and will undergo a calcium-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility {{similar to that}} of bovine brain calmodulin. In the presence of Ca 2 + the spinach and brain proteins comigrate, but in the presence of chelators they do not. A polyadenylylated RNA fraction has been isolated from <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> tissue and translated in a wheat germ cell-free translation system. The calmodulin synthesized in vitro has been isolated by using calcium-dependent affinity chromatography on phenothiazine-Sepharose conjugates. The translation protein comigrates with spinach calmodulin during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis whether in the presence or the absence of Ca 2 +. The translation protein also undergoes a calcium-dependent mobility shift identical to that of spinach calmodulin. Amino acid analysis of the translation calmodulin indicates that it does not contain Nε-trimethyllysine, an amino acid residue that is characteristic of all calmodulins previously examined. These studies suggest that Nε-trimethyllysine is not required for the calcium-dependent interaction of calmodulin with phenothiazines and indicate the potential utility of phenothiazine-Sepharose conjugates as affinity-based adsorbents in biological and biochemical investigations...|$|R

Multiple linear regressions were {{used to analyze the}} relationship between abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its parasitoids and predators and the following climatic variables: maximum and minimum temperature (oC), rainfall (mm) and relative humidity (%). For the analyses, climate variables from the month of collection (control variable) or from the month before the collection (delayed variable) were used. The abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> and predatory ants peaked in the dry season, while parasitoids were most abundant in the rainy season. Significant correlations (P is not great than 0. 05) were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. For all years, maximum temperature was the most dominant variable for all the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> stages. Significant correlations were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. This indicates that the weather variables at both the month of collection and with a delayed month in relation to collection is critical for pest-weather evaluation. This is important for <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> control.

40|$|Shaded coffee agroecosystems {{traditionally}} have few pest problems potentially due to higher abundance {{and diversity of}} predators of herbivores. However, with coffee intensification (e. g., shade tree removal or pruning), some pest problems increase. For example, coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> outbreaks {{have been linked to}} more intensive management and increased use of agrochemicals. Parasitic wasps control the coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> but few studies have examined the role of predators, such as ants, that are abundant and diverse in coffee plantations. Here, we examine linkages between arboreal ant communities and coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> incidence in a coffee plantation in Mexico. We examined relationships between incidence and severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> attack and: (1) variation in canopy cover, tree density, tree diversity, and relative abundance of Inga spp. shade trees; (2) presence of Azteca instabilis, an arboreal canopy dominant ant; and (3) the number of arboreal twig-nesting ant species and nests in coffee plants. Differences in vegetation characteristics in study plots did not correlate with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage perhaps because environmental factors act on pest populations at a larger spatial scale. Further, presence of A. instabilis did not influence presence or severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage. The proportion of leaves with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage was significantly lower where abundance of twig-nesting ants was higher but not where twig-nesting ant richness was higher. These results indicate that abundance of twig-nesting ants in shaded coffee plantations may contribute to maintenance of low <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> populations and that ants provide important ecosystem services in coffee agroecosystems...|$|R

In this review we discuss aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology, and the current evidence for three hypotheses relating to the evolution of this feeding guild. We also present a summary of the literature coverage relating to these herbivores, which have been relatively poorly studied compared with insects that feed externally such as sap suckers and leaf chewers. The majority of published studies concern <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> from the northern hemisphere, with a general focus on those species considered to be agricultural, forestry or horticultural pests. In a more detailed case study, we examine aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology of Australian species. At least 114 species have been recorded as <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia in four orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. Lepidoptera and Diptera are the most speciose orders of Australian leaf miners; Hymenoptera are represented by a single endemic genus and half of all coleopteran miners are species introduced for biological control.

40|$|This {{communication}} {{demonstrates that}} all de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> cells requires {{acyl carrier protein}} (ACP) and occurs specifically in the chloroplasts. Antibodies raised to purified spinach ACP inhibited at least 98 % of malonyl CoA-dependent fatty acid synthesis by <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> homogenates. Therefore, the presence of ACP in a compartment of the <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> cell {{would serve as a}} marker for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. A radioimmunoassay capable of detecting 10 (15) mol (10 (- 11) g) of spinach ACP was developed to measure the levels of ACP in leaf cell components isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation of a gentle lysate of <b>spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> protoplasts. All of the ACP of the leaf cell could be attributed to the chloroplast. Less than 1 % of the ACP associated with chloroplasts resulted from binding of free ACP to chloroplasts. Of interest, ACP from Escherichia coli, soybean, and sunflower showed only partial crossreactivity with spinach ACP by the radioimmunoassay. These results strongly suggest that, in the leaf cell, chloroplasts are the sole site for the de novo synthesis of C 16 and C 18 fatty acids. These fatty acids are then transported into the cytoplasm for further modification and are either inserted into extrachloroplastic membrane lipids or returned to the chloroplast for insertion into lamellar membrane lipids...|$|R

The enzyme from both sources was homogeneous upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. <b>Spinach</b> <b>leaf</b> {{debranching enzyme}} appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain, since the molecular weight of the native protein (110, 000 daltons) was not changed by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate.
