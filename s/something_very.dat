5|$|I had the chills. I had a {{great feeling}} about it when we {{finished}} writing the song, and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning... But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, I really felt <b>something</b> <b>very</b> special.|$|E
5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was {{an event of}} major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself). While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that <b>something</b> <b>very</b> significant had happened.|$|E
5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called <b>Something</b> <b>very</b> very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do justice to the detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E

5|$|Peter finds Walter and {{chooses to}} meet his father alone, as he {{believes}} Walter is upset from the past several days. Now at the beach house, Peter and Walter search for and retrieve a device that can seal shut the doorway into the other universe. Walter explains to Peter that he once lost <b>something</b> <b>very</b> dear to him {{and that he had}} to go and bring it back from another reality; the device was created to prevent something from following him.|$|E
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} {{the wreckage of the}} base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that <b>something</b> <b>very</b> large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins as}} an {{initiate}} {{of a powerful}} sect of magicians, the Shapers. Members of the sect create living beings from the magical essence within themselves. Apprentices are sent to academies to learn the art of shaping and the player's character has been accepted to do so. The player departs on a voyage to the academy aboard a specially modified Drayk, a dragon-like Shaper Creation. During the journey, the Shaper passes a group of islands, {{one of which is}} recognized as the Barred Sucia Island. Locations Barred by the Shapers are closed to both the sect and outsiders alike, meaning a catastrophe has occurred or <b>something</b> <b>very</b> valuable is located there. As the Shaper examines Sucia, lost in thought, the craft is attacked and mortally wounded by an unidentified sailing ship. After igniting the vessel's sails with a fireball, the craft deposits the Shaper on an abandoned dockside before dying. The player is now stranded on Sucia Island and {{must find a way to}} leave.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of these fossils {{is one of}} their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the Burgess Shale or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was <b>something</b> <b>very</b> different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived. Their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and diatoms became prevalent. Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating.|$|E
25|$|On New Year's Eve, Gopal discovers Helen {{has left}} a Christmas gift for him, and it is <b>something</b> <b>very</b> {{meaningful}} to him. He breaks down, and something in him shifts – regarding the relationship, his family, and himself.|$|E
25|$|It {{is easier}} than most Putnam Competition problems, but the {{competition}} often features seemingly obscure problems that turn out to refer to <b>something</b> <b>very</b> familiar. This integral has also {{been used in the}} entrance examinations for the Indian Institutes of Technology.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson's {{home was}} built {{to serve as a}} {{plantation}} house, which ultimately took on the architectural form of a villa. It has many architectural antecedents, but Jefferson went beyond them to create <b>something</b> <b>very</b> much his own. He consciously sought to create a new architecture for a new nation.|$|E
25|$|From 1936 {{until his}} death in 1949, Robinson made {{numerous}} radio and occasional television appearances. The distinctive sound of Robinson's tap dancing was frequently featured, but Robinson also sang, made sound effects, and told jokes and stories from his vaudeville acts. He also addressed the audience directly, <b>something</b> <b>very</b> rare for a black radio performer in that era.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{think there}} is any {{evidence}} that there have been any renditions carried out in the country of Syria. There is no evidence of that. And I think we have to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is <b>something</b> <b>very</b> important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of programming idioms for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed {{in the context of}} using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a low-level programming language. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or <b>something</b> <b>very</b> similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} production {{involved a}} story {{that took place in}} the distant future. In this story, a crew of explorers in a spaceship visit an abandoned planet, discovering signs of an extraterrestrial civilization that left behind technological artifacts. The explorers initially assume that the occupants of the planet had died off, seeing no sign of them, but as the story progresses, the player was meant to discover <b>something</b> <b>very</b> different. This premise is similar to the finished game's story, but contains clear differences.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a young scrumhalf by {{the name}} of Joost van der Westhuizen partnered Naas Botha as the Bulls' halfback combination. Everyone knew he would become <b>something</b> <b>very</b> special, and with time he did. He is {{one of only a handful}} of players that have won a World Cup winners medal (1995), and Tri-Nations winners medal (1998) and a Currie Cup winners medals (1998 and 2002). He captained his side in both the Currie Cup finals he played and was later also awarded the {{captaincy}} of the Springboks in the 1999 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|The player {{enters the}} central chamber, {{resisting}} the Dark Fall, and recites the incantation, imprisoning it, and releasing the trapped souls. Timothy thanks him, {{and before he}} departs, tells him things may not have turned out as he thinks. All evidence of the spirits trapped by the Dark Fall throughout history disappear. The game then cuts back to the opening scene, as the player receives a message from Pete. In the message, Pete begins by saying he has <b>something</b> <b>very</b> important to tell his brother, but then forgets why he rang, and says the redevelopment of the hotel is going well, {{and he will be}} home shortly.|$|E
25|$|At {{the funeral}} for the Italian {{swimming}} team victims, <b>something</b> <b>very</b> unusual happened. As the coffins {{of the victims}} were brought out from the church to the square, the crowd started to applaud. It was a spontaneous salute, almost a statement of defiance against death. It was also a tangible tribute to the young athletes. This, incidentally, was the very first time that clapping was recorded at a public, media-covered funeral in Italy. On numerous subsequent occasions, crowds would salute the victims of the Red Brigades and other domestic terrorist acts in a similar way. Clapping at funerals slowly became a typical salute for victims of media-covered funerals.|$|E
25|$|With the Great Western, Isambard Kingdom Brunel {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for new shipbuilding techniques. He realised that the carrying capacity of a ship increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This means that large ships are more fuel-efficient, <b>something</b> <b>very</b> important for long voyages across the Atlantic. Constructing large ships was therefore more profitable. Moreover, migration to the Americas increased enormously. These movements of population were a financial windfall for the shipping companies, {{some of the largest}} of which were founded during this time. Examples are the P of the United Kingdom in 1822 and the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique of France in 1855.|$|E
