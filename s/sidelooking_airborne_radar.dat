40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the nature and scope of earth resources activities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Because of recent developments from space exploration, NASA and KSC have evolved an earth resources program which focuses on applied R&D activities of direct benefit to a variety of federal, state, and local users. The historical development of this program is traced, and several projects are identified with special emphasis on the use of <b>sidelooking</b> <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> in several Brevard County, Florida test areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} principles of radar backscattering measurements are presented, including measurement statistics, Doppler and pulse discrimination techniques, and associated ambiguity functions. The operation of real and synthetic aperture <b>sidelooking</b> <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> systems is described, {{along with the}} internal and external calibration techniques employed in scattering measurements. Attention is given to the physical mechanisms responsible for the scattering emission behavior of homogeneous and inhomogeneous media, through a discussion of surface roughness, dielectric properties and inhomogeneity, and penetration depth. Simple semiempirical models are presented. Theoretical models involving greater mathematical sophistication are also given for extended ocean and bare soil surfaces, and the more general case of a vegetation canopy over a rough surface...|$|E

40|$|The {{major problem}} {{encountered}} by an <b>airborne</b> bistatic <b>radar</b> is {{the suppression of}} bistatic clutter. Unlike clutter echoes for a <b>sidelooking</b> <b>airborne</b> monostatic <b>radar,</b> bistatic clutter echoes are range dependent. Using training data from nearby range gates will result in widening of the clutter notch of STAP (space-time adaptive processing) processor. This will cause target returns from slow relative velocity aircraft to be suppressed or even go undetected. Some means of Doppler compensation for mitigating the clutter range dependency must be carried out. This thesis investigates {{the nature of the}} clutter echoes with different radar configurations. A novel Doppler compensation method using Doppler interpolation in the angle-Doppler domain and power correction for a JDL (joint domain localized) processor is proposed. Performing Doppler compensation in the Doppler domain, allows several different Doppler compensations to be carried out at the same time, using separate Doppler bins compensation. When using a JDL processor, a 2 -D Fourier transformation is required to transform space-time domain training data into angular-Doppler domain.

30|$|Bistatic pulse-Doppler <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> has {{desirable}} properties {{such as the}} low {{probability of}} detection by other radars relative to its monostatic counterpart. However, the clutter characteristics of bistatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> are more complex than those of monostatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar.</b> The clutter spectra not only vary severely with range, but also vary with bistatic configuration. In this article, the geometry model of bistatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> is given, and the approximate estimation expressions for clutter degrees of freedom (DOFs) are presented. Then a novel clutter suppression method for bistatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> with range ambiguity is presented. The method completes registration-based range ambiguity clutter compensation based on non-uniform sampling and the estimated clutter DOFs. The simulation results illustrate the performance improvement achieved for bistatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar.</b>|$|R

Performing Doppler compensation in the Doppler domain, allows several different Doppler compensations to be carried out at the same time, using separate Doppler bins compensation. When using a JDL processor, a 2 -D Fourier transformation is required to transform space-time domain training data into angular-Doppler domain. Performing Doppler compensation in the spacetime domain requires Fourier transformations of the Doppler compensated training data to be carried out for every training range gate. The whole process is then repeated for every range gate under test. On the other hand, Fourier transformations of the training data are required only once for all range gates under test, when using Doppler interpolation. Before carrying out any Doppler compensation, the peak clutter Doppler frequency difference between the training range gate and the range gate under test, needs to be determined. A novel way of calculating the Doppler frequency difference that is robust to error in pre-known parameters is also proposed. Reducing the computational cost of the STAP processor has always been the desire of any reduced dimension processors such as the JDL processor. Two methods of further reducing the computational cost of the JDL processor are proposed. A tuned DFT algorithm allow the size of the clutter sample covariance matrix of the JDL processor to be reduced by a factor proportional to the number of array elements, without losses in processor performance. Using alternate Doppler bins selection allows computational cost reduction, but with performance loss outside the clutter notch region. Different systems parameters are also used to evaluate the performance of the Doppler interpolation process and the JDL processor. Both clutter range and Doppler ambiguity exist in radar systems operating in medium pulse repetitive frequency mode. When suppressing range ambiguous clutter echoes, performing Doppler compensation for the clutter echoes arriving from the nearest ambiguous range alone, appear to be sufficient. Clutter sample covariance matrix is estimated using training data from the range or time or both dimension. Investigations on the number of range and time training data required for the estimation process in both space-time and angular-Doppler domain are carried out. Due to error in the Doppler compensation process, a method of using the minimum amount of range training data is proposed. The number of training data required for different clutter sample covariance matrix sizes is also evaluated. For Doppler interpolation and power correction JDL processor, the number of Doppler bins used can be increased, {{to reduce the amount of}} training data required, while maintaining certain desirable processor performance characteristics...|$|R

30|$|Monostatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> with <b>sidelooking</b> array antennas has the {{desirable}} {{property that}} the relationship between the clutter spatial and Doppler frequencies is both linear and range invariant, i.e., clutter is stationary, thereby enabling its effective suppression using training data from adjacent ranges. However, in many practical applications, for example, monostatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> with non-sidelooking arrays [4], cylindrical arrays [5], conformal arrays [6], and bistatic <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> [7], the clutter spatial-Doppler frequency relationship becomes nonlinear and range dependent, especially at short range, i.e., clutter is non-stationary.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation is {{on the development of}} advanced reduced rank adaptive signal processing for <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> space-time adaptive pro-cessing (STAP) and steering vector mismatch robustness. This is an important area of research in the field of <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> signal processing since practical STAP algo-rithms should be robust against various kinds of mismatch errors. The clutter return in an <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> has widely spread Doppler frequencies; therefore STAP, a two-dimensional adaptive filtering algorithm is required for effective clutter and jamming cancellation. Real-world effects in nonhomogeneous environments increase the num-ber of adaptive degrees of freedom required to adequately suppress interference. The increasing computational complexity and the need to estimate the interference from a limited sample support make full rank STAP impractical. The research presented here shows that the reduced rank multistage Wiener filter (MWF) provides significant subspace compression better than any previous techniques in a nonhomogeneous en-vironment. In addition, the impact of steering vector mismatch will also be examined on the MWF. In an <b>airborne</b> <b>radar</b> environment, {{it is well known that}} calibration er...|$|R
