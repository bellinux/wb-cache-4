5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific <b>seed</b> <b>bearer</b> (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Lyle Jeffs' {{estranged wife}} Charlene Jeffs claimed in a custody dispute {{that the group}} {{currently}} enforces a doctrine allowing sex with women only by men of the group appointed as [...] "seed bearers", defined as [...] "elect" [...] men of a [...] "worthy blood line chosen by the Priesthood to impregnate" [...] women. Under this doctrine, men no longer are allowed to have children with their wives. Charlene Jeffs wrote in her custody petition: [...] "It is the husband's responsibility to hold {{the hands of their}} wives while the <b>seed</b> <b>bearer</b> 'spreads his seed'. In layman terms, the husband is required to sit in the room while the chosen <b>seed</b> <b>bearer,</b> or a couple of them, rape his wife or wives." [...] She also described the [...] "Law of Sarah," [...] in which FLDS women perform sex acts on each other to prepare for a sexual encounter with a man in the FLDS leadership. Lorin Holm, who claimed to have been part of Jeffs' [...] "inner circle" [...] before he was excommunicated from the group in 2011, later described the [...] "Law of Sarah" [...] practice in Jeffs' community as akin to a lesbian sex show with Jeffs participating and sermonizing. Holm also said that mothers who would not take part were sent away to [...] "redeem themselves", and their children given to other women.|$|E
