Raw water with arsenic concentration up to 200 microgam/L along with high iron content was treated by the AIRU under the field conditions satisfying the Bangladesh standard (50 microgam/L) without using any chemicals. Efficient sludge management was ensured through porper drainage and safe disposal facilities.

40|$|Abstract. Three {{different}} Bulk Specialty Gas delivery Systems (BSGS) {{were designed}} and tested up to <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 1000 slpm. Conventional gas delivery, conventional liquid delivery and a novel liquid delivery system featuring Total Vaporization (TV) were compared {{in terms of}} product consistency {{and the amount of}} available ammonia from a bulk container. The delivered gas was monitored for moisture fluctuations as a function of <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and time. Results from the TV design showed consistent moisture levels at all <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> while both the gas and the conventional liquid delivery systems exhibited dramatic fluctuations in moisture concentration. Additionally, liquid delivery systems supply continuous <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> greater than 5000 slpm, while gas delivery systems can not <b>sustain</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> higher than 600 slpm due to heat transfer limitations. Furthermore, liquid delivery enables the consumption of nearly the entire product, while maintaining constant moisture levels. Empirical evidence has shown that 96 % of the container's contents can be used if the liquid delivery system is employed. However, with a gas or conventional liquid delivery system the impurity levels are uncontrollable and increase throughout the consumption of the bulk container. As a result, it is uncommon for the product to be completely consumed and purifier lifetime can not be accurately assessed...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{flow path}} {{connectivity}} within a geothermal reservoir {{is a critical}} component for efficiently producing <b>sustained</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of hot fluids from the subsurface. I present a new approach for characterizing subsurface fracture connectivity that combines petrographic and cold cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy with stable isotope analysis (δ 18 O and δ 13 C) and clumped isotope (Δ 47) thermometry of fracture-filling calcite cements from a geothermal reservoir in northern Nevada. Calcite cement samples were derived from both drill cuttings and core samples taken at various depths from wells within the geothermal field. CL microscopy of some fracture filling cements shows banding parallel to the fracture walls as well as brecciation, indicating that the cements are related to fracture opening and fault slip. Variations in trace element composition indicated by the luminescence patterns reflect variations in the composition and source of fluids moving through the fractures as they opened episodically. Calcite δ 13 C and δ 18 O results also show significant variation among the sampled cements, reflecting multiple generations of fluids and fracture connectivity. Clumped isotope analyses performed on {{a subset of the}} cements analyzed for conventional δ 18 O and δ 13 C mostly show calcite growth temperatures around 150 °C—above the current ambient rock temperature, which indicates a common temperature trend for the geothermal reservoir. However, calcite cements sampled along faults located within the well field showed both cold (18. 7 °C) and hot (226. 1 °C) temperatures. The anomalously cool temperature found along the fault, using estimates from clumped isotope thermometry, suggests a possible connection to surface waters for the geothermal source fluids for this system. This information may indicate that some of the faults within the well field are transporting meteoric water from the surface to be heated at depth, which then is circulated through a complex network of fractures and other faults...|$|R
40|$|Isotopically {{labelled}} ozone (18 O 3) is {{an ideal}} tool to study the deposition of O 3 to plants and soil, but no studies have made use of it due to the technical difficulties in producing isotopically enriched ozone. For 18 O 3 {{to be used in}} fumigation experiments, it has to be purified and stored safely prior to fumigations, to ensure that the label is present predominantly in the form ofO 3, and to make efficient use of isotopically highly enriched oxygen. We present a simple apparatus that allows for the safe generation, purification, storage, and release of 18 O 3. Following the purification and release of O 3, about half (by volume) of the 18 O is present in the form of O 3. This means that for a given release of 18 O 3 into the fumigation system, a roughly identical volume of 18 O 2 is released. However, the small volume of this concurrent 18 O 2 release (100 nmol molS 1 in our experiment) results in only a minor shift of the much larger atmospheric oxygen pool, with no detectable consequence for the isotopic enrichment of either soil or plant materials. We demonstrate here the feasibility of using 18 O as an isotopic tracer inO 3 fumigations by exposing dry soil to 100 nmol molS 1 18 O 3 for periods ranging from 1 to 11 h. The 18 O tracer accumulation in soil samples is measured using gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS), and the results show a linear increase in 18 O/ 16 O isotope ratio over time, with significant differences detectable after 1 h of exposure. The apparatus is adapted for use with fumigation chambers <b>sustaining</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 1 m 3 minS 1 for up to 12 h, but simple modifications now allow larger quantities of O 3 to be stored and continuously released (e. g. for use with open-top chambers or FACE facilities) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} {{generally}} accepted that reinjection {{will be necessary}} for optimizing the exploitation of a geothermal field. Not only does this afford a way {{to solve the problem}} of disposal of cooled geothermal brine, but it also serves the purpose of maintaining reservoir pressure, thus reducing possible subsidence effects, and <b>sustaining</b> production <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> In addition, reinjection enhances thermal energy extraction from the reservoir rocks. However, reinjection creates a zone of relatively cold water around each injection well that will grow with time and eventually reach the production wells. When the cold water appears ('breaks through') in the producing wells, the efficiency of the operation may be drastically reduced. It is therefore important to design the system of injection wells to prevent cold water breakthrough before a specified time. For a given production field, it is essential that both the location and <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of the injection wells be optimized. In the present paper the results of an initial study of possible reinjection patterns for the Cerro Prieto geothermal field, Baja California, Mexico are discussed. First, the numerical model and assumptions made are described, then the various cases we studied are presented. The resulting data indicate what may be expected from different reinjection schemes and may provide useful guidelines for future reinjection operations at Cerro Prieto and other liquid-dominated geothermal fields...|$|R

These results, however, agree well with the experience of existing EGS trials around the world. Thermal stresses induced during the circulation of cold water have a significant bearing on the long term production rate. As thermal drawdown of the rock matrix takes place, tensile thermal stresses are induced which allow residing fractures to dilate and enhance permeability. This gradually increases the fluid velocities between the injector and producer, yielding increasing production rates with time. It was also observed that the maximum thermal energy that can be recovered by use of our current know-how would be as much as 42 %. Nima Gholizadeh Doonechaly, Sheik S.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations of granular beds {{driven by a}} model hydrodynamic shear flow to elucidate general grain-scale mechanisms that determine the onset and cessation of sediment transport. By varying the Shields number (the nondimensional shear stress {{at the top of}} the bed) and particle Reynolds number (the ratio of particle inertia to viscous damping), we explore how variations of the fluid <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> particle inertia, and fluid viscosity affect the onset and cessation of bed motion. For low to moderate particle Reynolds numbers, a critical boundary separates mobile and static states. Transition times between these states diverge as this boundary is approached both from above and below. At high particle Reynolds number, inertial effects become dominant, and particle motion can be <b>sustained</b> well below <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> at which mobilization of a static bed occurs. We also find that the onset of bed motion (for both low and high particle Reynolds numbers) is described by Weibullian weakest-link statistics, and thus is crucially dependent on the packing structure of the granular bed, even deep beneath the surface.

40|$|Consider a {{communication}} network in which a source node wishes to multicast information to some sink nodes on the network. In the traditional setting, every node can only pass on the data it receives from incoming links to the links leaving it. We consider an extended setting which gives the intermediate nodes more “power”. In our model, each node may send any linear combination of the received data on the outgoing links. Such protocols, known as Linear Network Coding schemes, have been proved to guarantee optimal multicast throughput (that is, {{the maximum number of}} different data packets the source can transmit to all the sinks in one execution of the protocol matches the theoretical bound). In this work, we address the problem of fault tolerance in network coding. More specifically, we are interested in obtaining reliable coding schemes which guarantee optimal (in a sense we shall explain later) throughput even when some edges stop functioning, or are corrupt by noise. We modify an existing algorithm to provide a centralized scheme for finding such codes that tolerate any failure pattern from a polynomially bounded set of possible failure patterns in a network. A failure pattern is a set of edges that fail (transmits a zero message).

40|$|Unsaturated flow in very coarse sediments is a {{critical}} area for improving our basic understanding of vadose zone flow and transport because it contains important aspects that are beyond the realm predictable by classical Miller-Miller scaling analyses. In particular, very coarse-textured (> 1 mm grain-size) media can <b>sustain</b> high <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> at relatively low saturations, doing so via film flow rather than by flow through an interconnected network of saturated pores. Thus, the physics of fast flow processes in unsaturated very coarse media is fundamentally different from that traditionally recognized in finer textured sediments. Our general objectives are (i) to quantify the macroscopic hydraulic properties of very coarse textured sediments in the near-zero (- 10 to 0 kPa) matric potential region, and (ii) determine the microscale basis for fast unsaturated flow. Through these macroscopic and microscale studies, we intend to develop appropriate scaling relations for unsaturated flow in coarse-granular sediments. Gaining improved understanding of unsaturated flow in coarse granular sediments is important for practical concerns. Effective remediation and management of contaminated coarse-grained sediments such as those found at the Hanford Site requires knowledge of unsaturated fast flow. A {{better understanding of the}} failure mode for natural and engineered capillary barriers is also needed. This research proposal was developed to improve our understanding of the physics of unsaturated flow in coarse- to very coarse-textured sediments, and through this meet practical needs related to contaminant transport in such vadose environments...|$|R

Remote Sensing of Environment, 111 : 172 ? 181. Sponsorship: KTP partnership between Reynolds Geo-Sciences Limited and the University of Wales, AberystwythThe stagnation of Himalayan glaciers {{will only be}} exacerbated by a warming climate, increasing hazards associated with glacier lake development. Frontal recession is a poor indicator of negative balance in this region where most glaciers are debris covered, but reduced glacier <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> provide a valuable warning of stagnation. In-situ measurements of velocity are understandably rare and remote sensing measurements have hitherto been limited by severe topography and lack of suitable data. In this paper, we compare two techniques to measure <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in Everest region glaciers. Firstly, satellite radar interferometry (SRI) has recently become more viable because of improved digital elevation data and precision orbit models, which now allow snapshots of velocities to be retrieved from ERS imagery in the mid 1990 s without ground control information. Secondly, feature tracking between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images {{is found to be}} successful, even on the small glaciers of this region, because of the patterning associated with debris cover. This technique extends through the 1990 s and beyond, the time frame over which velocities can be measured. Using the examples of the Khumbu glacier flowing south into Nepal and the Kangshung glacier flowing East into China from the Everest massif, we compare SRI and SAR feature tracking in ERS images, consider the errors in these techniques, and examine the potential to monitor <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> across the region. The techniques are found to be highly complementary and appropriate for monitoring <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in this region, suggesting that routine monitoring of Himalayan glaciers is possible. The Kangshung glacier appears to <b>sustain</b> relatively high <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of up to 10 cm/day which, along with a convex topographic profile, indicates a healthy glacier not exhibiting significant negative mass balance. In comparison, much of the Khumbu glacier appears to have stagnated, the surface velocity at Gorak Shep is only 20 % of a field-based measurement in the 1970 's, and the concave surface profile confirms the downwasting associated with a debris-covered glacier in recession.

To {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome {{of patients in}} urinary retention due to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) treated using transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), an outpatient procedure requiring only local intra-urethral anaesthesia and intravenous sedoanalgesia. Patients and methods. The TUNA technique was used in 38 patients in acute retention due to BPE, 34 of whom were a poor surgical risk. A special cystoscopic catheter device delivered low-level radiofrequency (RF) energy interstitially to a localized area of the prostate, producing necrotic lesions within the prostatic parenchyma. After treatment, all men were evaluated using urinary <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> residual urine volume, the International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of lire score at 1, 3 and 6 months. Results. The mean prostate size was 43. 1 g (range 18 - 90). Tolerance of the procedure when using topical anaesthetic and intravenous sedation was excellent. Of the 38 patients treated using TUNA, 30 (79 %) resumed voiding within a mean of 8. 7 days (range 2 - 27). After 6 months, the <b>sustained</b> mean peak <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> was 10. 4 ± 3. 4 mL/s and the mean residual volume was 76 ± 45 mL. Five of the patients who did not resume voiding after TUNA underwent retropubic prostatectomy and one patient underwent TURP. The mean prostate size in these patients was 55. 7 g. Failure to void {{was associated with the}} treatment of too few areas of the prostate for its volume. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that TUNA is highly effective in relieving patients in urinary retention due to BPE and seems particularly suitable for treating patients who are at greater risk during surgery.

40|$|Reliable {{estimation}} of sewage <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> {{is essential for}} the proper design of sewers, pumping stations, and treatment plants. The design of the various components of the sewerage system should be based on the most critical <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> with a focus on extremely low and peak <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> that would be sustained for a duration related to the acceptable limits of behavior of the components under consideration. The extreme flow conditions and to what extent they differ from the average values are closely related {{to the size of the}} community or network, and the socioeconomic conditions. A single pumping station is usually sufficient to pump flow from small community in either flat or non-undulating topography. Therefore, the hydraulic loading on the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) results from the pumped flow from the pumping station rather than the trunk sewer flow. The intermittent operation of the pumping units further accentuates the sewage hydrograph in the final trunk sewer. Accordingly, the design flow for the various components of the WWTP should be determined based on their relevant flow factors. In this study, analysis of one representative small community out of five monitored small communities in Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is presented. Pumped sewage <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were measured and the sewer incoming flows were hydraulically derived. The hourly and daily sewer and pumped flow records were analyzed to derive the relationship between the flow factors that would be sustained for various durations (instantaneously, 1  h, 2  h, etc.) and their probability of non-exceedance. The resulting peaking factors with a consideration for their <b>sustained</b> <b>flow</b> duration and specified probability would permit the design of the various components of the treatment plant using more accurate critical flows...|$|R
