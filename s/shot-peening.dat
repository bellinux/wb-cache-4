5000|$|As {{one of the}} {{requirements}} for stress corrosion cracking {{is the presence of}} stress in the components, one method of control is to eliminate that stress, or at least reduce it below the threshold stress for SCC. This is not usually feasible for working stresses (the stress that the component is intended to support), but it may be possible where the stress causing cracking is a residual stress introduced during welding or forming.Residual stresses can be relieved by stress-relief annealing, and this is widely used for carbon steels. These have the advantage of a relatively high threshold stress for most environments, consequently it is relatively easy to reduce the residual stresses to a low enough level. In contrast austenitic stainless steels have a very low threshold stress for chloride SCC. This, combined with the high annealing temperatures that are necessary to avoid other problems, such as sensitization and sigma phase embrittlement, means that stress relief is rarely successful as a method of controlling SCC for this system.For large structures, for which full stress-relief annealing is difficult or impossible, partial stress relief around welds and other critical areas may be of value. However, this must be done in a controlled way to avoid creating new regions of high residual stress, and expert advice is advisable if this approach is adopted.Stresses can also be relieved mechanically. For example, hydrostatic testing beyond yield will tend to ‘even-out’ the stresses and thereby reduce the peak residual stress. Similarly laser peening, <b>shot-peening,</b> or grit-blasting tend to introduce a surface compressive stress, and are beneficial for the control of SCC. The uniformity with which these processes are applied is important. If, for example, only the weld region is shot-peened, damaging tensile stresses may be created at the border of the peened area. The compressive residual stresses imparted by laser peening are precisely controlled both in location and intensity, and can be applied to mitigate sharp transitions into tensile regions. Laser peening imparts deep compressive residual stresses on the order of 10 to 20 times deeper than conventional shot peening making it significantly more beneficial at preventing SCC. [...] Laser peening is widely used in the aerospace and power generation industries in gas fired turbine engines.|$|E

40|$|International audienceShot-peening (SP) {{treatments}} {{have shown}} {{their capacity to}} improve the oxidation resistance of titanium and zirconium thanks to the large compressive stresses and the surface hardening induced by this mechanical process. However, <b>shot-peening</b> treatments can produce a surface chemical deposit, which can modify the high temperature oxidation resistance. Here, we study pure titanium samples shot-peened with different type of balls: tungsten carbide, alumina or glass. The oxidation behavior was studied at 700 °C in dry air by thermo gravimetric analysis for short isotherm oxidation periods up to 100 h. Also, long oxidation tests (3000 h) at 700 °C were performed with an intermittent monitoring of the samples mass.

Consequently, the <b>shot-peening</b> numerical simulation takes into account this initial state in terms of residual stresses, plastic strains and hardening parameters. Besides, the material exhibits a gradient of microstructure and mechanical properties due to the thermochemical treatment. Thus, it is modeled as a composite material, where the gradient of mechanical properties (stress-strain curve at a given depth) is linked to the in-depth measured hardness.

A high carbon steel, C 70 S 6 (AISI 1070), was air cooled. The other material was a powder metal (0. 5 % C) steel. Each group of steels was divided into two. One was shot-peened. The other half remained in their original conditions. All were fatigue tested under fully reversed (R=- 1) tension-compression loading conditions. Microhardness tests were carried out on both the grip and gage sections of selected non shot-peened and shot-peened specimens to determine the hardness profile and effect of cycling. <b>Shot-peening</b> {{was found to be}} deeper on one side of each specimen. Compressive residual stress profiles and surface roughness measurements were provided. <b>Shot-peening</b> increased the surface roughness from 0. 26 ± 0. 03 µm to 3. 60 ± 0. 44 µm. Compressive residual stresses induced by <b>shot-peening</b> reached a maximum of - 463. 9 MPa at a depth of 0. 1 mm. The fatigue limit (N≈ 106 cycles) and microhardness profiles of the non shot-peened and shot-peened specimens were compared to determine the material behaviour changes after <b>shot-peening</b> and cycling. Also their fatigue properties were related to the manufacturing process including heat and surface treatments. Comparing the grip and gage microhardness profiles of each steel showed that neither cyclic softening nor hardening occurred in the non shot-peened condition. Cyclic softening was apparent in the shot-peened regions of all steels except powder metal (PM) steel. The amount of softening in the shot-peened region was 55. 0 % on the left side and 73. 0 % on the right in the AISI 1141 steel, 46. 0 % on the left side and 55. 0 % on the right in the C 70 S 6 AC steel and 31. 0 % on the right side in AISI 1151 QT steel. Softening was accompanied by a decrease in the depth of surface hardness. It is suggested that although the beneficial effects of shot peening, compressive residual stresses and work hardening, were offset by surface roughness, crack initiation was more likely to occur below the surface.

However, prediction of the fatigue life of <b>shot-peened</b> components under LCF is challenging due to the complex interaction between the shot peening induced effects and service conditions, especially in regions of high stress concentration. The current study aims to develop a validated 3 -D eigenstrain-based modelling tool, which is capable of simulating the stress/strain evolution under LCF in <b>shot-peened</b> notched samples representative of the real turbine blade fir tree geometry. The residual stress and strain hardening profiles caused by shot peening were first evaluated by experiments and then incorporated into the finite element (FE) model separately. In addition, the Smith – Watson – Topper (SWT) method was used to predict the fatigue life of shot peened samples, based on the stress/strain data generated using the developed FE model...|$|R
