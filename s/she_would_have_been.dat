Had she been commissioned, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known as USS West Conob (ID-4033), but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her.|$|E
5|$|Lisa del Giocondo {{spent her}} final years at Florence's Saint Orsola convent where she died on July 15, 1542, {{at the age}} of 63. In a {{scholarly}} account of their lives, Francesco was nearly 80 years old when he died in 1539. Lisa may have lived until at least 1551, when <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> 71 or72.|$|E
5|$|West Arrow was {{inspected}} by the 13th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion and was assigned {{the identification number}} of 2585.

5|$|West Caruth was {{inspected}} by the 12th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion for possible {{use as a}} service collier and was assigned the identification number of 3850.

5|$|Born in 1989, Liukin was {{ten months}} {{too young to}} compete as a senior in 2004, and thus was not {{eligible}} for {{a place on the}} U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Her scores in the junior division at the 2004 U.S. National Championships were competitive with those being posted by the seniors, and Marta Karolyi, the U.S. national team coordinator, has said that if Liukin had been eligible, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> named to the Olympic team.|$|E

5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport {{following the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the 2014 Sochi Games, Badenhorst competed {{and trained}} in the Netherlands, Austria, and the United States. By February 2014, she was ranked eighth in the world. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the first female snowboarder to {{represent}} Australia at the Winter Paralympics at Sochi, but was forced to withdraw from her event after suffering an injury to her left knee whilst training {{on the morning of}} the event.|$|E

5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, a disembodied Oscar floats over Tokyo and {{witnesses}} {{the aftermath of}} his death. Linda becomes withdrawn and despondent, especially after getting an abortion; Oscar's dealer, Bruno, destroys his stash; Alex lives in hiding on the streets; and Linda wishes <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> with Alex instead of Mario, as Oscar had wanted. On one occasion, Linda wishes that Oscar {{would come back to}} life; Oscar then enters Linda's head, and experiences her dream in which he wakes up at the morgue, from which his body is taken to be cremated.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Königsberg was ordered to attack British commerce around {{the entrance to the}} Red Sea. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier Koenig from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to Königsberg. Looff then radioed the German steamer Zieten to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> confiscated. Königsberg chased after the German freighter Goldenfels, whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. Königsberg was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of Goldenfels to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.|$|E

6000|$|Anne was ashamed. Had Lady Dalrymple and her {{daughter}} even been very agreeable, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ashamed of the agitation they created, but they were nothing. There was no superiority of manner, accomplishment, or understanding. Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of [...] "a charming woman," [...] {{because she had a}} smile and a civil answer for everybody. Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so awkward, that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth.|$|R
5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|The {{first version}} of the Gorgon, Medusa, was to have five feet, but due to {{perceived}} animation difficulties, the final version had one tail. Other Gorgons in the game adhered to this design. The goddess Artemis was considered for inclusion in God of War: Ascension as a playable female character, offering alternative combat options. Game Director Todd Papy said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. However, she was ultimately cut from the game and thus only appears in the original God of War as a translucent head.|$|E
5|$|As a carrier, {{the ship}} was {{to have had a}} {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 guns in dual mounts, ten 3.7cm SK C/30 guns in dual mounts, and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts. Conversion work was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war. This plan was also abandoned, and {{the ship was}} broken up for scrap.|$|E

25|$|If the Mary Wood {{listed in}} the 1860, 1880, and 1900 censuses is the same person as Mary Ramsey Wood, then, owing to a slight {{discrepancy}} in the stated ages, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> between 96 and 98 {{years old at the}} time of her death.|$|E
25|$|After her resignation, Sir Alan Sugar {{informed}} Adele {{that had}} Tim brought her up, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the one who}} was fired due to her consistent failures and disrespectful attitude, while also adding criticism for not admitting to being at fault in this or any other previous task.|$|E
25|$|If Mary Ramsey Wood {{had lived}} to be 120, as claimed, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the world's oldest person at that time, and would be the oldest American on record even today.
