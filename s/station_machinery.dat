40|$|Abstract — Power {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors for a developing country like Bangladesh. Like the rest of the countries of the world, the demand for power is increasing day by day in our country. At present, power failure has become an acute problem for this country. It has become hard to solve the power crisis. There are several reasons behind this problem such as limitation of resources, low generation capacity, high demand, derated capacity of power <b>station</b> <b>machineries</b> etc. To become a developed country, Bangladesh needs to overcome the problem of power crisis soon. Renewable energy can be a great source to solve the power crisis problem at a great extent. Here we have discussed about different forms of renewable energy that we can use to meet the increasing power demand of Bangladesh. We have mainly discussed those renewable energy sources which can be used in solving the power crisis of Bangladesh such as Solar energy, Bioenergy, Geothermal...|$|R
50|$|Players were colonists {{and instead}} of doing combat in the {{traditional}} sense the game focused on politics and manual labor. Players politically fought for sectors of the station which could then be equipped to provide services to other players. Using tools the player could manufacture new technology as well as repair parts of the station that were slowly degrading. Letting too many failing systems in the <b>station</b> rendered <b>machinery</b> unavailable until players repaired them.|$|R

50|$|A {{fossil fuel}} power station {{is a power}} station which burns fossil fuel such as coal, natural gas, or {{petroleum}} to produce electricity. Central station fossil fuel power plants are designed {{on a large scale}} for continuous operation. In many countries, such plants provide most of the electrical energy used. Fossil fuel power <b>stations</b> have <b>machinery</b> to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electrical generator. The prime mover may be a steam turbine, a gas turbine or, in small plants, a reciprocating internal combustion engine. All plants use the energy extracted from expanding gas, either steam or combustion gases. Very few MHD generators have been built which directly convert the energy of hot, moving water into electricity. MHD means Magnetohydrodynamics, which is the study of the magnetic properties of electrically conducting fluids. Examples of such magnetofluids include plasmas, liquid metals, salt water and electrolytes.|$|R
50|$|From its {{construction}} up to 1912, the Junqueira Power <b>Station</b> acquired new <b>machinery</b> {{to increase its}} production. In 1908 it started off with two alternators from the Boavista Power Station, each with a 1 MW output, and six Delaunay - Belleville boilers. The 1910 expansion involved the installation of three new Brown Boveri & Cª. turbo-alternators that raised the total output to 7.75 MW, as well as four boilers at a first stage, later joined by five more boilers with greater vaporisation capacity.Thus, in 1912, when all this equipment was in place, the original Tejo Power Station had fifteen small Belleville boilers and five generating sets that supplied the city of Lisbon’s electric grid.|$|R
5000|$|Ice cores are {{cylindrical}} {{samples from}} within ice sheets in the Greenland, Antarctic, and North American regions. First attempts of extraction occurred in 1956 {{as part of}} the International Geophysical Year. As original means of extraction, the U.S. Army’s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory used an 80 ft-long modified electrodrill in 1968 at Camp Century, Greenland, and Byrd <b>Station,</b> Antarctica. Their <b>machinery</b> could drill through 15-20 feet of ice in 40-50 minutes. From 1300 to 3000 ft in depth, core samples were 4 ¼ inches in diameter and 10 to 20 ft long. Deeper samples of 15 to 20 ft long were not uncommon. Every subsequent drilling team improves their method with each new effort.|$|R
40|$|The noise {{environment}} {{in a typical}} poultry processing plant was characterized by developing noise contours for two representative plants: Central Soya of Athens, Inc., Athens, Georgia, and Tip Top Poultry, Inc., Marietta, Georgia. Contour information was restricted to the evisceration are of both plants because nearly 60 percent of all process employees are stationed in this area during a normal work shift. Both plant evisceration areas were composed of tile walls, sheet metal ceilings, and concrete floors. Processing was performed in an assembly-line fashion in which the birds travel through the area on overhead shackles while personnel remain at fixed <b>stations.</b> Processing <b>machinery</b> was present throughout the area. In general, the poultry processing noise problem {{is the result of}} loud sources and reflective surfaces. Within the evisceration area, it can be concluded that only a few major sources (lung guns, a chiller component, and hock cutters) are responsible for essentially all direct and reverberant sound pressure levels currently observed during normal operations. Consequently, any effort to reduce the noise problem must first address the sound power output of these sources and/or the absorptive qualitities of the room...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{reports the}} {{analysis}} and application of a large scale pumping <b>station</b> with complex <b>machinery,</b> electrical, and hydraulic systems. The interaction between the pump system and transient flow {{in case of a}} sudden tripping of power to the system was investigated by numerically solving governing equations of multi pumps in parallel operation. The transient flow in the hydraulic system and the dynamics of the pumps, for example, oscillation of the surge tank, water hammer wave propagation, dynamical fluid torque acting on the pump impeller, and dynamical pump speed, were obtained on the complete pump model. Results obtained with the present approach show a promising reference for operation of a large scale pumping station with complex system in undulating case due to a sudden power tripping...|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet-educated Tsedenbal viewed Damba as [...] "backward," [...] lazy, and uneducated. He {{engineered}} Damba's {{removal from}} office in November 1958, just {{six months after the}} Thirteenth MPRP congress had reelected him to the position. Taking a cue from Nikita Khrushchev’s 1957 consolidation of power in the USSR by purging political rivals Georgy Malenkov and Nikolai Bulganin, Tsedenbal accused Damba of “profound ideological-political backwardness, conservatism and inertia” and “opportunist tolerance of distortions and shortcomings.” Just over a year later, in November 1959, Damba was sent into internal exile and demoted to director of the Ikh-Uul district animal husbandry <b>machinery</b> <b>station</b> in remote Khövsgöl Province [...] In 1962 Damba became deputy director of the Institute of Agriculture, a position he held until 1977.|$|R
500|$|WALL-E went undeveloped {{during the}} 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not {{confident}} enough yet {{to have a}} feature length film with a main character that behaved like Luxo Jr. or R2-D2. Stanton explained {{there are two types}} of robots in cinema: [...] "human with metal skin", like the Tin Man, or [...] "machine with function" [...] like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea [...] "powerful" [...] because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do with babies and pets: [...] "You're compelled ... you almost can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'" [...] He added, [...] "We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life." [...] The animators visited recycling <b>stations</b> to study <b>machinery,</b> and also met robot designers, visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, watched a recording of a Mars rover, and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human.|$|R
40|$|Aquaculture {{production}} enterprises, {{like other}} farm enterprises, require advanced planning to make production and marketing management {{decisions that are}} likely to result in profits. The purpose of this report is to provide production cost estimates for selected aquaculture enterprises to assist aquaculture producers in making production decisions and obtaining adequate financing. Aquaculture enterprises and their associated costs differ considerably among producers and resource situations. The projected costs presented here should not be interpreted as averages for producers in the industry. The purpose of the cost projections is to provide guidelines whereby producers and others with an interest in aquaculture production costs can make cost estimates appropriate to their unique situation that will facilitate sound management decisions. Data used in development of the budgets is a combination of information obtained directly from producers, Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service Specialists and Louisiana Agricultural Experiment <b>Station</b> Scientists. Current <b>machinery</b> and other input price data were combined with production practice data using the Microcomputer Enterprise Budget Generator developed at Mississippi State University. Fixed costs were estimated based on typical rates of use and sizes of operations. Production budget estimates are presented on a 'per acre' basis to facilitate using the estimates for different size operations. Overhead costs associated with operation of the farm business have been allocated as a residual claimant on a per acre basis in the enterprise budgets, but have not been included in the computation of breakeven selling prices. Farm Management,...|$|R
