5000|$|By design, it is {{physically}} impossible to mount EF-S lenses on EF-only cameras. This {{is because the}} increased proximity of the lens to the <b>sensor</b> <b>means</b> that on full-frame sensor or 35mm film EF cameras the lens itself would obstruct the mirror's movement and cause damage to the lens and/or camera. While {{it is possible to}} modify the lens such that the physical obstruction is removed, allowing for mounting to EF mount cameras, the rear of the lens would still obstruct the mirror. An additional reason is that the lenses produce a smaller image circle of even illumination (circle of no vignetting). An EF-S lens alignment mark is indicated by a small white rectangle, whereas the EF employs a small red dot. The lens will insert into the body when the alignment marks on each are matched, and the lens can then be rotated and locked into the operating position. EF-S camera bodies have both EF-S and EF alignment marks, while EF bodies have only EF marks. Some have reported success attaching EF-S lenses to full-frame bodies with the use of an extension tube; however, this does not eliminate the vignetting problem, and also removes the lens's ability to achieve infinity focus. Also, attachment of EF-S lenses on EF bodies can often be accomplished by removing the small plastic ring seen in the photo above. Although vignetting is still an issue, photos can be taken, and infinity focus achieved. This modification comes with caveats, one being that on some lenses, like the EF-S 10-22mm, at the 10mm setting, the element protrudes too far back toward EF mount camera bodies.|$|E

The FOM of the sensor in this work can reach 233.5, which is far {{higher than that of}} the published plasmonic refractive index sensor in the visible region [24, 28, 34].

Furthermore, we demonstrate that, compared to the common MDM structures, the usage of triangular nanoribbons in the structure is helpful to improve absorption performance. And meanwhile, the absorption mechanisms is also investigated and analyzed in detail. Considering the fabrication of the proposed structure, the triangular nanoribbons can be manufactured by many methods, such as e-beam lithography [41], molding [42], and imprint lithography [43].

Since stannic oxide is {{the most frequently used}} material, we shall restrict our discussion to SnO 2 -based sensors, which are currently prepared and characterized in our laboratory.

40|$|Data {{association}} {{is currently a}} major problem in passive sonar; it can be described as the problem of associating signals relating to a single source. In this thesis three novel algorithms are presented that address the data association problem for a single omni-directional passive sonar. Using this type of <b>sensor</b> <b>means</b> that {{it is not possible to}} obtain any information about the position of the noise source, consequently previously developed association algorithms, which rely on this information, cannot be implemented. As such the algorithms presented in this thesis associate information based on the shape, features and characteristics of the different signals. This is a new approach to solving the data association problem. The first of the algorithms presented uses a combination of template matching, with b-splines being used to form the template, and an exploitation of the known physical properties of signals emanating from a single noise source. The second algorithm identifies three key features (each of which is characterised by three parameters). Each of the signals are analysed to identify the presence of any of these features, which in turn are localised, identified and parametrised using a combination of wavelets, b-splines and a line-searching algorithm. It is then possible to form associations based of the presence of similar features occurring at the same time. The final approach uses cluster analysis. Several key ideas and developments in the field are identified and discussed before a number of the more suitable methods are tested on simulated data, which has been designed to mimic the characteristics expected in real data.

30|$|When the {{plasmonic}} metamaterial {{structures are}} surrounded by gas and liquid, a spectral shift of the resonance wavelength can be occurred due to the change of refractive index of environment. Thus, in practical application, narrow band absorbers are often used as biosensor, owing to the narrower band to improve the sensing performance. In designing sensors, the wavelength sensitivity (S) and the FOM are generally used for evaluating their performance, where the sensitivity and figure of merit are defined as S[*]=[*]Î”Î»/Î”n, FOM[*]=[*]S/FWHM respectively. The Î”Î» is the resonance wavelength change of reflectance spectrum, which results from the refractive index change of surrounding environment, and FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the reflectance spectrum. As we all know, the higher FOM of refractive index <b>sensor</b> <b>means</b> the bio-sensor with better performance of molecule detection. Thus, it is very meaningful to design an ultra-high FOM refractive index sensor with a simple structure. Unfortunately, the previously reported plasmonic sensors based on metamaterial structure generally have a relatively low FOM < 600 [22 â€“ 39], which will severely limit their further development and application. Shen designed a gold mushroom array structure with a narrow FWHM of 10 Â nm and a high FOM of 108 [22]. Liu designed a cross-shape patch array structure with FWHM of 12 Â nm and S of 538 Â nm/RIU [23]. Lin proposed and analyzed based on bowtie nanoantenna arrays (BNAs) with a FOM of 254 [24]. Lu proposed a nanolit microcavity-based structure and demonstrated a narrower FWHM of 8 Â nm and a FOM of 25 [25]. Li designed and investigated a plasmonic sensor with a FOM of 120 based triple-band metamaterial [26]. Recently, Srekanth proposed a plasmonic refractive index sensor based on a hyperbolic metamaterial with a FOM of 590 [27].

30|$|The {{challenges}} {{with the}} localization setup {{lie in the}} system architecture and the sensor fusion. The inter-agent ranging and lack of anchor nodes mean that some global state estimation is required with a potentially prohibitive large computational cost. The global state estimation, the distributed measurements, and the (required) high sampling rates of the inertial <b>sensors</b> <b>mean</b> that a potentially substantial communication is needed and that the system may be sensitive to incomplete or varying connectivity. The feet are poor placements for inter-agent ranging devices and preferably inertial sensors are used on both feet, meaning that the sensors of an individual agent will not be collocated. This gives a high system state dimensionality and means that relating the sensory data from different sensors to each other is difficult and that local communication links on each agent are needed. Further, inter-agent ranging errors as well as sensor separations, often have far from white, stationary, and Gaussian characteristics. Together, this makes fusing ranging and dead reckoning in a high integrity and recursive Bayesian manner at a reasonable computational cost difficult.|$|R
