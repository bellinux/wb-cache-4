40|$|We have {{constructed}} a global reaction kinetic model {{to better understand}} and describe the NOx storage/reduction process {{in the presence of}} CO 2. Experiments were performed in a packed-bed reactor with a Pt–Ba/¿-Al 2 O 3 powder catalyst (1 wt% Pt and 30 wt% Ba) with different lean/rich cycle timings. The model is based on a multiple storage sites mechanism and considers that fast NOx storage occurs at surface barium sites, as determined by the reaction kinetics. Slow NOx storage occurs at the <b>semi-bulk</b> and bulk barium sites, where diffusion plays a major role. It is assumed that surface, bulk, and <b>semi-bulk</b> sites differ not only in physical appearance, but also in chemical reactivity. The distribution of these sites is obtained from 9 -h lean-phase and 15 -h rich-phase cycling experiments and thermogravimetric analysis of fresh catalyst. The model adequately describes the NO and NO 2 breakthrough profiles during 9 h of lean exposure, as well as the subsequent release and reduction of the stored NOx. Furthermore, the model is also capable of simulating transient reactor experiments with 240 -s lean-cycle and 60 -s rich-cycle timings...|$|E
40|$|Poly(ester-ether-urethane) s {{copolymers}} are a resourceful {{class of}} biopolymers for {{the preparation of}} nanocarriers for drug delivery applications. However, a simple clinical translation for this synthetic material with biological and quality features is still needed. In this view, poly(ε-caprolactone) -co-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers were synthesized as <b>semi-bulk</b> pilot (Kg) scale under mild conditions in absence of catalyst, bearing functional termini such as fluorescein tag and anticancer targeting moieties. The obtained materials were processed into surface decorated paclitaxel (PTX) loaded nanoparticles (NPs). The NPs were fully characterized in vitro and in vivo biodistribution in healthy mice evidenced no sign of toxicity {{and lower levels of}} PTX in lung and spleen, compared to clinically applied PTX dosage form...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved, significantly more efficient formulation {{of an existing}} model for bulk cargo or <b>semi-bulk</b> cargo ship scheduling problems with a single loading port. The original model, published by Ronen in 1986, was formulated as a non-linear, mixed integer program. In this work, the authors were able to re-formulate it into a linear one, by eliminating all the non-linearities of the original model. In addition, this model has far fewer integer variables than the original one. A numerical example {{has been given to}} illustrate the elimination of non-linearities and how 40 integer variables, in the original model, are reduced to just eight. This example also shows that this model is better at finding exact optimal solutions than the original one. It is also worth observing that the resulting model is a generalization of the 'capacitated facility location problem'...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{differential}} desorption technique, called intermittent temperature-programmed desorption (ITPD), {{was used}} to give {{new insights into the}} properties of La 1 −xSrxCo 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 perovskites as a contribution to improve their performances with respect to various important application fields such as catalysis, electrocatalysis and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Both ITPD and interrupted TPD (carried out at different heating rates) evidenced two distinct oxygen adsorbed states, desorbing at temperatures lower than 400 °C, corresponding to less than 5 % of a compact monolayer of oxide ions. The first one, for low desorption temperatures (lower than 290 °C) exhibits a heat of adsorption (ΔH) distribution from 101 to 121 kJ mol− 1. The second one, for higher desorption temperatures (between 290 and 400 °C) corresponds to ΔH = 146 ± 4 kJ mol− 1. Additionally, for temperatures higher than 400 °C, we observed a continuous desorption of oxygen species, probably originating from the sub-surface or <b>semi-bulk,</b> with an associated activation energy of desorption ≥ 175 kJ mol− 1...|$|E
40|$|The Surface Science Laboratories at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) are {{equipped}} with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS or ESCA) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) facilities. These techniques provide information from the uppermost atomic layers of a sample, and are thus truly surface sensitive. XPS provides both elemental and chemical state information without restriction {{on the type of}} material that can be analyzed. The sample is placed into an ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber and irradiated with x-rays which cause the ejection of photoelectrons from the sample surface. Since x-rays do not normally cause charging problems or beam damage, XPS is applicable {{to a wide range of}} samples including metals, polymers, catalysts, and fibers. AES uses a beam of high energy electrons as a surface probe. Following electronic rearrangements within excited atoms by this probe, Auger electrons characteristic of each element present are emitted from the sample. The main advantage of electron induced AES is that the electron beam can be focused down to a small diameter and localized analysis can be carried out. On the rastering of this beam synchronously with a video display using established scanning electron microscopy techniques, physical images and chemical distribution maps of the surface can be produced. Thus very small features, such as electronic circuit elements or corrosion pits in metals, can be investigated. Facilities are available on both XPS and AES instruments for depth-profiling of materials, using a beam of argon ions to sputter away consecutive layers of material to reveal sub-surface (and even <b>semi-bulk)</b> analyses...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of synchrotron radiation based X-ray microscopic techniques (mu-XRF, mu-XANES, mu-XRD) applied on single depleted uranium (DU) particles and <b>semi-bulk</b> leaching experiments has been employed {{to link the}} potential bioavailability of DU particles to site-specific particle characteristics. The oxidation states and crystallographic forms of U in DU particles have been determined for individual particles isolated from selected samples collected at different sites in Kosovo and Kuwait that were contaminated by DU ammunition during the 1999 Balkan conflict and the 1991 Gulf war. Furthermore, small soil or sand samples heavily contaminated with DU particles were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal fluid (0. 16 M HCl) extractions. Characteristics of DU particles in Kosovo soils collected in 2000 and in Kuwait soils collected in 2002 varied significantly depending on the release scenario {{and to some extent}} on weathering conditions. Oxidized U (+ 6) was determined in large, fragile and bright yellow DU particles released during fire at a DU ammunition storage facility and crystalline phases such as schoepite (UO(3). 2. 25 H(2) O), dehydrated schoepite (UO(3). 0. 75 H(2) O) and metaschoepite (UO(3). 2. 0 H(2) O) were identified. As expected, these DU particles were rapidly dissolved in 0. 16 M HCl (84 +/- 3 % extracted after 2 h) indicating a high degree of potential mobility and bioavailability. In contrast, the 2 h extraction of samples contaminated with DU particles originating either from corrosion of unspent DU penetrators or from impacted DU ammunition appeared to be much slower (20 - 30 %) as uranium was less oxidized (+ 4 to + 6). Crystalline phases such as UO(2), UC and metallic U or U-Ti alloy were determined in impacted DU particles from Kosovo and Kuwait, while the UO(2, 34) phase, only determined in particles from Kosovo, could reflect a more corrosive environment. Although the results are based on a limited number of DU particles, they indicate that the structure and extractability of DU particles released from similar sources (metallic U penetrators) will depend on the release scenarios (fire, impact) and to some extent environmental conditions. However, most of the DU particles (73 - 96 %) in all investigated samples were dissolved in 0. 16 M HCl after one week indicating {{that a majority of the}} DU material is bioaccessible...|$|E
