5|$|In 1850 {{an engine}} shed had been {{opened on the}} south bank of the River Avon on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to the B station. Between 1859 and 1875, 23 engines {{were built in the}} {{workshops}} attached to the shed, including several distinctive Bristol and Exeter Railway 4-2-4T locomotives.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} then {{defined a}} limit (the so-called Red Line), along the 15th parallel, extending from Mao to Abéché, {{and warned that}} they would not tolerate any incursion south of this line by Libyan or GUNT forces. Both the Libyans and the French remained on their <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> with France showing itself unwilling to help Habré retake the north, while the Libyans avoided starting a conflict with France by attacking the line. This led to a de facto division of the country, with Libya maintaining control of all the territory north of the Red Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railway introduced new tensions {{between the government and}} the First Nations. The authorities wished to move the indigenous peoples to reservations north of the railway in order to cut them off from the United States border. For their part, the First Nations were unhappy about the railway being built through their lands, stole company horses and disrupted the construction work. The mounted police made arrests and the government reduced their rations: by 1883, the threat of starvation had forced the First Nations to relocate to the northern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|The station {{building}} is on <b>the</b> northeastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> facing <b>the</b> inner city. On <b>the</b> other, southwestern, <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> is <b>the</b> goods yard.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method is}} less sensitive to <b>the</b> calculation reference <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> compared with <b>the</b> Z-bus method.|$|R
50|$|Also of {{interest}} is a tunnel connecting the Eveleigh rail yards, on <b>the</b> southern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>line,</b> to <b>the</b> northern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>line,</b> just past Redfern.|$|R
5|$|The main display map of {{the game}} is focused on Cyrenaica, a {{representation}} of the Allied minefield that was laid in the Gazala Line between Gazala and Bir Hachieim. The Axis troops begin the game on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> whilst Allied forces begin the offensive in British Egypt. A command box in the game provides the player with an instant report of a unit or landscape once hovered over; data given on units includes their strength in terms of supply of infantry, provisions, artillery, and the number of moves that unit can make on one turn. Every two turns lasts one in-game day and units are available to enter combat phases once a day is finished.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century turnpikes {{arrived in}} the area and then in the 19th {{communications}} improved with the building of the Grand Western Canal, which reached the town in 1835, and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway. Wellington station was opened when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood {{at the foot of a}} steep incline. Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the village}} of Manlius, the amount of {{development}} along the route decreases as the homes lining the route become more spaced out. NY92 follows Limestone Creek southeastward through the towns of Manlius and Pompey to the Madison County line, where the creek turns south to run through Pompey Hollow, an area of flatlands situated on the Onondaga County <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The highway continues on into Madison County, where it becomes known as Syracuse Road as it heads through the town of Cazenovia. Most of NY92 in Madison County passes through rural, undeveloped areas; however, the section just north of its intersection with US20 runs along Cazenovia Lake and serves several lakeside homes. NY92 ends upon intersecting US20 at the southwestern tip of the lake just west {{of the village}} of Cazenovia.|$|E
50|$|By 1961 it {{had five}} {{intermediate}} stations but local passenger traffic failed to develop. The area is sparsely populated, being in <b>the</b> flood plain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river Colne {{and with the}} large Staines and Wraysbury reservoirs on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> closed to passengers in March 1965.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Plains, Texas, Todd played his college ball for the legendary Sammy Baugh at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, where he excelled on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
2500|$|This {{culminated in}} <b>the</b> rout <b>of</b> April 1917, known as [...] "Bloody April". The RFC (Royal Flying Corps) {{suffered}} particularly severe losses, although Trenchard's policy of [...] "offensive patrol", which placed most combat flying on <b>the</b> German <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> was maintained.|$|R
5|$|The {{incompletion}} on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked {{him to the ground}} after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood with arms akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} situated at a passing loop, {{with a single}} platform on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The building, which is noted as having been architecturally superior to other stations on the line, contained a booking office, porters' rooms, and an office for the line superintendent. The platform was covered along its entire length. A single-road engine shed was sited at {{the east end of}} the station from 1875, but burnt down in 1900. The initial service was six trains per day in each direction, however trains did not stop at Shirehampton on Sundays due to opposition from a local church, but this practice ended in May the same year following complaints from other residents and businesses.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} that to control Villers-Bocage, the British would have to occupy the ridge rapidly. The 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) (4th CLY), with a company of the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade, was to pass through Villers-Bocage and occupy the highest point of the ridge at Point 213. The 1/7th Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) would follow up and occupy {{the town and the}} 5th Royal Tank Regiment (5th RTR) and a company of the Rifle Brigade, were to take high ground at Maisoncelles-Pelvey to the {{south-west}} of Villers-Bocage. The 260th Anti-tank Battery of the Norfolk Yeomanry would cover the gap between the 4th CLY and the 5th RTR with 17pdr SP Achilles self-propelled anti-tank guns. The 5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (5th RHA), would follow the rest of the brigade group with its Sexton self-propelled guns. The 5th RHA and the brigade group tactical headquarters were established at Amayé-sur-Seulles. The two Hussar regiments were to provide flank protection against the Panzer-Lehr Division and uncover German positions either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of advance. The 131st Infantry Brigade, with the 1st Royal Tank Regiment (1st RTR) and the 1/5th and 1/6th Queen's, was to hold Livry as a firm base.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} by the North Eastern Railway company as a heavy rail station, and opened in December 1900 under the name 'Moor Edge'. The station {{platforms}} are on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and are linked by an underground pedestrian subway.|$|R
50|$|Residential areas, {{consisting}} of low-to-medium density housing, {{are located on}} both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>line.</b> Many <b>of</b> residential areas on <b>the</b> western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train <b>line</b> enjoy bushy surrounds and close proximity to Regional and National Parks, {{as well as the}} beautiful Lisgar Gardens.|$|R
50|$|After the Syrian {{military}} {{withdrew from}} East Beirut in August 1982, the Palestine Liberation Army was dispatched to <b>the</b> Green <b>Line</b> under <b>the</b> command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrians. The residents on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> disapproved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palestine Liberation Army.|$|R
5|$|The new station {{had four}} {{platform}} faces - two outer platforms, and two inner platforms sharing an island between the southbound line from Patchway and the westbound line to London. The western platforms served trains between Bristol and Wales, while the eastern platforms served trains {{on the new}} line. The platforms were linked by a subway {{which led to the}} booking office, situated on ground level by the main entrance {{on the east side of}} the station. The approach road led south from the main entrance, towards the A4174. There were waiting rooms and large canopies on each of the platforms. There were goods facilities to the south of the road, on the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and covering the site of the first station. There was a goods shed with a loading platform on a passing loop, as well as a north-facing covered loading platform and a south-facing siding. An additional south-facing siding for coal traffic was added after the First World War. Opposite the goods yard was Filton Junction Signal Box, which controlled the junction and by 1948 had more than 70 levers.|$|E

50|$|During a {{residency}} in Cologne (Germany) Yekutieli {{began a series}} of public interventions in which a white thin line is drawn in the street to create s supposed border. On both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> opposing sentences are written to enhance <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> space as difference and otherness.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the change}} in elevation, <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> this station is {{slightly}} above ground level and as a result, road traffic on Avenue H dead-ends on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> However, there is a pedestrian tunnel underneath the embankment that connects the sidewalk on both sides.|$|R
50|$|The station stands atop {{a railway}} {{embankment}} off a service road behind <b>the</b> parade <b>of</b> shops on West Barnes Lane. The shops and surrounding streets on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{are known as}} Motspur Park. There is also footpath access from Claremont Avenue on the western side.|$|R
25|$|These were ungated, {{with wooden}} cattle grids, {{except for the}} {{crossing}} at Sandwich Road station which had gates which protected only one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{operational}} base is at Aberystwyth, {{where there}} is an engine shed. Heavy overhauls are undertaken in a purpose built workshop on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{station at}} Milverton in Somerset was {{initially}} {{just a single}} platform on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> with a brick building. A passing loop and second platform were installed in 1880; the line east to Norton Fitzwarren was doubled on 7 February 1937. The station had a signal box on the westbound platform and a small goods yard {{to the west of}} the station on the same <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Goods traffic was withdrawn from 30 September 1963. No trace now remains of the station; the route of the line to the west is now part of the B3227 road.|$|E
25|$|On <b>the</b> {{opposite}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>the</b> Congress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederate States authorized <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederate States Marine Corps on 16 March 1861. Initially authorized at 45 {{officers and}} 944 enlisted men, the CSMC was increased to 1,026 enlisted men on 24 September 1862, but actual manpower never approached that number, maxing below 550 total. Its {{first and only}} Commandant, Colonel Lloyd J. Beall, stood the corps up in Richmond, and headquartered it at Fort Darling.|$|R
30|$|To avoid more {{negative}} {{impacts on the}} whole VSC-based DC grid, the HHB auto-reclosing operation based on the traditional strategy should be performed from one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DC <b>line.</b> If <b>the</b> auto-reclosing operation is successful and the normal voltage is restored, then the HHB on <b>the</b> other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DC <b>line</b> can be reclosed. In addition, if the communication for the HHB auto-reclosing operation between two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DC <b>line</b> is a failure, {{then there will be}} a false order for the corresponding HHB and an even greater influence on the whole VSC-based DC grid.|$|R

25|$|The next {{station was}} two {{miles east of}} the village of Morebath in Devon. When opened it was known as 'Morebath and Bampton', but from 1 August 1884 Bampton was served by its own station on the new Tiverton and North Devon Railway and the D station became just 'Morebath'. The station {{originally}} had a single platform on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> but a second track and platform were added in 1876. The loop was lengthened westwards from 6 June 1937 and the platforms were extended in wood. The goods yard was to the south of the original platform and accessed from the eastern end. The 1876 signal box was on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at the west end of the station, but a new box was provided as part of the 1937 alterations and situated at the west end of the main station building on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The goods yard was closed from 3 June 1963 and the passing loop and signal box were taken out of use at the same time. The station building and goods shed are both now used as houses.|$|E
50|$|The central Pacific Republic of Kiribati {{introduced}} {{a change of}} date for its eastern half on , from time zones −11 and −10 to +13 and +14. Before this, the time zones UTC+13 and UTC+14 did not exist. As a British colony, Kiribati was centered in the Gilbert Islands, just west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old date <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> distant Phoenix and Line Islands were on <b>the</b> other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> date <b>line.</b> Government offices on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> could only communicate by radio or telephone on <b>the</b> four days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> week when both sides experienced weekdays simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|A {{complete}} {{number is}} composed of various pebbles on lines and spaces, both on {{the positive and negative}} sides. For example, the number 4 might be represented as a pebble above <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>line</b> plus a pebble on <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first line; the pebble on the right side lies {{between the first and second}} lines so it counts as a +5, whereas the pebble on <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>line</b> represents a &minus;1, so the two pebbles together represent +4. Likewise, the number 90 might be represented as a pebble on <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third <b>line</b> plus a pebble on <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>line.</b> Note that this way of representing integers corresponds to the set-theoretic (or foundational) construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integers as ordered pairs of natural numbers.
