50|$|<b>Streaked</b> <b>flycatchers</b> eat a {{range of}} food items, mostly large insects, but also lizards and berries. It perches on a high watchpoint from which it sallies forth to catch insects in mid-flight or off plants using {{a range of}} {{aerobatic}} maneuvers, and occasionally gleans prey from the vegetation. The wintering southern migrants seem to include {{a considerable amount of}} fruit in their diet, for example those of Tamanqueiro (Alchornea glandulosa) which they sometimes eat in quantity; fruit are typically ripped off in mid-hover. It occasionally follows mixed-species feeding flocks, pouncing from up in the trees on prey flushed by birds in the undergrowth.|$|R
