5000|$|According to art {{historian}} Adam Hardy, the basic {{plan of the}} shrine (mulaprasada) is stellate (star shaped). It stands on a platform called jagati and is constructed with Soap stone material. According to historian Percy Brown this is a Hoysala innovation. Overall, the temple exhibits the nagara features (northern Indian influence) seen in a few other Hoysala temples {{such as in the}} Sadasiva Temple, Nuggehalli. According to {{art historian}}s Gerard Foekema and Percy Brown, nagara features are seldom seen in Hoysala temples. The temple is a large structure and has received patronage by multiple dynasties and reveals features of the later day Vijayanagara empire whose rulers added the entrance and tower over it (mahadvara) and bounding walls (prakara). Some post-Vijayanagara features are also visible. The tower over the entrance (gopuram) is a 7-story tall lime and brick structure that is adorned by Hindu gods, goddesses and other decorative structures in stucco.The temple is three shrined (trikutachala), has a garbhagriha (sanctum), and a vestibule (antarala) that connects the sanctum to the a closed mantapa (inner hall, navaranga) which opens into a large pillared gathering hall (mahamantapa). According to Percy Brown and Gerard Foekema, these are standard features in a Hoysala temple. The closed hall has two lateral shrines, one in the north and the other in the south. To the east, the large hall opens onto the platform that is meant for clockwise Circumambulation by devotees since the inside of the temple does not provide any such feature. On the platform, the base of the temple (called adhisthana) consists of moldings that take the <b>stellate</b> <b>form</b> of sanctum but become staggered square at the mahamantapa. The outer wall of the shrine and the large hall are single pilastered turreted walls. The tower over the shrine (shikhara) is plain without the typical ornamentation giving the temple as a whole an austere look. The temple gets its name from the [...] "serene" [...] (lit, [...] "Saumya") six feet tall image of Keshava, a form of the Hindu god Vishnu that stands on a garuda (eagle) pedestal. The roof of the closed mantapa is supported by lathe turned pillars, a standard feature in Hoysala constructions. These pillars divide the ceiling into [...] "bays" [...] (four central pillars create 9 bays in the closed hall) that are exceptionally well treated.|$|E

In this study, we examined the re-expression of these early glial traits in rat reactive astrocytes in affected neuronal perikarya in supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei induced by hypophysectomy. Double-labeling immunofluorescence confocal laser microscopy demonstrated that by 7  days post-lesion, both nestin and vimentin were present intensely in hypertrophied GFAP-IR reactive astrocytes {{in the area of}} hypophysectomized magnocellular neurons in SON and PVN, while nestin and vimentin are absent in the normal or sham-operated animals.

The spatiotemporal pattern of nestin-IR and/or vimentin-IR in reactive astrocytes suggests astrocytes attempt to revert to a more primitive glia form indicated by changes in morphology and phenotype following hypophysectomy, which may contribute to neuronal trophism and plasticity in the lesioned HNS favoring neuronal maintenance and fiber outgrowth. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|The role of {{thyroid hormone}} (TH) -induced vimentin {{expression}} {{in promoting the}} maturation of astrocytes has been investigated. Comparative immunocytochemical staining with vimentin antibody demonstrated distinctly different patterns of expression of vimentin during the progressive maturation of astrocytes of normal and TH-deficient astrocyte cultures. [35 S]Methionine labeling of cells showed a significant decline {{in the level of}} vimentin in the hypothyroid cultures at all ages from day 5 to 20. Western blot analysis suggested that the maturation of normal astrocytes was associated with the appearance of several acidic and basic variants of vimentin, whose expression was significantly delayed or reduced in the TH-deficient astrocytes. In normal astrocyte cultures, two acidic variants of vimentin, one of similar molecular weight and the other of lower molecular weight, were found to be phosphorylated during the final transformation of the epithelioid form into the mature <b>stellate</b> <b>form.</b> None of these phosphorylated forms was evident in the TH-deficient astrocytes. This was further confirmed by negative immunocytochemical staining of 5 - to 18 -dayold cultures of TH-deficient astrocytes with antibody TM 71, specific to phosphorylated vimentin, compared with age-matched normal astrocytes, which displayed consistent positive staining. The overall results indicate that TH-induced expression of phosphorylated forms of vimentin may be essential for the intracellular organization of the cytoskeleton in a way conducive to the morphological maturation of astrocytes.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the stemness and chemokine-mediated homing potential of dermal stromal cells (DSC) and to compare this with adipose stem cells (ASC). DSC have a less <b>stellate</b> <b>form</b> than ASC, confirming that DSC and ASC are two different types of mesenchymal cell populations. However, DSC display a mesenchymal stem cell phenotype (CD 31 −, CD 34 +, CD 45 −, CD 54 +, CD 90 +, CD 105 +, and CD 166 + similar to ASC and are also multipotent in their ability to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts.

Several ligands for these receptors, with CCL 5 /RANTES being the most potent, can induce migration of ASC and DSC in an in vitro wound-healing assay.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that osteocytes {{embedded in the}} bone matrix {{have the ability to}} sense deformation and/or damage to the matrix and to feed these mechanical signals back to the adaptive bone remodeling process. When osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes during the bone formation process, they change their morphology to a <b>stellate</b> <b>form</b> with many slender processes. This characteristic cell shape may underlie the differences in mechanosensitivity between the cell processes and cell body. To elucidate the mechanism of cellular response to mechanical stimulus in osteocytes, we investigated the site-dependent response to quantitatively controlled local mechanical stimulus in single osteocytes isolated from chick embryos, using the technique of calcium imaging. A mechanical stimulus was applied to a single osteocyte using a glass microneedle targeting a microparticle adhered to the cell membrane by modification with a monoclonal antibody OB 7. 3. Application of the local deformation induced calcium transients {{in the vicinity of the}} stimulated point and caused diffusive wave propagation of the calcium transient to the entire intracellular region. The rate of cell response to the stimulus was higher when applied to the cell processes than when applied to the cell body. In addition, a large deformation was necessary at the cell body to induce calcium transients, whereas a relatively small deformation was sufficient at the cell processes, suggesting that the mechanosensitivity of the cell processes was higher than that of the cell body. These results suggest that the cell shape with slender processes contributes to the site-dependent mechanosensitivity in osteocytes...|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{production}} of collagen type I {{is a major}} contributor to hepatic fibrosis. Activated (myofibroblastic), but not quiescent, hepatic stellate cells (lipocytes) have a high level of collagen type I and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. Therefore, stellate cell activation is a critical step in hepatic fibrosis. Here we show that quiescent stellate cells were activated by the generation of free radicals with ascorbate/FeSO 4 and by malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation. In addition, stellate cell activation by collagen type I matrix and TGF alpha was blocked by antioxidants, such as d-alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene. Moreover, oxidative stress, TGF alpha and collagen type I markedly stimulated stellate cell entry into S-phase, NFkB activity, and c-myb expression, which were prevented by antioxidants. c-myb antisense oligonucleotide blocked the activation and proliferation of stellate cells induced by TGF alpha. Nuclear extracts from activated, but not from quiescent, <b>stellate</b> cells <b>formed</b> a complex with the critical promoter E box of the alpha-smooth muscle actin gene, which was disrupted by c-myb and NFkB 65 antibodies, and competed by c-myb and NFkB cognate DNA. c-Myb expression was also stimulated in activated stellate cells in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic injury and fibrogenesis.

40|$|When uniform histologic {{criteria}} {{are applied to}} staging schistosome egg and granuloma development in the hamster liver, {{the evolution of the}} egg foci is shown to be monophasic, albeit with considerable variation of the individual cell response. Both real and artifactual egg-granuloma asynchrony are demonstrable. Alternate granuloma stages occur simultaneously within the same single organ, so that necrosis or fibrous scarring may result in some lesions but not in others. The granulomas of Schistosoma japonicum, S mansoni and S haematobium show both shared and distinctive features. Thus, oviposition is serial in S mansoni but clustered in the other two species. Neutrophils are common in S japonicum granulomas but are rare in the others. The differential features, listed in detail, will usually permit histologic identification of species during the early stages of infection; subsequently, the species-specific features and the overall intensity of host reaction tend to decline. At comparable egg loads and time spans, the liver pathology of S japonicum is the most severe. This is not related to granuloma size, but rather to more exudation and necrosis in early S japonicum granulomas, their tendency to encroach on adjacent liver tissue and to more extensive diffuse inflammatory infiltration. Hoeppli phenomena occur around S japonicum eggs both in <b>stellate</b> <b>form,</b> and as intraovular “reverse” precipitates. Plasma cells and amyloid deposition are frequent.

We attempted {{to determine whether the}} behavior of cumulus cells in culture medium is also reflected in the fertilization capacity of the oocyte and embryo quality. Methods. In 69 patients undergoing IVF, the oocyte – cumulus complex was obtained by follicle puncture. On the day folowing puncture, cumulus cell morphology and fertilization were evaluated. After three days of culture, the proliferation of cumulus cells was evaluated and on the day of embryo transfer, i.  e. on the third day after puncture, embryo quality also. Results. After one day of culture, the transformation of cumulus cells from spherical to <b>stellate</b> <b>form</b> was noted in 87. 0 % cell samples, in 5. 8 % of samples the cells adhered to the bottom but retained their spherical form and in 7. 2 % of samples the cumulus cells remained in the suspension.

The comparison of cumulus cell transformation after one day of culture and proliferation evaluated after three days of culture revealed their correlation. No relationship was found between the proliferative capacity of cumulus cells and fertilization, but we were able to confirm the relationship between the proliferative capacity of cumulus cells and embryo morphology. Conclusions. Under in vitro conditions, cumulus cells express a different capacity of morphological transformation and proliferation. From the pattern of cumulus cell proliferation we can infer to the embryo quality but not to the fertilization capacity of the oocyte. </p...|$|E

Mean circadian cell displacement was several times greater in poorly-differentiated cells, but was significantly and reversibly reduced by treatment and dibutyryl cAMP (5 X 10 (- 4) M) for 48 h. Reduction in motility was directly correlated with a change in cell morphology to a more <b>stellate</b> <b>form.</b> Well-differentiated cells had a smooth surface with ruffling restricted {{to the ends of}} processes and highly orientated glial filament and microfilament bundles. The poorly-differentiated cell surface had a microvillous, blebbed appearance and ruffling regularly occurred {{around the edge of the}} cytoplasm. Glial filaments and microfilaments were fewer and less well orientated in the poorly-differentiated cells; sites of adhesion to the substratum were fewer than in well-differentiated cells. Treatment of malignant cultures with dibutyryl cAMP resulted in smoothing of the cell surface, retraction of processes into thin pseudopodia and the appearance of microfilament bundles within the cells. These features marked the apparent cyto-differentiation. However, there was a loss of attachment, disappearance of microtubules and loss of glial filaments in the cytoplasm which was not compatible with differentiation. Intracellular recordings of membrane potentials gave a significantly higher mean value for well-differentiated cells. The mean membrane potential and input resistance of poorly-differentiated cells was unchanged by the addition of dibutyryl cAMP.

One arises from collaterals of medial olivocochlear efferents, and the other arises from neurons that project solely to the VCN. This study examines the action of cholinergic inputs on stellate cells in the VCN. T <b>stellate</b> cells, which <b>form</b> one of the ascending auditory pathways to the inferior colliculus, and D stellate cells, which inhibit T stellate cells, are distinguished electrophysiologically. Whole-cell recordings from stellate cells in slices of the VCN of mice demonstrate that most T stellate cells are excited by cholinergic agonists through three types of receptors, whereas all D stellate cells tested were insensitive to cholinergic agonists. Nicotinic excitation in T stellate cells has two components...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} taxonomy of limpets of the North East Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, particularly those from the Macaronesian islands. The present study compared populations of the intertidal limpet Patella candei d'Orbigny from the Azores, Madeira and the Canaries with those of P. caerulea Linnaeus and P. depressa Pennant from the European and African continental coasts. No major differences in radular morphology were detected between the three species. However, electrophoretic analysis of 15 enzyme loci gave overall genetic identity (I) values of sim 0. 5 between the three species, indicating that they cannot be regarded as conspecific as previously thought, and suggesting that P. candei is endemic to the Macaronesian islands. Comparisons of P. candei within these islands showed that, although populations did not differ with respect to radular morphology and soft-body parts, populations from the Azores were distinct from those in Madeira and the Canaries in shell shape and gene frequencies. Individuals from the Azores had, no average, taller shells and longer radulae, while those in Madeira and the Canaries had a shallow, depressed and <b>stellate</b> shell <b>form.</b> This was interpreted as being due to the wider habitat distribution of the species in the Azores compared to Madeira and the Canaries. Electrophoretic results showed that P. candei from the Azores differed from P. candei in Madeira and the Canaries by almost 40 % of the loci investigated (I= 0. 660), suggesting that the former is a separate endemic species. An I value of 0. 969 between populations in Madeira and the Canaries was typical of conspecific populations...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{cells in}} a {{developing}} culture of Acetobacter xylinum in a static liquid glucose medium were swept {{to the surface}} by the flotation of a submerged cellulose ndt. The net was probably pulled to the surface by adsorbed carbon dioxide given off by the metabolizing cells. The relatively high oxygen pressure at the aerated surface of a static liquid culture mediated the rapid production of cellulose in the surface layer. A. xylinum produced less cellulose in swirled than in static nutrient medium. Cellulose in the swirled medium occurred {{in the form of}} remarkable bodies, spherical, jointed or <b>stellate</b> in <b>form,</b> up to 10 mm. in size. The swirling favoured the overgrowth of the wild type organism by mutants which were specifically deficient in the ability to form cellulose. On the basis of the type of colonial growth and of the pellicle characteristics, two groups of A. x y h u m mutants with an extreme deficiency in cellulose-forming ability and one with an intermediate degree of deficiency were differentiated. An extracellular framework consisting of cellulose characterizes the growth habitat of Acetobacter xylinum (Franz & Schiebold, 1943; Aschner & Hestrin, 1946; Frey-Wyssling & Muhlethaler, 1946). The understanding of the morpho-genesis of this remarkable structure is relevant to efficient technical use of A, xylinum as an oxidizing organism and as a cellulose source (Evans & Hibbert, 1947) and {{to the use of the}} organism as a model system in which physical and chemical aspects of cell-wall production can be examined outside the cel...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the histological changes in rat liver after 2 -acetylaminofluorene (AAF) administration. The data demonstrate that AAF-induced oval cells were preferentially generated by proliferation {{of the terminal}} biliary ductules that we suggest constitute the primary hepatic stem cell niche. The oval cells formed ductular structures, representing {{an extension of the}} canals of Hering. This histological organization provides continuous bile drainage of the hepatocytes and uninterrupted blood flow in the sinusoids. The oval cell ductules are surrounded by a continuous basement membrane that is intermittently disrupted by processes of <b>stellate</b> cells that <b>form</b> direct cell-cell contact with the oval cells. Although both AAF treatment and bile duct ligation results in proliferation of biliary epithelial cells, the mechanism(s) responsible for the proliferation of the biliary epithelium seems to differ in the two models. In contrast to the biliary proliferation stimulated by bile ligation, AAF-induced oval cell proliferation as well as the capacity of these cells to differentiate into hepatocytes, bile epithelial cells and possibly other cell lineages can be blocked by administration of dexamethasone...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for the {{functional}} superiority of cells cultured as 3 D aggregates or on 3 D scaffolds over conventional 2 D monolayer cultures has created interest in material and cell based methods {{that influence the}} formation and structure of multicellular aggregates in vitro. We have created a coculture of primary rat hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells on a poly(DL-lactic acid) surface, a poor substrate for rat hepatocyte adhesion, to study the dynamics of multicellular spheroid formation and the resultant cell arrangement. The poly(DL-lactic acid) surface allows dynamic and rapid interaction of hepatocytes and <b>stellate</b> cells to <b>form</b> coculture spheroids in a complex multistage process (shown by time lapse microscopy). This spheroid morphology supports enhanced cell viability relative to a mono-culture mono-layer system (measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage). The distribution of the aggregating cell type in the final structure {{is related to the}} mechanics of formation i. e. mainly central and peripheral. This study provides a unique and generically applicable insight into the dynamics of multicellular spheroid formation where aggregation is induced by one cell type and imposed on another. This has implications for 3 D cell culture models and a wide number of currently used stromal co-culture systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} a global survey of Magellan data covering over 90 percent of the surface and designed to document the characteristics, location, and dimensions of all major volcanic features on Venus has revealed over 1660 landforms and deposits. These include over 550 shield fields (concentrations of small volcanos less than 20 km in diameter), 274 intermediate volcanos between 20 and 100 km diameter {{with a variety of}} morphologies, 156 large volcanos in excess of 100 km diameter, 86 calderalike structures independent of those associated with shield volcanos and typically 60 - 80 km in diameter, 175 coronae (annulus of concentric ridges or fractures), 259 arachnoids (inner concentric and outer radial network pattern of fractures and ridges), 50 novae (focused radial fractures <b>forming</b> <b>stellate</b> patterns), and 53 lava flood-type flow fields, and 50 sinuous lava channels (all of which are in excess of 10 (exp 2) - 10 (exp 3) km in length). The near-global coverage of Magellan data analyzed in this study confirms and extends the results of earlier observations that showed that volcanism is a widespread and significant process on the surface of Venus for the period of time in the presently observed record (less than about the last one billion years) ...|$|R
40|$|The medial {{entorhinal cortex}} (MEC) is an {{increasingly}} important focus for investigation of mechanisms for spatial representation. Grid cells found in layer II of the MEC {{are likely to be}} <b>stellate</b> cells, which <b>form</b> a major projection to the dentate gyrus. Entorhinal stellate cells are distinguished by distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties, but how these properties contribute to representation of space is not yet clear. Here, we review the ionic conductances, synaptic and excitable properties of stellate cells, and examine their implications for models of grid firing fields. We discuss why existing data are inconsistent with models of grid fields that require stellate cells to generate periodic oscillations. An alternative possibility is that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of stellate cells are tuned specifically to control integration of synaptic input. We highlight recent evidence that the dorsal-ventral organization of synaptic integration by stellate cells, through differences in currents mediated by HCN and leak potassium channels, influences the corresponding organization of grid fields. Because accurate cellular data will be important for distinguishing mechanisms for generation of grid fields, we introduce new data comparing properties measured with whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings. We find that clustered patterns of action potential firing and the action potential after-hyperpolarization are particularly sensitive to recording condition. Nevertheless, with both methods, these properties, resting membrane properties and resonance follow a dorsal ventral organization. Further investigation of the molecular basis for synaptic integration by stellate cells will be important for understanding mechanisms for generation of grid fields...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a quantitative {{description of the}} circuits formed in cat area 17 by estimating the “weight ” of the projections between different neuronal types. To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons {{and the number of}} synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny <b>stellate</b> cells, which <b>form</b> a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few “strong ” but many “weak ” excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.
