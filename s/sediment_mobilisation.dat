40|$|Abstract: Although {{sediment}} {{problems have}} long been recognised in those {{areas of the world}} with high rates of soil loss and high specific sediment yields, recent years have seen a growing recognition of the wider significance of fine sediment as an environmental problem. This has resulted in a growing need to incorporate sediment control strategies into catchment management programmes. The design of effective sediment control strategies is, however, heavily dependent upon a sound understanding and knowledge of <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> and delivery within the catchment system and thus the overall sediment budget. Traditional monitoring techniques are generally unable to provide information on the internal functioning of the sediment budget. Against this background, {{there is a need for}} new approaches to data collection and tracing techniques are being increasingly used. Environmental radionuclides provide a particularly useful tool for tracing <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> and delivery and this paper provides further information on the basis for their use and on their potential applications. Selected examples of their application to documenting rates of soil loss and sediment delivery from cultivated fields, sediment source tracing, and documenting rates of floodplain sedimentation and longer-term changes in suspended sediment properties are provided...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe primary {{origin of}} this project {{is due to a}} high demand for {{freshwater}} supply in the Berg Water Management Area (WMA). Most of the Berg WMA`s freshwater supply does not live up to the high ecological standards. This is mainly due to high sediments loading in the Berg River {{which is one of the}} water supplies to the Berg WMA. The project was conducted on a small-scale catchment at Langgewens experimental farms in Swartland district. The focus of this study was to address some of the hydrological processes active in the research catchment: infiltration, run-off and sediment mobilization on different soil types under wheat and canola vegetation cover. This was done to investigate the origin of sediments in the Berg River. Considering the results, one might conclude that the decayed root systems from the canola and wheat vegetation covers, organic matter content, soil cracks, slope orientation, and soil composition, all played a major role in influencing the ability of the soil to absorb the simulated rainfall. Because the infiltration was calculated using the difference between the incoming simulated rainfall and the measured run-off, there was an inverse relationship between run-off and infiltration. When run-off was low, the infiltration was high and vice versa. iv Factors that governed <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> within the ring area are micro topography within the ring area, the slope gradient and vegetation covers. Considering the results, vegetation cover played a pivotal role and it must be maintained at all times. It is advisable that the land users leave crop residual cover behind after the annual harvest and not expose the land surface in bare form for too long as this will generate more run-off and increase <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation.</b> The analyses showed that wheat crop protects the soil from rain drop impact than on canola crop...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{recognition of}} the potential of aquatic biota to act as ‘geomorphic agents’, key knowledge gaps exist in relation to biotic drivers of fine sediment dynamics at microscales and particularly the role of invasive species. This study explores the impacts of invasive signal crayfish on suspended sediment dynamics at the patch scale through laboratory and field study. Three hypotheses are presented and tested: (1) that signal crayfish generate pulses of fine <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> through burrowing and movement that are detectable in the flow field; (2) that such pulses may be more frequent during nocturnal periods when signal crayfish {{are known to be}} most active; and (3) that cumulatively the pulses would be sufficient to drive an overall increase in turbidity. Laboratory mesocosm experiments were used to explore crayfish impacts on suspended sediment concentrations for two treatments: clay banks and clay bed substrate. For the field study, high frequency near-bed and mid-flow turbidity time series from a lowland river with known high densities of signal crayfish were examined. Laboratory data demonstrate the direct influence of signal crayfish on mobilisation of pulses of fine sediment through burrowing into banks and fine bed material, with evidence of enhanced activity levels around the mid-point of the nocturnal period. Similar patterns of pulsed fine <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> identified under field conditions follow a clear nocturnal trend and appear capable of driving an increase in ambient turbidity levels. The findings indicate that signal crayfish have the potential to influence suspended sediment yields, with implications for morphological change, physical habitat quality and the transfer of nutrients and contaminants. This is particularly important given the spread of signal crayfish across Europe and their presence in extremely high densities in many catchments. Further process-based studies are required to develop a full understanding of impacts across a range of river styles...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{revealed the}} presence of traffic-derived metals within road, stream and estuarine sediments collected from a coastal catchment, northern Australia. Studied road sediments displayed variable total metal concentrations (median Cd, Cu, Pb, Pd, Pt, Ni and Zn values: 0. 19, 42. 6, 67. 5, 0. 064, 0. 104, 36. 7 and 698 mg/kg, respectively). The distinctly elevated Zn values are due to abundant tyre rubber shreds (as verified by SEM-EDS and correlation analysis). By comparison to the road sediments, background stream sediments taken upstream from roads have relatively low median Pb, Pd, Pt and Zn concentrations (7. 3 mg/kg Pb, 0. 01 mg/kg Pd, 0. 012 mg/kg Pt, 62 mg/kg Zn). Stream and estuarine sediment samples collected below roads have median values of 21. 8 mg/kg Pb, 0. 014 mg/kg Pd, 0. 021 mg/kg Pt and 71 mg/kg Zn, and exhibit 207 Pb/ 206 Pb and 208 Pb/ 206 Pb ratios that appear on a mixing line between the isotopically distinct background stream sediments and the road <b>sediments.</b> Thus, <b>mobilisation</b> of dusts and sediments from road surfaces has resulted in relatively elevated Pb, Pd, Pt and Zn concentrations and non-radiogenic Pb isotope ratios in local coastal stream and estuarine sediments. The investigation demonstrates that traffic-derived metals enter coastal stream and estuary sediments at {{the fringe of the}} Great Barrier Reef lagoon...|$|R
40|$|The {{water quality}} of the River Dun and {{associated}} surface waters (a reservoir, two tributaries of the Dun, the Kennet and Avon Canal and the River Kennet to which the Dun drains) is described {{for a wide range}} of major, minor and trace elements. The water quality is determined by inputs from: (a) geologic sources (Ca, Sr concentrations and alkalinity) and (b) contaminant inputs from farming and sewage (Na, Cl, B, soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate). As river water is mainly supplied from the Chalk aquifer and riparian areas, the water quality variation is damped, but there are occasional storms, where near surface/surface runoff delivers higher nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations, but dilutes determinands derived predominantly from geologic and point sources. River and canal water quality is also modified by in-stream biological processes in spring and summer, which remove nutrients (N, P and Si) and CO 2 from the water, bringing about precipitation of calcium carbonate and thus reductions in Ca concentrations and alkalinity. The biological effects are particularly marked for the Kennet and Avon Canal. The River Dun and Kennet and Avon Canal have been subject to episodic fish-kills and concern has been expressed about the role of event-based resuspension of bed <b>sediments</b> and <b>mobilisation</b> of dredged <b>sediments</b> on dissolved oxygen levels within the river. Therefore, fluvarium experiments on sediment–water interactions were undertaken to examine the potential effects of bed sediment disturbance on dissolved oxygen levels. The results of the fluvarium experiments demonstrate an ecologically-significant 30 % reduction in dissolved oxygen levels following bed sediment disturbance. This reduction in DO concentrations was greater than expected from calculations using the measured sediment-oxygen demand. However, it is not clear that the bed sediments are mobilized to sufficient extent in the field for deleterious loss of DO. Indeed, much of the resuspended sediments within the canal and the river may well come from runoff from the land. The results also demonstrate key hydrogeochemical processes in Chalk-fed surface waters, with implications for environmental management...|$|R
40|$|In many {{water quality}} models {{production}} of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) is modelled as mineralisation from particulate organic matter (POM). In this paper {{it is argued that}} the DOC production from dessicated sediments by water turbulence may be of similar importance In many water quality models production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is modelled as mineralisation from particulate organic matter (POM). In this paper it is argued that the DOC production from dessicated sediments by water turbulence may be of similar importance. The DOC production from sediments was measured under sterile conditions, as a function of shaking time, sediment to water ratio and OC content. Furthermore, the maximum fraction of particulate organic carbon (POC) that can be mobilised by agitation (excluding the contribution of mineralisation) was assessed. The experiments can be considered as laboratory simulations of resuspension of aquatic sediments due to turbulence caused by wind, benthivorous fish or dredging. It was found that aquatic resuspension of dessicated <b>sediment</b> may cause <b>mobilisation</b> of up to 100 % of indigenous particulate carbon in a few weeks. An empirical equation was derived that expresses mobilised carbon (DOC) as a function of sediment concentration (POC), OC fraction (foc) and time. At a typical value of 25 mg/L suspended sediment, the halflife for mobilisation is 0. 5 day, which is much faster than bacterial degradation of POM in aquatic systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Purpose Despite {{substantial}} {{research into}} Pb storage in peatlands, formal {{description of the}} mechanisms of contaminated <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> is limited. This study explores the controlling factors of contaminated sediment dynamics in an eroding peatland in the Peak District National Park, UK. Materials and methods This study uses the Pb contamination stored near the peat’s surface as a fingerprint to trace contaminated sediment dynamics in three severely degraded headwater catchments. A field portable XRF analyser was used {{across a range of}} catchment surfaces to examine patterns of contaminant storage and release. Results and discussion Lead concentrations varied greatly over a small spatial scale. Erosion is exposing high concentrations of Pb on interfluve surfaces (up to 1660 μg g− 1), and substantial amounts of reworked contaminated material (up to 1010 μg g− 1) are stored on other catchment surfaces (gully walls and floors). A variety of factors have been shown to significantly control Pb release and storage in this environment, including wind action, aspect, and gully depth. Vegetation also {{plays an important role in}} retaining sediment-bound heavy metals within contaminated peat catchments...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of monosulfidic sediments in inland waterways {{is emerging as}} a major environmental issue. Mobilisation and suspension of monosulfidic sediments can result in deoxygenation, acidification of the water column and mobilisation of trace metals. The controls on monosulfidic <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> and the critical thresholds for its scour and entrainment have not been established. This study examines {{the effect of a}} minor flood event (average return interval of 5 years) on sulfidic sediment scour in the Wakool River in southern NSW, Australia. Five profiles were sampled within a small (∼ 300 m) reach before and after a minor flood event to determine the degree of sediment scour and transport. The results indicate substantial scour of both monosulfidic sediments and underlying bed sediments (approximately 2100 m 3). Changes in the sediment geochemistry suggest large concentrations of monosulfidic sediments had been suspended in the water column, partially-oxidised and redeposited. This is supported by 210 Pb results from one of the profiles. These results suggest that these monosulfidic sediments can move as bed load during minor flood events...|$|E
40|$|The mutual {{interplay between}} sand ripples and oscillatory flow forms a complex system {{affecting}} the hydrodynamic roughness of seabeds and impacting on energy dissipation and <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> on the coast. Discrete self-organising computer simulations, in which local rules {{lead to the}} emergence of global patterns, currently exist to model the formation of sand ripples under various conditions. However, limited laboratory validation or extension of these models to oscillatory flow has been conducted. In the current study, work was undertaken to demonstrate that ripple formation under waves can be considered a self-organising process, and modelled as such. A laboratory study enabled visual validation of self-organising behaviour, as well as quantification of the rate of ripple growth and re-growth when condition change. A numerical model, based on earlier work in wind-driven ripples, developed ripples of a plausible shape and wavelength and also simulated many of the self-organising characteristics observed in the laboratory. The results of both the laboratory study and model indicate that a self-organising process provides a probable behavioural scheme for ripple development under hydraulic oscillatory flow.

40|$|Nutrient inputs to estuarine {{and coastal}} waters {{worldwide}} are increasing and {{this in turn}} is increasing the prevalence of eutrophication and hypoxic and anoxic episodes in these systems. Many urbanised estuaries are also subject {{to high levels of}} anthropogenic metal contamination. Environmental O 2 levels may influence whether sediments act as sinks or sources of metals. In this study we investigated the effect of an extended O 2 depletion event (40 days) on fluxes of trace metals (and the metalloid As) across the sediment–water interface in sediments from a highly metal contaminated estuary in S. E. Tasmania, Australia. We collected sediments from three sites that spanned a range of contamination and measured total metal concentration in the overlying water using sealed core incubations. Manganese and iron, which are known to regulate the release of other divalent cations from sub-oxic sediments, were released from sediments at all sites as hypoxia developed. In contrast, the release of arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc was comparatively low, most likely due to inherent stability of these elements within the sediments, perhaps {{as a result of their}} refractory origin, their association with fine-grained sediments or their being bound in stable sulphide complexes. Metal release was not sustained due to the powerful effect of metal-sulphide precipitation of dissolved metals back into <b>sediments.</b> The limited <b>mobilisation</b> of <b>sediment</b> bound metals during hypoxia is encouraging, nevertheless the results highlight particular problems for management in areas where hypoxia might occur, such as the release of metals exacerbating already high loads or resulting in localised toxicity...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} awareness of the detrimental influence of diffuse sources of pollution on aquatic systems and of the integral role played by <b>sediment</b> in the <b>mobilisation</b> and transport of pollutants. The recognition of the environmental, societal and economic importance of the ecological health of aquatic environments has led to a change in emphasis regarding agricultural and environmental policy. To implement successful delivery of emerging policy requirements, there is a current need to have an enhanced understanding of the relationship between different forms of land use and sources of diffuse pollution, particularly sources of fine sediment. To understand the potential impacts of future land use changes, including environmental conservation measures on sources of sediment, it is useful to consider them within a longer-term context. This study has successfully applied the sediment source fingerprinting technique to floodplain overbank sediment cores in a retrospective study of six diverse UK river catchments with identified sediment problems. The varying estimates of relative sediment contributions from differing sources have been compared to known land use change in the study catchments over concurrent time periods, to explore any associations which might be apparent. Over the last 40 years, the increased cultivation of high erosion risk crops, such as those which are harvested late in the season (e. g. maize) and those which are sown in the autumn (e. g. winter wheat), has contributed disproportionately to the total sediment load relative to the area of land occupied by such cultivation. Increased stocking densities have resulted in increased relative sediment contributions from grassland sources, particularly intensively managed temporary grassland, but can have an even greater impact on sediment contributions derived from channel bank sources. The installation and maintenance of drainage for agriculture or for flood risk management has resulted in increased relative sediment loads from channel bank and associated sub-surface sources. Through the further development of such research, the efficacy of mitigation measures can be tested against evidence-based historic trends and those management approaches which provide identifiable improvements can be developed as best practice options for future land management targeted at reducing the negative impacts of excessive sediment ingress to river systems. The design of the source fingerprinting methodology used in this work was based on an established successful approach and this was developed further through the incorporation of a number of refinements designed to improve the robustness of the technique and expedite its implementation.

40|$|The Agrio-Guadiamar River reach {{affected}} by the Aznalcóllar mine tailings spill {{can be divided into}} three main sectors taking account of geomorphic characteristics and human-induced changes. Along the first 15 km, the valley presents the characteristics of a middle fluvial reach of moderate sinuosity and gradient; the floodplain declines gently towards the main channel and is built up mainly by lateral accretion deposits, which are mined by open pits. The second sector is located between 15 and 30 km downstream of the mine, and is characterised by higher channel sinuosity and a lower gradient; the floodplain is built on overbank deposits, separated from the main channel by natural levees, showing some low sinuosity flood channels. Finally, the lowest reach, with a similar low gradient, can be described as the proximal area of the Doñana marshlands, whose geomorphology has been modified by agricultural practices for the last 40 years. The spread of mining tailings deposited a mat of pyrite mud (fine milled heavy metal-rich ore) over the main channel and floodplain with a thickness of up to 50 cm in the first sector and then, progressively decreasing downstream. The pyrite mud was deposited over the natural <b>sediments</b> without significant <b>mobilisation</b> of the latter and without relevant geomorphic changes. The subsequent cleaning up of the pyrite mud with the help of heavy machinery resulted in the removal of most of the bushy and herbaceous vegetation as well as the reworking of bed sediments and the destruction of their natural armouring. Relatively small amounts of submerged pyrite mud that could not be removed from the main channel and that mixed with the shallow natural sediments during the cleaning works provides a long-term pollution element in the system. Pyrite mud remnants on floodplains are not being directly removed by fluvial activity in the mid-term because these sedimentation areas are susceptible to erosion only by the wandering of the main channel. However, these materials can be easily oxidised, therefore, plant uptake and underground water pollution should be monitored. On the other hand, the channel bed and banks are source areas of sediments and pyrite materials that can be easily eroded due to the destruction of the natural protection features (vegetation and armouring). Once eroded, the pyrite particles will be transported over longer distances than the coarser host natural alluvium, and deposited on floodplains or areas with low flow velocity.

We show that the use of a portable TIR camera can enhance the visualisation of mixing dynamics taking place at stream confluences, identify the location of the mixing front between two different water sources and the degree of mixing. Interpretation of handheld TIR observations also provided information on how stream morphology and discharge can influence mixing dynamics in small streams.

40|$|Elevated {{suspended}} sediment {{concentrations in}} fluvial environments {{have important implications}} for system ecology and even small concentrations may have serious consequences for sensitive ecosystems or organisms, such as freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera margaritifera). Informed decision making is therefore required for land managers to understand and control soil erosion and sediment delivery to the river network. However, given that monitoring of sediment fluxes requires financial and human resources which are often limited at a national scale, <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> and delivery models are commonly used for sediment yield estimation and management. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is the most widely used model for overland flow erosion and can, when combined with a sediment delivery ratio (SDR), provide reasonable sediment load estimations for a catchment. This paper presents RUSLE factors established from extant GIS and rainfall datasets that are incorporated into a flexible catchment modelling approach. We believe {{that this is the first}} time that results from a RUSLE application at a national scale are tested against measured sediment yield values available from Ireland. An initial assessment of RUSLE applied to Irish conditions indicates an overestimation of modelled sediment yield values for most of the selected catchments. Improved methods for model and SDR factors estimation are needed to account for Irish conditions and catchment characteristics. Nonetheless, validation and testing of the model in this study using observed values is an important step towards more effective sediment yield modelling tools for nationwide applications...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{modelling}} currently cannot accurately {{reproduce the}} onshore-offshore transport asymmetry observed on gravel beaches. The {{role of the}} impulsive pressure response generated by plunging waves has been hypothesised to aid mobilisation of sediment, and thus may contribute to transport asymmetry. This process is not currently included in models. Laboratory tests were conducted {{across a range of}} wave conditions to investigate the role of plunging wave-breaker impacts on the mobilisation of sediment of gravel beaches. Pressure records were obtained at positions close to the plunging impact locations, to monitor the localised pressures that lead to <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation.</b> The correction of the recorded pressure to the bed surface, for further analysis, was achieved through a two stage approach. Adoption of a new technique for separating the pressure records into two components, each determined by different processes is presented. Each component is then corrected to the bed surface with the application of a pragmatic prediction of the experienced attenuation. Data covering a wide range of Iribarren values was assessed, and the impact pressure was parameterised against the wave-breaker type. This procedure identified a potential peak in the impact pressure-Iribarren space in the plunging breaker region, consistent with the previous hypothesis. Comparison of cross-shore profile records provides further limited evidence that morphological prediction fails to reproduce specific characteristics associated with profiles generated under plunging breaker action. Finally, a brief discussion is provided on how the role of the additional pressure generated under plunging impacts can be incorporated into future numerical models. EPSR...|$|E
40|$|The Lower Paleozoic {{sequence}} at Mt. Owen, Nelson, hosts {{gold and}} base metal mineralization. The succession comprises the Wangapeka Formation (a black shale and sandstone unit), the underlying Arthur Marble Formation, {{which in turn}} rests on a metamorphosed and hydrothermally altered sequence of quartzite, dolomite, and black shales, informally defined here as the Owen Formation. The succession dips steeply westward, away from the adjacent intrusive batholith of Cretaceous Separation Point Granite. Tectonic deformation, metamorphism, and hydrothermal alteration are related to two principal controls: (a) granite intrusion, and (b) confinement of fluid processes beneath the marble. Study of the disseminated sulphide minerals in the sedimentary rocks shows that whereas the sequence within and above the marble contains only crystalline pyrite, the more altered Owen Formation contains a complex suite of minerals, exhibiting the paragenesis: pyrite → pyrrhotite → marcasite → pyrite. Base metal ores form both replacement and infilling bodies within, and near, the marble, and comprise argentiferous galena, sphalerite, and minor chalcopyrite; in one deposit a silver-rich tetrahedrite occurs, together with more complex minerals of the fahlore group. Gold is substantially confined to quartz-carbonate veins in the Owen Formation, where it occurs in a hypogene assemblage of marcasite, pyrite, and quartz, which represents late stage deposition. Some gold, which is highly argentiferous, occurs partly in idiomorphic form and {{is considered to be}} hypogene; supergene gold is also present. An earlier report of native bismuth appears {{to be based on the}} misidentification of native lead. Mineralization extended over a wide range of generally declining temperatures and changing fluid composition; precise reconstruction of physico-chemical conditions is difficult due to the effects of retrograde overprinting, and the lack of equilibrium data for the sulphide, carbonate, and silicate systems examined. A study of fluid inclusions provides some precise data on the hydrothermal system; evidence for the existence of a CO₂-saturated fluid during mineral deposition permits the use of filling temperatures without correction for sealing pressure. The measurement of both CO₂ content and salinity for one inclusion permits complete P-T-X evaluation of the local fluid system at the time of sealing: XCO 2 ₂ = 15 wt. % XNaCl = 9. 3 wt. % T = 312 °C P = 790 b All data are combined in an interpretative model for the mineralization, in which a fluid is produced by intrusion-induced dewatering and dehydration of <b>sediments,</b> and the <b>mobilisation</b> and transport of ore metals is promoted by decarbonation and desulphurization reactions. Structural control by the impermeable marble produces an up-dip, non-recirculatory fluid flow, resulting in intensified alteration and mineralization in the upper Owen Formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of magmas in arc volcanism depends on <b>sediment</b> subduction. The <b>mobilisation</b> of the subducted sediments determines {{the extent of}} the transfer of materials from the slab to the mantle wedge and whether the transfer occurs as a fluid or a melt. Extensive research has already been done on the contribution of pelitic sediments to arc volcanism. However, the high amounts of sulphur emitted by some subduction volcanoes, cannot be explained by pelitic sediments only. For these reasons, this thesis describes experiments determining melting relations in the anhydrite-dolomite system, as very {{little is known about the}} influence of these evaporitic sediments in a subduction setting. Melting relations in the anhydrite-dolomite system were determined through high pressure and temperature experiments, using a piston cylinder apparatus at 10 and 35 kbar and over a temperature range from 900 to 1370 ºC. The main experiments were performed using a starting {{composition of}} 2 : 1 dolomite/anhydrite ratio, some were performed with the ratios: 4 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 dolomite/anhydrite and two experiments were performed with pure anhydrite. The resulting samples were analyzed with an electron microprobe. The onset of melting of the anhydrite-dolomite system occurs between 900 and 925 C at 10 kbar and between 975 en 1000 C at 35 kbar. The first melts formed in the 10 kbar experiment have a composition similar to a dolomite/anhydrite ratio of 2 : 1. Anhydrite and dolomite co-existed as residual solid phases during progressive melting, and disappeared 1000 and 1050 C in the 10 kbar experiments, leading with anhydrite. Above 1100 C, dolomite decomposes and periclase appears in the samples. In these experiments, the compositions of the melt and solids suggest that SO 3 was present in a fluid phase. Hence, next to dolomite decomposition and melting, some reaction occurred to transfer sulphur to a fluid phase. The melting point for pure anhydrite is probably higher than 1450 C at 10 kbar, due to impurities in the natural anhydrite used, experiments at 1400 and 1450 C yielded melt as well as primary crystals. Analysis of the experiments proved difficult due to the presence of CO 2, a fluid phase and quench crystals in the melt, therefore little can be said about trends in the compositions over the different experiments. Though the melting temperature of the mixture of dolomite and anhydrite proved about 100 C lower than that of the individual minerals, it is still too high to accommodate melting in an average subduction setting according to current models, unless a process like slab detachment plays a role and the inflow of hot asthenospheric mantle increases the temperature enough to accommodate melting. One example of a volcano in a subduction setting erupting sulphur- and CO 2 -rich magmas is Monte Vulture. During the Messinian salinity crisis evaporites, containing anhydrite and dolomite, were deposited on the Adriatic plate. This plate has since then been subducted underneath Italy. Slab detachment has occurred in the area, and the inflow of asthenospheric mantle has increased the temperatures to accommodate melting of the subducted evaporites. The involvement of the Messinian evaporites in the metasomatising agent of the mantle source beneath Monte Vulture could explain the high sulphur content, high  34 S value and high CO 2 content of the Vulture magmas. The findings in this thesis support that hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{suspension}} of sediments by oscillatory flows {{is a complex}} case of fluid–particle interaction. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide insight into the spatial (time) and scale (frequency) relationships between wave-generated boundary layer turbulence and event-driven sediment transport beneath irregular shoaling and breaking waves in the nearshore of a prototype sandy barrier beach, using data collected through the Barrier Dynamics Experiment II (BARDEX II). Statistical, quadrant and spectral analyses reveal the anisotropic and intermittent nature of Reynolds’ stresses (momentum exchange) in the wave boundary layer, in all three orthogonal planes of motion. The fractional contribution of coherent turbulence structures appears to be dictated by the structural form of eddies beneath plunging and spilling breakers, which in turn define the net <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> towards or away from the barrier, and hence ensuing erosion and accretion trends. A standing transverse wave is also observed in the flume, contributing to the substantial skewness of spanwise turbulence. Observed low frequency suspensions are closely linked to the mean flow (wave) properties. Wavelet analysis reveals that the entrainment and maintenance of sediment in suspension through a cluster of bursting sequence is associated with the passage of intermittent slowly–evolving large structures, which can modulate the frequency of smaller motions. Outside the boundary layer, small scale, higher frequency turbulence drives the suspension. The extent to which these spatially varied perturbation clusters persist is associated with suspension events in the high frequency scales, decaying as the turbulent motion ceases to supply momentum, with an observed hysteresis effect...|$|E

The focus {{of this study was}} to address some of the hydrological processes active in the research catchment, namely infiltration, run-off and <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> on different soil types. It was done to investigate the origin of Berg River pollutants. To answer the overall question about what influence the natural salt load of the Berg River, a number of subprojects have been identified, one of which is to understand the hydrological processes in the soil mantle and vadose zone. Hence, the study aimed to answer the research questions mentioned and discussed in section 1. 3 of Chapter 1. Considering the results, it could be suggested that decayed root systems from the rows of plants, soil cracks, small channels and openings created by small animals, as well as slope orientation and, therefore, soil composition, all played a major role in influencing the ability of the soil to absorb the simulated rainfall. In this study, the factors that influenced run-off are micro topography, soil moisture, root system, animal activities in soil profile, soil crack dimensions and the hydraulic conductivity. The main factors that played a major role to influence sediments mobilisation are strongly believed to be the micro topography within the ring, slope gradient and length, vegetation cover and rainfall-simulation intensity. After using different techniques, the results show that farmers must be aware that with storm rainfall, particles smaller than 65 μm are subject to mobilisation. It is important to let land-users know that they need proper and appropriate methods for land-use. South Afric...|$|E

The paleoclimatic development has been interpreted {{on the basis of}} mass accumulation rate, carbonate content, mean grain size, sediment petrology and 29 radiocarbon dates. The results demonstrate in the early Holocene (10, 000 - 8000 cal year BP) high sediment accumulation rates attributable to the effect of enhanced <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> under influence of a relatively low sea level and remobilisation of glacial sediments on the sparsely vegetated Vestfirdir peninsula. The data suggest that a general southward displacement of the Polar Front commenced around 5000 - 4000 cal year BP. A new proxy for Holocene climatic variability is presented by the basalt/plagioclase ratio in the 63 - 100 mum fraction. High basalt/plagioclase values are primarily related to periods of increased storminess and bottom current energy, which enhanced the transport of basaltic sediment from the coastal zone towards the outer shelf. Advection of polar waters containing basalt-rich IRD from the eastern Greenland Blosseville Kyst basalt province may also have contributed to increased basalt/plagioclase ratios. The correlation between basalt/plagioclase ratios and proxies of solar activity (C- 14 production and Be- 10 flux) was explored and suggests that some of the centennial-scale peaks in colder climate could be related to increased nuclide production in the upper atmosphere. In addition, {{it was found that the}} Medieval Warm Period (c. 1100 - 700 cal year BP) was characterised by strong cyclone activity over the Iceland region. Intense atmospheric circulation during this period has been confirmed also by other studies in the northern North Atlantic region...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the seismic {{expression of the}} conduits underlying over 350 mud volcanoes that were erupted {{in an area of}} the western Nile Cone in the past 5. 3 Myrs. The study is based on a c. 4300 km 2 3 D seismic survey. The conduits are interpreted to transect the > 1000 m thick Messinian Evaporite succession, demonstrating that the eruptive process is sufficiently dynamic to breach the formidable seal represented by the evaporites. The mud volcano conduits are remarkably similar in geometry and seismic characteristics to many previously described examples of fluid escape pipes. They are vertical to sub-vertical structures with a crudely cylindrical geometry, but that can either widen or narrow upwards towards their upper terminations in the mud volcano edifices. Imaging at depth within the Messinian Evaporites and pre-evaporite successions is more uncertain, but direct sampling of mud from surface volcanoes suggests a pre-Messinian source, confirming the seismic interpretation that they root within pre-salt stratigraphy. A conceptual model for the genesis of these mud volcano conduits through salt is proposed, for which hydraulic fracturing is driven by high overpressures that developed in the pre-salt source stratigraphy {{as a response to the}} Messinian Salinity Crisis. Dissolution and removal of evaporites resulting in fracturing and collapse via a stoping mechanism which is a slow process by comparison to hydraulic fracturing but is argued to potentially contribute to conduit formation.

40|$|Synchronous {{measurements}} of waves {{were made at}} six locations around a small reef platform island in the Maldives during both westerly and northeast monsoon conditions. Summary statistics of wave records indicated similar Hs values propagating onto windward and leeward reef surfaces and a distinct growth in wave height as waves shoal toward island shorelines. Waves up to 0. 78 m were recorded impacting the island shoreline. Wave energy on the reef platform was strongly modulated by seasonal winds with wave energy during the westerly monsoon {{an order of magnitude}} larger than wave conditions in the northeast monsoon. Spectral analysis of wave records highlighted spatial differences in wave energy around the island. Windward reefs and shorelines are dominated by waves at wind and swell frequencies, whereas wind-wave energy is absent from leeward shorelines. Consequently, windward shorelines have up to twice the gross energy input than leeward shorelines. Results have significant implications for geomorphic processes. Longer duration and greater incident wave energy during the westerly monsoon has promoted higher growth of the western reef flat (+ 0. 2 m) and more energetic shoreline runup processes have produced markedly higher western island ridges (+ 0. 7 m). Incident shoreline wave processes are sufficient to entrain beach sediments during both monsoon periods although periods of active <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> are constrained to mid- to high-tide stages. The windward–leeward gradient in shoreline wave energy is likely to drive littoral sediment flux. Seasonal modulation of the shoreline wave energy gradients account for observed oscillations in beach position around island shorelines.

40|$|The {{observation}} that sediment flux from mountain ranges struck by high magnitude earthquakes can be {{strongly influenced by}} coseismic mass movements brings into question the nature of coseismic deformation as a net contributor to mountain building. To better constrain the role of high-magnitude earthquakes in orogenesis, high-resolution data of earthquake induced mass wasting is required for areas of differing tectonic, morphological, and climatic settings. Here we compare the erosional flux to the tectonic flux associated with the 2010 Mw = 7. 2 Sierra El Mayor earthquake in Mexico and examine the landslide patterning of coseismic mass movements associated with this event. The ruptured fault system has a significant strike-slip component with subsidence along the eastern flank and uplift on the western flank of the range. Peak ground acceleration was highest along the steepest sections of the range such that the frequency of landslide occurrence was strongly correlated to slope gradient. Both vertical and horizontal coseismic displacement demonstrated a strong control over landslide initiation. This result suggests that strike-slip systems experience very different landslide patterning to thrust faults during earthquakes. Based on interferometric analysis of synthetic aperture radar images, the earthquake resulted in a total uplifted volume of 41. 6 × 106 m 3 {{and a loss of}} 95. 2 × 106 m 3 due to subsidence. This suggests a net tectonic volumetric flux of − 53. 6 × 106 m 3. <b>Sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> by coseismic landslides is estimated at − 2. 7 × 106 m 3 derived from a manually mapped inventory using SPOT 5 multispectral imagery.

40|$|Measurement of {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) {{is widely}} used as a biomarker of exposure to neurotoxic compounds in aquatic environments. In the present study, AChE activity was monitored in the clam Tapes philippinarum in the Lagoon of Venice, {{with the aim of}} evaluating the possible exposure of animals to neurotoxic compounds. Two sampling strategies were followed. In the first case, temporal and spatial variations of AChE activity were measured in clams collected seasonally (from October 2003 to June 2004) in 3 sites of the Lagoon: Campalto (site 1), near a sewage treatment plant, Marghera (site 2), a highly polluted area, and Poveglia (site 3), a reference site. The condition index (CI) of clams was also calculated. In the second case, AChE activity was measured in clams collected at the end of seasonal samplings in 12 sites located throughout the Lagoon: areas licensed for clam farming (sites 5 to 11), nearby canals characterised by waste waters from agricultural areas (sites 4, 12, 13, 14), and a reference site outside the Lagoon (site 15). Results revealed a significant reduction in AChE activity in clams from Marghera in October, January and April, indicating their probable exposure to neurotoxic compounds originating in the industrial zone of Porto Marghera. A seasonal trend in AChE activity was also observed, enzyme activity being higher in January and lower in June. Clams from Campalto generally had higher CI values than those from Marghera and Poveglia. However, no particular correlation between AChE activity and CI was found. Lastly, marked differences in AChE activity were recorded when comparing enzyme activity of clams from various sites in the Lagoon of Venice with those of clams collected at site 15. Significant reductions in AChE activity were observed in animals collected in both nearby canals and licensed areas, indicating the homogeneous spatial distribution of potentially neurotoxic compounds throughout the Lagoon. It is probable that <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> caused by clam harvesting and the passage of shipping {{plays an important role in}} resuspension of persistent contaminants having neurotoxic activity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{assessment}} {{of climate change}} impacts on the sediment cycle is currently a primary concern for environmental policy analysts in Mediterranean areas. Nevertheless, quantitative {{assessment of}} climate change impacts is still a complex task. The {{aim of this study}} was to implement a sediment model by taking advantage of sediment proxy information provided by reservoir bottom deposits and to use it for climate change assessment in a Mediterranean catchment. Materials and methods The sediment model was utilised in a catchment that drains into a large reservoir. The depositional history of the reservoir was reconstructed and used for sediment sub-model implementation. The model results were compared with gauged suspended sediment data in order to verify model robustness. Then, the model was coupled with future precipitation and temperature scenarios obtained from climate models. Climatological model outputs for two emission scenarios (A 2 and B 2) were simulated and the results compared with a reference scenario. Results and discussion Model results showed a general decrease in soil moisture and water discharge. Large floods, which are responsible for the majority of <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation,</b> also showed a general decrease. Sediment yield showed a clear reduction under the A 2 scenario but increased under the B 2 scenario. The computed specific sediment yield for the control period was 6. 33 Mg ha â 1 year â 1, while for the A 2 and B 2 scenarios, it was 3. 62 and 7. 04 Mg ha â 1 year â 1, respectively. Furthermore, sediment transport showed an increase in its time compression, i. e. a stronger dependence of total sediment yield from the largest event contributions. Conclusions This study shows a methodology for implementing a distributed sediment model by exploiting reservoir sedimentation volumes. This methodology can be applied to a wide range of catchments, given the high availability of reservoir sedimentation data. Moreover, this study showed how such a model can be used in the framework of a climate change study, providing a measure of the impact of climate change on soil erosion and sediment yields...|$|E

40|$|Soil erosion from {{agricultural}} areas {{is a large}} problem, because of off-site effects like the rapid filling of reservoirs. To mitigate the problem of sediments from {{agricultural areas}} reaching the channel, reservoirs and other surface waters, {{it is important to}} understand hillslope-channel connectivity and catchment connectivity. To determine the functioning of hillslope-channel connectivity and the continuation of transport of these sediments in the channel, it is necessary to obtain data on sediment transport from the hillslopes to the channels. Simultaneously, the factors that influence sediment export out of the catchment need to be studied. For measuring hillslope-channel sediment connectivity, Rare-Earth Oxide (REO) tracers were applied to a hillslope in an agricultural catchment in Navarre, Spain, preceding the winter of 2014 - 2015. The results showed that during the winter no sediment transport from the hillslope to the channel was detected. To test the implication of the REO results at the catchment scale, two contrasting conceptual models for sediment connectivity were assessed using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning method. The RF method was applied using a 15 -year period of measured sediment output at the catchment scale. One model proposes that small events provide sediment for large events, while the other proposes that only large events cause sediment detachment and small events subsequently remove these sediments from near and in the channel. For sediment yield prediction of small events, variables related to large preceding events were the most important. The model for large events underperformed and, therefore, we could not draw any immediate conclusions whether small events influence the amount of sediment exported during large events. Both REO tracers and RF method showed that low intensity events do not contribute any sediments from the hillslopes to the channel in the Latxaga catchment. Sediment dynamics are dominated by <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> during large (high intensity) events. Sediments are for a large part exported during those events, but the system shows a memory of the occurrence of these large events, suggesting that large amounts of sediments are deposited in and near the channel after these events. These sediments are gradually removed by small events. To better understand the delivery of sediments to the channel and how large and small events influence each other more field data on hillslope-channel connectivity and within-channel sediment dynamics is necessary. </p...|$|E
40|$|Erosion and {{sediment}} characteristics were measured using simulated rainfall on two cultivated soils of contrasting lithology (Quaternary calcareous colluvium and Tertiary marls) in a semiarid Mediterranean area of SE Spain. Two rainfall intensities, high (56. 0 ± 2. 4 mm h− 1) and medium (31. 4 ± 1. 4 mm h− 1), {{were used in}} order to know the mechanisms involved in each selected condition. For each simulated event, runoff {{and sediment}} were sampled at 1 -min intervals on a 1 -m wide by 2 -m long erosion plot. The erosion rate was calculated as {{the total amount of}} soil lost divided by the time period of the test. The duration of the test was that needed to reach steady state runoff, an average time of 24. 5 min for Quaternary calcareous colluvium and 17. 7 min for Tertiary marls. The size distribution of the transported sediment in the field (effective size distribution) was compared with equivalent measurements of the same samples after chemical and mechanical dispersion (ultimate size distribution) to investigate the detachment and transport mechanisms involved in <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation.</b> The results showed that the soil type determined the hydrological response, regardless of the rainfall intensity. The erosional response was, however, determined by the rainfall and soil surface characteristics. In Quaternary calcareous colluvial soils, the predominant erosion process depended on the rainfall intensity, with a prevailing detachment-limited condition in high-intensity events and prevailing transport-limited conditions in those events of medium intensity. These differences in the main erosion processes were reflected {{in the size of the}} transported material and in the change in sediment size within the storm. Thus, a time-dependent size distribution of the eroded material (decreasing coarse fractions and increasing fine fractions with runoff time) was observed for high-intensity events. In medium-intensity events, on the other hand, the time-independent size distribution of the eroded material indicated transport-limited erosion. Due to the rapid surface crusting on the Tertiary marl soil, no differences in the main erosion processes or in the sediment size distribution occurred for the different rainfall intensities tested. The erosion of marl soils was determined mainly by the limited quantity of available sediment. The effective size of material was a more sensitive parameter than the ultimate size of the sediment to study the way in which the sediment was transported.

40|$|Extensive and {{widespread}} landsliding {{is a common}} feature in a post-earthquake mountainous environment. The intense seismic shaking of an earthquake leaves the ground destabilised and thus very susceptible to slope failure. In addition to co-seismic landsliding, many slopes retain the high potential to fail for {{a significant amount of}} time beyond seismic activity. Therefore {{there is a need to}} further develop our understanding of sediment dynamics of steep mountain environments once the shaking has stopped. The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in China resulted in widespread landsliding, generating large volumes of loose rock and soil. Examples from other recent large earthquakes warn of the potential secondary hazards associated with such loose material: up to 30 m of river-bed aggradation was seen following the 1999 Chi-Chi Earthquake, Taiwan and it is thought that Sichuan may experience hazards of a similar magnitude. Preliminary reports and oblique photographs have displayed significant levels of sediment aggradation in certain areas and summer monsoonal rains continue to trigger further landslide failures. In addition to the associated hazards, this event has provided the opportunity to investigate sediment dynamics following a large earthquake (Mw = 7. 9) in a unique area of heterogeneous lithology and wide ranging geophysical variables, which has been impacted upon by both seismic and post-seismic (rainfall) activity. This study uses a combination of desk-based and field-based research in order to examine the distribution and evolution of post-seismic landslide failures. Volume-area scaling laws are developed in order to allow erosion rates to be calculated and finally an innovative oblique photography technique is used to constrain the depth of sediment aggradation. The results demonstrate that as a source of material, the occurrence of landslides in this region is controlled by a combination of topographic, geologic and seismological factors. Resulting volume estimations and subsequent erosion rates indicate that the Wenchuan earthquake has potentially destroyed more material through erosion than it has built through surface uplift. To conclude the movement of sediment through a mountain catchment, levels of sediment aggradation show that a significant proportion of material from the hillslope is transported down into the valley bottom; this is seen to coincide with periods of intense rainfall. Overall, this research derives a unique assessment of <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> in Sichuan in order to understand the controls on sediment remobilisation and secondary hazards. By constraining the extent of sediment sources and transfer, this research has the potential to aid the prediction of future post-earthquake hazards and landscape response in Sichuan, providing insight into the role of earthquakes in landscape evolution. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} river {{channels}} and their riparian zones {{in terms of}} geomorphology and vegetation has {{a significant effect on}} water and sediment transport in headwater catchments. High roughness in natural rivers due to vegetation and geomorphological attributes generate drag on flowing water. This drag will slow water discharge, which in turn influences the sediment dynamics of the flow. The impacts of changes in the management of rivers and their riparian zone (either by catchment managers or river restoration plans) impacts both up- as well as downstream reaches, and should be assessed holistically prior to the implementation of these plans. To assess the river's current state as well as any possible changes in geomorphology and vegetation in and around the river, effective approaches to characterise the river are needed. In this paper, we present a practical approach for making detailed surveys of relevant river attributes. This methodology has the benefit of being both detailed – describing river depth, width, channel morphology, erosive features and vegetation types – but also being practical in terms of time management. This is accomplished by identifying and describing characteristic benchmark reaches (typical sites) in detail against which the remainder of the river course can be rated. Using this method, a large river stretch can be assessed in a relatively short period while still retrieving high quality data for the total river course. In this way, models with high data requirements for assessing the condition of a river course, can be parameterised without major investments on field surveys. In a small headwater catchment (23 km 2) in southwestern Poland, this field methodology was used to retrieve data to run an existing model (HEC-GeoRAS) which can assess the impact of changes in the riparian and channel vegetation and channel management on sedimentation processes and stream flow velocity. This model determines the impact of channel morphology and in-channel and riparian vegetation on stream flow and sediment transport. Using four return periods of flooding (2, 10, 20 and 100 years), two opposing channel management / morphology scenarios were run; a natural channel and a fully regulated channel. The modelling results show an increase in the effect of riparian vegetation / geomorphology with an increase in return period of the modeled peak discharge. More natural channel form and increased roughness reduces the stream flow velocity due to increasing drag from flow obstructions (vegetation and channel morphological features). The higher the flood water stage, the greater the drag due to vegetation on the floodplains of natural river reaches compared to channelised sections. Slower flow rates have an impact on <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> and transport in the river. ...|$|E
40|$|Palaeoclimatic reconstructions {{in central}} China often rely on proxy information, {{obtained}} from single palaeoenvironmental archives at a distinct study site, such as lake sediments. Although {{they provide a}} high temporal resolution of information, their context within the acting depositional and geomorphological processes in a distinct landscape unit often is difficult to ascertain. The nature of lake systems strongly depends on catchment processes in addition to direct responses to climate forcing. In the scope of palaeoclimatic studies on the northern Tibetan Plateau and its foreland, we investigate the complex interaction of landscape evolution in response to monsoon dynamics. Our approach follows a source-to-sink approach along sediment cascades, to infer palaeoclimatic responses and to decipher internal non-climatic dynamics of the landscape system. Lake sediments represent the final and mostly complete sedimentary products, while adjacent landforms and offshore deposits provide insights into the spatial dimension of palaeoenvironmental change. The approach of concerted geomorphological and limnogeological research was successfully demonstrated at Lake Donggi Cona on the NE Tibetan Plateau at 4, 090 m elevation. The 30 km long, 8 km wide, and 90 m deep lake occupies a pull-apart basin. Sub-bottom profiling revealed the presence of tectonic structures as well as subaquatic terraces and ancient fan systems from former low lake stands, draped by younger lake sediments. A prominent moraine arc {{in the vicinity of}} the lake can be attributed to a glacial advance during an early stage of the last glacial cycle. Several terrace levels and fossil lake sediments of early to mid-Holocene age around the lake shore document former stages of higher lake level of about 10 m above present level. In addition to alluvial processes, dunes and loess-like sediments in the catchment of the lake give evidence of differing stages in the intensity of aeolian <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> or fixation. Lake development is documented by multi-proxy data in a series of sediment cores across the lake basin. The oldest recovered sediments, younger than 18 ka BP, comprise siliciclastic laminates and lateglacial saline shallow-lake sediments, overlying basal sands. The deposition of fine-grained marls and enhanced biological production characterized the deep lacustrine environment of the Holocene. A switch from a closed lake basin with brackish conditions towards an open oligotrophic fresh-water basin after 6. 8 ka BP is indicated by ostracod assemblages and changes in carbonate chemistry. This change in hydrology likely was triggered by tectonic pulses along the Kunlun Fault, an area with severe earthquake activity. Pollen records exhibit climate signals and indicate moist conditions in the early Holocene. During the same time, loess sediments have been preserved from a period from 10. 5 to 7. 5 ka BP, related to the strengthening of the insolation-driven Asian summer monsoons. This time was characterized by wetter and warmer climate and supported the trapping of dust. A dry and cooler climate resulted in the reactivation of dune sands from 3 ka to present, possibly in combination with stronger human influence...|$|E
40|$|Rates {{of river}} channel change in three {{contrasting}} Scottish upland environments {{have been studied}} {{within the context of}} Climatic fluctuation and landuse changes over the last 250 years. The object of the research was to assess the spatial and temporal variation in channel types, the main controls on channel pattern and the dominant modes of channel adjustment. This was undertaken in a hierarchic framework with sites being investigated at three spatial scales. At a macro-scale, the spatial and temporal variation in channel pattern was evaluated through a random sample of river channel segments for each study area, derived from the first and second editions of the 1 : 10, 560 0. S. maps plus the 1 : 10, 000 third edition. Each channel segment was classified within a map-based channel system typology, specifically constructed for upland Scotland. Measures of activity collected for each sample incorporated sinuosity, braiding and lateral shift indices. Flood histories were reconstructed for each study area on the basis of discharge records, long rainfall records and contemporary accounts, to assess if there was any evidence for climatic change, fluctuation or periodicities. Estimates of the recurrence interval of rainfall and runoff events of differing magnitude, frequency and duration were assessed. Data, mainly of a qualitative nature, were derived from contemporary sources and estate plans to evaluate whether any landuse changes could have changed the runoff regime and sediment mobility within each catchment. At a meso-scale, 7 to 9 channel segments (already identified as "active" within the macro-scale study) were subject to a more detailed process-response analysis, using sequential aerial photographs. Finally at a micro-scale, the unit stream powers at these sites were studied in relation to specific runoff rates thereby relating channel process to channel form. The strength of the controls on channel planform type varied in degree with the area studied. The glacial legacy, the positioning of local baselevels and sediment size were found to be dominant controls. In terms of channel dynamics, the position of the Channel planform in relation to process thresholds and the existence of a quasi-equilibrium condition were both very important. In terms of process-response, the following general observations hold true. An extreme event of high RI (> 100 years) will have a major disruptive impact if there is room for expansion of the channel system and providing thresholds for sediment transport are exceeded. If these thresholds are high, the fact that the channel has not recently been disrupted may also be important. The modes of expansion across the active area depend on the type of channel involved. Different study areas have different types of Channel pattern present and thus a greater likelihood of certain types of planform adjustment. The role of more moderate events (10 - 50 years) varies principally with sediment size and Channel slope. Small-scale modification may take place where stream powers associated with more moderate events exceed competence thresholds. It was found that process rates were highly variable in both time and space and that present rates were not necessarily representative of the past 250 years. Even within this timespan, there have been periods of increased activity in response to increased discharges of moderate magnitude (eg. 1870 s- 1880 s within the Dee study area) and random extreme magnitude floods (eg. between 1948 - 1956 in the Tweed study area). The impact of landuse change, especially in relation to <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> (Dee and Spey study areas), and speed of runoff (Tweed study area) also appeared to be important...|$|E
40|$|Land {{degradation}} {{is a large}} problem worldwide, {{especially in}} agricultural areas. Between 1 - 6 billion ha of land worldwide is affected by land degradation. With an increasing world population, more food production is needed and, therefore, more land is converted into agricultural areas. This conversion of land to agricultural areas, in turn, leads to more land degradation. Some common forms of land degradation are desertification, salinization and soil erosion by water. The negative effects of soil erosion have been recognized for a long time. Since the early 20 th century, researchers have tried to quantify soil displaced due to water, and to measure and model the efficiency of management strategies. The implications of problems with upscaling, wrong process representation and equifinality include the difficulty to properly predict sediment sources, pathways and sinks within catchments. These problems then can translate into the implementation of sub-optimal management strategies. To deal with these non-linear processes {{and the lack of}} proper representation of water and sediment sources, pathways and sinks, the concept of connectivity was developed. Currently, many definitions of connectivity have been proposed, although the definition most used is that of hydrological connectivity by Pringle (2003) : ‘Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle’. A unified theory on what constitutes connectivity and how connectivity should be measured or inferred remains {{one of the biggest challenges}} within catchment science.   In addition, it is unclear whether connectivity should be an output or an input of a model and if an input, whether this should be added explicitly or implicitly. The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to assess and quantify hydrological and sediment connectivity in a meaningful way, which can further our understanding of hydrological and sediment transport processes and catchment system dynamics. The study was carried out in three catchments in Navarre, northern Spain. Two catchments, ‘Latxaga’ and ‘La Tejeria’, are agricultural catchments with sizes of 2. 07 km 2 and 1. 69 km 2, respectively. The ‘Oskotz Forestal’ catchment is a (semi-) natural catchment, with a size of 5. 05 km 2. Land cover in the agricultural catchments is mainly winter wheat and barley, while in the Oskotz catchment it is grassland and forest. Latxaga and La Tejeria are mainly underlain by marls and within La Tejeria some sandstone is also present. The geology in Oskotz is characterised by an alternation of marls and sandy limestone. In chapter 2, I used networks (graph theory) to characterise and quantify overland flow connectivity dynamics on hillslopes in a humid sub-Mediterranean environment by using a combination of high-resolution digital-terrain models, overland flow sensors and a network approach.   Results showed that there are significant differences between overland flow connectivity on agricultural areas and semi-natural shrubs areas. Significant positive correlations between connectivity and precipitation characteristics were found. Significant negative correlations between connectivity and soil moisture were found, most likely due to soil water repellency and/or soil surface crusting. The combination of structural networks and dynamic networks for determining potential connectivity and actual connectivity proved a powerful tool for analysing overland flow connectivity.   In chapter 3, I determined the functioning of hillslope-channel connectivity and the continuation of transport of these sediments in the channel. To determine this functioning, I obtained data on sediment transport from the hillslopes to the channels while simultaneously looking at factors that influence sediment export out of the catchment. For measuring hillslope-channel sediment connectivity, Rare-Earth Oxide (REO) tracers were applied to a hillslope in the Latxaga catchment preceding the winter of 2014 - 2015. The results showed that during the winter there have been no sediments transported from the hillslope into the channel. Analysis of precipitation data showed that although total precipitation quantities did not differ much from the mean, the precipitation intensities were low. Using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning method, I showed that hillslope-channel connectivity in Latxaga is dominated by <b>sediment</b> <b>mobilisation</b> during large (high intensity) precipitation events. Sediments are for a large part exported during those events. Large events also leave behind large amounts of sediments in and near the channel, which is gradually removed by small events. In chapter 4 I demonstrated that existing data can be used to assess governing factors of connectivity, and how these factors change over time. Data from three catchments in Navarre, Northern Spain, were used to assess factors that influence hydrologic and sediment connectivity. These factors were used as components in a spatially-lumped linear model for discharge and suspended-sediment yield. Three components of connectivity were distinguished: topographical, biological and soil. Changes in the topographical component for the studied periods were considered relatively small, and, therefore, kept constant. Changes in the biological component were determined using the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Changes in the soil component were assessed using an Antecedent Precipitation Index. Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients were between 0. 49 through 0. 62 for the discharge models and between 0. 23 through 0. 3 for the sediment-yield models. I recommended applying the model at smaller spatial scales than catchment scale to minimize the lumping of spatial variability in the components. In chapter 5, the objective was to better understand the implications of model calibration at different spatial scales on the simulation of hydrology and sediment dynamics of an agricultural catchment. I applied the LAPSUS-D model to the Latxaga catchment. The model was calibrated and validated (4 years: 2011 - 2015) using three datasets at varying spatial scales: hillslope, catchment and the combined dataset (combined-calibrated model). The hillslope-calibrated model showed mainly infiltration-excess overland flow, the catchment-calibrated mainly saturation-excess overland flow at the footslopes and the combined-calibrated model showed saturation-excess overland flow from the midslopes to the footslopes. For hydrology, the combined-calibrated model simulated the large discharge peaks best, while at the hillslope scale, the hillslope-calibrated model performed best. The hillslope-calibrated model produced the highest model efficiencies for sediments, for calibration (0. 618) and validation (0. 269). The hillslope-calibrated model was the only model that showed observed gully erosion on a high-resolution DEM and displayed channel sediment dynamics. However, absolute quantities of erosion and deposition within the catchment were too high. The results show that modellers need to be aware of problems associated with automatic calibration, over-calibration and not incorporating measured data at multiple spatial scales.   We advocate incorporating runoff and sediment tracing data at multiple scales whenever this is possible and to, furthermore, carry out specific measuring campaigns towards this end, ultimately to get a more comprehensive view on hydrological and sediment connectivity within a catchment. The combination of chapters in this thesis showed that the connectivity concept is useful for a wide range of studies, from hillslope scale to catchment scale. Using the concept, I was able to determine sediment dynamics for a humid-Mediterranean catchment and show that this behaviour is different than previously thought. Depending of the aim of the study, various concepts of connectivity are useful. Different geologic and climatic settings cause large differences in catchment (sediment) dynamics. It might, therefore, not be necessary, or even possible, to strive for a single, unifying conceptual framework for connectivity. Instead, a collection of frameworks for different settings should be developed. These frameworks should, however, always aim at helping to understand which measurements need to be taken and which type of models and indices should be used for that particular setting. It is my honest opinion that connectivity is definitely a useful concept to advance our knowledge on water and sediment transport processes further. However, careful consideration is also required as this particular concept will not necessary provide the ultimate explanation and insights in dynamic behaviour within watersheds around the world. The gap between the different spatial and temporal scales is too complex to be bridged with a single concept like connectivity. However, the many studies about connectivity that will be published in the near future will be able to advance knowledge on water and sediment transport processes...|$|E
