5|$|At 4p.m. PDT on May 22, the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and Italian <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> {{arranged}} for a call to Endeavour by Pope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by {{the discovery of a}} gash in the Shuttle's fuselage—the Pope extended his blessing to Kelly's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, who had undergone skull surgery earlier in the week. The event marked the first time a Pope spoke to astronauts {{during the course of a}} mission.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland <b>Space</b> <b>Agency,</b> the Swiss Space Office, {{has been}} {{involved}} in various space technologies and programmes. In addition {{it was one of the}} 10 founders of the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> in 1975 and is the seventh largest contributor to the ESA budget. In the private sector, several companies are implicated in the space industry such as Oerlikon Space or Maxon Motors who provide spacecraft structures.|$|E

5|$|Since 1999, {{the leading}} Hubble {{outreach}} group in Europe {{has been the}} Hubble European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> Information Centre (HEIC). This office was established at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency.</b> The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.|$|E
5|$|The European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency,</b> in {{collaboration}} with Roscosmos, launched the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander on March 14, 2016. While the Trace Gas Orbiter successfully entered Mars orbit on October 19, 2016, Schiaparelli crashed during its landing attempt.|$|E
5|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{combines}} NASA's Space Station Freedom {{project with}} the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module. NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints {{led to the}} merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA), and the Canadian <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles. It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, {{the completion of the}} US Orbital Segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2016. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya), with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.|$|E

5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{proposed}} in 1965, {{the station was}} established by the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (NTNF) in 1967 in close cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) and located adjacent to Tromsø Geophysical Observatory. From its inception until 1974, it served low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operated by the European Space Research Organization (ESRO). To a lesser extent it was also used by Canadian <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LEO satellites. Norway's non-membership in ESRO and later the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) caused Tromsø to not become a ground station for Landsat. A gradual increase in operations occurred from 1982, such as for the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme and the European Remote-Sensing Satellite. TSS became part of NSC in 1990, although it was partially sold to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) in 1995. SvalSat merged with TSS in 2002 to form KSAT.|$|E

40|$|Formerly {{known as}} the Cloud Retrieval Evaluation Workshop (CREW; see the list of {{acronyms}} used in this paper below) group (Roebeling et al. 2013, 2015), the International Cloud Working Group (ICWG) was created and endorsed during the 42 nd Meeting of CGMS. The CGMS-ICWG provides a forum for <b>space</b> <b>agencies</b> to seek coherent progress in science and applications and also to act as a bridge between <b>space</b> <b>agencies</b> and the cloud remote sensing and applications community. The ICWG plans to serve as a forum to exchange and enhance knowledge on state-of-the-art cloud parameter retrievals algorithms, to stimulate support for training in the use of cloud parameters, and to encourage <b>space</b> <b>agencies</b> and the cloud remote sensing community to share knowledge. The ICWG plans to prepare recommendations to guide the direction of future research-for example, on observing severe weather events or on process studies-and to influence relevant programs of the WMO, WCRP, GCOS, and the <b>space</b> <b>agencies...</b>|$|R
5|$|Several other Venus flybys {{took place}} in the 1980s and 1990s that {{increased}} the understanding of Venus, including Vega 1 (1985), Vega 2 (1985), Galileo (1990), Magellan (1994), Cassini–Huygens (1998), and MESSENGER (2006). Then, Venus Express by the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) entered orbit around Venus in April 2006. Equipped with seven scientific instruments, Venus Express provided unprecedented long-term observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded that mission in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{spacecraft}} reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, {{and began}} the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A joint project of the European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) and NASA, Cassini–Huygens proved a very successful mission. The Cassini probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only , discerning patches {{of light and dark}} that would be invisible to the human eye.|$|E

5|$|The {{main and}} most urgent problem, however, was in finding funds {{to support the}} {{continued}} operation of the spacecraft amid the spending crunch in post-Soviet Russia. The French <b>space</b> <b>agency,</b> having already {{contributed significantly to the}} project (both scientifically and financially), took upon itself to fund the continuing operations directly.|$|E
5|$|The main {{purposes}} of the mission were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced following the Columbia disaster {{as well as to}} deliver supplies, equipment, and European <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) astronaut Thomas Reiter from Germany to the ISS. The transfer of Reiter to the ISS returned the station to a three crew member staffing level.|$|E
