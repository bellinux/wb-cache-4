5|$|<b>Smokeless</b> Welsh coal {{exported}} from Barry Docks was {{in great}} demand by the Royal Navy at their stations {{all over the}} world.|$|E
5|$|The J79 engines {{produced}} noticeable {{amounts of}} black smoke (at mid-throttle/cruise settings), a severe disadvantage in that the enemy could spot the aircraft. This was solved on the F-4S fitted with the −10A engine variant which used a <b>smokeless</b> combustor.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the <b>smokeless</b> powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but <b>smokeless</b> powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning <b>smokeless</b> powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of <b>smokeless</b> powder, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of <b>smokeless</b> powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. <b>Smokeless</b> tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the belief}} {{that it would be}} {{operated}} by <b>smokeless</b> locomotives, the line had been built with little ventilation and a long tunnel between Edgware Road and King's Cross. Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers and the ventilation was later improved by making an opening in the tunnel between Gower Street and King's Cross and removing glazing in the station roofs. With the problem continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values. This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report, which reported that a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the line was electrified before these were built.|$|E
5|$|While {{the role}} of battleships in both World Wars {{reflected}} Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike ships of the line, the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines —because efficient mines & torpedoes didn't exist before that— {{which could be used}} by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The Jeune École doctrine of the 1870s and 1880s recommended placing torpedo boats alongside battleships; these would hide behind the larger ships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes. While this tactic was vitiated by the development of <b>smokeless</b> propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s, the Royal Navy had developed the first destroyers, which were initially designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.|$|E
25|$|One movie {{depicting}} <b>smokeless</b> {{tobacco use}} was the 2003 John Travolta movie Basic where <b>smokeless</b> brand Skoal was used.|$|E
25|$|The term {{black powder}} was coined {{in the late}} 19th century, {{primarily}} in the United States, to distinguish prior gunpowder formulations from the new <b>smokeless</b> powders and semi-smokeless powders. Semi-smokeless powders featured bulk volume properties that approximated black powder, but had significantly reduced amounts of smoke and combustion products. <b>Smokeless</b> powder has different burning properties (pressure vs. time) and can generate higher pressures and work per gram. This can rupture older weapons designed for black powder. <b>Smokeless</b> powders ranged in color from brownish tan to yellow to white. Most of the bulk semi-smokeless powders ceased to be manufactured in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th Century, as Western {{manufacturers}} developed {{machine guns and}} other rapid fire ordnance, it became imperative to reduce the smoke that obscured battlefields and revealed hidden gun emplacements. Camphor was an essential component {{in the production of}} <b>smokeless</b> gunpowder. Also, the new <b>smokeless</b> powder did not foul the weapons as much as conventional gunpowder.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 the Clean Air Act started legally {{enforcing}} <b>smokeless</b> {{zones in}} the capital. There were areas where no soft coal {{was allowed to}} be burned in homes or in businesses, only coke, which produces no smoke. Because of the <b>smokeless</b> zones, reduced levels of sooty particulates eliminated the intense and persistent London smog.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>smokeless</b> powder is {{coated in}} {{graphite}} {{to prevent the}} buildup of static charge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Smokeless</b> {{tobacco is}} cause of oral and {{pharyngeal}} cancers (oropharyngeal cancer). Cigar smoking {{is an important}} risk factor for oral cancers as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{latter half}} of the 19th century saw the {{invention}} of nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose and <b>smokeless</b> powders which soon replaced black powder in many applications.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works began {{producing}} <b>smokeless</b> powder for firearms ammunition in {{the early}} 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared at Santa Cruz {{under the direction of}} assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW <b>Smokeless</b> powder and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid cartridge case corrosion caused by picric acid in the Peyton Powder.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works {{became a}} DuPont {{subsidiary}} in 1903, and operated under the DuPont name after 1906. Powder works wharf demolition begun in 1883 was completed before {{construction of the}} Neptune Casino at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in 1904. DuPont control of explosives manufacturing in the United States caused federal anti-trust action in 1912 requiring DuPont to distribute assets into three firms. Manufacture of blasting explosives was assigned to Atlas Powder Company. California Powder Works double-base <b>smokeless</b> powder patents were assigned to Hercules Powder Company's consolidated <b>smokeless</b> powder manufacturing facility at Kenvil, New Jersey. DuPont retained manufacture of black powder and single base <b>smokeless</b> powders including the powder being manufactured for the United States Navy. When the Panama Canal simplified transport to the Pacific Fleet, DuPont consolidated production facilities in New Jersey and terminated operations at Santa Cruz in 1914. Powder mill facilities were dismantled, and the property was sold in 1924. The two mansions occupied by powder works superintendents were abandoned and razed in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Among {{cigarette}} smokers in 2005, {{an estimated}} 42.5% had stopped smoking {{for at least}} 1 day during the preceding 12 months because {{they were trying to}} quit. Among the estimated 42.5% (or 91.8 million) of people who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetimes (the question the CDC asked to measure if they were ever smokers or not), 50.8% (or 46.5 million) did not smoke currently. In 2005, prevalence of current cigar smoking was 2.2% and current <b>smokeless</b> tobacco use was 2.3%. Prevalence of cigar smoking and use of <b>smokeless</b> tobacco were higher among men (4.3% and 4.5%, respectively) than women (0.3% and 0.2%).|$|E
25|$|Towards the end {{of their}} use in the armed forces, the {{original}} gunpowder cartridges were replaced by cartridges filled with <b>smokeless</b> powder. Despite the increase in muzzle velocity, the sights were not altered, thus radically decreasing the accuracy of the rifle.|$|E
25|$|Though tobacco may be {{consumed}} by either smoking or other <b>smokeless</b> {{methods such as}} chewing, the World Health Organization (WHO) only collects data on smoked tobacco. Smoking has therefore been studied more extensively than {{any other form of}} tobacco consumption.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Standard Oil first {{produced}} {{isopropyl alcohol}} by hydrating propene. Its major {{use at the}} time was not rubbing alcohol but for oxidation to acetone, whose first major use was in World War One for the preparation of the <b>smokeless</b> propellant, cordite.|$|E
25|$|Other major tobacco {{sponsors}} in {{the sport}} during the 1980s through 2000s included Players Ltd., KOOL, and Hollywood. <b>Smokeless</b> tobacco companies also sponsored several entries, with Foyt in a longer-term association with Copenhagen, and Skoal also appearing on cars during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Prevalence {{of tobacco}} {{consumption}} is {{reported by the}} World Health Organization (WHO), which focuses on smoking (not <b>smokeless</b> chewing tobacco) due to reported data limitations. As of 2008 the rate {{was estimated to be}} 18%, and declining. A 2011 survey estimates that 17% of Canadians smoke.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the legislation, tobacco {{sponsorship}} continues in the sports through electronic cigarettes, with companies such as Green Smoke, blu (owned by R.J. Reynolds), and Arrowhead sponsoring NASCAR teams. A brand of herbal <b>smokeless</b> tobacco, Smokey Mountain, has also sponsored drivers such as Hornaday, Johnny Sauter, Brian Scott, and Daniel Hemric.|$|E
25|$|The {{rocket motor}} has a burn time of 2.1 seconds, a maximum thrust of 27,000 newtons and can {{accelerate}} the Piranha missile up to Mach 2. The motor uses a <b>smokeless</b> propellant. The theoretical range is 8–10km (4–6km in early versions from the 70's and 80's). The mission time is 40 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Smoke is {{primarily}} mitigated by more evenly mixing the fuel with air. As {{discussed in the}} fuel injector section above, modern fuel injectors (such as airblast fuel injectors) evenly atomize the fuel and eliminate local pockets of high fuel concentration. Most modern engines use these types of fuel injectors and are essentially <b>smokeless.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fort's heavy {{guns were}} German, {{typically}} Krupp, while the turret mechanisms {{were from a}} variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than <b>smokeless</b> powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.|$|E
25|$|Charcoal is also mostly <b>smokeless</b> and is {{not liable}} to {{deterioration}} by fungi or insects which attack fuelwood. With these benefits, charcoal is particularly popular in cities. However, even in rural areas in Goma, North Kivu for example, charcoal is also widely used. On average, each person uses 1 to 1.6 cubic meter of fuelwood and 80 to 95kg of charcoal annually.|$|E
25|$|DuPont {{continued}} to expand, {{moving into the}} production of dynamite and <b>smokeless</b> powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments. The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted {{in the creation of}} the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel). At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of <b>smokeless</b> powders.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, at {{serial number}} 164,100, a {{spring-loaded}} base pin latch replaced the cylinder pin retaining screw and by 1900, at serial number 192,000, the Colt Single Action was certified {{for use with}} <b>smokeless</b> powder. In 1920, larger, highly visible sights replaced the original thin blade and notch. The revolvers remained essentially unchanged from that point until cessation of manufacture {{at the beginning of}} World War II.|$|E
25|$|The {{first sign}} the Americans had of the enemy's {{proximity}} was a Cuban Army soldier lying dead by the road. The engagement began with shots by U.S. artillery. Spanish infantry returned fire, pinning down the advancing American units with rifle volleys. The Spaniards were armed with superior 7mm 1893 model Mauser repetition rifles that fired round after round of <b>smokeless</b> gunpowder, making them exceedingly difficult to target in return.|$|E
25|$|The large {{weapons were}} all German products, made by Krupp in Essen, but the armor was by Cockerill (Belgium), Ateliers de Creusot (France) or Grüson (Germany). The fort was {{provided}} with signal lights to permit {{communication with the}} neighboring Fort de Lantin and Fort de Hollogne. The guns were fired using black powder rather than <b>smokeless</b> powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of oil refining {{led to the}} availability of kerosene as lamp oil, which has a <b>smokeless</b> combustion {{in contrast with the}} until then highly used whale oil. The lamp oil became known as Pennsylvania Kerosine. Due to overfishing, whale oil became rare and expensive. By this time, petroleum oil had already begun to supplant fish, whale, and vegetable oils for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, and transatlantic export had already begun.|$|E
25|$|English {{inventor}} Thomas Parker, who {{was responsible}} for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the <b>smokeless</b> fuel coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries. Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is a volatile, colorless liquid {{that has}} a slight odor. It burns with a <b>smokeless</b> blue flame that is not always visible in normal light. The {{physical}} properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain. Ethanol's hydroxyl group is {{able to participate in}} hydrogen bonding, rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight, such as propane.|$|E
25|$|Goddard {{described}} extensive {{experiments with}} solid-fuel rocket engines burning high grade nitrocellulose <b>smokeless</b> powder. A critical breakthrough {{was the use}} of the steam turbine nozzle invented by the Swedish inventor Gustaf de Laval. The de Laval nozzle allows the most efficient (isentropic) conversion of the energy of hot gases into forward motion. By means of this nozzle, Goddard increased the efficiency of his rocket engines from 2 percent to 64 percent and obtained supersonic exhaust velocities of over Mach 7.|$|E
