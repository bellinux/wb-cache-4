25|$|Though {{the west}} coast is rocky, it is noted for its fine scenery. La Fontaine Bay, named for a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> located nearby, is {{particularly}} well known for its views. The ruggedness of the coast means there are no excellent anchorages around Little Sark, though Port Gorey, the larger off two inlets in the south coast, was formerly used as a harbour.|$|E
25|$|Morgan Square, the city’s primary {{downtown}} hub, is {{the original}} courthouse village. It was founded adjacent to a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> (now underground) on the western slope of a ridge, which forms {{the border of the}} Tyger and Pacolet River watersheds. The square's name derives from Daniel Morgan, the general who commanded the American forces at Cowpens. A statue of Morgan was placed in the square in 1881. The oldest existing buildings on Morgan Square date to the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|Spring-loaded flex hinge temples: These flex hinges are {{equipped}} with a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> that affords the arms a greater range of movement and does not limit them to the traditional, 90 degree angle. Repairs {{can be made by}} using Self Aligning Spring Hinge Screws. Use screw insertion pliers to push the tip beyond the first barrel of a spring hinge at a 45 degree angle and use a standard screwdriver to tighten. As the screw moves down the barrel, it will move to a 90 degree angle. When finished, use a plier to break off the excess.|$|E
50|$|The {{entire area}} around Barton Springs {{is riddled with}} faults from the Balcones Fault Zone and {{features}} other, <b>smaller</b> <b>springs.</b> For example, about one mile (2 km) upstream of Upper Barton Spring, an intermittent spring fills a popular natural swimming hole. Several other <b>small</b> <b>springs</b> empty directly into the Barton Creek bypass tunnel that passes {{to the side of}} Barton Springs Pool.|$|R

25|$|The basic physics behind {{neutrino}} oscillation can {{be found}} in any system of coupled harmonic oscillators. A simple example is a system of two pendulums connected by a weak spring (a spring with a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> constant). The first pendulum is set in motion by the experimenter while the second begins at rest. Over time, the second pendulum begins to swing {{under the influence of the}} spring, while the first pendulum's amplitude decreases as it loses energy to the second. Eventually all of the system's energy is transferred to the second pendulum and the first is at rest. The process then reverses. The energy oscillates between the two pendulums repeatedly until it is lost to friction.|$|E
25|$|The Wrythe {{lies between}} Carshalton village {{to the south}} and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word rithe which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by {{the fact that there was}} once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, just a couple of miles away, and a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The spring has since disappeared under ground and the culvert it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch marched {{toward the}} centre of the city in orderly fashion until {{reaching}} the artillery range of the Fortaleza do Monte, where they came under heavy bombardment. When the invaders passed by a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> called Fontinha where local women used to wash their laundry, the Jesuit priest Giacomo Rho fired a cannon-shot from the Fortaleza do Monte which landed on a barrel of gunpowder {{in the midst of the}} Dutch formation, causing many casualties. This changed the tempo of battle, as the Dutch commanders halted the advance to deliberate their next steps. They decided to climb the Guia Hill, upon which a hermitage was situated, to get a better view of the enemy, but their ascent was resisted by a party of 30 Macanese and blacks, whose ferocity and effective use of terrain forced the Dutch to back down and change their plans again. Not expecting such stiff resistance, the invaders moved toward a patch of high ground near the Guia Hill, with the intention of retreating for the day due to fatigue and low ammunitions (most were lost in the explosion).|$|E

2500|$|Beco {{reported}} eight {{visions of}} the Blessed Virgin Mary between January 15 and March 2, 1933. She reported seeing a Lady in White who declared herself the Virgin of the Poor and told her: [...] "Believe in me and I will believe in you". In one vision, the Lady reportedly asked Mariette to drink from a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> and later said that the spring was for healing. Over time the site drew pilgrims. Today, the <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> yields about 2,000 gallons {{of water a day}} with many reports of miraculous healings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the city's name is unclear, but in one version, the name comes from the archaic Romanian word chișla (meaning [...] "spring", [...] "source of water") and nouă ("new"), because it was built around a <b>small</b> <b>spring,</b> {{at the corner of}} Pușkin and Albișoara streets.|$|E

[...] The rear fixed surfaces, ply covered, were very narrow, though the root of the fin was carefully faired into the fuselage. The tapered control surfaces were fabric covered.|$|E
2500|$|The South Fork Trinity River {{begins as}} a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> on the west slope of the Brooks Ridge near North Yolla Bolly Mountain, [...] above sea level. From there, it flows briefly west and turns to the north, {{receiving}} numerous small tributaries which drain a series of steep, forested valleys in the headwaters. At about [...] from its source, the river is crossed by the Humboldt Trail, then it receives north-flowing Shell Mountain Creek from the left. Shortly downstream, the [...] long East Branch South Fork Trinity River joins from the right. Shortly afterwards, it receives Happy Camp Creek from the left and Smoky Creek from the right.|$|E
2500|$|Dated c. 1560, and {{attributed}} by them to Titian. To Penny {{it seems}} [...] "largely autograph" [...] (by Titian himself), {{and from the}} various differences in detail he suggests it was [...] "planned, if not painted, {{at the same time}} as [...] or perhaps a little earlier". [...] It was engraved by Raphael Sadeler II in 1610. Alone among the versions described here, a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> or stream falls to the left of the figures. [...] Owned by Anne Russell Digby, wife of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, it was inherited by the Spencer family in 1685, in whose hands it remained until 1924. It was then sold to various British and American art dealers, and acquired in 1942 by the National Gallery of Art.|$|E

2500|$|Beckman was {{not allowed}} to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign, and they were not {{particularly}} interested in the problem; he eventually came up with a solution himself. [...] Instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil, with pressure from a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> to create a single contact point, he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove, in which the contact point was contained. The contact point could then move smoothly and continuously, and could not be jarred out of contact. Beckman's Model A Helipot was in tremendous demand by the military. [...] Within the first year of its production, its sales became 40% of the company's income. Beckman spun off a separate company, the Helipot Corporation, to take on the electronics component manufactory.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney had {{acquired}} land {{adjacent to the}} route of the future CPR line at Pile-of-Bones, which was distinguished only by collections of bison bones near a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> run-off creek, some few kilometres downstream from its origin in the midst of what are now wheat fields. There was an [...] "obvious conflict of interest" [...] in Dewdney's choosing the site of Pile-of-Bones as the territorial seat of government and it was a national scandal at the time. But until 1897, when responsible government was accomplished in the Territories, the lieutenant-governor and council governed by fiat and there was little legitimate means of challenging such decisions outside the federal capital of Ottawa. There, the Territories were remote and of little concern. Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, wife of the then Governor General of Canada, named the new community Regina, in honour of her mother, Queen Victoria.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other planned {{cities in}} the Canadian West, on its {{treeless}} flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> run-off, Wascana Creek. Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake {{to the south of}} the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate [...] long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake. Regina's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906. Wascana Centre, created around the focal point of Wascana Lake, remains one of Regina's attractions and contains the Provincial Legislative Building, both campuses of the University of Regina, First Nations University of Canada, the provincial museum of natural history, the Regina Conservatory (in the original Regina College buildings), the Saskatchewan Science Centre, the MacKenzie Art Gallery and the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts.|$|E

2500|$|The siege {{began on}} 6 April. The {{garrison}} was continually shelled and mortared, {{in many instances}} by Japanese using weapons and ammunition captured at Sangshak and from other depots, and was slowly driven into a small perimeter on Garrison Hill. They had artillery support from {{the main body of}} 161st Brigade, who were themselves cut off [...] away at Jotsoma, but, as at Sangshak, they were very short of drinking water. The water supply point was on GPT Ridge, which was captured by the Japanese {{on the first day of}} the siege. Some of its defenders were unable to retreat to other positions on the ridge and instead withdrew towards Dimapur. Canvas water tanks on FSD and at the Indian General Hospital had neither been filled nor dug in to protect them from fire. While a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> was discovered on the north side of Garrison Hill, it could be reached only at night. The medical dressing stations were exposed to Japanese fire, and wounded men were often hit again as they waited for treatment.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{restoration}} work done on Locust Grove in the late 1980s, students from Longwood College visited the home and grounds and conducted an archaeological dig which covered various portions of the property. [...] Excavations were conducted at five points around the site, {{and a number of}} discoveries were made. [...] Chief among these was the grave of an infant discovered {{in the corner of the}} former kitchen garden near the house. [...] Oral tradition states that Francisco had a daughter who died in infancy sometime in the 1820s, and who was buried in the garden. [...] There are no formal records either of such a burial or of the birth of the child; however, the discovery of the grave lends greater credence to the story. [...] Also found on the grounds of the house were the remains of the foundation of a tobacco barn, known to have burned in 1826, as well as some bits of ash and a large collection of nails and nail fragments. [...] Excavations on and around the property also turned up the foundation and cellar of an old ice house, later used as a trash midden; the foundation of another small building, whose purpose remains uncertain; and a <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> associated through oral tradition with Peter Francisco. [...] Numerous beams and door and window frames original to the house were found and replaced during {{the restoration}} and excavation; the originals were set aside in the basement for further study.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the evening}} of February 11, 1858, a young Roman Catholic girl, Bernadette, went to fetch some {{firewood}} with her sister and another companion when a Lady who was indescribably beautiful appeared {{to her at the}} Massabielle grotto. [...] Although the Lady did not tell Bernadette her name when asked at first, she told her to return to the grotto. On subsequent visits, the Lady revealed herself to be the [...] "Immaculate Conception". This was a reference to the dogma of the Immaculate Conception which had been defined only four years earlier in 1854 by Pope Pius IX, stating that the Virgin Mary herself had been conceived without sin. [...] Bernadette, having only a rudimentary knowledge of the Catholic faith, did not understand what this meant but she reported it to her parish priest, Father Peyremale. [...] He, though initially very skeptical of Bernadette's claims, became convinced when he heard this because he knew the young girl had no knowledge of the doctrine. [...] The Lady also told Bernadette to dig in the ground at a certain spot and to drink from the <b>small</b> <b>spring</b> of water that began to bubble up. Almost immediately cures were reported from drinking the water. And yet the water has been shown through repeated testing to not have any special curative properties. [...] Today thousand of gallons of water gush from the source of the spring, and pilgrims are able to bathe in it. Countless purported miracle cures have been documented there, from the healing of nervous disorders and cancers to cases of paralysis and even of blindness. [...] "The estimate that about 4000 cures have been obtained at Lourdes within the first fifty years of the pilgrimage is undoubtedly considerably less than the actual number." ...|$|E
