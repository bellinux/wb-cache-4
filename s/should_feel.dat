5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
25|$|Fanny Cradock {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the public in the postwar-utility years, trying to inspire the average housewife with an exotic approach to cooking. She famously worked in various ball-gowns without the customary cook’s apron, averring that women <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> cooking was easy and enjoyable, rather than messy and intimidating.|$|E
25|$|In an {{open letter}} to De Volkskrant {{on the day of the}} Dutch elections, defense {{minister}} Kamp said the news about possible mistreatment was deceptive, and that the editor of De Volkskrant <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> being misused by the sources for this story. The Department of Defense in the mean time is demanding a rectification of the story published by De Volkskrant.|$|E

Why <b>should</b> you <b>feel</b> for its debasing thraldom--you who, in the {{religious}} mystification of man, have, at least, the noble privilege of being a Protestant?" ...|$|R

25|$|Stretching {{prior to}} strenuous {{physical}} activity has been thought to increase muscular performance by extending {{the soft tissue}} past its attainable length {{in order to increase}} range of motion. Many physically active individuals practice these techniques as a “warm-up” in order to achieve a certain level of muscular preparation for specific exercise movements. When stretching, muscles <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> somewhat uncomfortable but not physically agonizing.|$|E
25|$|Maathai was {{defeated}} in the Party of National Unity's primary elections for its parliamentary candidates in November 2007 and chose to instead run as the candidate of a smaller party. She {{was defeated}} in the December 2007 parliamentary election. She called for a recount of votes {{in the presidential election}} (officially won by Mwai Kibaki, but disputed by the opposition) in her constituency, saying that both sides <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> the outcome was fair and that there were indications of fraud.|$|E
25|$|Is it {{necessary}} for sisters to be set apart to officiate in the sacred ordinances of washing, anointing, and laying on of hands in administering to the sick? It certainly is not. Any and all sisters who honor their holy endowments, not only have right, but <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> it a duty, whenever called upon to administer to our sisters in these ordinances, which God has graciously committed to His daughters {{as well as to}} His sons; and we testify that when administered and received in faith and humility they are accompanied with almighty power.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August, the day Fourth Army retook Albert (a {{symbolic}} victory as it {{had been}} their forward base at the Somme two years earlier) Haig ordered his Army Commanders to pass down to all ranks the message that bold attacks were now needed, {{even to the point of}} divisions driving for distant objectives leaving their flanks uncovered: “risks which a month ago would have been criminal to incur, ought now to be incurred as a duty”. It has been suggested that this was aimed in part as a rebuke to Byng. The following day he sent out further guidance, quoting the relevant passage of Field Service Regulations, on how “advance guards” <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> for weak spots in the enemy defences.|$|E
25|$|After {{the upper}} abdomen has been palpated and {{the form that}} is found is identified, the {{individual}} performing the maneuver attempts to determine {{the location of the}} fetal back. Still facing the woman, the health care provider palpates the abdomen with gentle but also deep pressure using the palm of the hands. First the right hand remains steady {{on one side of the}} abdomen while the left hand explores the right side of the woman's uterus. This is then repeated using the opposite side and hands. The fetal back will feel firm and smooth while fetal extremities (arms, legs, etc.) <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> like small irregularities and protrusions. The fetal back, once determined, should connect with the form found in the upper abdomen and also a mass in the maternal inlet, lower abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Meade asked Grant for {{clarification}} because Grant had ordered a 4:00a.m. attack {{all along the}} line. Grant said both Humphreys and Parke <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> {{for a chance to}} push on that night, that Humphreys should send skirmishers forward and attack if the Confederates were leaving their positions. If the Confederates held their line, Grant said that Humphreys should send Miles's division down White Oak Road to reinforce Sheridan. Grant also directed that Wright, Parke and Ord, with John Gibbon's XXIV Corps from the Army of the James, should begin an artillery barrage on the Confederate lines. The corps commanders and Ord reported their men could not see well enough to attack. At 10:00p.m., Union artillery opened fire on the Confederate lines opposite the Petersburg lines until 2:00a.m. The Confederates did not leave the lines and the Union assault began at about4:40a.m.|$|E

25|$|Some Medicare {{supplemental}} insurance (or “Medigap”) plans {{cover all}} of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health care needs. Many policymakers {{believe that such}} plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a perverse incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are {{a major cause of}} rising costs and propose that people with Medicare <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years. But it would also increase health care costs substantially for people with costly health care needs.|$|E
25|$|During {{his life}} at Rome, {{although}} he never {{rose to a}} position of real independence, and had always a hard and close struggle with poverty, he seems to have known everybody, especially every one of any eminence at the bar or in literature (friend to all). In addition to Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his manifold friends or more intimate acquaintances Silius Italicus, Juvenal, the younger Pliny; and there were many others of high position whose society and patronage he relished. The silence which he and Statius, although authors writing at the same time, having common friends and treating often of the same subjects, maintain in regard to one another may (nay must certainly) be explained by mutual dislike or want of sympathy or healthy rivalry or simple disgust. Martial in many places shows an undisguised contempt for the artificial kind of epic on which Statius's reputation chiefly rests; and it seems quite natural in the mind of an eminent litteraturist that the respectable author of the Thebaid and the Silvae <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> little admiration, nay perhaps even outright contempt, for either the life or the works of the populist and unsophisticated bohemian epigrammatist.|$|E
500|$|The text {{ends with}} a {{paragraph}} that asks if it is [...] "any wonder that artists <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> keen delight {{in looking at the}} disguising-patterns worn by animals?" [...] These are [...] "triumphs of art", where the student can find [...] "in epitome, painted and perfected by Nature herself", the typical color and pattern scheme of each kind of landscape.|$|E

500|$|At first Young was {{appreciative of}} Champollion's success, {{writing in a}} letter to his friend that [...] "If he [...] did borrow an English key. The lock was so dreadfully rusty. that no common arm would have had {{strength}} enough to turn it....You will easily believe that were I ever so much the victim of the bad passions, I <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> nothing but exultation at Mr. Champollion's success: my life seems indeed to be lengthened by the accession of a junior coadjutor in my researches, and of a person too, who is so much more versed in the different dialects of the Egyptian language than myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Comparing {{the game}} to Super Metroid, GameSpot thought that Metroid Fusion offered that game's best qualities {{packaged}} in a new adventure. Nintendo Power heralded it as {{a return to the}} classic Metroid action gameplay style. The [...] "perfect" [...] controls were praised by Electronic Gaming Monthly, concluding its review by claiming [...] "all games <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> this good." [...] The game did not feel new to GameSpy, which complained that even the final enemy encounter draws heavy inspiration from Super Metroid. GameZone found that the small screen was a poor environment in which to play Metroid Fusion, but they ultimately still found it an exciting game.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, Elliott {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} at the University of Iowa under its head coach, Forest Evashevski, another former All-American at the University of Michigan. [...] On being hired at Iowa, Elliott said, [...] "I <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> at home back in the Big Ten. [...] I grew up in Bloomington – 40 miles from Illinois. [...] I played at Purdue and Michigan and coached at Michigan. [...] My father went to Iowa and Northwestern and now I’m coaching at Iowa." [...] He stayed at Iowa until 1957. [...] Elliott was with the Hawkeyes in 1956 when they went 9–1, won the Big Ten championship, and defeated his former team, Oregon State, 35–19, in the 1957 Rose Bowl game.|$|E

500|$|As an instinctive conservative, Waugh {{believed}} that class divisions, with inequalities {{of wealth and}} position, were natural and that [...] "no form of government [...] ordained by God as being better than any other". In the post-war [...] "Age of the Common Man", he attacked socialism (the [...] "Cripps–Attlee terror") and complained, after Churchill's election in 1951, that [...] "the Conservative Party have never put the clock back a single second". Waugh never voted in elections; in 1959, he expressed a hope that the Conservatives would win the election, which they did, but would not vote for them, saying [...] "I <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> I was morally inculpated in their follies" [...] and added: [...] "I do not aspire to advise my sovereign in her choice of servants".|$|E
500|$|Emily Dickinson is now {{considered}} a powerful and persistent figure in American culture. Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet. As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that [...] "If nothing else {{had come out of}} our life but this strange poetry, we <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it." [...] Critic Harold Bloom has placed her alongside Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot, and Hart Crane as a major American poet, and [...] listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.|$|E
500|$|The team {{felt that}} Sarah's {{physical}} appearance <b>should</b> <b>feel</b> authentic, displaying {{her relationship with}} Joel, while simultaneously establishing her as a distinct character. They aimed to establish the character as [...] "a down-to-earth girl who shares many qualities with Ellie". On the relationship between Joel and Sarah, Hayes felt that they are [...] "more like best friends than father and daughter", citing their playfulness and humor with each other. Hayes felt intimidated during her audition, due to her inexperience with video game performances. She {{found it difficult to}} perform lines in the recording studio, preferring to perform them with the body movements; she believed that the latter felt more natural. To perform Sarah's death, Hayes forced herself to remember and experience previous moments in her life, such as her grandfather's death.|$|E
