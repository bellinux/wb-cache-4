25|$|Pioneer newspaperman John Houston {{arrived in}} South Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was {{published}} on November 6th, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. John's articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> printing press and worked on the newspaper.|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 1882, at {{his house}} in Ville d'Avray, near Sèvres, he died from {{intestine}} or stomach cancer. Even though he was wounded a month earlier from an accidental revolver discharge, the injury had not been life-threatening. Five artists, Jules Bastien-Lepage, a realist painter, Antonin Proust, defensor of the vanguard who Gambetta had named Minister of Beaux-Arts, Léon Bonnat, an academic painter, Alexandre Falguière, who did his mortuary mask, and his personal photographer Étienne Carjat all <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> death-bed, making five widely different representations of him which were each published by the press the following day. His public funeral was on 6 January 1883.|$|E

500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, , Dylan {{describes}} first encountering Grossman at the Gaslight cafe: [...] "He {{looked like}} Sydney Greenstreet {{from the film}} The Maltese Falcon, had an enormous presence, always dressed in a conventional suit and tie, and he <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> corner table. Usually when he talked, his voice was loud like the booming of war drums. He didn't talk so much as growl." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{recognition}} of his services to the Australian Veterinary Association, he was elected a Fellow. His Fellowship citation in 1959 stated that [...] "through his work and writings, through the many students who have <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet and by his willingness at all times to extend help and friendship to his colleagues, Mr. Gordon has attained a worldwide reputation both as a parasitologist and for his personal qualities".|$|E

Brown ordered three guns to be unshotted for that purpose, and about ten the next morning the ship Jackal began to salute, but on coming to the third gun it was discovered to be primed. So the apron of the fourth firearm was taken off which was fired and being shotted with round and grape shot, it pierced the side of the Lady Washington and killed Capt Kendrick as he <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> table, and killed and wounded many upon the deck." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{experimental}} line, with a sixth return wire, was run {{between the}} Euston terminus and Camden Town station of the London and North Western Railway on 25 July 1837. The actual distance {{was only one}} and a half-mile (2.4km), but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length. It {{was late in the}} evening before the trial took place. Mr Cooke was in charge at Camden Town, while Mr Robert Stephenson and other gentlemen looked on; and Wheatstone <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> instrument in a dingy little room, lit by a tallow candle, near the booking-office at Euston. Wheatstone sent the first message, to which Cooke replied, and 'never' said Wheatstone, 'did I feel such a tumultuous sensation before, as when, all alone in the still room, I heard the needles click, and as I spelled the words, I felt all the magnitude of the invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Short {{died at the}} Gilbert House in Geuda Springs on September 8, 1893. The {{local paper}} {{reported}} that: [...] "Luke Short died at the Gilbert this morning of dropsy. The remains were embalmed by W.A. Repp today and will be shipped this evening to Ft. Worth, Tex. The remains will accompanied by the wife and two brothers of the deceased." [...] Just two days before Short's death, while Hattie <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> bedside in Kansas, word arrived {{that her mother had}} died in Fort Worth. A Dodge City newspaper belatedly printed a dispatch from Fort Worth which stated that [...] "two days ago his mother-in-law died and the two funerals will take place here at the same time." [...] Death had already claimed two of Hattie's sisters and her father. Now her mother and her husband had died just forty-eight hours apart. She had suffered an unusual amount of early death in her family, and found herself a widow at 29 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Dwight owns an {{impressive}} array of weaponry. In addition to Laser Tag and paintball equipment, he has a crossbow range at his farm ("Office Olympics") and, when he was named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch, hinted that he might bring a bo staff to work. He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including pepper spray, nunchucks, throwing stars, a stun gun, a boomerang, handcuffs, a nightstick, a pair of brass knuckles and a Chinese sword, all of which were confiscated by Toby. Dwight also claimed to have <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk for an entire day with a spud gun, without any difficulty from Security. Dwight also uses a real gun, a Colt Anaconda, fired within city limits, to start off the race in [...] "Fun Run". In [...] "Branch Wars", he produces a disturbing number of Molotov cocktails for a panty raid on Utica. In [...] "Survivor Man", it is revealed that Dwight still has numerous knives (and other weapons) hidden on himself (as in [...] "Stress Relief", there is a knife strapped to his leg) or strategically positioned throughout the office (such as [...] "Mr. A Knife" [...] in a filing cabinet, twin sais behind a water cooler, a sword in a ceiling tile, a blow dart in a bathroom stall, and a compound bow under a couch), and that he owns a [...]22 rifle with scope. Also, in this episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness, being able to provide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through the scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself, although {{it is not clear whether}} the mushrooms Michael started to ingest were actually poisonous.|$|E

2500|$|John Houston {{arrived in}} Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and bought {{property}} in South Fort George and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. In 1909, South Fort George was a First Nations village, a sawmill and a Hudson's Bay Store. Less than a dozen new residents lived in the infant town-site in tent shacks. [...] The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, John's favorite villain, was still far away: not even across the Alberta/BC border on the eastern end of construction, and the construction from the western end at Prince Rupert had just begun. John's South Fort George articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> printing press and worked on the newspaper. Nevertheless, whether there was little news to report or not, John was a busy man from November 1909 to March 1910. He responded to approximately 300 letters a month, written mostly by parties interested in purchasing land in the area, and he was working on formulating a platform for the Liberal Party. In March 1910, the work and excessively cold caught up with him and John contracted pneumonia and was pulled on a toboggan down the Blackwater Trail to the Quesnel hospital by his friend and fellow pioneer settler, William J Cooke. John died on March 8 at the hospital in Quesnel, but not before he got a chance to read his own obituary, one printed in error by the Vancouver Province. His nurse, knowing his sense of humor, showed him the article, and he supposedly joked that he respected the paper and that they didn't need to make a correction because he was planning on making good on their story. John was laid to rest in Nelson, where there is a memorial in his honor.|$|E
2500|$|John's [...] "joy {{became more}} {{for him the}} more he was diminished. … This was John, {{and this is how}} the single {{individual}} is to fulfill something similar in lesser situations. If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we all know how to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has lost his mind or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil only yesterday <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was kind enough to set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And yet, how strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
