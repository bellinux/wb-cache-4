40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{the project}} to improve the {{mechanical}} dewatering of sewage sludge by freezing. The dewatering of sewage sludge to high contents of dry solids is prohibited by the water trapped within the cells of the sludge. By freezing the cell water can be released partly due to osmotic effects and damages of the cell walls. Three types of sludge were investigated: aerobically and anaerobically <b>stabilized</b> <b>sludge</b> and not <b>stabilized</b> <b>sludge.</b> After the conditioning by freezing the content of dry solids could be raised with the same dewatering device from 25 % to 40 % by weight for not <b>stabilized</b> <b>sludge,</b> from 33 % to 45 % for the aerobically <b>stabilized</b> <b>sludge</b> and from 42 % to 60 % for the anaerobically <b>stabilized</b> <b>sludge.</b> That means for all sludges that the quantity of water to be evaporated in a following drying process is reduced by about 50 %. Therefore important energy savings are possible but the realization of the sludge conditioning by freezing as a continuous process is impeded mainly by the very low freezing velocity of about 1 mm/h, necessary for the reported improvements.

For TAD-MAD process, SCOD and VFA could rapidly reach to the highest values 16000 mg/L and 7222 mg/L at initial 2 d respectively, which achieved more significant effect on cell lysis.

The sludge from the wastewater treatment plant in textile units is considered hazardous as it is often contaminated with heavy metals of dyestuffs and chemicals. Currently, land filling is the most common practice for textile sludge disposal. Leaching of heavy metals from textile sludge is a growing concern in Bangladesh. This study attempts to find out an environment-friendly solution for the management of the textile sludge. In this study, sludge samples were collected from treatment plants of various textile units located at Savar, Gazipur and Narsingdi. An electric incinerator was designed, fabricated and installed for the incineration of textile sludge. The sludge samples were incinerated at 5000 C, 7000 C and finally at 8000 C for different time intervals. The volume reduction of the sludge samples was nearly 80 % at 8000 C. The incineration techniques were used for volume reduction and destruction of the hazardous elements. The oven dried samples were powdered and mixed at various proportions (0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 %) with clay for making the ceramic products and also mixed with sand, cement and aggregates for making blocks for the stabilization of heavy metals in sludge.

After each pretreatment the polyphenols concentration were evaluated against nopretreated mixture. The best results were obtained with salts additions (FeCl 3 and CaCO 3) which make the simultaneous actions of reducing the polyphenols concentration by flocculation phenomena and increasing the biodegradation of recalcitrant ligno-cellulosic material...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis on}} the {{processing}} of sewage sludge in waste to energy applications contains a description of sludge material properties (density, specific heat capacity and dynamic viscosity), and is, in its main chapters, devoted to sludge disintegration for improved dewatering and the experimental study of emissions produced in incineration, where the influence of alkali addition was examined. The incineration of dried sludge was done in a fluidized bed reactor {{and the production of}} air emissions and distribution of heavy metals was studied. The thermo-chemical disintegration of <b>stabilized</b> sewage <b>sludge,</b> elaborated in the second main chapter, aims at reducing the water content of sludge after dewatering. Experiments conducted in laboratory-scale aimed at identifying a suitable temperature level, required dosage of chemical agent. In the following, a basic economical evaluation is described, where the savings are determined from savings in sludge disposal...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of treated and <b>stabilized</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> to soils {{has been shown}} to be a viable disposal alternative, since costs are low and cause no negative impacts, but contribute to the restoration of the original characteristics of some degraded soils. This experiment was carried out in Mogi Guacu, State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) to evaluate the effect of doses (0, 20, 40, and 80 Mg ha(- 1)) of an organic compost of sewage sludge and grass residues on the recovery of a humusless soil, in particular on the soil physical properties and revegetation with native species. It was found that closes of sewage sludge compost did not change the soil physical properties at the site under study and the plant height and diameter of the chosen reforestation Species were not influenced by increasing doses of sewage sludge compost applied to humusless soil, regardless of the succession group...|$|R
30|$|The Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) {{produces}} ~ 800 – 1, 000  kg of {{treated sewage}} sludge per day at its Manchinchi {{wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP). The biosolids are used for land application purposes although the contaminant and pathogen composition {{and quality of the}} biosolids have been unknown until this study. Zambia does not have legal standards and guidelines for biosolids management or application. The Manchinchi plant in Lusaka suffers from constant breakdowns such that the effectiveness of the plant to produce quality grade biosolids for land application use is questionable. In peri-urban areas, the problem of poor sanitation is being addressed using different technologies including urine diversion ecosan toilets. The effectiveness of ecosan toilets to <b>stabilize</b> faecal <b>sludge</b> has not been assessed in Zambia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to stabilize and characterize the biosolids from Manchinchi plant and ecosan toilets. Stabilization was done by use of drying beds and irradiation. The parametres that were used for characterization were microbiological, parasitological and heavy metals.|$|R
