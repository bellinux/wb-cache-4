40|$|LecturePg. 101 - 110 The {{design and}} {{application}} of solid couplings combined with flexible quill shafts for high speed turbocompressors are presented. Solid couplings are rigid in the axial direction. They transmit any residual thrust from one compressor casing to another, and even into the gear. A single thrust bearing then positions the complete rotor train. Elimination of individual thrust bearings results in a smaller lube-oil system and a reduced power loss. Any additional thrust components from a prestressed flexible-disc coupling or a gear-type coupling (gear lock) are completely avoided. The use of a flexible intermediate shaft (quill shaft) gives the <b>solid</b> <b>coupling</b> the same lateral flexibility as for a geartype or flexible-disc coupling. Criteria for allowable misalignment are given in this paper. A <b>solid</b> <b>coupling</b> is neither exposed {{to any kind of}} wear nor endangered by corrosion or stress corrosion so that no maintenance is necessary. Couplings have a decisive influence on rotordynamics. The conventional arrangement of a multicasing train with gear-type or flexible-disc couplings incorporates individual thrust bearings located outboard of the journal bearings (long shaft over hangs). Introducing solid couplings leads to a stiffer rotor by eliminating individual thrust bearings. A comparison of critical speeds of a high-speed/high-power compressor train is made alternatively equipped with solid couplings, flexible-disc or gear-type couplings. The response of the different rotors and couplings to specified unbalance weights is calculated and compared throughout the complete speed range. Torsional and lateral critical frequencies can easily be influenced by modification of intermediate shafts, even after installation of a compressor train. Operating experience on nearly 1500 compressors equipped with solid couplings have proven their excellent reliability especially on high speed, high power turbocompressor applications...|$|E

The two {{components of the}} disk, gas treated with grid hydrodynamics and solids treated as superparticles, are mutually coupled by drag forces. We find that the initially laminar equilibrium flow spontaneously develops into turbulence in our unstratified local model. Marginally <b>coupled</b> <b>solids</b> (that <b>couple</b> to the gas on a Keplerian time-scale) trigger an upward cascade to large particle clumps with peak overdensities above 100. The clumps evolve dynamically by losing material downstream to the radial drift flow while receiving recycled material from upstream. Smaller, more tightly <b>coupled</b> <b>solids</b> produce weaker turbulence with more transient overdensities on smaller length scales. The net inward radial drift is decreased for marginally coupled particles, whereas the tightly coupled particles migrate faster in the saturated turbulent state. The turbulent diffusion of solid particles, measured by their random walk, depends strongly on their stopping time and on the solids-to-gas ratio of the background state, but diffusion is generally modest, particularly for tightly <b>coupled</b> <b>solids.</b> Angular momentum transport is too weak and of the wrong sign to influence stellar accretion.

The main mechanical integral formulations for solid or viscous liquids are briefly recalled: classical Eulerian, Eulerian with a characteristic function, updated Lagrangian and arbitrary Euler Lagrange, with some comments on the finite element discretization using a mixed formulation and mini tetrahedral elements. The crucial remeshing issues are analyzed for non steady-state processes with different levels of sophistication: Updated Lagrangian for solids, or Euler and a characteristic function, possibly combined with error estimation and adaptivity.

However, gas <b>solid</b> <b>coupling</b> and the corresponding fluid flow solver remain immature. In this work, we propose a modified lattice Boltzmann approach to consider the effect of both the local solid volume fraction and the local relative velocity between particles and fluid, which {{is different from the}} traditional volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A time-driven hard sphere algorithm is combined to simulate the motion of individual particles, in which particles interact with each other via hard-sphere collisions, the collision detection and motion of particles are performed at constant time intervals. The EMMS (energy minimization multiscale) drag is coupled with the lattice Boltzmann based discrete particle simulation to improve the accuracy. Two typical fluidization processes, namely, a single bubble injection at incipient fluidization and particle clustering in a fast fluidized bed riser, are simulated with this approach, with the results showing a good agreement with published correlations and experimental data. The capability of the approach to capture more detailed and intrinsic characteristics of particle fluid systems is demonstrated. The method can also be used straightforward with other solid phase solvers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} multiscale methods for slowly varying porous media, fluid and <b>solid</b> <b>coupling,</b> and application to geomechanics. The thesis {{consists of three}} closely connected results. We outline them and their relation. First, we derive a homogenization result for Stokes flow in slowly varying porous media. These results are important for homogenization in deformable porous media. Traditionally, these techniques are applied to periodic media, however, {{in the case of}} Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) slowly varying domains occur naturally. We then develop a computational methodology to compute effective quantities to construct homogenized equations for such media. Next, to extend traditional geomechanics models based primarily on the Biot equations, we use formal two-scale asymptotic techniques to homogenize the fully coupled FSI model. Prior models have assumed trivial pore scale deformation. Using the FSI model as a fine-scale model, we are able to incorporate non-trivial pore scale deformation into the macroscopic equations. The primary challenge here being the fluid and solid equations are represented in different coordinate frames. We reformulate the fluid equation in the fixed undeformed frame. This unified domain formulation is known as the Arbitrary Lagrange-Eulerian (ALE). Finally, we utilize the ALE formulation of the Stokes equations to develop an efficient multiscale finite element method. We use this method to compute the permeability tensor with much less computational cost. We build a dense hierarchy of macro-grids and a corresponding collection of nested approximation spaces. We solve local cell problems at dense macro-grids with low accuracy and use neighboring high accuracy solves to correct. With this method we obtain the same order of accuracy as we would if we computed all the local problems with highest accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{methods have}} been widely used in civil {{engineering}} for the non-destructive evaluation of the concrete structures. Measurements of the velocity of the ultrasonic wave in concrete can be used to assess the quality of the concrete. As the concrete is a heterogeneous multiphase material which is acoustically inhomogeneous, propagation of ultrasonic waves through it will be a complex process comparing to other solid materials. This thesis involved testing the hypothesis, suggested by previous studies using ‘non-contact’ apparatus, that a coupling effect might exist between the ultrasound wave and the constituent materials of concrete. The velocity of sound in concrete samples measured by the traditional ultrasonic pulse velocity testing apparatus (PUNDIT), different coupling media of varying acoustic impedance was placed between the transducers and concrete. The coupling effect was evaluated in terms of the couplant used, compressive strength, aggregate content and maximum size of coarse aggregate. Analysis of variances (ANOVA) was performed to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the measurements recorded using a conventional system and a coupled system. In accordance with the experimental results, coupling materials {{have an effect on the}} pulse velocity measured in a given concrete. The effect varies depending on the material used. The UPV measurements with <b>solid</b> <b>coupling</b> were higher than those from the liquid coupling at all strength levels. For concrete with a specific w/c, the pulse velocity increased as the aggregate content increased. The conventional and rubber tests showed more sensitivity to the changes in aggregate content than the liquids tests. When the aggregate content is constant, concretes with larger MAS generally yielded higher pulse velocities than those with smaller MAS. In the coupling tests, the UPV measurements were more affected by the couplant used than the change in MAS of the mix. While the rubber test showed significant differences between the measurements of the two MAS at each strength level, the propanol test recorded approximately similar values for both MAS at all compressive strength levels. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh-resolution {{borehole}} strainmeters {{are usually}} installed in tectonically active regions {{in order to}} detect slow-slip events, and to estimate slow transients related to earthquake swarms. However, they are also sensitive to other numerous influences, internal or external. Furthermore, {{the quality of their}} coupling to the rock through cementation, and the mechanical properties of the rock mass around them, have a critical influence on their records. Many of the existing strainmeters present such problems, and the correction for these effects often remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the analysis of the records of a high-resolution borehole dilatometer (Sacks–Evertson), located in the seismically active rift of Corinth (Greece) (station TRZ in the Trizonia island). We show that the instrument suffers from an only partial-solid coupling, and that the nearby sea tides have a direct (through elastic response) and indirect (through pore-pressure diffusion) effect on the dilatation signal, which adds up to the solid tidal strain source. We propose a methodology that allows, in a first step, to better separate the internal (solid tide) from the external (air pressure, sea level) influences, by calculating a frequency-dependent transfer function outside the range of the tidal periods. We then extrapolate this function, in particular at the tidal periods. In a second step, the resulting variation with frequency of the coupling coefficients with sea level led us to estimate the proportion of instrument not solidly cemented to rock (thus in contact with water pore pressure), which is about 90 % of the total height. Despite the small proportion of <b>solid</b> <b>coupling,</b> the sensor resolution remains very good up to a few tens of hours of a time period, thanks to the confining effects of the rocks on the local pore pressure. These results allow us to correct for the external effects, and reduce the associated variance by 80 – 90 % (in the period range of minutes to days). The empirical correction of the sea level effect could be explained using a simple Boussinesq’s approximation and 1 D pore-pressure diffusion model, which contributed to better constraint of some of the poro-elastic parameters {{in the vicinity of the}} instrument. After correction, the solid tidal signal at the 24 -h period is almost anti-correlated with those of the theoretical solid tide. This surprising result is consistent with a similar anti-correlation observed for the longest period surface waves (200 s) comparing the TRZ dilatometer signals to the strain measured by a nearby borehole strainmeter (MOK, 15 km). This could be related to the presence of a shallow fault close to the instrument, which would creep in response to seismic wave-related stress...|$|E
