40|$|This {{white paper}} {{examines}} {{the transformation of}} public spaces through free Wi-Fi services offered by Australian cultural institutions and municipalities. Australian public institutions have been slower to offer free Wi-Fi services compared to their counterparts in Europe and the United States. Nevertheless, public institutions are beginning to discover a variety benefits in offering Wi-Fi. These include: enriching community life; enhancing public safety; providing marketing and communications portals; servicing city employees and sensors; and, most prominently, enhancing local economies by attracting more visitors. This white paper finds that Wi-Fi services can enhance public spaces by adding to their vibrancy and atmosphere. Wi-Fi services also provide a valuable digital resource for different mobile users, including out-of-office workers and travellers. However, Wi-Fi services should not be launched indiscriminately. Poorly thought out services can also support uses that isolate groups of users and prevent cross-group mingling in public space. Despite the potential benefits, many public institutions are deterred from offering attractive Wi-Fi services due to cost {{and a lack of}} ‘digital culture’ in local government. Institutions are also concerned that next generation mobile broadband services will make Wi-Fi hotspots redundant, a position this report argues against. As online access becomes increasingly integrated into social life, these stances will need to be reconsidered. This white paper recommends that: •    The benefits of Wi-Fi in public space are better conveyed to public institutions through educational initiatives. •    Public institutions consider the different network and business models available to subsidise the cost of a service. In so doing, institutions {{should be aware of the}} positive and negative aspects of privatising public space and spectrum, especially when it comes to control over amenities which service the public good. •    Institutions can learn from successful service models that focus on ‘user-centric’ service and consider the different positive ‘place-attributes’ described in this research. •    Institutions explore positive models for providing or <b>seeding</b> <b>services</b> that enable cross-group social interactions...|$|E

Despite scientific findings about the correlation between the quality of seeds and the quality of crops they produced, commercial seed handlers continued to sell poor-quality seed. In 1923, about 150 farmers met in Richmond, Virginia, to take steps to remedy the situation. These 150 farmers, calling their cooperative Virginia <b>Seed</b> <b>Service</b> (VSS), found that pooling their resources enabled them to procure seeds better suited to Virginia's growing conditions.|$|R

30|$|Evidences in {{literature}} {{suggest that a}} key motivation leading to off-farm labour supply among farm households in both the developed and the developing country has been the desire to have a diversified sources of income and manage risk (Chang and Mishra ([2008]). Hazell and Hojjati ([1995]) as well as Chavas, et al., ([2005]), among others, have also reported that given the very weak capital market in most developing countries, many farm households in the often resort to off-farm work to raise cash {{with a view to}} relaxing their cash flow and liquidity constraints. This view is supported by evidences in Stampini and Davis ([2009]) as well as Pfeiffer, et al. ([2009]) that reported that households engaged in off-farm activities were able to spend significantly more on <b>seeds,</b> <b>services,</b> hired labour, and livestock inputs, which confirms that off-farm income relaxes credit constraints in agriculture.|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of species to track shifting climates {{into the future}} will strongly influence outcomes for biodiversity under a rapidly changing climate. However, we know remarkably little about the dispersal abilities of most species and how these {{may be influenced by}} climate change. Here we show that climate change is projected to substantially reduce the <b>seed</b> dispersal <b>services</b> provided by frugivorous vertebrates in rainforests across the Australian Wet Tropics. Our model projections show reductions in both median and long-distance seed dispersal, which may markedly reduce the {{capacity of}} many rainforest plant species to track shifts in suitable habitat under climate change. However, our analyses suggest that active management to maintain the abundances of a small set of important frugivores under climate change could markedly reduce the projected loss of <b>seed</b> dispersal <b>services</b> and facilitate shifting distributions of rainforest plant species...|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic {{activity}} is driving population declines and extinctions of large-bodied, fruit-eating animals worldwide. Loss of these frugivores {{is expected to}} trigger negative cascading effects on plant populations if remnant species fail to replace the <b>seed</b> dispersal <b>services</b> provided by the extinct frugivores. A collapse of seed dispersal may not only affect plant demography (i. e., lack of recruitment), but should also supress gene flow via seed dispersal. Yet little empirical data still exist demonstrating the genetic consequences of defaunation for animal-dispersed plant species. Here, we first document a significant reduction of seed dispersal distances along a gradient of human-driven defaunation, with increasing loss of large- and medium-bodied frugivores. We then show that local plant neighbourhoods have higher genetic similarity, and smaller effective population sizes when large seed dispersers become extinct (i. e., only small frugivores remain) or are even partially downgraded (i. e., mediumsized frugivores providing less efficient seed dispersal). Our results demonstrate that preservation of large frugivores is crucial to maintain functional <b>seed</b> dispersal <b>services</b> and their associated genetic imprints, a central conservation target. Early signals of reduced dispersal distances that accompany the Anthropogenic defaunation forecast multiple, cascading effects on plant populationsPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the organization}} of the rice seed sector in Guinea with the overall objectives to assess how organizational settings affect seed supply to small-scale farmers and to suggest institutional changes that would favour <b>seed</b> <b>service</b> and uptake of varieties. Data were collected in Guinea, West Africa, using focus group discussions with extension workers, farmers, representatives of farmers’ associations, agro-input dealers, researchers and non-governmental organization (NGO) staff, and surveys of 91 rice farming households and 41 local seed dealers. Findings suggest that the current institutional settings and perceptions of stakeholders from the formal seed sector inhibit smallholder farmers’ access to seed. Seed interventions {{in the past two decades}} have mainly relied on the national extension system, the research institute, NGOs, farmers’ associations and contract seed producers to ensure seed delivery. Although local seed dealers play a central role in providing seed to farmers, governmental organizations operating in a linear model of formal seed sector development have so far ignored their role. We discuss the need to find common ground and alternative models of seed sector development. In particular we suggest the involvement of local seed dealers in seed development activities to better link the formal and the informal seed systems and improve smallholder farmers’ access to seed from the formal sector...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the nature and extent}} of the agricultural biotechnology R&D and innovations in Nigeria. Data were collected from the Directors, Heads of Crop Units and Research Scientists in the agricultural research institutes using structured and unstructured questionnaires and interview schedules. The data collected were analysed using frequencies, means and percentages. The study revealed that there were 48 researchers engaged in the various aspects of agricultural biotechnology R&D, in the research institutes considered. About 32. 9 % were females, 67. 1 % were males with mean ages of 38 and 39. 5 years, respectively. The majority, 53. 2 % of the researchers, possessed MSc qualifications with 46. 6 % specialising in conventional biotechnology. A total of 308 research outputs were recorded in all the research institutes. The most important motivation for embarking on these research projects was the need of the market (72. 1 %) and the existence of facilities (27. 9 %). The various bodies responsible for commercialisation of research results were the research institutes (83. 3 %), entrepreneurs (6. 7 %), the financial institutions, cooperative farmers and the National <b>Seed</b> <b>Service</b> (3. 3 %). Only two scientists possessed intellectual property rights and received royalties regularly. However, the majority did not patent their research results because of the lack of interest (45. 4 %), ignorance (32. 0 %) and the rigours of the procedure (32. 3 %). agricultural biotechnology; R&D; innovation; motivation; R&D commercialisation; intellectual property rights; patents; royalties; policy implications; Nigeria; research and development. ...|$|R
