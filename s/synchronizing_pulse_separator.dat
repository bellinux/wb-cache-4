40|$|The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has {{successfully}} operated an in-house developed powerline fault locator system since 1986. The BPA fault locator system consists of remotes installed at cardinal {{power transmission line}} system nodes and a central master which polls the remotes for traveling wave time-of-arrival data. A power line fault produces a fast rise-time traveling wave which emanates from the fault point and propagates throughout the power grid. The remotes time-tag the traveling wave leading edge as it passes through the power system cardinal substation nodes. A <b>synchronizing</b> <b>pulse</b> transmitted via the BPA analog microwave system on a wideband channel sychronizes the time-tagging counters in the remote units to a different accuracy of better than one microsecond.
