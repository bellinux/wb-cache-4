40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} {{characteristics}} of cargo extraction, the initial phase of airdrop process, a high fidelity and extendibility simulation model with uniform motion equations for all states during extraction is developed {{on the basis of}} dynamics methods and contact models between cargo and aircraft. Simulation results agree well with tests data. Cargo exit parameters, which contribute to cargo pitch after extraction, are studied. Simplified computation model of dimensionless exit time is developed and used to evaluate the relation between extraction phase and landing accuracy. Safe interval model is introduced to evaluate the safety of extraction process. Also, relations between initial parameters, including pull coefficient, aircraft pitch and CG coefficient, etc, and result parameters, including exit time, cargo <b>safety,</b> <b>pitch,</b> etc, are developed to help design of airdrop system. especially the selection of extraction parachute and cargo deployment...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides an}} improvement for a wind turbine (20) having {{at least one}} blade (21) mounted on a hub (22) for controlled rotation about a blade axis (yb-yb) to vary the pitch of the blade relative to an airstream. The hub is mounted on a nacelle (23) for rotation about a hub axis (xh-xh). The wind turbine includes a main pitch control system for selectively controlling the pitch of the blade, and/or a <b>safety</b> <b>pitch</b> control system for overriding the main blade pitch control system and for causing the blade to move toward a feathered position {{in the event of}} an overspeed or fault condition. The improvement includes: an energy storage device (26) mounted on the nacelle and associated with the blade; a pitch-axis controller (25) mounted on the nacelle and associated with the blade and with the energy storage device; an electro-mechanical actuator (28) mounted on the hub and associated with the blade; and at least one slip ring (29) operatively arranged to transmit power and/or data signals between the pitch-axis controller and the electro-mechanical actuator; whereby the mass on the rotating hub may be reduced...|$|E

50|$|He {{thought it}} best to land and {{selected}} a field on a stock farm near Whitney Point, New York. The field was knobbly, and the airplane bounced and turned a somersault. Sweet, having unbuckled his <b>safety</b> belt, was <b>pitched</b> against the cockpit wall, and killed by a head injury. Lt. Hoppin, belted in his seat, was unbruised. Sweet was buried at the Rural Cemetery at Phoenix, New York.|$|R

Next morning at daybreak Mr. Wallace started to the post-office, where he {{expected}} to find letters. Leonard and Juanna did not accompany him, but {{went for a walk}} before the sun grew hot. Then it was, as they walked, that a certain fact came home to them; namely, that they could not avail themselves of their host's kindness any longer, and, further, that they were quite penniless. When one is moving slowly across the vast African wilds, and living on the abounding game, love and kisses seem an ample provision for all wants. But the matter strikes the mind in a different light after the trip is done, and civilisation with its necessities looms large in the immediate future.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper uses {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} combined with sliding mesh and dynamic layering methods to study the dynamic ground effect of a UVA during the phase of takeoff. The research focused on longitude characteristics, such as lift, drag and pitching moment. Results showed that the aerodynamic force would vibrate acutely, which affected {{the stability of the}} UAV and the <b>safety</b> of takeoff. <b>Pitching</b> angle is the most important factor influencing the aerodynamic forces. Increase the pitching angle properly is benefit to the safety of takeoff operation...|$|R
50|$|In February 1913, {{however, the}} {{political}} unrest reached {{the capital of}} Mexico. In the Decena Tragica General Victoriano Huerta unseated President Madero and had him murdered. The German ambassador kept apprised of developments through his contacts with the other diplomats in the capital and through Felix Sommerfeld who stayed at the German embassy {{for most of the}} uprising. Von Hintze knew that a coup was about to happen. Rather than waiting for the military to make its move, the ambassador proposed for Madero to install Huerta as a successor, while he and his administration would retreat to <b>safety.</b> He <b>pitched</b> the idea first to Foreign Minister Pedro Lascuráin. Madero initially agreed but then relented. The coup happened and Madero was arrested. Von Hintze negotiated with American Ambassador Wilson as well as General Victoriano Huerta to secure the release and safe conduct of Madero and his family. He did not succeed. Despite General Huerta's assurances Madero and Pino Suárez were murdered.|$|R
5|$|Plastic seats {{replaced}} wooden benches in the West Stand in 1980 and in {{the following}} year, the club announced a deal with electronics company Pioneer Corporation with the stand expanded {{at a cost of}} around £1.3m, renamed as the Pioneer Stand and re-opened in 1983. However, the cost of building the stand meant the club had to sell players, and led to a decline in fortunes on the <b>pitch.</b> <b>Safety</b> barriers were removed from the North Stand in 1989 following the Hillsborough disaster and following the recommendations of the Taylor Report, the terraces in both the North and South stands were also converted to all-seating. The Pioneer Stand was renamed as the Britannia Stand following a new sponsorship deal with the building society in 1999, {{and in the}} following year a statue of Sir Alf Ramsey was unveiled at the corner of Portman Road and Sir Alf Ramsey Way.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on the 250 -passenger BWB {{configuration}}, {{the effect}} of the configuration of flap on BWB civil aircraft flight loading during takeoff and landing is studied by computational fluid dynamics. Flight loading varied with the flap deflection, area and the layout is discussed. It is shown the existence of flap makes the angle of attack smaller in takeoff and landing and aerodynamic forces and moment larger. In addition, it can change the loading distribution along span wise of the wing and affect the structural <b>safety.</b> Especially, increased <b>pitch</b> moment can make flight safety worse in takeoff and landing. In some cases, {{it is important that the}} function of flap is to improve the drag significantly and reduce the distance of taxiing to benefit to safety in landing. The airworthiness will have to be re-evaluated before the flaps are used in BWB on basis of the structural and flight safety considerations according to CCAR 25...|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} of new stadium concepts relevant aspects of planning are described with proven actual relations, created by a typological investigation of structures and use-specific organization. This is a basis, which is contentwise necessary, {{in order to be able}} to decide substantial initial parameters of a line of sight profile on grandstands. In that case at modern sports grounds or places of event "Sightlines and Safety" are inseparable In assistance of built examples and parameter studies, empirical investigations and a review on historical building defaults, the safety-relevant appropriate decision criteria are cleared up. In this way a planning instrument will be developped for sightline-construction, which qualifies the comfort of viewing accomodations. The requirements and technical recommendations to sports stadia changed in the process of the past decades very strongly. The desire for a higher comfort for the spectators and a better marketableness became clear defaults for new stadium designs. By the omission of many athletic careers the grandstand bodies move much closer to the pitch. This leads to the desired effect of closer atmosphere, but changes the viewing conditions for the spectators. The planning parameter "point of eye" or "C- value" become the quality standard with the evaluation of a grandstand. This is usually not further crucial in a Track and Field stadia, because of a sufficient distance of seating. By the increasing complexity of multi-functional use structures in stadium and arena the factors of influence become ever obscurer on the latest development of a modern grandstand, for example the issues of <b>safety</b> in <b>pitch</b> perimeter barriers of the "First row". Decisions and defaults from different responsibility ranges unnoticed interlink with diagram geometry of a sightline-profile. In a first step the building type is set into a historical context. The bases of seeing are described, the physics of the eye and the visual acuity criteria necessary for regarding. The moreover a sample person Modulor "EN" is being developed from the bases of the anthropometry. This way a contract-obligatory basis for a line of sight design can be represented by the overlay of historical proportion teachings, like the "golden section", with existing regulations and statistic data for body-measurements. In the next step an objective construction procedure for the sightline-determination is developed. Because of the past legislation C. E. N. Technical Commitees (TC's) defaults do not exist in a practice-relevant form to design a viewing accomodations and will not lead to its possible commitment of a qualitative comparison standard. In assistance by parameter studies within the calculation formula and empirical investigations on the examples built for the FIFA soccer World Cup 2006 in Germany, appropriate decision criteria are represented. In this connection the technical recommendations and requirements of important sports federations are analyzed and set with one another in relationship, in order to clear their dependence up and to make critical conclusions possible on the respective regulations. This work is to inform as a methodical decision basis and to serve as an optimizing planning instrument for the construction of stadia in {{the development}} of sightline-profiles for modern sports grounds or places of event...|$|R
