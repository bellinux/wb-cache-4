Due to its inherent variability,production of high-quality sawn timber demands adequate control of log conversion, which is feasible with computedtomography (CT) log scanning. Existing appearance grading rules for sawn timber might not fully reflect people’s visualperception of wood surfaces, and therefore, an alternative, more perception-oriented appearance classification could bebeneficial. An appearance classification of sawn timber based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) ofknot-pattern variables was developed and tested. Knot-pattern variables derived from images of board faces were used intraining PLS-DA models against an initial classification of the board faces previously established by aid of cluster analysis. Virtual board faces obtained from <b>simulated</b> <b>breakdown</b> of 57 CT-scanned Norway spruce logs were graded according tothe developed classification. Visual assessment of the grading {{results indicated that the}} classification was largely consistentwith human perception of board appearance. An initial estimation of the potential to optimize log rotation, based on CTdata, for the established appearance grades was derived from the simulations. Considerable potential to increase the yield ofa desired appearance grade, compared to conventional log positioning, was observed. Validerad; 2015; Nivå 1; 20141111 (olof) </p...|$|E
40|$|Modern sawmills are {{increasingly}} like process industries, running continuously with very large volumes {{flowing through the}} process every second. This fact makes it vital for every company to utilize its equipment and raw material as effectively as possible to maximize yield and value. The objective of this <b>simulated</b> <b>breakdown</b> study was to analyze the potential to increase volume yield in Swedish sawmills. While the commonly used horns-down position performs well on an average basis, {{the results show that}} the optimal rotation position for an individual log is most often found at another position. Results from extended simulations show that the average volume yield can be increased further by applying the optimal combination of rotation and parallel positioning in cant and deal saw. An increase in average volume yield by 4. 5 percentage points (8. 6 %) would enable a typical Swedish sawmill to produce a further 17, 300 m 3 of boards per year and thereby increase potential annual income by US$ 3. 7 million per year. This optimization concept requires a preevaluation of every log in order to define the optimal combination of settings. Some of these procedures must be performed online within a split second to accommodate production speed demands. Modern technology such as industrial x-ray in combination with traceability methods, multivariate models, breakdown simulation software, and high-performance computers enables evaluation and optimization of every log online at full production speed.

Currently, more than 80 % of ERA use is non-legal and non-emergency with a commensurate increase in exposure to risk. In addition there is evidence that stops can occur in the wrong place within ERAs which may have consequences for emergency vehicle access as well as the ability to leave the ERA safely and rejoin the carriageway. The aim of this driving simulator study was to evaluate drivers’ response and subjective evaluation of different ERAs designed to optimise their safe and effective use. Four design options were evaluated: 1) Low lit ERA at unlit motorway (night drive); 2) Unlit ERA at fully-lit motorway (night drive); 3) Small ERA format (total length reduced from 100 to 55 m); 4) Revised ERA design (alternative road markings and position of emergency phone). 72 participants were asked to drive three routes in which they experienced a <b>simulated</b> <b>breakdown</b> requiring them to stop in an ERA. This allowed for the evaluation of drivers’ ability to exit the motorway and drivers’ stopping position within the ERA. By repairing the simulated fault, drivers were subsequently asked to rejoin the carriageway which in turn allowed for the evaluation of factors such as gap acceptance and speed choice. It was shown that the specific ERA designs differently affected driving behaviour and the results are discussed in the context of road safety and network performance.

Carbon footprints were analysed using ISO 14040 Life Cycle Assessment guidelines, greenhouse gas emissions using a portable gas meter and physicochemical and enzyme assays using standard techniques, often based on soil or compost protocols in the absence of specific bioreduction methods. Whilst there is always room for vessel design improvement such as using solar energy and determining loading capacity to reduce foaming, the technology has repeatedly shown to reduce the volume of waste to be ultimately disposed and has gained favour within the livestock industries. Bioreduction has also shown to be biosecure in both laboratory and field settings and under both optimal and sub-optimal conditions.

40|$|With {{the current}} {{increasing}} demand for {{faster and more}} reliable communication and computing electronic devices such as faster wireless communication networks, circuit designers are forced to carry out device optimization {{in order to achieve}} the maximum possible performance. To enable full circuit optimization, designers depend on compact models for the different circuit elements; this means that the compact models for the individual elements need to be accurate and reliable in order to achieve the best possible performance under different bias and temperature conditions. For present day RF bipolar transistors, there is a trade-off between device speed and breakdown voltage, i. e., faster devices have got a lower breakdown voltage; this imposes a great difficulty in devices such as power amplifiers, which require both high currents and voltages. For this, circuit designers are forced to explore device operation beyond certain breakdown voltages. Thus, the need for reliable compact models {{that can be used to}} accurately simulate the transistor characteristics in the breakdown regime under different operation conditions. This thesis addresses the physical mechanisms that are relevant and significant to breakdown characteristics of present day industrial Si BJT's and SiGe HBT's. As is demonstrated in the thesis, the standard Mextram model version 504. 10, for example, actually is not capable of accurately simulating characteristics in the weak collector-base breakdown regime as a function of both bias and temperature, even though all appropriate temperature scaling rules, well established as they have been in the past for previous generations of semiconductor technology, appear to have been applied. This thesis analyses and resolves this inadequacy of Mextram. With respect to the physics involved, the key questions are: what are the mechanisms in this regime responsible for these misfits and how can they be addressed in order to achieve accurate model simulations? Addressing these questions formed the goal of this thesis. Between the introduction to the thesis provided in Chapter 1, and the overview of the conclusions and potential future prospects presented in Chapter 5, the thesis progresses as follows. In Chapter 2 an extraction method for base resistance (RB) and thermal resistance (RTH) of Si/SiGe bipolar transistors is presented. This method uses the measurements of the transistor characteristics in the weak collector-base breakdown regime, to accurately determine RB and RTH, by consistently accounting for the influence of self-heating and Early effect on the internal base-emitter voltage. Generally this method extends the category of the methods that utilizes the weak collector-base avalanche current to vary the base and collector currents independently of the emitter current, while eliminating voltage fluctuations across the emitter resistance by enforcing a fixed emitter current. The method was demonstrated on measured data taken on present day RF SiGe HBT's, and the corresponding results were compared with those from other earlier published extraction methods. By using the simulated data of the standard Mextram compact model as the input data of the method (instead of the measured data), we carried out a self-consistency check of the method; from the corresponding results, our extraction method yielded more accurate values for RTH than the earlier proposed methods. The RTH from this method is used later in Chapter 4 to take into account the influence of self-heating on the electrical characteristics in this weak collector-base breakdown regime. In Chapter 3, an extended review of the relevant and significant physical mechanisms that are responsible for the deviations between the measured family of weak breakdown characteristics and their simulated counterparts, as a function of both bias and temperature is carried out. Firstly, an extensive review of the physical mechanisms addressed by the Mextram compact model is undertaken. Secondly, a development of a physics-based compact model formulation of non-local avalanche effects in bipolar transistors and their temperature dependencies is carried out. The physical basis of this non-local avalanche model is the approximate energy balance equation and Chynoweth's empirical law for impact-ionization. The ionization coefficient as a function of the electron temperature, turned out to be a sharped peaked function about the maximum position. The approximate expression for the multiplication factor is attained by Taylor series expansion of the integral of ionization coefficient over epilayer width, in terms of the relative width of the function peak. With only two new model parameters, the final expression for the weak avalanche current turned out to be explicit in nature and in terms of elementary function, so it could easily be implemented in existing full compact bipolar transistor models. A compact formulation suitable for industrial applications of this non-local avalanche model was also derived and it accurately approximates the original formulation for low and intermediate collector currents, but it suppress the avalanche current for high collector currents. Using the existing Mextram model electric field distribution, the Mextram model was extended with the new non-local avalanche model; the resulting extended version of Mextram is physical in nature with only two new introduced model parameters, i. e., the relaxation length and its temperature coefficient. This extended model version is used to assess the relevant and significant physical mechanisms in the weak collector-base breakdown regime. Chapter 4 is devoted to an experimental assessment of the family of weak collector-base breakdown characteristics by employing the physical extended version of the Mextram model (with included the non-local avalanche compact model) derived in Chapter 3. Using the measurement data taken on present day Si/SiGe industrial bipolar transistors, we demonstrate that these observed breakdown characteristics are actually not just classical local/non-local avalanche characteristics as portrayed in most published literature, but other physical mechanisms are significant as well in this breakdown regime. We showed that these physical effects can actually be distinguished, and thus taken into account independently of avalanche effects. Here, we took advantage of the well developed physical basis of the Mextram compact model in addressing these effects, together with our extraction method for RTH developed in Chapter 2 to address self-heating effects on the measured electrical characteristics that significantly interfere in the weak collector-base breakdown regime. With these interfering physical effects well addressed, we demonstrated that the avalanche mechanism responsible for the deviations between the measured and <b>simulated</b> <b>breakdown</b> characteristics is non-local avalanche indeed, and with non-local effects adequately taken into account, accurate model fits to the measured characteristics taken on present day industrial Si/SiGe bipolar transistors are achieved as a function of both bias and temperature. Also with these physical effects adequately taken into account, the developed model (Mextram extended with our new non-local avalanche compact model) actually captures the presupposed underlying semiconductor device physics. Here, our extracted values for the electron energy relaxation length and its temperature coefficient, in actual industrial bipolar devices under normal forward bias conditions, are in agreement with earlier independent published values for these material coefficients. Though the relevant and significant physical mechanisms in the weak collector-base breakdown regime, each separately, have already been published in semiconductor device literature, and while most of them have been adopted in standard compact models for bipolar transistors, these effects cannot be used individually to address the deviations between the measured and simulated family of characteristics in this regime. All of them must be jointly taken into account in order to achieve accurate simulation of the characteristics in this breakdown regime; this is well demonstrated and verified in Chapter 4. Since the derived extended version of Mextram model is physical in nature, and the new model parameters are indeed material coefficients, with parameter values already available in published semiconductor device literature, the new compact model can be used to extract or verify model parameters representing other physical effects that interfere in the weak collector-base breakdown regime. Also the physical basis of the model can form a foundation for extension of the model to strong avalanche breakdown regime.

40|$|The {{research}} {{discussed in}} this report was conceived during our earlier attempts to <b>simulate</b> <b>breakdown</b> across a dielectric surface using a Monte Carlo approach. While cataloguing the various ways that a dielectric surface could affect the breakdown process, we found that one obvious effect [...] photoemission from the surface [...] had been ignored. Initially, we felt that inclusion of this effect could {{have a major impact}} on how an ionization front propagates across a surface because of the following argument chain: (1) The photon energy required to release electrons from a surface via photoemission is less than the photon energy required to ionize gas molecules directly. (2) The mean free path of a photon in gas is longer for low-energy photons than for high-energy photons. (3) Photoionization is a major effect in advancing the ionization front for breakdown in gas without a surface, therefore, we know that even high-energy photons can be released from the head of a streamer and propagate some distance through the gas. Our hypothesis, therefore, was that photons with energies near the threshold of photoemission could travel further in front of the streamer before being absorbed than higher-energy photons needed for photoionization, yet the lower-energy photons, with the help of the surface, could still create seed electrons for new avalanches. Thus, the streamer would advance more rapidly next to a surface than in gas alone. Additionally, the photoemission from the surface would add to the electrons in the avalanche and cause the avalanche to grow faster. After some study, however, we are forced to conclude that although photoemission does contribute to avalanche growth at fields near breakdown threshold, secondary electron emission causes electrons to stick to the surface and cancels out the growth due to photoemission. This conclusion assumes a discharge that occurs over a short period of time so that charging of the surface, which could alter its secondary electron emission characteristics, does not occur. This report documents the numerical work we did on investigating this effect and the experimental work we did on pre-breakdown phenomena in gas...|$|R

Macroscopically, this corresponds to the 'capacity drop' at the transition from free to congested traffic.

In a given water layer, the transport distances of eroded soil fractions, and thus {{that of the}} associated substances across landscapes, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and phosphorous, {{are determined by the}} settling velocities of the eroded soil fractions. However, using mineral size distribution to represent the settling velocities of soil fractions, as often applied in current erosion models, would ignore the potential influence of aggregation on the settling behaviour of soil fractions. The destructive effects of raindrops impacting onto aggregates are also often neglected in current soil erosion models. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a proxy method to effectively <b>simulate</b> aggregate <b>breakdown</b> under raindrop impact, and further identify the settling velocity of eroded sediment and the associated SOC. Two agricultural soils with different sandy and silty loam textures were subjected to rainfall using a raindrop aggregate destruction device (RADD).

The same mass amount of bulk soil of each soil type was also dispersed and sieved into the same six classes, to form a comparison in size distribution. The SOC content was measured for each settled and dispersed class. Our results show the following: (1) for an aggregated soil, applying dispersed mineral grain size distribution, rather than its actual aggregate distribution, to soil erosion models would lead to a biased estimation on the redistribution of eroded sediment and SOC; (2) the RADD designed in this study effectively captures the effects of raindrop impact on aggregate destruction and is thus able to simulate the quasi-natural sediment spatial redistribution; (3) further RADD tests with more soils under standard rainfall combined with local rainfalls are required to optimize the method...|$|R

Laser pulses with the energy of about 350 mJ/pulse and with a pulse width of 10 ns were used to deposit the energy in the region of interest. The dynamics of the interaction were captured in both the schlieren and shadowgraphs images taken at 500, 000 frames per second rates. In order to understand the complicated dynamics of the interaction between the thermal spot and its associated shockwave with the oblique shockwave from the model, computational calculations were performed. A two-dimensional, time-accurate Euler code was applied for this purpose. Good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results has been found. As expected, the laser-induced thermal spot indeed weakened the oblique shock. The images also show {{the dynamics of the}} interaction between shockwaves generated by the laser breakdown in the flow and the oblique shock, including reflections off the wedge body. The results from this near-field experiment can be used to optimize the energy addition for the practical applications including sonic boom reduction. A...|$|R

This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] Ethidium bromide {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which <b>simulates</b> the metabolic <b>breakdown</b> of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium bromide (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|R
40|$|Low energy plasmas and {{associated}} phase change and melt {{flow of the}} anode have been modeled using experiments and computational methods. Results were developed {{in the context of}} a sample application in microelectronic manufacturing, the Electronic Flame Off (EFO) process. ^ The experiments were performed in a scaled-up arc chamber that qualitatively reproduce the Electronic Flame Off (EFO) discharge at an enlarged length scale. Experiments involved the design and development of a PC-based control and data acquisition system. Results indicate that voidage increases and the heat affected zone decreases with increasing current. ^ The computational model consisted of two components: a low energy weakly ionized plasma model and a model for the phase change, flow and heat transfer in the anode. ^ The plasma model <b>simulated</b> the <b>breakdown</b> of a wire-to-plane gap and the subsequent discharge. The conservation equations for the electron and ion number densities, the electron temperature, and Gauss 2 ̆ 7 law for the self consistent electric field were solved simultaneously. The methodology to model geometrically complex domains with arbitrarily prescribed anode shapes was also developed. Results showed that intense charge sheaths are formed near the anode showing the strong influence of geometry on the discharge. A heat flux minimum was shown to exist at the neck of a spherically tipped anode. ^ The phase change and flow in the anode were modeled. Phase-change included melting during the discharge and solidification on termination of the discharge. The methodology to model the evolving shape of the melting anode has also been described. Next, the plasma model was coupled to the fluid mechanics/heat transfer model to provide a realistic simulation of the complete process. Results shown for the first time in this dissertation have indicated that the inter-electrode gap decreases and then increases as the melt at the anode tip rolls up due to surface tension. ^ The theory for modeling electric field effects on flames has been described along with a new self-consistent model. It has been shown that a widely prevalent theory for electric effects on flames is not self-consistent. Results from the new model indicated a smaller magnitude of the electric field effect. ...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceRidge {{culture is}} a special {{conservation}} tillage method, but the long-term influence of this tillage system on soil aggregate-size stability in paddy fields is largely unknown in southwest of china. The objectives of this paper are to evaluate soil aggregates stability and to determine the relationship between SOC and soil aggregate stability. Soil samples at 0 - 20 cm layer were adopted from a long-term (16 yr) field experiment including conventional tillage: plain culture, summer rice crop and winter upland crop under drained conditions (PUR-r), and conservation tillage: ridge culture without tillage, summer rice and winter fallow with floodwater layer annually (NTR-f), and winter upland crop under drained conditions (NTR-r), and wide ridge culture without tillage, summer rice crop and winter upland crop under conditions (NTRw-r), respectively. The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized {{in terms of their}} size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatments; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates > 0. 250 mm in size. WSMA and NMWD were applied to <b>simulate</b> the <b>breakdown</b> mechanisms of aggregates for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to slaking in paddy soil. The results showed that the amount of aggregates-size was greatly observed in the fraction of 2 ~ 6. 72 mm under ridge culture in paddy soil (more than 50 %) under slaking and capillary-wetting pretreatment. The proportion of soil macro-aggregates (> 0. 25 mm) in conservation tillage was greatly higher than that in conventional tillage under subsequent slaking treatment. Minimal differences of aggregate stability between slaking and wetting were observed, while {{significant differences were found between}} ridge culture and plain culture. The aggregates stability under slaking treatment ranked in the order of NTR-r>NTRw-r>NTR-f>PUR-r, while under wetting was NTRw-r>NTR-r>NTR-f>PUR-r, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the aggregates stability and SOC concentrations under wetting, and low correlation was observed under slaking pretreatment. Soil exposure with tillage and lack of rice/rape-seed stubble inputs caused declines in aggregation and organic carbon, both of which make soil susceptible to water erosion. Adoption of ridge culture with no-tillage integrated with crop rotation and stubble mulch significantly alter soil organic concentration, suggesting it was a valuable conservation practice for soil aggregation and soil organic carbon sequestration on paddy soil...|$|R
40|$|Vortex {{breakdown}} is {{an important}} phenomenon observed in swirling flows involving {{the development of a}} stagnation point on the axis of the vortex followed by a region of recirculation when the swirl increases beyond a particular level. It has been studied extensively over past 50 years and various theories have been proposed to explain its various aspects. However, a single model explaining all the aspects together is yet to emerge. Numerical simulations of breakdown have been performed using a variety of grid-based as well as vortex methods. Vortex methods are a Lagrangian alternative to grid-based methods wherein the motion of the vorticity is determined by the local fluid velocity convection, with models for viscous effects when considered. The fluid velocity is obtained from the vorticity field. Only the rotational regions of the flow need to be considered leading to significant economy of computational effort for simulations of vorticity dominated flows, such as vortex breakdown. The inviscid vortex filament method has been used to simulate several aspects of the vortex breakdown phenomenon. The vortex filament method however, cannot easily simulate viscous effects. To simulate the viscous effects the viscous vortex particle method needs to be used. This work was intended to be a first step towards this end by initially evaluating the effectiveness of the inviscid version of the vortex particle method in <b>simulating</b> the <b>breakdown</b> phenomenon. The inviscid vortex particle method was found to satisfactorily simulate most qualitative aspects involved in the formation of vortex breakdown such as the retardation of axial velocity along centerline, radial swelling of the vortex core, formation of stagnation points, creation of azimuthal vorticity gradient from axial vorticity gradient and the turning of vortex lines along with the formation of a bubble-like structure with recirculating flow within. The effect of a wall placed adjacent to the vortex core was simulated by using image vortices. The wall was not found to influence the location of breakdown. However, the initiation of the spiral mode was found to occur earlier when a wall was present. For a quantitative assessment, a simulation of the experimental results of Faler and Leibovich (1978) was attempted. The simulation managed to predict the location of the breakdown and the extent of the bubble. The shape and height of the bubble obtained however were not in accord with the experimental observations. A single vortical cell was obtained in the interior of the bubble...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to the modeling of sub-nanosecond partial discharge (PD) phenomena in high voltage cables is presented to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation method for modeling transients and their effects measured at a distance. FDTD modeling computes the three-dimensional electric and magnetic fields throughout the simulation volume. This numerically intensive process has the advantage that time-varying quantities such as voltages and conducted currents can be recorded at any position within the model. For modeling PDs in cables, a current source is introduced within the insulating medium and its time-domain waveform defined using digitally sampled data from an actual PD current pulse measurement. High frequency current transformers (HFCTs) are commonly used for on-site detection and location of PD in HV distribution cables. The HFCT itself cannot be modeled directly using FDTD because its geometrical detail is too small for the FDTD mesh. However, a hybrid model can be implemented by recording magnetic field values on path enclosing a conductor, applying Ampere's circuital law to determine the PD current and applying the responses of real HFCTs that have been characterized experimentally. The method for <b>simulating</b> localized insulation <b>breakdown</b> is presented, showing how this can be used to launch a PD pulse into a cable model and predict the output response of an HFCT some distance away. This process is illustrated through a parametric study of variations in the PD source parameters and by comparison of the data with the measured propagation properties of PD signals in an 11 kV EPR-insulated cable sample. Examples are also given in which the FDTD software is used to model time-domain reflectometry measurements that can be useful for locating damage within the same type of HV cable. Similar techniques could be applied to much larger insulation breakdown currents, for example, in gas switches...|$|R
30|$|With the {{development}} of computational geomechanics, numerical method based on continuous and discontinuous mechanics has been become a promising approach to study the shear behaviour of rock joints. Son et al. (2004) conducted elasto-plastic simulation of a direct shear test on rough rock joints using a finite element method (FEM) with a joint finite element of 6 -node and zero thickness. Their results reproduced salient phenomena commonly observed in actual shear test of rock joints, including the shear strength hardening, softening and dilation. Roosta et al. (2006) developed a visco-plastic multilaminate model to model the shear stress-shear displacement and normal displacement—shear displace of artificial joint specimen at constant normal load conditions. Liu et al. (2009) implemented the rock failure process analysis (RFPA) model (Tang 1997) into the finite element software package ABAQUS using its user subroutine UMAT interface to simulate the shearing process of a three-dimensional (3 D) rough rock joints {{on the basis of}} the interface modelling technique and found that a curved failure surface developed from the loading asperity and approximately intersected the trailing face of the asperity. Lin et al. (2012) used a continuum approach to simulate direct shear tests on flat and wave-like rock joints. A new methodology is proposed by Nguyen et al. (2014) to combine shear box testing and corresponding continuous mechanics—based numerical simulations with the natural joint roughness at the micro-scale taken into account. However, most numerical simulations of the shearing process of rough rock joints are conducted using discontinuous methods, especially the commercial discrete element method (DEM)—Particle Flow Code (PFC) developed by Itasca Consulting Group Inc. Cundall (1999) implemented a bounded particle model into PFC 2 D to model the nonlinear relation between peak shear strength and normal stress, and the dependence of the peak dilation angle on the normal stress in shearing rock joints and rough faults. Indraratna and Haque (2000) used PFC 2 D to simulate the shear behaviour of artificial regular rock joints. Guo and Morgan (2008) <b>simulated</b> the <b>breakdown</b> of fault blocks using PFC 2 D to study the frictional strength, mechanical behaviour and stress and strain rate of evolving fault gouge and their dependence on normal stress and uniaxial compressive strength. Park and Song (2009, 2013) carried out an extensive series of simulations for direct shear tests of rock joints using PFC 3 D to demonstrate the feasibility of reproducing a rock joint using the bonded particle model and examine the effect of the geometrical features and the micro-properties of a joint on its shear behaviour. Shrivastava et al. (2011) used PFC 2 D to simulate direct shear tests on rock joints with asperity inclinations of 15 ° and 30 ° at different normal stresses. Zhao (2013) implemented PFC 2 D to simulate single and multi-gouge particles in a rough fracture segment undergoing shear. Huang et al. (2014) simulated the dynamic direct-shear tests on the rough rock joints with 3 D both sinusoidal and random surface morphologies using the discrete element method. Bahaaddini et al. (2015) studied the shear behaviour of rock joints in a direct shear test using the particle flow code PFC 2 D taken into account the micro-scale properties of the smooth joint model.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} power sector of nation {{has given the}} {{opportunity}} to power engineers to protect the power equipment for reliable operation during their operating life. It has been seen from the several studies conducted by power engineers that one of the main problem in high voltage power (HV) equipment is the degradation of insulation i. e., quality of insulation of power equipment. As the high voltage power equipments are mainly subjected with spark over voltage causes by the lighting strokes, switching action, a protective device is used for determine the safe clearance required for proper insulation level. The sphere gaps are commonly used for measurements of peak values of high voltages and have been adopted by IEC and IEEE as a calibration device. Generally, the standard sphere gaps are widely used for protective device in electrical power equipments. The sphere gaps are filled up with insulating medium such as liquid insulation (transformer oil), and gas insulation (SF 6, N 2, CO 2, CCl 2 F 2 etc.) in HV power equipments. Normally, air medium is widely used as an insulating medium in different electrical power equipments as its breakdown strength is 30 kV/cm. Therefore electrical breakdown characteristic of small air gap under the different applied voltage has its great significance for the design consideration of various air insulated HV equipment. In addition, the effect of breakdown voltage on different insulation like lamiflex, leatheroid, plywood, craft paper, and polyester fiber has also been studied. To observe the effect on insulation due to breakdown mechanism, the insulation samples are collected both before and after breakdown voltage test and analysis has been done with the help of Scanning electron microscope (SEM). To <b>simulate</b> the air <b>breakdown</b> voltage with and without the insulation barrier has been studied experimentally in high voltage laboratory, a standard diameter of 25 cm spheres are used for measurement of air breakdown voltages and electric field of the high voltage equipments.

Finally, the experimental result has been compared with theoretical, and simulation results. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} description and benchmark {{evaluation of the}} tropospheric chemistry version of the global chemistry transport model TM 5 (Tracer Model 5, version TM 5 -chem-v 3. 0). A full description is given concerning the photochemical mechanism, the interaction with aerosol, {{the treatment of the}} stratosphere, the wet and dry deposition parameterizations, and the applied emissions. We evaluate the model against a suite of ground-based, satellite, and aircraft measurements of components critical for understanding global photochemistry for the year 2006. The model exhibits a realistic oxidative capacity at a global scale. The methane lifetime is ~ 8. 9 years with an associated lifetime of methyl chloroform of 5. 86 years, which is similar to that derived using an optimized hydroxyl radical field. The seasonal cycle in observed carbon monoxide (CO) is well simulated at different regions across the globe. In the Northern Hemisphere CO concentrations are underestimated by about 20 ppbv in spring and 10 ppbv in summer, which is related to missing chemistry and underestimated emissions from higher hydrocarbons, as well as to uncertainties in the seasonal variation of CO emissions. The model also captures the spatial and seasonal variation in formaldehyde tropospheric columns as observed by SCIAMACHY. Positive model biases over the Amazon and eastern United States point to uncertainties in the isoprene emissions as well as its chemical <b>breakdown.</b> <b>Simulated</b> tropospheric nitrogen dioxide columns correspond well to observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument in terms of its seasonal and spatial variability (with a global spatial correlation coefficient of 0. 89), but TM 5 fields are lower by 25 – 40 %. This is consistent with earlier studies pointing to a high bias of 0 – 30 % in the OMI retrievals, but uncertainties in the emission inventories have probably also contributed to the discrepancy. TM 5 tropospheric nitrogen dioxide profiles are in good agreement (within ~ 0. 1 ppbv) with in situ aircraft observations from the INTEX-B campaign over (the Gulf of) Mexico. The model reproduces the spatial and seasonal variation in background surface ozone concentrations and tropospheric ozone profiles from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre to within 10 ppbv, but at several tropical stations the model tends to underestimate ozone in the free troposphere. The presented model results benchmark the TM 5 tropospheric chemistry version, which is currently in use in several international cooperation activities, and upon which future model improvements will take place...|$|R
