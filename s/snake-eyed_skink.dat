50|$|Analysis of {{the stomach}} {{contents}} of certain Ablepharus species {{has led to the}} conclusion that common <b>snake-eyed</b> <b>skinks</b> are typically generalist predators. They mainly feed on small arthropods, mollusks, and small snails.|$|R
40|$|<b>Snake-eyed</b> <b>skinks</b> are {{relatively}} small lizards of the genera Panaspis and Afroablepharus. Along with closely-related scincid taxa, the allocation of these genera has been constantly rearranged based on morphology, ecology and biogeography. Members of these genera occur primarily in savanna habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa and include species that have highly conserved morphology, which poses a challenge for taxonomic studies. We sequenced two mitochondrial (16 S and cyt b) and two nuclear genes (PDC and RAG 1) from 91 Panaspis and Afroablepharus samples from various localities in eastern, central and southern Africa. Concatenated gene-tree and divergence dating {{analyses were conducted to}} infer phylogenies and biogeographic patterns. Molecular data sets revealed several cryptic lineages, with most radiations occurring during the mid-Miocene to Pliocene. We infer that rifting processes (including the formation of the East African Rift System) and climatic oscillations contributed to the expansion of savannas and precipitated cladogenesis in <b>snake-eyed</b> <b>skinks.</b> Species in Panaspis and Afroablepharus used in this study formed a monophyletic group, rendering Afroablepharus as synonymous to Panaspis. As a result, species previously assigned to Afroablepharus must be allocated to Panaspis or a different genus. Divergence estimates and cryptic speciation patterns of <b>snake-eyed</b> <b>skinks</b> were consistent with previous studies of other savanna vertebrate lineages from the same areas examined in this study. ...|$|R

50|$|Ablepharus is a genus of skinks that {{contains}} the common <b>snake-eyed</b> <b>skinks.</b> Their name refers {{to the fact that}} their eyelids have fused to a translucent capsule; as in snakes, they thus are physically incapable of blinking. They resemble small lizards and prefer to live in the leaf litter of dry fields and hills. Their scales give them a very shiny, bronze appearance with a characteristically dark stripe down the sides of their bodies. They prey on small insects and other small mollusks.|$|R
40|$|Arboreal {{reptiles}} {{are often}} difficult to capture because of their cryptic nature and propensity to flee out of reach when approached. In addition, arboreal lizards often seek refuge under loose or peeling tree bark; therefore researchers often remove it to catch them, thereby potentially damaging habitat. Using arboreal cover boards, or "artificial bark," might reduce damage to natural shelter sites, allowing repeated surveys. We compared capture success and population structure of samples obtained by two capture methods-active searches (visual encounter surveys [VES]) and arboreal cover boards used as artificial bark-on two species of arboreal lizards, Inland <b>Snake-eyed</b> <b>Skinks</b> (Cryptoblepharus australis) and Dubious Dtellas (Gehyra dubia). Two types of arboreal cover boards (cardboard and closed-cell foam) were strapped around the main trunks of trees with elastic straps. Systematic VES during the day (for Cryptoblepharus) and at night (for Gehyra) were conducted in conjunction with monitoring of arboreal cover boards. Diurnal VES for Cryptoblepharus had low capture success (17. 1 % of observed animals) compared to arboreal cover boards (49. 6 %). Nocturnal spotlight surveys for Gehyra resulted in {{a high number of}} observations, but low capture success (44. 9 % of observed animals) compared to arboreal cover boards (83. 5 %). There was no difference in the capture success between cover board materials. Using arboreal cover boards as artificial bark increased hand captures of arboreal lizards, and preserved natural bark shelters that would have otherwise been destroyed by peeling bark during visual encounter surveys...|$|R
