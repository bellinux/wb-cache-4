In medieval times there were important woad-growing regions in England, Germany and France. Towns such as Toulouse became prosperous from the woad trade.

Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed as data reduction method before applying hierarchical cluster analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was implemented as a non-hierarchical supervised pattern recognition method to build a classification model. In order to avoid broad-shaped interferences from the fluorescence background, the influence of 1 st and 2 nd derivatives on the classification was studied by using cross-validation.

The study dealt with colour removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction using an array of Pb/PbO 2 cylinders as anode and stainless steel screen as cathode in a batch recycle electrochemical unit. Operating variables such as current density, initial dye concentration, NaCl concentration, pH, and solution flow rate were investigated. The results indicate that complete decolourization and 88. 2 % COD reduction can be achieved under the optimum operating conditions. Kinetic study at different flow rates has shown that decolourization takes place through a first order diffusion controlled reaction. Energy consumption was calculated at different operating parameters.

The sources of natural bio-colorants for food coloring and styling primarily are, certain species of plants, animals and microorganisms. Considerable increment of public awareness {{about the use of}} synthetic color additives for food products has augmented in the use of natural food colorants. In 1991, Japanese food legislation on the statement of natural food additives on labels was enforced due to the several impacts on public health and, call to reliable methods, especially natural food colorants, in food products. Systematic researches make available bio-colorants such as, carotenoids [141, 142], anthocyanins [143, 144], betalains [145, 146], chlorophylls [147, 148], tannins [149], quinones [115, 150], biliproteins [151] etc. All, they have different auxochromic and chromophoric groups which directly or indirectly alters to produce different hues ranging from green through yellow, orange, red, blue, and violet, depending on the source of colorant [3, 116, 152]. Consequently, a great upsurge has been seen in biotechnological production of food grade pigments Colorants from microbial world such as fungi, bacteria and microalgae etc. are quite common in nature. Among the molecules produced are carotenoids, melanins, flavins, quinones and more specifically monascins, violacein, phycocyanin or <b>indigo.</b> <b>Synthetic</b> colors in limited quantities are permitted in various types of foods: fruit and vegetable products, hard-boiled confectioneries, bakery foods, instant foods, traditional Indian sweetmeats and other dairy products. However, synthetic colors are being replaced by natural colors in view of the health benefits as well as increased public awareness towards eco-preservation.|$|R

Several tests were performed to analyze the potential use of the Maya type pigments in coatings applications compared to those pigments that are already commercially available. Oil Absorption values for Maya type pigments were {{in the range of}} 62 – 68 g/ 100 g, while that for Copper Phthalocyanine blue was 61. 13 g/ 100 g and Ultramarine Blue was 42. 74 g/ 100 g. Specific gravity was 2. 29 and the critical pigment volume concentration was in the range of 37. 23 – 39. 42. K/S ratio for these pigments ranges from 0. 34 – 1. 08. The resistance of the Maya type pigments to acid rain was tested using simulated lab test called Kesternich test. Results show that the presence of calcium carbonate impurities affects the stability of Maya pigments to acid rain resulting in the formation of calcium sulfate. Resistance to ultraviolet light and moisture condensation were determined using a UV weathering chamber that simulates real weather conditions. Color difference values were recorded before and after exposure to the simulated weathering. Results of the exposure test on acrylic solvent based paints after 500 hours shows Maya type pigments have superior performance as compared to Ultramarine blue and slightly inferior performance as compared against Copper Phthalocyanine Blue. Water based Maya type paints show superior performance as compared to Ultramarine Blue and superior or comparable performance as compared to Copper Phthalocyanine.

40|$|Indigo is {{insoluble}} {{in water}} and most dyeing solvents. Hence, its use in textile coloration is achieved by alkaline reduction to a soluble leuco-compound and then applying this solution followed by oxidation. Printing with indigo on cotton commonly employs sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) as the alkali and sodium hydrosulphite (hydros) as the reducing agent. Caustic soda poses effluent disposal problems. Hydros rapidly loses potency by reacting with atmospheric oxygen during the printing / padding process. This causes premature oxidation of print paste and necessitates constant monitoring. Further, the degradation products of hydros pose effluent hazards. Hence, {{there is a constant}} search to find better alternatives in terms of chemical stability and effluent management. In the above context, the present research used thiourea dioxide (TUD) as a more stable reducing agent and sodium carbonate as a milder alkali.

Throughout the nineteenth century British India was the pre-eminent producer and supplier to the West of indigo for its thriving textile industry.
