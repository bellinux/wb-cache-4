At Marconi Electronic Systems the benefits of <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> connections to the MMIC are being explored.

The effect of the UBM and electroplating process of <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> on the shear strength of <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> was studied {{as well as the}} relationship between the shear test failure mode and <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> {{fabrication process}}. The aging testing and the temperature-humidity testing with various test time were performed for the samples. In the study, four types of low-cost PCB designs of the fine-pitch solder-bumped flip-chip were evaluated. Various size test chips were used in the experiments. The concept of wetting area error ratio was introduced to quantify the change of the designed wetting area on PCB and the actual wetting area. The chip size and the <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> parameters determined the alignment tolerance required on the PCB. The geometry-based model was used to model the solder joint shape and predicted the failure mechanism of solder joint during the bonding process. The formation and the effect of voids in the underfill material were analyzed and studied. Flip-chip-on-flex (FCOF) technology has been developed for various size chips and various flexible substrate designs. The warpage of flexible substrate was critical to the bonding process and the underfill process. The reliability of solder joints in FCOF was evaluated and tested using thermal cycling and temperature/humidity tests. The adhesion of solder mask, Cu trace and substrate determined the shear strength of flip chip assembly. Most of shear failure located at the interface between the solder mask and the flexible substrate. A pressure sensor and an actuator were also assembled on a flexible substrate using FCOF technology. A photolithography process was developed to meet the <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> fabrication requirement of the sensor chip.

50|$|Flip chip, {{also known}} as {{controlled}} collapse chip connection or its abbreviation, C4, is a method for interconnecting semiconductor devices, such as IC chips and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), to external circuitry with <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> that have been deposited onto the chip pads. The technique was developed by General Electric's Light Military Electronics Dept., Utica, N.Y. The <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> are deposited on the chip pads on the top side of the wafer during the final wafer processing step. In order to mount the chip to external circuitry (e.g., a circuit board or another chip or wafer), it is flipped over so that its top side faces down, and aligned so that its pads align with matching pads on the external circuit, and then the solder is reflowed to complete the interconnect. This {{is in contrast to}} wire bonding, in which the chip is mounted upright and wires are used to interconnect the chip pads to external circuitry.|$|E
50|$|The {{resources}} and successes with integrated circuits, and {{a review of}} some of the drivers of field failures, subsequently motivated the reliability physics community to initiate physics of failure investigations into package-level degradation mechanisms. An extensive amount of work was performed to develop algorithms that could accurately predict the reliability of interconnects.

50|$|One of {{the issues}} with the CSP type of package (which was {{intended}} to be soldered directly to an FR4 or flex circuit) was that for high-density interconnects, the soft <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> provided less of a stand-off as the <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> diameter and pitch were decreased.

40|$|Abstract. Thermo-mechanical {{reliability}} of the <b>solder</b> <b>bumped</b> flip chip packages having underfill encapsulant was evaluated with thermal shock testing. In the initial reaction, the reaction product between the solder and Cu mini bump of chip side was Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC layer, while the two phases which were (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 and (Ni,Cu) 3 Sn 4 were formed between the solder and electroless Ni-P layer of the package side. A crack was formed at the upper edge region of <b>solder</b> <b>bump,</b> and propagated through the solder region. The primary failure mechanism of the solder joints {{in this type of}} package was confirmed to be thermally activated solder fatigue failure. After thermal shocks of 2000 cycles, one more crack which was not observed in the case of non-underfill encapsulated flip chip was observed at the left side of interface between <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> and substrate. The addition of this crack formation should be due to the underfill encapsulation between the Si chip and substrate...|$|R
50|$|Solder bumping {{technology}} (the {{process of}} joining a chip to a substrate without shorting using solder) was first conceived and implemented by IBM {{in the early}} ‘60s. Three versions {{of this type of}} solder joining were developed. The first was to embed copper balls in the <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> to provide a positive stand-off. The second solution, developed by Delco Electronics (General Motors) in the late ‘60s, was similar to embedding copper balls except that the design employed a rigid silver bump. The bump provided a positive stand-off and was attached to the substrate by means of solder that was screen-printed onto the substrate. The third solution was to use a screened glass dam near the electrode tips to act as a ‘‘stop-off’’ to prevent the ball solder from flowing down the electrode. By then the Ball Limiting Metallurgy (BLM) with a high-lead (Pb) solder system and a copper ball had proven to work well. Therefore, the ball was simply removed and the solder evaporation process extended to form pure <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> that were approximately 125μm high. This system became known as the controlled collapse chip connection (C3 or C4).|$|E

This system obtains the projection images from various directions using the rotational transfer of flat panel detector and the fixed mounted open-type X-ray generator that has a wide radiation angle, and reconstructs 3 D image using the 3 D FBP (Filtered Back Projection) method. In addition, we have developed the reconstruction acceleration unit for oblique CT, and thus the 3 D image is obtained in the real time. In our experiments, we evaluated the solder joints of BGA mounted substrate.

40|$|In electroplating-based {{flip-chip}} technology, the Cu stud and solder {{deposition process}} {{is one of}} the most important factors affecting the reliability of solder joints. The growth of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds (IMC) also plays a critical role. In this paper, the effect of Cu stud surface roughness and microstructures on the reliability of solder joint was studied. The micro-structural morphology of the Cu-Sn IMC layer was affected by Cu stud surface structure. The Cu stud with sloped edge can impacted the adhesion of <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> and UBM (Under Bump Metallurgy) layer. Insufficient solder wetting at edge of the Cu stud can further degrade the reliability of solder joints. We observed the thickness of epsilon-phase Cu(3) Sn layer increased continuously instead of eta-phase Cu(6) Sn(5) due to the deficiency of tin at the bottom of <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> after extended thermal aging. The adhesion of Cu stud and UBM layer was weakened due to the growth of Cu(3) Sn at the edge of Cu stud. Both of the Cu-Sn IMC layers grew at the top of Cu stud as the aging time increased. The mean thickness of two IMC levers increased linearly with the square root of aging time. We found that cracks formed easily at the interface of Cu-Sn IMC layer and <b>solder</b> <b>bump,</b> especially at the Pb-rich layer and IMC layer interface. Cracks led to low bump shear strength after extended thermal aging. We did not observe cracks formed at the Cu(6) Sn(5) and Cu(3) Sn interface.

40|$|Numerical methods {{like the}} finite element (FE) method {{are often used}} to {{evaluate}} the reliability of electronic packages. However, the accuracy of non-linear numerical analyses should be confirmed by experimental measurements. In this study, we evaluated the strain distribution in flip chip (FC) packages with multi-layered printed circuit boards (PCBs) by combining the digital image correlation method (DICM) and the non-linear FE method, considering the viscoelasticity of resins and the elastoplasticity and creep of solder alloy. Four types of FC package consisting of two types of buildup (BU) resin and two types of underfill (UF) resin were evaluated. The distributions of strain on the cutting sections of FC packages were measured using the DICM with microphotographs obtained by a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The strain measurements showed that the UF resin with the low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) reduced thermal strain around a <b>solder</b> <b>bump,</b> and the BU resin with the low CTE reduced the strain concentration along the interface between a Si chip and a <b>solder</b> <b>bump.</b> We performed the non-linear FE analyses while taking into account the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio of the UF resin and the constant instantaneous Poisson’s ratio. The result of the FE analyses with the constant instantaneous Poisson’s ratio did not correspond with the strain measurements using the DICM. The normal strain in a <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> was less than that obtained by the measurement, and the direction of a shear strain band in a <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> was different from that measured using the DICM.
