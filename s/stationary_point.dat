30|$|Note that {{approximation}} problem (3.7) is a nonconvex programming problem, {{so when we}} {{solve this}} problem, we will obtain <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> rather than global optimal solutions. Therefore, we will analyze the convergence of problem (3.3)’s and (3.7)’s <b>stationary</b> <b>points.</b> Firstly, we give the definition of <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of (3.3) and (3.7), respectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{frequencies}} of the <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> in rotor-ball bearing system {{are difficult to}} determine due to the nonlinear and non-smooth ball supporting effects. This paper presents a linearized discriminant to calculate {{the frequency of the}} <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of the system. The influences of system parameters on the <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> with the Timoshenko beam and the Bernoulli–Euler beam models are also discussed. The comparison between the linear and nonlinear results indicates that the underlying assumptions are reasonable for the range of parameters considered. With the help of linearized discriminant, the frequency values of the <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> can be found conveniently. Taking the frequency values of <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> into the linearized discriminant, the corresponding system parameters can also be obtained by setting the linear determinant to be zero...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the {{recently}} observed phenomenon of topology trivialization of potential energy landscapes (PELs) for several statistical mechanics models, we perform a numerical {{study of the}} finite size $ 2 $-spin spherical model using both numerical polynomial homotopy continuation and a reformulation via non-hermitian matrices. The continuation approach computes all of the complex <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of this model while the matrix approach computes the real <b>stationary</b> <b>points.</b> Using these methods, we compute {{the average number of}} <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> while changing the topology of the PEL as well as the variance. Histograms of these <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> are presented along with an analysis regarding the complex <b>stationary</b> <b>points.</b> This work connects topology trivialization to two different branches of mathematics: algebraic geometry and catastrophe theory, which is fertile ground for further interdisciplinary research.

30|$|As a {{drawback}} of the dynamics-based reference generators, such as {{an artificial}} potential field approach, <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> would be caused from equilibrium of acting forces (i.e., -f_L, f_G, and f_O). The leader point should escape from such <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> by adding an explorative force f_E. Note that the robot (i.e., the reference gait speeds) does not requrie the explorative force since the robot is towed only by the leader <b>point,</b> namely no <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> are caused.|$|R
40|$|Long time {{behavior}} of a semilinear wave equation with nonlinearboundary dissipation is considered. It is shown that weak solutions generated by the wave dynamics converge asymptotically to a finite dimensional. It is known [CEL 1] that the attractor consists of all full trajectories emanating from the set of <b>stationary</b> <b>points.</b> Under the additional assumption that the set of <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> is finite it is proved that every solution converges to some <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> at an exponential rate...|$|R
40|$|The <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of the {{potential}} energy function V are studied for the ϕ^ 4 model on a two-dimensional square lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions. On the basis of analytical and numerical results, we explore the relation of <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> to the occurrence of thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the phase transition potential energy of the ϕ^ 4 model does in general not coincide with {{the potential}} energy {{of any of the}} <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of V. This disproves earlier, allegedly rigorous, claims in the literature on necessary conditions for the existence of phase transitions. Moreover, we find evidence that the indices of <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> scale extensively with the system size, and therefore the index density can be used to characterize features of the energy landscape in the infinite-system limit. We conclude that the finite-system <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> provide one possible mechanism of how a phase transition can arise, but not the only one. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
25|$|The {{determination}} of molecular structure by geometry optimization became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives {{of the energy}} with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies {{are related to the}} eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.|$|E
25|$|A more {{straightforward}} way {{of determining}} {{the nature of a}} <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> is by examining the function values between the stationary points (if the function is defined and continuous between them).|$|E

40|$|We {{establish}} a multidimensional decay of oscillatory integrals with degenerate <b>stationary</b> <b>points,</b> gaining the decay {{with respect to}} all space variables. This bridges {{the gap between the}} one-dimensional decay for degenerate <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> given by the classical van der Corput lemma and the multidimensional decay for non-degenerate <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> given by the stationary phase method. Complex-valued phase functions as well as phases and amplitudes of limited regularity are considered. Conditions for estimates to be uniform in parameter are also given...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{least squares}} formulation for the maximum weight clique problem is proposed. When nonnegativity of variables is relaxed, it becomes possible to enumerate its <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> assuming the degeneracy did not occur.

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> {{of what is}} known as the lattice Landau gauge fixing {{functional}} in one-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theory, or as the Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional random phase XY model in statistical physics. An analytic solution of all <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> is derived for lattices with an odd number of lattice sites and periodic boundary conditions. In the context of lattice gauge theory, these <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> and their indices are used to compute the gauge fixing partition function, making reference in particular to the Neuberger problem. Interpreted as <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of the one-dimensional XY Hamiltonian, the solutions and their Hessian determinants allow us to evaluate a criterion which makes predictions on the existence of phase transitions and the corresponding critical energies in the thermodynamic limit. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

25|$|One {{molecular}} formula can represent {{more than one}} molecular isomer: a set of isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the potential energy surface) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) {{as a function of}} the coordinates of all the nuclei. A <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> is a transition structure and the coordinate is the reaction coordinate. This process of determining stationary points is called geometry optimization.|$|E
25|$|Expressed in {{mathematical}} language, {{using the}} calculus of variations, {{the evolution of}} a physical system (i.e., how the system actually progresses from one state to another) corresponds to a <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> (usually, a minimum) of the action.|$|E
25|$|For the {{function}} f(x) = x3 we have f(0) = 0 and f'(0) = 0. This {{is both a}} <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> and a point of inflection. This is because the concavity changes from concave downwards to concave upwards and the sign of f(x) does not change; it stays positive.|$|E
40|$|Inspired by {{a recent}} work by Alexander et al. (J Bank Finance 30 : 583 – 605, 2006) which proposes a {{smoothing}} method to deal with nonsmoothness in a conditional value-at-risk problem, we consider a smoothing scheme for a general class of nonsmooth stochastic problems. Assuming that a smoothed problem is solved by a sample average approximation method, we investigate the convergence of <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of the smoothed sample average approximation problem as sample size increases and show that w. p. 1 accumulation <b>points</b> of the <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of the approximation problem are weak <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> of their counterparts of the true problem. Moreover, under some metric regularity conditions, we obtain an error bound on approximate <b>stationary</b> <b>points.</b> The convergence result is applied to a conditional value-at-risk problem and an inventory control problem...|$|R

25|$|In {{the field}} of {{computational}} chemistry, energy minimization (also called energy optimization, geometry minimization, or geometry optimization) {{is the process of}} finding an arrangement in space of a collection of atoms where, according to some computational model of chemical bonding, the net inter-atomic force on each atom is acceptably close to zero and the position on the potential energy surface (PES) is a <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> (described later).

25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the optical path length, the <b>stationary</b> <b>point</b> is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a spherical mirror). In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E

40|$|The {{global maximum}} of a {{function}} {{can be determined}} by using information {{about the number of}} <b>stationary</b> <b>points</b> in the domain of interest.

The integral is based on work {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. The numerical feasibility of the method is shown by two computed examples, i. e., estimation problems from statistics and optical communication theory.
