It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe, notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Tromsø, Norway (seeds can ripen as far north as Vesterålen); Reykjavík, Iceland; and Tórshavn on the Faroe Islands. It now occurs throughout the British Isles, having been introduced in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{its life}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, Ewiniar affected Yap and Palau, which fall under the warning jurisdiction of the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5feet (1.5m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands.

5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly {{the same amount of}} {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700cm per year in the east and over 1,000cm in the west.

5|$|Scotland {{is roughly}} {{half the size of}} England and Wales and has {{approximately}} the same amount of coastline, but only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land, under 60 metres above sea level, and most of this is located in the south and east. This made marginal pastoral farming and fishing the key factors in the pre-modern economy. Its north Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, which encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and <b>salt</b> <b>spray,</b> made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult.|$|E
5|$|Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> near the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's good arable and {{pastoral}} land is found {{mostly in the}} south and east of the country. Heavy rainfall, wind and <b>salt</b> <b>spray,</b> in combination with thin soil and overgrazing, made most of the western islands treeless. The terrain often made internal land communication difficult, encouraging a coastal network. In the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago, there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming. The two main sources of food were grain and cow milk. From the Bronze Age, arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, there were hill forts in southern Scotland associated with cultivation ridges and terraces and the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of Britain there was re-growth of trees indicating a reduction in agriculture.|$|E

The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{moved slowly}} over Cuba {{for two days}} before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160homes and 190trailers were damaged. <b>Salt</b> <b>spray</b> damaged crops in the region, and there was $5million in damage and four deaths. In the Straits of Florida, Inez capsized a boat of Cuban refugees, killing 45people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11people. The hurricane threatened the northern Yucatán Peninsula, and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of Tamaulipas and cut off roads to Tampico. About 84,000people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500houses. Damage was estimated at $104million, and there were 74deaths in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm track}} brought Mireille {{west of the}} most {{populated}} island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu. At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States.

25|$|The {{islands are}} part of the Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra {{ecoregion}} that includes several subantarctic islands. In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, lichens, and mosses. Low plant diversity reflects the islands’ isolation, small size, severe climate, the short, cool growing season and, for Heard Island, substantial permanent ice cover. The main environmental determinants of vegetation on subantarctic islands are wind exposure, water availability, parent soil composition, <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> exposure, nutrient availability, disturbance by trampling (from seabirds and seals) and, possibly, altitude. At Heard Island, exposure to <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> and the presence of breeding and moulting seabirds and seals are particularly strong influences on vegetation composition and structure in coastal areas.|$|E

40|$|A {{technology}} of puffed-salted rice processing has been studied. Five rice varieties (IR 64, IR 42, IR 48, Cisadane and Gemar) were used. <b>Salt</b> solution was <b>sprayed</b> onto the rice prior to puffing, at level of 10 % of rice weight. Puffed salted rice {{were compared to}} puffed unsalted-rice. The results showed that either rice varieties or salting affected the puffed rice characteristics. Puffed rice of Gemar variety had the highest whiteness and volume expansion, and lowest hardness. Protein quality decreased in the puffed rice, indicated by decreasing in amino acids composition. Aromatics and S-amino acid were more susceptible to degradation during puffing than the others. <b>Salt</b> <b>spraying</b> before puffing resulted in puffed rice with lower whiteness and volume expansion, and higher water solubility and gel consistency. Salting also increased amino acids susceptibility to degradation during puffing.

Farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family and cattle were the most important domesticated animal.|$|E
25|$|Tsuga canadensis {{has long}} been a popular tree in cultivation. The tree's {{preference}} for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow. In addition, its very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth habit and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable ornamental tree. In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil. It is most often used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can also be trained as a dense formal hedge. It should not be used on roadsides where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to <b>salt</b> <b>spray.</b> It is also poorly adapted as a windbreak tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in winter. It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of urban stress, intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable. Its tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as a Christmas tree.|$|E
