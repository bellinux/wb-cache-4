40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden Ergebnisse von numerischen Untersuchungen vorgestellt, die mit topografischer Veränderung der Fugenfläche bei zylindrischen Press-verbindungen eine Spannungsoptimierung bewirken. Durch diese Spannungsoptimierung wird das Auftreten der Spannungsspitzen reduziert und die spezifische Reibenergie, die ein Maß für die Reibdauerbeanspruchung ist, an der Nabenkante deutlich verringert. Ziel dieses Forschungsschwerpunktes war der Aufbau einer ganzheitlichen Untersuchungsmethodik von Welle-Nabe-Verbindungen unter Torsionsbelastung, die den direkten Vergleich von numerischen und experimentellen Ergebnissen ermöglicht. Für die experimentellen dynamischen Versuche wurde ein neuartiges Prüfstandskonzept mit dazugehöriger Probenform entwickelt, das ein gleichzeitiges Belasten zweier stehender Welle-Nabe-Verbindungen ermöglicht. Bei diesem Prüfstandskonzept können alle denkbaren Belastungsfälle für Torsion untersucht werden. Zusätzlich ist eine gleichzeitige Überlagerung einer umlaufenden Biegung möglich. Für weitere experimentelle Untersuchungen wurde eine Vorrichtung aufgebaut, mit deren Hilfe der integrale Reibwert in Umfangsrichtung ermittelt werden kann. Ein neuartiges Konzept zur Messung der Relativbewegung an der Nabenkante wurde entwickelt, um die veränderte Reibcharakteristik vor und nach der dynamischen Belastung an der Nabenkante nachzuweisen. Die numerischen Ergebnisse der spannungsoptimierten Pressverbindungen zeigen, dass eine Zunahme des Schlupfes an der Nabenkante stattfindet und die verringerte Pressung an dieser Stelle zu einer deutlichen Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie bei allen untersuchten Pressverbindungen führt. Das Ergebnis bei der Ausführung einer glatter Welle ist die Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie um einen Faktor von über zwei und bei abgesetzter Welle von über vier. Spezielle Übergänge zwischen den Wellenabsätzen an der Nabenkante wurden mit verschiedenen Freistichformen untersucht und auch dabei wurde eine deutliche Verringerung der Reibenergie festgestellt. Für die analytische Berechnung des Schlupfes für spannungshomogenisierte Pressverbindungen wurden, aufbauend auf den analytischen Formeln nach Leidich /LEIDICH 83 /, Korrekturkurven ermittelt, mit denen der Schlupf berechnet werden kann. Weiterhin werden Korrekturkurven angegeben, für die der Schlupf in Abhängigkeit von der Geometrie der Wellenschulter analytisch berechnet werden kann. Zur Anpassung des optimalen Übermaßverlaufes wurde eine Annäherung mittels einer Radien-Fasen-Korrektur vorgenommen. Es zeigt sich, dass zur Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie das Übermaßniveau direkt an der Nabenkante {{relevant}} ist und der darauffolgende Verlauf des Übermaßes nur von untergeordneter Bedeutung ist. Somit ist eine Reduzierung der Reibdauerbeanspruchung mittels eines an das spannungshomogenisierte Übermaß an der Nabenkante angenäherten Fasenniveaus realisierbar. Erstmalig wurde numerisch der lokale Reibwert an den schlupfbehafteten Gleitzonen innerhalb der Fugenfläche schrittweise erhöht, um die Veränderung der realen Reibverhältnisse abzubilden. Vergleichend mit den integral eingesetzten Reibwerten bewirkt die Anpassung des lokalen Reibwertes eine Schlupfzunahme von maximal 1 µm. Mit der experimentellen Schlupfmessung konnte infolge des direkten Vergleichs vor und nach der dynamischen Belastung eine deutliche Reduzierung der Schlupfamplituden ermittelt werden. Mithilfe analytischer Gleichungen gelingt es, den dafür angepassten lokalen Reibwert für die konventionellen und die spannungsoptimierten Pressverbindung zu errechnen. Die jungfräulich lokalen Reibwerte von 0, 3 bis 0, 4 stiegen während der Belastung bei gemessenen Rautiefen von Rz = 5 µm auf ein Niveau bis 0, 7 an. Diese Reibwerterhöhung wird für geschliffene Proben wahrscheinlich noch höher ausfallen und somit auch direkte Reibverschweißungen an der Nabenkante mit sich bringen. This work {{presents the}} results of experimental and numerical investigations, showing how changes in the topography of the contact surface of cylindrical pressed shaft-hub connections lead to stress optimization effects which considerably reduce the occurrence of stress peaks and fretting fatigue at the hub edge. This homogenization of stress is realized by a variable interference along the axial length of the connection. The key objective of the research at hand was to establish a holistic methodology for the examination of shaft-hub connections subjected to torsional load which would enable direct comparison of numerical and experimental results. Within the framework of the research, an innovative test bench concept with standing still specimen allowing two standing shaft-hub connections to be tested simultaneously was developed for dynamic experimentation. Extremely flexible in deployment, the new test bench is suitable for performance {{of a wide variety of}} torsion tests. In addition, a circumferential bend may be superimposed in parallel. For further experimental investigations, a device was developed for usage in calculating the integral friction value in circumferential direction. An advanced approach for measurement of the relative movement at the hub edge was introduced to quantify the change in friction characteristic at the hub edge before and after application of dynamic stresses. Numerical results of stress-optimized pressed connections evidence an increase in slip at the hub edge with the subsequent reduction in pressure at this location leading to a significant drop in specific friction energy for all the pressed connections examined. Results for smooth shafts showed that the specific friction energy was reduced to under half the original value, while for shafts with shoulder fillets the figure decreased to even lower than one-fourth. When special transitions between the chamfers of the shafts at the hub edge were investigated using various groove shapes, these also showed a clear reduction in friction energy. To analytically compute the slip for stress-strain homogenized pressed connections, an analytical formula proposed by Leidich /LEIDICH 83 / has been used to calculate correction curves for the pressed connections investigated, multiplying them to derive the slip. Furthermore, this work presents correction curves which have been found suitable for the analytical calculation of slip as a function of the <b>shaft</b> <b>shoulder.</b> To adapt the optimal press fit, an approximation using radius-chamfer correction was carried out. Results showed that the press fit interference at the hub edge is the crucial factor for a reduction in the specific friction energy with the further interference playing only a subordinate role. Hence, it follows that a reduction in fretting fatigue may be achieved by correct design of the chamfer height at the hub edge. For the first time ever, the local friction value at the slip zones within the contact surface was increased in increments to represent changes in the real friction conditions. Com-pared to the integral friction values, this adjustment of the local friction value resulted in an increase in slip of no more than 1 µm. Employing direct benchmarking techniques before and after dynamic stress testing, the experimental slip measurement approach determined a sharp reduction in slip amplitudes. Then using analytic equations, the adapted local friction value can be calculated for both the conventional and stress-optimized pressed connections. Before applying the load, the friction values ranged between 0. 3 and 0. 4 with a measured roughness depth of RZ = 5 µm. The friction values rose up to 0. 7 while the load was applied and remained constant. This increase in the friction value is significantly greater for smooth specimens, thus resulting in direct friction fusing at the hub edge. Since a pressed connection is designed in a range under the slip torque threshold, these results imply that a much higher friction value can be assumed for the design than recommended in the relevant industrial norms DIN 7190 /DIN 7190 - 01 / due to the fact that when dynamic stresses are applied a stationary status comes into being within the friction characteristic. Consequently, the stick-slip thresholds would also seem to be set too high for the specimens tested as these parameters were calculated on the basis of too low (local) friction values. There is therefore no evidence to conclude that, even for slip less than 0. 5 µm, a pressed connection will be fatigue resistant. And this would seem to be underpinned by examinations of worn pressed connections where damage occurred after a number of years. This work arrives at the conclusion that assured design is only possible in pressed connections which do not evidence relative movement between the shaft and the hub...|$|E

In this study, the {{endurance}} limit of shrink-fitted assemblies with a circumferential groove subjected to rotating bending is investigated experimentally {{as well as}} numerically. So called staircase method {{is used for the}} realisation of the fatigue test series.

By means of the FE-Analyses the influence of static pre-stress in circumferential groove due to interference fit on fatigue limit is determinated.

40|$|An {{analytical}} solution {{has been}} proposed recently by the authors to describe, with a unified approach, the stress fields in the neighbourhood of sharp cracks, V-shaped notches and re-entrant corners in plates subjected to remote tensile loading. In the present paper, the above solution is revised and extended, by also determining the relevant displacement fields {{and the degree of}} accuracy of the solution for both the longitudinal and transverse stress fields. Afterwards, since the stress held depends on the type of loading, the circumferential principal stress component is modified to account for bending in fatigue life predictions, while the radial principal stress is almost negligible in this case. The analytical results are compared with finite element values obtained for different geometries loaded under tensile or bending conditions, as well as with other closed-form solutions. The new expressions seem to give better stress estimates than the currently available approximate solutions, whether analytical or numerical, when the opening angle of the re-entrant corner is equal to or greater than pi/ 2. Hence they should represent a good starting point to describe stress distributions induced by stress raisers with large and well defined opening angles such as <b>shafts</b> with <b>shoulder</b> filets, gears and weldments...|$|R

40|$|In a {{proposed}} improvement of tooling for friction stir welding, gimballed shoulders would supplant shoulders that, heretofore, have been fixedly aligned with pins. The proposal is especially relevant to self-reacting friction stir welding. Some definitions of terms, recapitulated from related prior NASA Tech Briefs articles, are prerequisite to a meaningful {{description of the}} proposed improvement. In friction stir welding, one uses a tool that includes (1) a rotating shoulder on top (or front) of the workpiece and (2) a pin that rotates with the shoulder and protrudes from the shoulder into {{the depth of the}} workpiece. In conventional friction stir welding, the main axial force exerted by the tool on the workpiece is reacted through a ridged backing anvil under (behind) the workpiece. When conventional friction stir welding is augmented with an auto-adjustable pin-tool (APT) capability, the depth of penetration of the pin into the workpiece is varied in real time by a position- or forcecontrol system that extends or retracts the pin as needed to obtain the desired effect. In self-reacting (also known as self-reacted) friction stir welding as practiced heretofore, there are two shoulders: one on top (or front) and one on the bottom (or back) of the workpiece. In this case, a threaded shaft protrudes from the tip of the pin to beyond the back surface of the workpiece. The back shoulder is held axially in place against tension by a nut on the threaded <b>shaft.</b> Both <b>shoulders</b> rotate with the pin and remain aligned coaxially with the pin. The main axial force exerted on the workpiece by the tool and front shoulder is reacted through the back shoulder and the threaded shaft into the friction-stir-welding machine head, so that a backing anvil is no longer needed. A key transmits torque between the bottom shoulder and the threaded shaft, so that the bottom shoulder rotates with the shaft. This concludes the prerequisite definitions of terms...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Technical and {{conceptual}} shortcomings of cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes have {{been pointed out}} in the past, all representing a potential risk for mucosal damage of the pediatric airway. In this study, cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes from different manufacturers were investigated with regard to the cuff shoulder design using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). METHODS: Cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes with the smallest internal diameter available were ordered from five manufacturers. SEM scans were performed from the tube <b>shaft</b> - cuff <b>shoulder</b> - tube cuff assembly and from the cuff shoulder alone. Each investigation was repeated in four samples of each tube brand. In addition, thickness of cuff membrane was measured. RESULTS: Major differences were found among the cuff shoulders investigated ranging from smooth transitions, softened borders to very sharp steps. There was also considerable difference in the thickness among the cuff membranes between the different tube brands ranging from 18 microm in polyurethane cuffs up to 90 microm in polyvinylchloride cuffs. CONCLUSIONS: Because the gap between the outer tracheal tube and the internal mucosal layer of the pediatric airway is often very narrow, some of the observed irregularities have the potential to injure the airway mucosa in pediatric patients, particularly during long-term use and firm fit of the tracheal tube in the airway. As cuffed tubes are increasingly used in small children, the observed irregularities in some tracheal tube brands may need to be improved and their safety should be proved by the manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|Coatings {{are added}} to {{components}} to provide enhanced protection from the surroundings or to recondition them after the surfaces have been damaged. But the change in conditions at the surface will often lead {{to a change in}} the resistance to fatigue loading. This investigation is focused on the behaviour of <b>shouldered</b> <b>shafts</b> electroplated with nickel, chromium and a cobalt/chromium carbide composite. Changes, in fatigue strength are demonstrated. Each of the materials has a unique effect on the behaviour of a shaft, although there is a similarity which can be utilised in design. Each can reduce the fatigue strength by a substantial amount, but it is possible to optimize the design of a new shaft so that its strength is not significantly different to that of an uncoated version. The composite coating has the least effect. Explanations for these effects are given, based on differences in the mechanical properties of the substrate and coating materials, the distribution of residual stresses within the materials, and the interaction of these factors with the applied stress profile. Recommendations and methods of analysis which can be used in the design of coated components are presented. The contribution of the manufacturing processes is discussed, and grinding is highlighted as a dominant factor. Gentle grinding procedures are shown to produce ideal conditions by inducing large compressive residual stresses in the surfaces. Radial plots of the residual stresses have been produced. These were obtained by techniques based on Sachs' method, using electrochemical machining and an extended analysis developed for use with coated parts. The stress distributions were not affected by fatigue limit loading, indicating that stress relief methods using amplitudes of this order are ineffective and unsafe...|$|R

"To my resolution," [...] {{answered}} Simon; [...] "for I {{think nothing}} {{can make a}} man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the knowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward. Well, I mounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the Spey Tower, being accounted a good bowman. But a very cold fit seized me as I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front, and their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong columns, three in number. They came on steadily, {{and some of us}} would fain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were obliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement as we best might. As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines, each man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover themselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before them, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home for a glass of distilled waters. But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy Kempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he should waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English were in presence; so I e'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable angle, formed by two battlements. The English then strode forward, and drew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but to the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could call on St. Andrew. I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I believe I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet. But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town crier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took heart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim. A little man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target, dropt with a <b>shaft</b> through his <b>shoulder.</b> The provost cried, 'Well stitched, Simon Glover!'

I gained some credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of necessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not have lost it again.

40|$|After a short {{introduction}} to the topics of this thesis, in chapter 2 we described the functional and radiological results of a retrospective study in patients with an ipsilateral scapular neck and clavicular <b>shaft</b> fracture (floating <b>shoulder).</b> Forty-six patients were treated between 1991 and 1996. Thirty-five patients remained available for analysis (follow-up: 35 months). Thirty-one patients had been initially treated non-operatively and four operatively. Three patients underwent secondary surgery. Both operatively as non-operatively treated patients had a fair to good functional outcome (Constant score 71 versus 76). A correlation was found between radiological result (angular malunion of the neck) and functional result. Our study results suggest that conservative treatment is preferred in patients with an ipsilateral clavicular and scapular neck fracture, in absence of angular malunion. Fair to poor functional results are reported in literature on patients with a displaced scapular neck fracture. In chapter 3 occurrence of malunion was analysed in conservatively treated patients with a scapular neck fracture in relation with the clinical outcome. In the period 1991 and 2001, 24 patients with a locally isolated scapular neck fracture were treated. Thirteen patients were available (follow-up: 5. 5 years). In four patients a translational displacement > 1 cm was found, but no significant angular displacement. The mean Constant score of all 13 patients was 90. This study {{suggests that there is}} no correlation between occurrence of translational displacement of the scapular neck and a poor functional result. In chapter 4 a biomechanical study was described. The aim was to identify a mechanical cause for loss of shoulder function in case of a malunited scapular neck. A 3 D computer model was used to analyse shoulder biomechanics. Abduction of the humerus and loading of a 90 º abducted humerus were simulated with presence and absence of caudal displacement of the glenoid. The patterns of muscle activation were studied, with attention to the rotator cuff muscles. A difference in muscle activation was found between the control and malunion cases. The rotator cuff muscles were significantly shortened in the fracture cases and their generated forces were strongly reduced when the humerus was loaded at 90 º abduction. From the current study it appears that loss of the rotator cuff function can be compensated by other muscles with larger moment arms. In chapter 5, the current status of the anatomical, biomechanical and clinical aspects of a floating shoulder is reviewed. It is suggested in literature that in patients with a floating shoulder, O. R. I. F. of the clavicular shaft fracture will reduce the displaced scapular neck fracture and prevent malunion. In chapter 6 is explained-by presentation of three case reports- that this generally accepted theory is not correct. In chapter 7 an anatomical study is presented in which the best position of the arm for achieving an adequate exposure to the scapular neck and the safest distance of both axillary and suprascapular nerve to the glenoid is determined. Thirteen fresh-frozen shoulders were dissected through a posterior surgical approach [...] The distance of neurovascular structures to the glenoid was measured with the arm in different positions. A significant increase in axillary nerve-glenoid distance by abducting the arm was observed in all cases. It was concluded that abduction of the arm facilitates the exposure to the scapular neck. Abduction up to 90 º particularly in combination with external rotation of the arm increases the "safe zone" between the branch of the axillary nerve innervating the teres minor muscle and the glenoid. The posterior surgical approach according to Brodsky is elucidated in chapter 8 by presentation of a patient who was treated by O. R. I. F. of a displaced glenoid fracture...|$|R
