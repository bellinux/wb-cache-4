Laboratory tests were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of this chemical on growth and sporulation of Phytophthora citrophthora and P. parasitica, which cause Phytophthora gummosis and mot rot of citrus in Arizona Zoospore motility, zoospore cyst viability, sporangia production, and mycelia' growth were significantly reduced in the presence of STTC Results of laboratory tests suggest that application of S 7 TC as a soil drench could reduce inoculum production and subsequent new infections by P. citrophthora and P. parasitica...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to evaluate and}} compare the effect of root and soil treatments with <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate</b> (STTC) (Enzone), metalaxyl (Ridomil), and fosetyl-Al (Aliette) on subsequent development of Phytophthora root rot on citrus. Disease development was significantly reduced on rough lemon seedlings treated with STTC or metalaxyl compared to untreated plants when this citrus rootstock was inoculated with sporangia of P. citrophthora or P. parasitica. Growth of rough lemon seedlings in soil naturally infested with P. parasitica that was treated one week before planting with STTC or metalaxyl was equivalent to that obtained in sterilized orchard soil STTC applied as a soil drench at 2, 450 ppm was lethal to P. citrophthora and P. parasitica on colonized leaf disks of lepton buried in soil, whereas a similar treatment with metalaxyl at 10 ppm or fosetyl Al at 3, 000 ppm did not appreciably affect pathogen viability. Sporangium production on leaf disks of lemon colonized by P. citrophthora and P. parasitica and buried in soil was reduced at least 90 % compared to the untreated control six days after treatment of soil with 2, 450 ppm of STTC, 10 ppm of metalaxyl, or 3, 000 ppm of fosetyl AL These studies demonstrate the potential usefulness of <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate</b> as a fungicide for control of Phytophthora root rot of citrus. Only fosetyl-Al (Aliette) and metalaxyl (Ridomil) currently are registered for control of Phytophthora diseases on citrus...|$|E
40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} with a chitin-urea soil amendment and several other nematicides on four crop-nematode combinations: tomato-Meloidogyne incognita; potato-Meloidogyne chitwoodi; walnut-Pratylenchus vulnus; and brussels sprouts-Heterodera schachtii. Significant (P ≤ 0. 10) nematode population reductions were obtained with the chitin-urea soil amendment in the trims on potato and walnut. In the trials on brussels sprouts and on tomato, phytotoxicity occurred at rates of 1, 868 and 1, 093 kg/ha, respectively. Significant (P ≤ 0. 10) nematode reductions were also obtained with metham sodium on potato; with 1, 3 -D on tomato and brussels sprouts; and with <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate,</b> XRM 5053, fenamiphos, ethoprop, LX 1075 - 05, LX 1075 - 07, and SN 109106 on tomato. The following materials did not provide significant nematode control under {{the conditions of the}} particular experiments: metham sodium, oxamyl, and Yucca extract on tomato; and dazomet granules on brussels sprouts...|$|E
40|$|Pratylenchus penetrans is a pest for {{producers}} of oriental lilies in northern California. Concern over groundwater contamination from 1, 2 -dichloropropane following shank injections of 1, 3 -dichloropropene-l, 2 -dichloropropane mixture and granular applications of aldicarb prompted testing for alternative methods of controlling P. penetrans. In field trials, nematicides applied by drip irrigation (ethoprop, fenamiphos, oxamyl, <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate,</b> water extracts of marigold and vetch, and 1, 3 -D plus emulsifier) were tested {{with and without}} foliar applications of oxamyl. Nematode populations were reduced (P = 0. 05) relative to controls in soil or roots on one or more sampling dates by all drip-applied nematicides except the plant extracts. On some sampling dates, additional reductions (P = 0. 05) occurred {{as a result of}} three foliar applications of oxamyl. Foliar-applied oxamyl alone also reduced (P = 0. 05) nematodes in soil or roots. Lily bulb weight was not affected (P = 0. 05) by chemical treatments...|$|E
40|$|Armillaria {{root rot}} caused by Armillaria mellea {{is a major}} problem when {{establishing}} new orchards in riparian areas and when re-planting at locations where the disease occurred previously (Ogawa and English, 1991). The pathogen can persist in the soil for many years as mycelium in infested dead roots or as rhizomorphs. Trees are infected by root contact with infested roots or by rhizomorphs. From the roots, the pathogen grows into the tree crown and trunk and may kill the tree. The disease spreads as circular infection centers, ultimately rendering the orchard nonproductive. Historically, pre-plant methyl bromide-chloropicrin soil fumigations were the most effective treatments for managing Armillaria root rot. Alternatives such as <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate</b> were less effective (Adaskaveg et al., 1999), whereas carbon bisulfide, a relatively effective option, had additional challenges due to its explosive nature that limited its use (Ogawa and English, 1991). Due to the phasing out of methyl bromide for agricultural use, iodomethane was evaluated as an alternative soil fumigant. Duration and temperature of iodomethane treatments were evaluated in th...|$|E
40|$|Alternatives {{to reduce}} or modify {{nematicide}} use for minimizing groundwater contamination in Easter lily were explored in two field trials. Alternatives to standard 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) plus phorate injection in the first trial were: (i) delaying applications until after winter rains, (ii) removing roots from planting stock, (iii) 1, 3 -D via drip irrigation, (iv) a chitin-urea soil amendment, (v) the registered insecticide disulfoton, and (vi) several nonregistered nematicides. None of the treatments equaled the standard treatment. In the second trial, potential benefits of adding a systemic nematicide, oxamyl (OX), or a fungicide, metalaxyl (MX), to the standard treatment were explored. Preplant drip irrigation applications of metam sodium (MS), <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate</b> (ST), and emulsifiable 1, 3 -D were evaluated alone and in combination with postplant applications of OX and MX. Several drip-applied treatments performed comparably to the standard treatment {{with respect to the}} most important criteria of crop quality, bulb circumference. Metam-sodium in combination with either or both OX and MX, 1, 3 -D plus OX and MX, and ST plus OX and MX provided the best results...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate potential chemical disease management tools for Alternaria fruit rot on navel oranges and Coniophora brown wood rot on lemon trees, to investigate the possible effect of branch diameter on development of Coniophora wood rot on lemon trees and to summarize our evaluations of citrus rootstocks with respect to relative resistance to root rot and stem canker development when challenged with Phytophthora citrophthora and P. parasitica. We were unable to reduce the level of Alternaria fruit rot on navel oranges with single applications of Abound or copper hydroxide following significant rainfall events. Wood decay in lemon branches inoculated with Coniophora eremophila was significantly suppressed by Abound and a thick formulation of <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate.</b> The degree of Coniophora brown wood rot in lemon branches of different diameters was variable, although the level of disease in 10 mm diameter branches was significantly smaller than the amount of wood decay in 30 mm diameter branches. Root loss due to Phytophthora citrophthora and P. parasitica in Citrus macrophylla, rough lemon, C. volkameriana and Troyer citrange was lower {{than most of the}} 36 different rootstocks tested. On the other hand, root loss on Carrizo citrange, C- 35 citrange and sour orange was among the higher values of disease recorded. Stem canker development due to both species of Phytophthora on Troyer citrange, Carrizo citrange, sour orange and Citrus macrophylla was lower than most of the 36 rootstocks tested. Stem cankers on rough lemon and Citrus volkameriana were among the higher values of disease recorded...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{synthetic}} pesticides {{on the soil}} microbial community have been thoroughly investigated in the past mostly by culture-dependent methods and only few recent studies have used culture-independent approaches for this purpose. However, {{it should be noted}} that most of these studies have been conducted in microcosms where the soil microbial community is exposed to unrealistic concentrations of the pesticides, providing an unrealistic exposure scheme for soil microorganism. On the other hand, little is known regarding the potential impact of botanical pesticides on the soil microbial community. Therefore, a laboratory study and a field study were conducted to investigate the effects of synthetic (metham sodium [MS], <b>sodium</b> <b>tetrathiocarbonate</b> [SoTe], and fosthiazate) and botanical pesticides (azadirachtin, quillaja, and pulverized Melia azedarach fruits [PMF]) on the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the results of the laboratory study indicated that the application of PMF resulted in significant changes in the soil microbial community. This was obvious by the proportional increase in the abundance of fatty acids 18 : 1 omega 9 cis, 18 : 1 omega 9 trans, which are common in gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi, and 18 : 2 omega 6, 9, which is a fungal indicator. This response was attributed to the release of copious amounts of organic carbon and nutrients in the soil by the PMF. On the other hand, MS inhibited fungi and gram-negative bacteria, while fosthiazate and the botanical pesticides quillaja and azadirachtin did not impose significant changes in the soil microbial community. Similar results were obtained by the field study where application of the fumigants MS and SoTe significantly altered the structure of the soil microbial community with the former having a more prominent effect. Fosthiazate imposed mild changes in the soil microbial community, whereas quillaja and azadirachtin again did not show a significant effect. Overall, botanical pesticides, at their recommended dose, did not alter the structure of the soil microbial community compared to synthetic nonfumigant and fumigant pesticides which induced significant changes...|$|E
