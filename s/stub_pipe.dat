2500|$|On 3 December 2010, the ATSB {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} report which contained a key finding of a manufacturing flaw: An area of fatigue cracking was found within a <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> that feeds oil to the engine HP/IP bearing structure. Bearing lubricating oil leaked from the crack, causing the subsequent engine fire and failure of the IPT disc. The fatigue fracture {{was a result of}} the misalignment of the <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> during the counter-boring process. That inaccurate alignment resulted in one side of the same <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> becoming too thin to resist fatigue fracturing. This [...] "could lead to an elevated risk of fatigue crack initiation and growth, oil leakage and potential catastrophic engine failure from a resulting oil fire," [...] according to the agency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) indicated that [...] "fatigue cracking" [...] in a <b>stub</b> <b>pipe</b> within the engine resulted in oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led {{to the release of}} the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. It also said the issue is specific to the Trent 900.|$|E
2500|$|The {{findings}} {{were determined to}} be a [...] "critical safety issue," [...] and the ATSB recommended immediate inspections of in-service Trent 900 engines. [...] On 8 December the ATSB reported that 45 Trent 900 engines had been inspected, and 3 of these engines had failed inspection and {{had been removed from}} service. [...] On 18 May 2011, the ATSB released an interim factual report which states that 53 Trent 900 engines were removed from service— 11 due to out-of-tolerance oil-feed stub pipes and 42 due to lack of measurement records relating to the oil-feed <b>stub</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the DSM process, {{cyclohexane}} was {{heated to}} about 155 °C (311 °F) before passing {{into a series}} of six reactors. The reactors were constructed from mild steel with a stainless steel lining; when operating they held in total about 145 tonnes of flammable liquid at a working pressure of 8.8 kg/cm2 gauge (0.86 MPa gauge; 125 psig). In each of the reactors, compressed air was passed through the cyclohexane, causing {{a small percentage of the}} cyclohexane to oxidise and produce cyclohexanone, some cyclohexanol also being produced. Each reactor was slightly (approximately 14 inches, 350 mm) lower than the previous one, so that the reaction mixture flowed from one to the next by gravity through nominal 28-inch bore (DN 700 mm) <b>stub</b> <b>pipes</b> with inset bellows. The inlet to each reactor was baffled so that liquid entered the reactors at a low level; the exiting liquid flowed over a weir whose crest was somewhat higher than the top of the outlet pipe. The mixture exiting reactor 6 was processed to remove reaction products, and the unreacted cyclohexane (only about 6% was reacted in each pass) then returned to the start of the reactor loop.|$|R
25|$|Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 {{flying from}} London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an {{uncontained}} failure in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure {{was found to}} have been caused by a misaligned counter bore within a <b>stub</b> oil <b>pipe</b> leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|R
50|$|Rolls-Royce {{determined}} that the direct cause of the oil fire and resulting engine failure was a misaligned counter bore within a <b>stub</b> oil <b>pipe</b> leading to a fatigue fracture. The ATSB's preliminary investigation report confirmed Rolls-Royce's findings. Airbus {{determined that}} the IPT disc released three different high energy fragments, resulting in structural and systems damage. It also concluded that segregated wiring routes were cut by two out of the three individual pieces of disc debris and as a result, engine No. 1 could not be shut down after landing.|$|R

5000|$|... 19. Kinetic {{resistance}} - Oil, water, vapor, gas and air do have mass, {{that needs}} to be accelerated in order to be moved for the operation of an engine. Rolls Royce Merlin and Nakajima Sakae received rear-facing <b>stub</b> exhaust <b>pipes</b> in their development, resulting in a measurable increase in the maximum speed of Supermarine Spitfire, De Havilland Mosquito and Mitsubishi A6M Zero. This is a form of jet propulsion using kinetic energy in the exhaust, implying that the balancing of kinetic resistance arising from fluid components of an engine is not insignificant. Crank webs partially hitting the oil in oil pan (accelerating the oil mass rapidly) could be a big source of vibration.|$|R
25|$|Qantas Flight 32 was a Qantas {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight that}} suffered an uncontained engine failure on 4 November 2010 {{and made an}} emergency landing at Singapore Changi Airport. The failure {{was the first of}} its kind for the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. It marked the first aviation occurrence involving an Airbus A380. On inspection it was found that a turbine disc in the aircraft's No.2 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine (on the port side nearest the fuselage) had disintegrated. In addition to destruction of the engine, this caused damage to the nacelle, wing, fuel system, landing gear, flight controls, the controls for engine No.1 and a fire in the left inner wing fuel tank that self-extinguished. The failure was determined to have been caused by the breaking of a <b>stub</b> oil <b>pipe</b> which had been manufactured improperly.|$|R
50|$|The Dada {{movement}} began during World War I as {{a protest}} against the madness and violence of war. Applying shock tactics and anarchy to art the Dadaists pioneered the use of new artistic techniques such as collage, photomontage readymades {{and the use of}} found objects. Artists like Marcel Duchamp, Hannah Höch, Kurt Schwitters, Francis Picabia, Man Ray and others incorporated into their work random everyday objects often combined with more conventional artist materials. They included photographs, panes of glass, picture frames, eyeglasses, boxes, newspapers, magazines, ticket <b>stubs,</b> metal <b>pipes,</b> bulbs, bottle racks, urinals, bicycle wheels and other objects. Marcel Duchamp created The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, working on the piece from 1915 to 1923. He made the work on two panes of glass; with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust.|$|R

50|$|The cross-plane or two-plane {{crankshaft}} is {{the configuration}} used in most V8 road cars. The {{first and last}} of the four crank pins are at 180° with {{respect to each other}} as are the second and third, with each pair at 90° to the other, so that viewed from the end the crankshaft forms a cross. The cross-plane have half as strong (and twice as frequent) secondary vibration than flat-plane, but requires heavy counterweights on the crankshaft to counter Rocking Vibration caused by plane imbalances (See Engine balance for details). With the Secondary Vibration advantage, the cross-plane V8 can be scaled up to large displacements without causing destructive vibration. However, the use of heavy counterweights makes the cross-plane V8 a slow-revving engine that cannot speed up or slow down quickly compared to flat-plane because of the greater rotating mass. While the firing of the cross-plane V8 is evenly spaced overall, the firings on the 'L'eft and 'R'ight banks are LRLLRLRR or RLRRLRLL, resulting in uneven intake and exhaust pulse spacing for each bank. In stock cars with exhaust manifolds merging four exhaust ports into one exit, this results in uneven filling/scavenging of intake/exhaust gas in the cylinders (that prevents uniform combustion across cylinders) causing the typical V8 burble sound that many people have come to associate with American V8s. In all-out racing cars it leads to the need to connect exhaust pipes between the two banks to design an optimal exhaust system, resulting in the long exhaust pipes that resemble a bundle of snakes as in the Ford GT40. This complex and encumbering exhaust system has been a major problem for single-seater racing car designers, so they tended to use <b>stub</b> exhaust <b>pipes</b> in the 1950s, or place exhaust ports {{on the inside of the}} V angle as on the 4.2 L Ford Indy engine in Lotus 38.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of 1952 the cars were {{substantially}} rebuilt, including better cooling - most notably a greatly enlarged radiator aperture in the nose, better ventilation, and repositioning of the exhaust <b>pipe</b> <b>stubs.</b> The car had been deliberately designed with a low seating position, but Fangio, asked what changes he would like on the car, replied that amongst other things he would like a little higher seat, as he liked to see where he was going. The car was modified to Fangio's request and he drove the car intermittently throughout 1953. He later {{said that it was}} the most formidable car he ever drove during his career. At this stage the engines were developing more than 500 hp, touching 600 hp, albeit with a very peaky power curve. This power curve had been forecast by Rolls-Royce who had recommended that inter-stage throttling of the supercharger be incorporated to provide a curve more suited to road use. Berthon considered the addition an unnecessary complication, and this, and the alternative variable-angle stators at the supercharger's inlet - both used initially on the two-stroke Crecy - which had been developed and tested by Rolls-Royce for the engine, were not proceeded with.|$|R
