Tasks of study: to <b>select</b> and instruct <b>assessors</b> group {{to work by}} LST ISO 8586 – 1 : 1997. Sensory analysis. General guidance of the selection, training and monitoring of assessors. Part 1 : <b>Selected</b> <b>assessors.</b> To do descriptive analysis of dairy product (cheese) by LST ISO 4121 : 2004. Sensory analysis. Methodology. Evaluation of food products by method using scales. To make sensory profile of dairy product (cheese). Material and methods: the study’s was done at Food Safety and Animal Hygiene department in LVA and at Sensory Analysis Laboratory in KTU Food Institute. There were analysed 4 cheeses sensory analyses, done each of cheese comparable analysis and made profile. The assessors group were made from 7 students of LVA. This group selected in 2004 at KTU Food Institute and trained, but they didn’t have sensory analysis skills. At assessors screening was using these methods: ageusia, matching and ranking tests. At first assessors group was rating general cheeses appearance, odour and taste, consistency in 5 scoring. Then assessors group analysed the cheeses by earlier chosen and discussed attributes, used scales those attributes intensity to rate. From receive information were made sensory profile. To know consumers’ opinion about cheeses was used acceptability test. Results: the sensory analyses methods review showed, that sensory analyses methods are widely usable for different food products group attributes and theirs difference characterize. To do sensory analyses without special documentation concrete test we must to have <b>selected</b> <b>assessors</b> group. The assessors done sensory profile of 4 cheeses, analysis showed, that by rating attributes cheeses were very different. Quantitatively most intensive odour and taste attribute had 4 and 3 cheeses, which were most acceptability for consumers in 100 mm scale rank their acceptability. The best cheese was 3, but consumers by acceptability ranked 4 cheese. These different we can to explain methods differences: then assessors ranking 3 attributes, their ranking appearances and consistency (third ranking), and acceptability test made assessors more attention intend for odour...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the warmed-over flavor development (WOF) in bovine roast-beef through adescriptive sensory analysis using the Longissimus dorsi, Semitendinosus and Supraspinatus muscles of Nellore steers. There was a pre-selection for recruitment of assessors. Forty-five individuals were registered, being 35 preselected, from these, 24 {{were evaluated by}} difference tests (triangular tests) to determine the ability to discriminate WOF's differences in roast-beef samples. After the tests, 13 individuals were selected to determine the sensory profile of each sample.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a {{value-added}} whey cheese through addition of pine nuts. Therefore, different concentrations of pine nuts [2, 4, 6 and 8 % (w/w) ] were added to whey cheese. The {{study was designed to}} evaluate the influence of pine nuts on physicochemical and sensory properties of whey cheese. The addition of pine nuts resulted in an increase in fat content and total solids and a decrease in moisture content. However, no statistically significant difference was found in pH values. Sensory analysis was performed using the 9 -point hedonic scale, with <b>selected</b> <b>assessors.</b> The whey cheese sample with 4 % pine nuts was the most appreciated (7. 6 points), followed by the classic whey cheese, whey cheese with 6 and 8 % pine nuts (7. 4 points), and whey cheese with 2 % pine nuts (7. 3 points). Nevertheless, the sensory characteristics of whey cheese were not significantly influenced by the addition of pine nuts.

A commercial wheat flour T 512, ingredients such as yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapeseed oil, sodium chloride {{were used for}} preparing dough and final products. Guar gum and commercial additive Trial RC 2 were used as additives for production. The textural {{properties of}} rolls were measured by a TA-XT Plus Texture Analyzer. All samples were evaluated by <b>selected</b> <b>assessors.</b> A five-point hedonic scale was used for evaluation characteristics such as taste, pliancy, texture, porosity, stickiness, gumminess, crispness and quality. The obtained data showed nonsignificant difference in moisture of rolls after baking and 3 days after baking. Control sample of rolls had higher firmness in comparison to other samples with guar gum after baking. Samples of rolls with higher addition of guar gum (10 g. kg - 1 and 15 g. kg - 1) had less firmness in comparison to control sample and sample with 5 g. kg - 1 of guar gum. Sensory analysis showed negligible differences among all samples in monitored characteristics. Sensory assessors evaluated all samples as identical. Increased addition of guar gum in rolls led to the extension of shelf life (lower firmness) at unchanged sensory properties of the rolls. </span...|$|R

40|$|Background: Objective {{structured}} {{clinical examination}} (OSCE), {{an important tool}} for assessment of clinical skills, introduced more than 4 decades ago. KIST Medical College, a new medical school of Nepal, affiliated to Tribhuvan University Institute of Medicine, has made learning of physical examination skills structured and integrated with greater involvement of different clinical science departments. Students learn physical examination skills in second year MBBS {{as a part of}} early clinical exposure. Objective: To share the experiences regarding implementation of integrated OSCE. Materials and Methods: At the end of clinical posting of learning of physical examination skills, assessment was done with OSCE. Fifteen OSCE stations including each of 5 minutes were developed and arranged. Standardized patients and validated checklist were used. OSCE was conducted in novel way. Prior to the OSCE session: Suitable venue was <b>selected,</b> <b>assessors</b> were identified, standardized patients were selected, running order of the stations in circuit was developed, list of equipments/instruments required was prepared, and tasks, checklists, feedback questionnaires were printed. The day before the OSCE session: OSCE stations were inspected and clearly labeled, condition of required equipments/instruments was checked, a pack of the documents for each OSCE station were made available, and signs were displayed at proper places. On the day of the OSCE session: Reliable stop watch and loud manual bell were used, support staffs were placed to direct the candidates, examiners, and standardized patients (SPs), assessors explained SPs, students were briefed, supervisors observed the session, and feedback were taken from students, assessors, and SPs. At the end of the OSCE session: Checklists and feedback questionnaires were collected, token money was paid to SPs, and a contribution of everyone was appreciated. After the OSCE session: Score was compiled and result declared, and feedback questionnaires data compiled and shared with academic team. Results: Ninety eight percent of the students attended the OSCE session. All agreed that standardized patient were co-operative, 93 % found the faculty′s presentation as non-threatening where as 99 % found the overall OSCE environment conducive. Most (92 %) of the faculties found the selection of simulated patients appropriate, and all were satisfied with student′s approach towards SP. All expressed satisfaction with the overall management.

40|$|Castration {{of entire}} male pigs {{is widely used}} in Norway to prevent the {{unpleasant}} odour/flavour that may occur in meat from boars. Castration of entire male pigs {{is expected to be}} prohibited in Norway (and in Europe) in the future, and it is therefore important to gain more knowledge about the human perception of boar taint. Boar taint is mainly associated with the presence of two compounds, skatole and androstenone. Skatole is detected by 99 % of the consumers and regarded as unpleasant, while the ability to perceive androstenone varies and is, at least partly, determined by the amino acid sequence of the human odour receptor OR 7 D 4. The aim of the present thesis was to look at the possible challenges connected to a future production of entire males investigating the quality of the raw material and sensory perception of boar tainted meat. The results presented in the thesis showed that approximately 39 % of the Norwegian consumers were identified as androstenone sensitive based on results from a new method developed in this project. After relating the data from the consumer’s androstenone sensitivity testing to their DNA, the result showed that the consumer’s androstenone sensitivity corresponded with their DNA typing in all cases where the consumers were defined as sensitive. Since the developed sensitivity test gave no false positive genotypes, it can be recommended for setting androstenone thresholds in meat and for <b>selecting</b> <b>assessors</b> to sensory panels. This result was confirmed when sensory assessors from 4 European sensory panels evaluated meat with different levels of androstenone. All assessors were able to detect androstenone in pure form when recruited, but 26 % of the assessors were defined as non sensitive by the method developed in this project and did not react negatively on androstenone tainted meat as opposed to the sensitive assessors. Results presented in this thesis also showed that skatole easily can be detected in low concentrations (0. 15 ppm), both by sensory assessors and consumers. The Norwegian established practise with a sort out threshold value of 0. 21 ppm may therefore provide negative reactions from the consumers. For androstenone, using a level of 3 ppm for sorting would be economically acceptable due to the low number of carcasses above 3 ppm (5. 5 %), but its odour may then be detected and not accepted by sensitive consumers during frying of the meat. With the use of different production technologies (dry salted and fermented bacon) and addition of common and strong food flavour additives (liquid smoke) higher skatole levels were accepted by the consumers. In general, the skatole flavour seemed easier to mask than androstenone flavour...|$|R

5000|$|A key {{recommendation}} {{from the first}} review of the testing process in 2010 by Professor Harrington was that Atos should <b>select</b> <b>assessors</b> to be 'mental function champions', who would provide mainly telephone advice to other assessors on mental health issues as they related to the WCA's criteria. At the DWP's behest, Atos did this in 2011. The other legacy of his tenure was the introduction in 2011 of the 'personalised summary statement'. This {{was intended to be}} a written explanation to the claimant in plain English of how the assessor's recommendation had been reached, but the DWP decided not to send them to claimants; instead, the department sent a 'decision-makers justification' written by a civil servant. Nevertheless, the DWP insisted that assessors still write summaries, saying that decision-makers found them helpful when trying to understand the main reports. Professor Harrington also asked MIND, Mencap and the National Autistic Society to [...] "provide recommendations on refining the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors". Professor Harrington would listen to their ideas and then make recommendations to the DWP, once the recommendations had also been considered by an independent scrutiny group. However, the DWP's medical experts were not convinced by the evidence presented: they did not agree that the existing descriptors were not working properly; they saw no evidence that the proposed system would be any better; and they felt that the changes would make the assessment unnecessarily complicated. The DWP decided to set up an 'evidence-based review' — overseen from start to finish by Professor Harrington and to run in parallel with his annual reports for Parliament — to look at the proposed changes to the mental health criteria used in the WCA. But in his third and final report, Professor Harrington lamented that [...] "the evidence-based review has unfortunately taken longer to develop than is ideal". One reason it had taken longer to develop was that the scope of the review had been broadened to cover the physical descriptors as well, and had mutated into an evaluation of an entirely new assessment. This 'evidence-based review' did not publish its findings until December 2013 — three years after it had originally been conceived — by which time most of the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme had been completed. The review concluded that the proposed alternative assessment was less accurate than the WCA and that [...] "the WCA produced consistent results on the whole, and is an accurate indicator of work capability as compared with expert opinion". DWP ministers decided to replace Professor Harrington once he had submitted his final report in 2012 (although he maintained an oversight role with the evidence-based review that he had suggested be set up in 2010 and that published its findings at the end of 2013). As his successor they appointed Dr Paul Litchfield, another occupational health specialist and one who had played a key part in designing the WCA's mental and cognitive function descriptors in 2006.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge mining sensory {{evaluation}} data is a challenging process due to extreme sparsity of the data, {{and a large}} variation in responses from different members (called assessors) of the panel. The main goals of knowledge mining in sensory sciences are understanding the dependency of the perceived liking score on the concentration levels of flavors’ ingredients, identifying ingredients that drive liking, segmenting the panel into groups with similar liking preferences and optimizing flavors to maximize liking per group. Our approach employs (1) Genetic programming (symbolic regression) and ensemble methods to generate multiple diverse explanations of assessor liking preferences with confidence information; (2) statistical techniques to extrapolate using the produced ensembles to unobserved regions of the flavor space, and segment the assessors into groups which either have the same propensity to like flavors, or are driven by the same ingredients; and (3) two-objective swarm optimization to identify flavors which are well and consistently liked by a <b>selected</b> segment of <b>assessors...</b>|$|R

Methods. A systematic literature search was performed for articles describing interventions on FAs in primary care (Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO). Outcomes were morbidity, quality of life (QoL), and use of healthcare. Two independent <b>assessors</b> <b>selected</b> all randomized clinical trials (RCT) and assessed {{the quality of the}} selected RCTs. Results. Five primary care based RCTs were identified. Three RCTs used frequent attendance to select patients at risk of distress, major depression, and anxiety disorders. These RCTs applied psychological and psychiatric interventions and focused on undiagnosed psychiatric morbidity of FAs. Two of them found more depression-free days and a better QoL after treating major depressive disorder in FAs. No other RCT found any positive effect on morbidity or QoL. Two RCTs studied an intervention which focused on reducing frequent attendance. No intervention significantly lowered attendance. Due to the difference in study settings and the variation in methods of selecting patients, meta-analysis of the results was not possible. Conclusion. No study showed convincing evidence that an intervention improves QoL or morbidity of frequent attending primary care patients, although a small effect might be possible in a subgroup of depressed frequent attenders.

40|$|Utility {{functions}} {{in the form of}} tables or matrices have often been used to combine discretely rated decision-making criteria. Matrix elements are usually specified individually, so no one rule or principle can be easily stated for the utility function as a whole. A series of five matrices are presented that aggregate criteria two at a time using simple rules that express a varying degree of constraint of the lower rating over the higher. A further nine possible matrices were obtained by using a different rule either side of the main axis of the matrix to describe situations where the criteria have a differential influence on the outcome. Uncertainties in the criteria are represented by three alternative frequency distributions from which the <b>assessors</b> <b>select</b> the most appropriate. The output of the utility function is a distribution of rating frequencies that is dependent on the distributions of the input criteria. In pest risk analysis (PRA), seven of these utility functions were required to mimic the logic by which assessors for the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization arrive at an overall rating of pest risk. The framework enables the development of PRAs that are consistent and easy to understand, criticize, compare, and change.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{modified}} Rankin Scale (mRS) is {{the most}} prevalent outcome measure in stroke trials. Use of the mRS may be hampered by variability in grading. Previous estimates of {{the properties of the}} mRS have used diverse methodologies and may not apply to contemporary trial populations. We used a mock clinical trial design to explore inter- and intraobserver variability of the mRS. Methods: Consenting patients with stroke attending for outpatient review had the mRS performed by 2 independent assessors with pairs of <b>assessors</b> <b>selected</b> from a team of 3 research nurses and 4 stroke physicians. Before formal assessment, interviewers estimated disability based only on initial patient observation. Each patient was then randomized to undergo the mRS using standard assessment or a prespecified structured interview. The second interviewer in the pair reassessed the patient using the same method blinded to the colleague’s score. For each patient assessed, one rater was randomly assigned to video record their interview. After 3 months, this interviewer reviewed and regraded their original video assessment. Results: Across 100 paired assessments, interobserver agreement was moderate (k= 0. 57). Intraobserver variability was good (k= 0. 72) but less than would be expected from previous literature. Forty-nine assessments were performed using the structured interview approach with no significant difference between structured and standard mRS. Researchers were unable to reliably predict mRS from initial limited patient assessment (k= 0. 16). Conclusions: Despite availability of training and structured interview, there remains substantial interobserver variability in mRS grades awarded even by experienced researchers. Additional methods to improve mRS reliability are required. </p...|$|R

Methods. Reflection and critical analysis focusing on content analysis of Hong Kong and Australian reports relevant to aged care accreditation and the author’s experience of the Australian aged and health care accreditation systems. Results. The Australian experience suggests that an accreditation system leads to improved quality of care but does not maintain or improve quality on its own, nor does it prevent the occurrence of adverse events. It is most effective at developing a culture of staff and resident empowerment, continuous improvement, best practice, ongoing learning and innovative research. The relationship between accreditation and regulation of the industry sector, how standards are developed, <b>assessors</b> <b>selected</b> and trained are important considerations in its successful operation. Conclusions. Governments need to ensure efficient use of available resources while assuring the quality of services while industry needs to participate to ensure its relevance and competitiveness. Health care professionals, government, and industry stakeholders sometimes have competing interests but their first priority should be those to whom they provide care. Engaging elderly people, carers, and staff in values-based advocacy of independence, autonomy and quality care is needed to balance these competing interests. Valuing the contribution of elderly people together with a greater emphasis on researching the effectiveness of care should be the measure of success of the journey to quality that commences with the accreditation process...|$|R

Nine <b>selected</b> and trained <b>assessors</b> evaluated 13 sensory attributes using the Multiple Comparison Test. The appearance and flavor attributes of the papayas treated with CS and CMS were compared to the control or reference sample (R - fruit without coating) using a nine-point scale, which varied from 1 : less intense than R; 5 : equal to R; 9 : more intense than R. The samples were coded with three digit numbers and evaluated with repetition by a panel of assessors. In general, appearance was more affected by the coatings than flavor. Fruits coated with 3 and 5 % of both coatings kept the green color longer than the other coating’s concentrations, and at 5 % the color of the fruits was less uniform on the last evaluation day. The 3 and 5 % CS coating gave greater brightness to the fruits. 5 % CMS favored the presence of fungi and damaged the fruit surface at the 14 th day of storage. The CS coating at 5 % presented peeled surface during all experimental time. Changes in fruits’ flavor were perceived at the 12 th and 14 th days of storage.

Thirty-six reviews (with 52 meta-analyses) had adequate studies to compare results of noncomparative and comparative studies by using a hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic meta-regression model for each test comparison. In 10 meta-analyses, noncomparative studies ranked tests in the opposite order of comparative studies. A total of 25 meta-analyses showed more than a 2 -fold discrepancy in the relative diagnostic odds ratio between noncomparative and comparative studies. Differences in accuracy estimates between noncomparative and comparative studies were greater than expected by chance (P < 0. 001). A paucity of comparative studies limited exploration of direction in bias. Evidence derived from noncomparative studies often differs from that derived from comparative studies. Robustly designed studies in which all patients receive all tests or are randomly assigned to receive one or other of the tests should be more routinely undertaken and are preferred for evidence to guide test selection.

40|$|Introduction. The project "Risk {{assessment}} form policy to impact dimension - RAPID" funded by Executive Agency for Health and Consumers (EAHC) of DG SANCO is aiming at frame a full chain assessment method to evaluate impacts of policies on population health. Twomain phases have been planned: (1) an international survey of risk assessors and (2) risk assessment case-studies by country. Objectives. Phase 1 has posed {{the challenge for}} IFC-CNR unit to arrange a search strategy to provide an overall description of risk assessment practice in Italy. Phase 2 has strengthened the clinical experience and research in our Institute on cancer risk from Ionizing Radiation inMedical Imaging, through {{the building of a}} risk assessment model to evaluate the medical practice under present legal requirements on radiation protection, in Tuscany Region. Methods. During phase 1 a national survey of risk <b>assessors,</b> <b>selected</b> by Internet search of key words, collected data of interest using a validated questionnaire sent by email. In phase 2, local IFCCNR data were used, as collected during a campaign for prevention of cancer through the reduction of inappropriate ionising radiation medical examinations. The development of methods and tools is based on the re-construction of a rationale, where the variables of the assessment process are related, tested and validated. The model is then useful to explain the observed health outcomes, according to the underlying causal structure. Results. Recommendations for effective interventions on general practitioners and medical specialists practice should minimize cancers attributable to radiation exposures. The applied approach of a full chain risk assessment will be used for a training session addressed to the Italian risk experts who had joined the survey. Conclusions. Developing informed policies, which take into account the complexities and uncertainties involved in risk estimate, can result in the reduction of long-term cancer risk...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} assessing for manufacturing a small and medium enterprise of electronic industry case study in the Northeast of Thailand. Electronic industry produces integrated circuits products (IC). We use lean assessment tools with 14 lean technique and tools. The value of lean assessment are scoring system derived from the malcolm baldrige national quality award, the two-dimensioned scoring system composing of the process; approach, deployment, learning, and integration. There are reveal operations of each of lean techniques and tools, and the performance; the 0 - 4 level needed to be improved in depth and hence would reflect operations requiring sustainable outcomes. This lean assessment is a systematic approach, assessor come to sit, examine operations from a lean perspective and assessed the situation as prior. The purposes of this visit were to introduced to production or factory manager or window person of SMEs who gave assessor {{a tour of the}} plant. Assessor also got a chance to explain lean assessment criteria on the shop floor. <b>Assessor</b> <b>selects</b> a value streaming line that produce most goods or main production line to assess. Assessor takes 1 day to assess and discuss the lean assessment. As a result, the lean assessment survey should be adjusted to fit the systems adaptively. Three plants of electronic industries were leanness of 1. 06 or 26 %. Five plants of garment industry were leanness of 1. 13 or 28 %. Four plants of shoe industry were leanness of 1. 39 or 34 %. Shoe industry had high leanness all unless quick changeover and multi skill. The quick changeover and multi skill were high score on garment industry. Electronics industry has not the lead but second in visual management, 5 s, operation base layout, quick changeover, multi skill, standard operation procedures, and policy deployment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. An {{acceptable}} assessment must be both {{valid and}} reliable; the face {{validity of the}} Leicester assessment package has already been established. AIM. This study set out to test {{the reliability of the}} Leicester assessment package, and the factors influencing it, when used by multiple assessors to assess performance in general practice consultations. METHOD. Six randomly <b>selected</b> course organizer <b>assessors</b> simultaneously used the package to conduct independent assessments of the performance of five doctors of widely varying abilities in consultation with six simulated patients. The scores allocated were subjected to generalizability analysis. RESULTS. The mean scores allocated for consultation performance of individual doctors ranged from 51 % to 70 %, with the lower scores being allocated to the less experienced doctors. Scores of each assessor across the cases were examined for internal consistency and five of the six assessors consistently scored the doctors with an alpha coefficient of the minimum accepted level of 0. 80 or greater. The other assessor had a consistency of only 0. 22. Measurements of consistency within cases between markers indicated that the first case produced unreliable results (alpha coefficient 0. 25) but all other cases were scored consistently. Two independent assessors scoring eight consultations are the requisite numbers to achieve acceptable levels of reliability in a formal assessment process; seven consultations produce the minimum acceptable generalizability coefficient of 0. 80 plus the first 'non-counting' consultation. CONCLUSION. Required levels of reliability can be achieved when the package is used by multiple markers assessing the same consultations over a wide range of consultation performance. To achieve reliability only two hours of assessment time are required using the Leicester package compared with the previously regarded minimum of 32 hours. Although assessors can produce reliable scores with minimal training, intra-assessor reliability cannot be taken for granted and all assessors should be trained and calibrated before being sanctioned to conduct assessments, particularly for regulatory purposes. The Leicester assessment package has now been shown to be valid, reliable, feasible and easy to use in practice. It can, therefore, be recommended for use in both formative and summative assessment of consultation competence in general practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{coating of}} papayas with Cassava Starch (CS) and {{carboxymethyl}} starch (CMS) {{is an alternative}} to extend the shelf life of these fruits. This study evaluated {{the effect of the}} three different levels of CS and CMS (1, 3, and 5 %) on sensory characteristics of papayas during storage. Nine <b>selected</b> and trained <b>assessors</b> evaluated 13 sensory attributes using the Multiple Comparison Test. The appearance and flavor attributes of the papayas treated with CS and CMS were compared to the control or reference sample (R - fruit without coating) using a nine-point scale, which varied from 1 : less intense than R; 5 : equal to R; 9 : more intense than R. The samples were coded with three digit numbers and evaluated with repetition by a panel of assessors. In general, appearance was more affected by the coatings than flavor. Fruits coated with 3 and 5 % of both coatings kept the green color longer than the other coating’s concentrations, and at 5 % the color of the fruits was less uniform on the last evaluation day. The 3 and 5 % CS coating gave greater brightness to the fruits. 5 % CMS favored the presence of fungi and damaged the fruit surface at the 14 th day of storage. The CS coating at 5 % presented peeled surface during all experimental time. Changes in fruits’ flavor were perceived at the 12 th and 14 th days of storage. A less characteristic flavor and a bitter taste were noticed in the fruits coated with CS and CMS at 5 % at the 12 th day of storage. O revestimento de mamões por Fécula de Mandioca (FM) e carboximetilamido (CMA) é uma alternativa que visa prolongar a vida de prateleira dos frutos. Este estudo avaliou o efeito de três diferentes níveis de FM e CMA (1, 3 e 5 %) nas características sensoriais de mamão papaia durante o armazenamento. Nove provadores selecionados e treinados avaliaram 13 atributos sensoriais através do teste de comparação múltipla. Os atributos de aparência e sabor dos mamões tratados com FM e CMA foram comparados com a referência (R - sem revestimento) usando escalas de nove pontos, as quais variaram de 1 : menos intenso que R; 5 : igual a R; 9 : mais intenso que R. As amostras foram codificadas com número de três dígitos e avaliadas com repetição pelos provadores. Em geral, a aparência dos frutos foi mais afetada que o sabor pelos revestimentos utilizados. Frutos revestidos a 3 e 5 % de FM e CMA apresentaram coloração verde por mais tempo, mas a 5 % a cor foi menos uniforme no último dia de avaliação. Os revestimentos de FM a 3 e 5 % conferiram maior brilho aos frutos. O CMA a 5 % favoreceu a presença de fungos e injúrias na superfície no 14 º dia de armazenamento. O revestimento de FM a 5 % apresentou descascamento durante todo o período experimental. Alterações no sabor dos frutos foram percebidas aos 12 º e 14 º dias de armazenamento. Sabor menos característico e gosto amargo foram identificados nos frutos revestidos por FM e CMA a 5 % no 12 º dia de armazenamento...|$|R

"I, Thomas Carlyle, {{residing}} at Chelsea, presently Rector in the University of Edinburgh, {{from the}} love, favour and affection which I bear to that University, {{and from my}} interest in the advancement of education in my native Scotland, as elsewhere, for these and for other more peculiar reasons, which also I wish to record, do intend, and am now {{in the act of}} making to the said University, a bequest, as underwritten, of the estate of Craigenputtoch, which is now my property. Craigenputtoch lies {{at the head of the}} parish of Dunscore, in Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire. The extent is of about 1,800 acres; rental at present, on lease of nineteen years, is £250; the annual worth, with the improvements now in progress, is probably £300. Craigenputtoch was for many generations the patrimony of a family named Welsh, the eldest son usually a 'John Welsh,' in series going back, think some, to the famous John Welsh, son-in-law of the reformer Knox. The last male heir of the family was John Welsh, Esq., surgeon, Haddington. His one child and heiress was my late dear, magnanimous, much-loving, and, to me, inestimable wife, in memory of whom, and of her constant nobleness and piety towards him and towards me, I am now--she having been the last of her kindred--about to bequeath to Edinburgh University with whatever piety is in me this Craigenputtoch, which was theirs and hers, on the terms, and for the purposes, and under the conditions underwritten. Therefore I do mortify and dispose to and in favour of the said University of Edinburgh, for the foundation and endowment of ten equal Bursaries, to be called the 'John Welsh Bursaries,' in the said University, heritably and irredeemably, all and whole the lands of Upper Craigenputtoch. The said estate is not to be sold, but to be kept and administered as land, the net annual revenue of it to be divided into ten equal Bursaries, to be called, as aforesaid, the 'John Welsh Bursaries.' The Senatus Academicus shall bestow them on the ten applicants entering the University who, on strict and thorough examination and open competitive trial by examiners whom the Senatus will appoint for that end, are judged to show the best attainment of actual proficiency and the best likelihood of more in the department or faculty called of arts, as taught there. Examiners to be actual professors in said faculty, the fittest whom the Senatus can <b>select,</b> with fit <b>assessors</b> or coadjutors and witnesses, if the Senatus see good, and always the report of the said examiners to be minuted and signed, and to govern the appointments made, and to be recorded therewith. More specially I appoint that five of the 'John Welsh Bursaries' shall be given for the best proficiency in mathematics--I would rather say 'in mathesis,' if that were a thing to be judged of from competition--but practically above all in pure geometry, such being perennial, the symptom not only of steady application, but of a clear, methodic intellect, and offering in all epochs good promise for all manner of arts and pursuits. The other five Bursaries I appoint to depend (for the present and indefinitely onwards) on proficiency in classical learning, that is to say, in knowledge of Latin, Greek, and English, all of these, or any two of them. This also gives good promise of a young mind, but as I do not feel certain that it gives perennially or will perennially be thought in universities to give the best promise, I am willing that the Senatus of the University, in case of a change of its opinion on this point hereafter in the course of generations, shall bestow these latter five Bursaries on what it does then consider the most excellent proficiency in matters classical, or the best proof of a classical mind, which directs its own highest effort towards teaching and diffusing in the new generations that will come. The Bursaries to be open to free competition of all who come to study in Edinburgh University, and who have never been of any other University, the competition to be held on or directly before or after their first matriculation there. Bursaries to be always given on solemnly strict and faithful trial to the worthiest, or if (what in justice can never happen, though it illustrates my intention) the claims of two were absolutely equal, and could not be settled by further trial, preference is to fall in favour of the more unrecommended and unfriended under penalties graver than I, or any highest mortal, can pretend to impose, but which I can never doubt--as the law of eternal justice, inexorably valid, whether noticed or unnoticed, pervades all corners of space and of time--are very sure to be punctually exacted if incurred. This is to be the perpetual rule for the Senatus in deciding." ...|$|R
