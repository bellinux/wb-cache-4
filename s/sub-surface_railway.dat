5|$|The {{station was}} built with a {{connection}} to the <b>sub-surface</b> Metropolitan <b>Railway,</b> with the platform sunk below ground level; consequently there are considerable gradients leaving the station.

5|$|Yerkes {{also did}} not {{live to see the}} UERL's {{financial}} struggle during the first years after the opening of the new lines. Because of greatly over-optimistic pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers, the lines failed to generate the income expected and needed to fund the interest payments on the UERL's substantial borrowings. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26million of a predicted 60million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25million of a predicted 50million. For the DR, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55million.

500|$|In November 1890, {{with the}} C {{about to start}} operating, the CLR {{announced}} a new bill for the 1891 parliamentary session.

5|$|The {{technologies}} of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of <b>sub-surface</b> steam operated <b>railways.</b> Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited loading gauge and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|R

40|$|The London Underground {{network is}} {{a crucial part of}} the {{transportation}} system in one of only four ‘Alpha’ world cities. The other three – Paris, New York and Tokyo – also have such <b>sub-surface</b> <b>railway</b> transport systems that may benefit from this shape grammar station design process in a future research proposal. In London’s case, the passenger flow rates are the underlining factor in sizing infrastructure where passengers have access – it is therefore this criterion that provides the basis for the shape grammar formulation for the largest, oldest {{and one of the most}} complex underground systems in the world. The research aims to improve passenger fire evacuation times, with due cognisance of the growth of numbers using the system, and its present susceptibility to terrorist attacks taken into account. The proposed shape grammar approach will provide for generation of spatial layouts, based upon visual rules of shape recognition, replacement / union, their connectivity and spatial relationships. The paper concentrates on definition and implementation of novel shape grammar design rules that incorporate station planning design knowledge, and in particular also discusses designers’ fire risk assessment approach and related knowledge that is also needed to produce credible station design solutions. Development, to date, of the proposed artificially intelligent CAD environment is also described along with parallel theoretical research. The proposed CAD interface provides familiarity to the designer and avoids incompatibility issues regarding drawing exchange format between various software systems. The shape grammar layouts produced will be tested in SIMULEX, a commercially available evacuation package, and be compared against ‘traditionally’ designed layouts to demonstrate improvements of preliminary ‘reference’ designs, which follow the standard London Underground design process as a later stage of this research...|$|E
