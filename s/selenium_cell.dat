5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The <b>selenium</b> <b>cell</b> {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.|$|E
500|$|Although the <b>selenium</b> <b>cell</b> {{photometer}} was proving successful, it {{was difficult}} to use and not very sensitive. Illinois physics professor Jakob Kunz suggested that Stebbins try a photoelectric cell. [...] Kunz had been doing experimentation on an improved photoelectric cell which was alkali based. Kunz's cell was the predecessor of the modern day [...] "electric eye." [...] Stebbins left for a sabbatical in Europe in fall of 1912. While he was gone, Kunz and another Illinois physicists W.F. Schulz successfully tested a photoelectric cell photometer at the Observatory.|$|E

"She (May Stebbins) {{wrote down}} the numbers as the {{observer}} called them, but after some nights of recording a hundred readings just to get one magnitude, {{she said it was}} pretty slow business. I responded that someday we would do all this by electricity. That was a fatal remark. Thereafter she would often prod me with the question, [...] "When are you going to change to electricity?" [...] It happened that within two or three months, the Department of Physics gave an open house, and one of the exhibits was in (the) charge of a young instructor, F.C. Brown. He showed how, when he turned on a lamp to illuminate a <b>selenium</b> <b>cell,</b> a bell would ring, when the lamp was off, the bell would stop. Here was the idea: Why not turn on a star to a cell on a telescope and measure a current?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Gray {{conceived}} of a primitive closed-circuit television system {{that he called}} the [...] "telephote". Pictures would be focused on an array of <b>selenium</b> <b>cells</b> and signals from the <b>selenium</b> <b>cells</b> would be transmitted to a distant station on separate wires. At the receiving end each wire would open or close a shutter to recreate the image.|$|R

500|$|Upon {{his return}} from sabbatical in August 1913, Stebbins ended his {{pioneering}} work with the <b>selenium</b> <b>cell</b> and began working with Kunz on the new photometer. A number of other notable astronomical discoveries occurred at the observatory through the years. [...] In 1915 Stebbins' object of study became the star involved in Myers' first big discovery at the observatory, Beta Lyrae. He thus began an aggressive research program produced a series of papers in the Astrophysical Journal on eclipsing binaries Lambda Tauri, Algol, 1H Cassiopeiae (HR 8926), ellipsoidal variables π5 Orionis, and b Persei, and Nova Aquilae (V603 Aquilae) in 1918. Stebbins and Kunz also travelled to Wyoming to study the Solar eclipse of June 8, 1918. Dr. Elmer Dershem joined the Observatory staff in 1917 and rebuilt the photometer {{in the summer of}} 1919. By 1922, Charles Wylie completed the first Illinois astronomy doctorate for his photoelectric studies of the Cepheid Η Aquilae, and Sigma Aquilae noting its variations due to tidal distortions.|$|E
500|$|Stebbins and Fay C. Brown {{soon became}} friends and in time, {{they had a}} <b>selenium</b> <b>cell</b> {{positioned}} on the [...] telescope at the observatory. In the summer of 1907, after several attempts, the two achieved a light curve for Earth's moon and measured the moon's brightness during a lunar eclipse. This {{marked the first time}} in America that electricity was used to measure astronomical brightness. [...] Later Stebbins went further, discovering that by cooling the cell to zero degrees Fahrenheit he would double the cell sensitivity and diminish irregularities in the circuit tenfold, still further, by reducing the size of the cell the irregularities were reduced more. [...] The pair went on to detect stellar intensity and activity that were previously unrecorded. [...] In 1909 their observations of Algol detected {{for the first time the}} second minimum as well as limb brightening. The coming of Comet Halley in 1910 allowed Stebbins, in May, to use his selenium photometer to study the comet. Two years later Stebbins used the photometer and discovered four stars to be eclipsing binary stars: Beta Aurigae, Spica, Alpha Coronae Borealis and Delta Orionis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, Boris Rosing and {{his student}} Vladimir Zworykin created {{a system that}} used a {{mechanical}} mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, [...] "very crude images" [...] over wires to the [...] "Braun tube" [...] (cathode ray tube or [...] "CRT") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner, [...] "the sensitivity was not enough and the <b>selenium</b> <b>cell</b> was very laggy".|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} 3 -D solar <b>cells</b> using <b>selenium</b> {{for the light}} {{absorber}} layer. Selenium is a p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 1.8 and 2 eV for crystal and amorphous states, respectively. Flat <b>selenium</b> solar <b>cells</b> were researched by Nakada in the mid- 1980 s [22, 23]. The <b>selenium</b> solar <b>cells</b> with a superstrate structure showed the best efficiency of 5.01 % under AM 1.5 G illumination. In our work, the selenium layer was prepared by electrochemical deposition (ECD), a non-vacuum method, resulting in the extremely thin absorber (ETA) [11 – 21]. The similarly structured solar <b>cells</b> (3 -D <b>selenium</b> ETA solar <b>cells</b> deposited on nanocrystalline TiO 2 electrodes using electrochemical deposition) were also studied by Tennakone et al. [11], which were composed with hole-conducting layer of CuSCN. The Se layer worked just to be a photoabsorber.|$|R
50|$|The {{receiver}} was a {{parabolic mirror}} with <b>selenium</b> <b>cells</b> at its focal point. Conducted {{from the roof}} of the Franklin School to Bell's laboratory at 1325 'L' Street, this was the world's first formal wireless telephone communication (away from their laboratory), thus making the photophone the world's earliest known voice wireless telephone systems, at least 19 years ahead of the first spoken radio wave transmissions. Before Bell and Tainter had concluded their research in order {{to move on to the}} development of the Graphophone, they had devised some 50 different methods of modulating and demodulating light beams for optical telephony.|$|R
