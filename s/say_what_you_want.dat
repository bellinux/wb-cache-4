And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E
500|$|... "If U Seek Amy" [...] {{runs through}} a dance-oriented beat and {{features}} many instruments, including keyboards, snare, bass drums, electric guitars and timpani. According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song has a beat of 130 {{beats per minute}} and is written in the key of A minor. Spears's vocal range spans from G3-C5. In the song, Spears seems {{to be looking for}} a woman named Amy in a club. It has been suggested that Amy is either Amy Winehouse or an alter ego of Spears herself. The verses end with the hookline [...] "Hahahehehahaho", which, according to Poppy Cossins of The Sun, is fitting to [...] "the album's [...] overtone". The chorus begins with the lines [...] "Love me, hate me / <b>Say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> about me", a reference to the public's perception and fascination with Spears' life. This presents Spears both as [...] "an object of desire and a punching bag". According to Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, this line also alludes to the public image of British singer Amy Winehouse.|$|E
500|$|... "Do What U Want" [...] is a mid-tempo synthpop and R track, drawing {{influence}} from 1980s-inspired throbbing synths and an electronic beat. Eric R. Danton of Rolling Stone {{described it as}} a [...] "muscular club beat". James Montgomery from MTV News said that a [...] "lurching, lascivious beat" [...] was the main backbone of the song, interspersed with Gaga's loud-voiced vocals, a [...] "corky" [...] chorus and Kelly's [...] "cool, coital" [...] singing. The song's chorus is built around arpeggios. Complex described its [...] "Do what you want, what you want with my body" [...] hook as [...] "catchy and somewhat raunchy". The song's lyrics represent themes of sexual submissiveness, with Gaga telling off detractors that her thoughts, dreams, and feelings are her own, no matter what one does with her body. Jim Farber of New York Daily News suggested [...] "Do What U Want" [...] to be a response to [...] "everyone who ever made a tart comment about her — which, by now, involves half the planet". Gaga and Kelly alternate singing the lines [...] "Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Write what you want, <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> about me/ If you want you know that I'm not sorry".|$|E

The expression tongue in cheek refers to a statement that is not to be taken entirely seriously – something said or done with subtle ironic or sarcastic humour. A tongue twister is a phrase made specifically to be very difficult to pronounce. Aside from being a medical condition, [...] "tongue-tied" [...] means being unable to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> due to confusion or restriction. The phrase [...] "cat got your tongue" [...] refers to when a person is speechless. To [...] "bite one's tongue" [...] is a phrase which describes holding back an opinion to avoid causing offence. A [...] "slip of the tongue" [...] refers to an unintentional utterance, such as a Freudian slip. The [...] "gift of tongues" [...] refers to when one is uncommonly gifted to be able to speak in a foreign language, often as a type of spiritual gift. Speaking in tongues is a common phrase used to describe glossolalia, which is to make smooth, language-resembling sounds that is no true spoken language itself.

Nevertheless, Anne keenly enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands; though alone she never found it lonely; her imagination peopled her path with merry companions, and with these she carried on a gay, pretended conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations are apt to be in real life, where people sometimes fail most lamentably to talk up to the requirements.

5000|$|The {{release of}} the Sex Pistols' first single [...] "Anarchy in the UK" [...] in October 1976 led to a wave of punk bands in Birmingham as {{in the rest of}} the country. The Accused {{released}} a single EP in 1979, their self-deprecating style illustrated by their two most popular songs: the self-explanatory [...] "We're Crap", and [...] "W.M.P.T.E." [...] - a tribute to the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive. A review of The Sussed in 1978 called them [...] "a shambles", concluding [...] "every town should have one band like The Sussed. Any town with two is in dead trouble" [...] Dansette Damage were best known for their classic debut single, the [...] "double b side" [...] "N.M.E."/"The Only Sound", that became a favourite of John Peel and his producer John Walters and was later learned to have been produced by Robert Plant. The all-male Dangerous Girls started in 1978 with a post-punk sound influenced by Public Image Ltd, perversely moving in an increasingly punk direction for their series of singles, that were re-released on three compilation albums in 2001 and 2002. Of wider long term significance were The Killjoys, who were led by future Dexys Midnight Runners singer Kevin Rowland and grew out of an earlier band called Lucy and the Lovers in 1976. The success of their wild and snarling first single [...] "Johnny won't go to Heaven" [...] in 1977 saw the NME declare Rowland to be Johnny Rotton's successor as the voice of punk protest, but Rowland was already expressing dissatisfaction with punk's uniformity, complaining that [...] "The original idea of punk was to be different and <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> ... not just to copy everybody else". By 1978, in an early sign of the uncompromising eccentricity of Rowland's later career, the Killjoys were inspiring the hatred of punk audiences by performing Bobby Darin covers and country and western music at punk venues like London's 100 Club.|$|R

[...] "It is scripted," [...] she said. [...] "They basically will call you names, berate you, curse at you until they get <b>you</b> to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> they <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to say."

I don't know what it is, and don't want to; but when a prisoner comes down here, it is always because they want to get something out of him, or they want to finish with him for good and all. You see you are below the level of the moat here. The water comes at ordinary times to within six inches of that slit up there. And in wet weather it happens sometimes that the stream which feeds the moat swells, and if it has been forgotten to open the sluice gates of the moat, it will rise ten feet before morning. I once knew a prisoner drowned in the cell above this." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Gaskarth, [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> Me (Dead?)" [...] is a up-tempo {{track that}} begins the album with [...] "a great guitar hook {{and lots of}} energy." [...] He said the song talks about [...] "feeling like you're being {{stretched}} to your limits by somebody. Gaskarth visited Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo at his house and ended up co-writing [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". He called Cuomo [...] "such a cool guy to work with." [...] Gaskarth said the track was [...] "an ode to {{having a good time}} and not taking yourself too seriously." [...] Barakat called the track [...] "a great song ... It has a cool Weezer/All Time Low/party hybrid-vibe to it." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Forget About It" [...] details [...] "that place in a relationship where people have been together for a really long time and they're afraid to let go." [...] Despite this, he said it was [...] "a totally fun song." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Guts" [...] was [...] "about finding within yourself the ability to <b>say</b> and do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> no matter <b>what</b> the repercussions might be." [...] Maja Ivarsson from The Sounds provides guest vocals on the track. Gaskarth said Ivarsson was [...] "someone I’ve always respected vocally". He added that the pair [...] "both sound really similar ... she definitely sounds like a girl and I sorta sound like a girl so there’s a weird mix that happens but trust me it works for the song." [...] He called the track [...] "a departure for us as it's more universal and timeless than we've ever been." ...|$|R
