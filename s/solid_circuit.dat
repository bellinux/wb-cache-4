30|$|In Fig.  13, {{the natural}} current {{crossing}} {{point of the}} inverter fault current appeared at 1.0018  s. The progress of the DC circuit breaker included detection, looking up the <b>solid</b> state <b>circuit</b> breaker database, and the auxiliary switching action. Therefore, the waiting time for the DC breaker to act is the setting time minus the delay times caused by detection and looking up the database. The simulation, detection, looking-up the database and {{the action of the}} <b>solid</b> state <b>circuit</b> breaker were treated as instantaneous, namely, they were completed within one simulation step that ranged from 10  μs to 50  μs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to use a <b>solid</b> state <b>circuit</b> breaker for the {{improvement}} of transient stability margin. Long distance AC transmission is often subject to stability problems, which limits the transmission capability. Interconnected power systems suffer from weakly damped swings between synchronous generator and sub systems. The development of modern power system has lead to an increasing complexity in the study of power system and also presents new challenges to power system stability and in particular to the aspects of transient stability and small signal stability. Transient stability control plays a significant role in ensuring the stable operation of power systems in the event of large disturbances and faults and is thus a significant area of research. This study investigates the improvement of transient stability of a two area system, using <b>Solid</b> State <b>Circuit</b> Breaker which is capable of fast switching in case of faults and thus controlling the real and reactive power flows in a faulted transmission line. Simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simulink environment for two area system model with <b>Solid</b> State <b>Circuit</b> Breaker to analyze the effects of SSCB on transient stability performance of the system. From the simulation results, swing curves of the three phase faulted power system without SSCB gets increases monotonically and thus the system can be considered as unstable whereas the swing curves of the system with an SSCB reaches to a steady state...|$|R

5000|$|Valve {{amplifier}} circuits {{are significantly}} different from broadband <b>solid</b> state <b>circuits.</b> <b>Solid</b> state devices have a very low output impedance which allows matching via a broadband transformer covering a large range of frequencies, for example 1.8 to 30 MHz. With either class C or AB operation, these must include low pass filters to remove harmonics. While the proper low pass filter must be switch selected for the frequency range of interest, the result {{is considered to be}} a [...] "no tune" [...] design. Valve amplifiers have a tuned network that serves as both the low pass harmonic filter and impedance matching to the output load. In either case, both solid state and valve devices need such filtering networks before the RF signal is output to the load.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a number of}} experiments with superconducting cir- cuits containing small Josephson junctions. The circuits are made out of aluminum islands which are interconnected with a very thin insulating alu- minum oxide layer. The connections form a Josephson junction. The current trough the junction {{is related to the}} superconducting phase difference across the junction and described by the well-known Josephson relation. The char- acteristic energy scale for this effect is the Josephson energy, which is a measure for the strength of the coupling of the islands. Due to the parallel plate geometry of the junction a capacitance is formed. This capacitance leads to a charging effect. The characteristic energy scale for this effect is given by the charging energy. With the shadow evaporation technique it is possible to make the Josephson junction area very small and the two characteristic energy scales of the same order of magnitude. Charge and phase are conju- gate variables. Therefore a circuit containing such small Josephson junctions exhibits quantum effects. The microfabrication technique used in this the- sis allows fabrication of <b>solid</b> <b>circuits</b> with controlled quantum mechanical behavior. Applied Science...|$|R
