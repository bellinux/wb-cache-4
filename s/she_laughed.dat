While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> to herself {{about the prospect of}} having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age, as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.|$|E
500|$|According to Jean-Claude Déquéant, Farmer showed limited enthusiasm {{during the}} demo {{recordings}} and declared: [...] "The voice was surprisingly present and <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> after each take when listening". Dahan was satisfied, because Farmer {{had a clear}} and deep voice and could easily reach high notes. Initial rehearsals were held at Dahan's home. Dahan has said of these rehearsals: [...] "There was a large room with a piano and there we repeated the staging of the song. Mylène {{had a hard time}} understanding all this, we had to teach her everything, starting with the choreography [...] This probably did not look very professional." ...|$|E

The press came to refer to the three, who made numerous joint public appearances, as the [...] "Movement widows". Evers-Williams and King were frequent guests at Medgar Evers College, and Shabazz occasionally visited the King Center in Atlanta. Writing about Shabazz, Evers-Williams described her as a [...] "free spirit, in the best sense of the word. When <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> she had this beauty; when she smiled, it lit up the whole room." ...|$|E

500|$|The anglicized name Isaac is a {{transliteration}} of the Hebrew term Yiṣḥāq which literally means [...] "He laughs/will laugh." [...] Ugaritic texts {{dating from}} the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent smile of the Canaanite deity El. Genesis, however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac's parents, Abraham and Sarah, rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell {{on his face and}} laughed when God (Hebrew, Elohim) imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later, when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when God questioned Abraham about it.|$|E
500|$|Following {{her first}} {{appearance}} in 1969, Driver remained {{in the role of}} Betty continuously. She suggested in 1999 that if she gave up she would die [...] "within a month from sheer boredom". In a 2006 interview <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> off the notion of retirement, saying: [...] "From day one on The Street everyone has been very kind to me. In fact, I'm godmother to Bill Roache's son. So as long as they want me, I'm happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family." [...] She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the News of the World reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress's 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was {{very much a part of}} plans for the series' upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations. Driver died on 15 October 2011, having appeared in over 2,800 episodes of Coronation Street.|$|E
500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

2500|$|On November 11, 1961, Baez played {{her first}} major New York concert at a sold-out {{performance}} at Town Hall.

2500|$|In Stuart Lake's best-selling biography, [...] (1931), Earp {{added to}} the story. He {{is quoted as saying}} that Holliday's girlfriend, [...] "Big Nose Kate" [...] Horony, devised a diversion. She {{procured}} a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol. However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed [...] "a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room." [...] <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> at the idea of [...] "a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earhart's {{ideas on}} {{marriage}} were liberal {{for the time}} as she believed in equal responsibilities for both breadwinners and pointedly kept her own name rather than being referred to as [...] "Mrs. Putnam". When The New York Times, per the rules of its stylebook, insisted on referring to her as Mrs. Putnam, <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> it off. Putnam also learned {{that he would be}} called [...] "Mr. Earhart". There was no honeymoon for the newlyweds as Earhart was involved in a nine-day cross-country tour promoting autogyros and the tour sponsor, Beech-Nut chewing gum. Although Earhart and Putnam never had children, he had two sons by his previous marriage to Dorothy Binney (1888–1982), a chemical heiress whose father's company, Binney & Smith, invented Crayola crayons: the explorer and writer David Binney Putnam (1913–1992) and George Palmer Putnam, Jr. (1921–2013). Earhart was especially fond of David, who frequently visited his father at their family home, which was on the grounds of The Apawamis Club in Rye, New York. George had contracted polio shortly after his parents' separation and was unable to visit as often.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Reuters writer Daniel Carlson {{said the}} show was [...] "exactly {{as bad as you}} would fear". Carlson said the jokes were bad and that delivery from the actors is too exaggerated; although he praised Matt Lucas, he said Maguire and Lucas were inappropriately over-the-top. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the show a [...] "relentless, mediocre spoofery that so desperately wants to remind us of Monty Python and the Holy Grail". However, Gilbert said the show might work better in half-hour increments, rather than in the one-hour premiere with [...] "Wench Trouble" [...] and [...] "Golden Powers". Kate Ward of Entertainment Weekly said although the show's premise had promise, she did not particularly like the execution. Ward said Matt Lucas's character [...] "came off as Dr. Evil light", but said Sean Maguire was charming and that <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> at some of the [...] "juvenile jokes", including Horst Draper, the name of a prisoner accused of raping horses. Boston Herald reviewer Mark A. Perigard complimented the show's high production values, but said, [...] "What was spent on sets didn't go into the script." [...] He also said the concept of a comedy swords-and-fantasy show is redundant because even serious shows, like [...] and , are comedies to an extent.|$|E

[...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] when Abram was ninety-nine years old, God {{declared}} his new name: [...] "Abraham"– [...] "a father of many nations", {{and gave him}} the covenant of circumcision. God gave Sarai the new name [...] "Sarah", and blessed her. Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child [...] "Isaac" [...] (Hebrew yitschaq, [...] "laughter") and circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, [...] "God hath made me to laugh, [...] all that hear will laugh with me." [...] Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company. Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked.|$|E
