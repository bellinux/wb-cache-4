25|$|The {{most likely}} {{reason for the}} {{overheating}} of the port engine was the plate heat exchanger getting clogged by small pieces of coal that had washed overboard from the cargo hold and entered the cooling system via the port side <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> The starboard engine was not affected because it used a separate sea water intake {{in the bottom of}} the vessel. Another possible cause was the development of hairline cracks in the cylinder liner or head due to large variations in engine load, allowing hot exhaust gases to mix with the cooling water.|$|E

2500|$|Following his VC investiture, Michell's medal {{was placed}} in storage along with other {{possessions}} in his <b>sea</b> <b>chest,</b> which he had left with the proprietors of the boarding house that he stayed in while in Sydney. He intended to have his belongings forwarded to him once he had settled in New Zealand but lost contact with the boarding house proprietors. His medal remained missing until around 1912, when it was purchased at an auction in London. His family attempted {{to negotiate with the}} owner of the medal for the return of the medal but it took the intervention of the Duke of York, before they were successful and it was purchased in 1928. [...] His medal is now displayed in the West Coast Historical Museum in Hokitika.|$|E

50|$|In 1966 Thalatta {{was entirely}} {{restored}} and re-rigged {{to take on}} a role as a schoolship under the flag of the East Coast Sail Trust. The barge's former cargo space was converted into communal living quarters where young people sleep in hammocks and keep their belongings in big wooden <b>sea</b> <b>chests.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} a crew leave a ship so quietly. They sneaked over the rail one after another, {{taking care not to}} bang their <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> too heavily. They looked our way, but not one had the stomach to come up and offer to shake hands with the mate as is usual.|$|R
50|$|At the bow, all of {{the planks}} taper to butt the stem. The stem is carved from a single curved oak log to form the {{cutwater}} and has one land for each plank. The inside of the stem is hollowed into a v shape so {{the inside of the}} rivets can be reached during construction or repair. Each of the crossbeams has a ledge cut about 25 mm wide and deep to take a removable section of decking. <b>Sea</b> <b>chests</b> were placed on top of the decking to use when rowing. Most likely on longer voyages <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> were secured below decks to act as ballast when sailing. The centre section of the keel has little rocker and together with flat midships transverse section the hull shape is suited to medium to flat water sailing. When sailing downwind in strong winds and waves, directional control would be poor, so it is likely that some reefing system was used to reduce sail area. In such conditions the ship would take water aboard at an alarming rate if sailed at high speed.|$|R

"There," [...] {{said the}} landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old <b>sea</b> <b>chest</b> that did double {{duty as a}} wash-stand and centre table; [...] "there, make {{yourself}} comfortable now; and good night to ye." [...] I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.|$|E
50|$|Longships {{were not}} fitted with benches. When rowing, the crew sat on <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> (chests {{containing}} their personal possessions) {{that would otherwise}} take up space. The chests were made {{the same size and}} were the perfect height for a Viking to sit on and row. Longships had hooks for oars to fit into, but smaller oars were also used, with crooks or bends to be used as oarlocks. If there were no holes then a loop of rope kept the oars in place.|$|R
40|$|Historically, fouling organisms {{on ships}} {{have been a}} major source of {{introduced}} species (Carlton 1979 a, 1979 b, 1987, 1989). Modern anti-fouling paints and high ship speeds greatly reduce the amount of fouling today. However, fouling is often common in <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> and at certain points on the bottom. We sampled tankers during routine maintenance in dry dock, selected to estimate the potential range of fouling and diversity of fouling organisms. 7 B. Methods We sampled the fouling communities of two ships in dry dock: the S/R Baytown (in San Francisco Bay), which had not been cleaned in dry dock for approximately 2 years; and the S/R Benicia (in Portland), which had been cleaned in dry dock within about 6 months. The S/R Baytown had remained within San Francisco Bay for several months without making an ocean voyage prior to haul out, providing time for further accumulation of fouling organisms. Representative patches of fouling communities were scraped from the bottoms of the ships within 6 hours of haul out and before any cleaning had commenced. The <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> and strainers of the ambient water intakes were also sampled. All samples were preserved in 10 % formaldehyde and returned to the laboratory for sorting and identification using a dissectin...|$|R
5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{detected}} in New Zealand {{in the port}} of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first incident of C.mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere. Since then, more well-established populations of C.mutica {{have been found in}} Port Lyttelton in 2006, and in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington Harbour in 2007. Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls of vessels in other ports, though they did not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C.mutica in the Atlantic through ballast water in the <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> of international shipping.|$|R

60|$|When Doctor Walker had departed, the Admiral packed all his {{possessions}} {{back into his}} <b>sea</b> <b>chest</b> {{with the exception of}} one little brass-bound desk. This he unlocked, and took from it a dozen or so blue sheets of paper all mottled over with stamps and seals, with very large V. R.'s printed upon the heads of them. He tied these carefully into a small bundle, and placing them in the inner pocket of his coat, he seized his stick and hat.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{singular}} sight which met {{his eyes as}} he entered the sitting-room of the Admiral. A great <b>sea</b> <b>chest</b> stood open in the center, and all round upon the carpet were little piles of jerseys, oil-skins, books, sextant boxes, instruments, and sea-boots. The old seaman sat gravely amidst this lumber, turning it over, and examining it intently; while his wife, with the tears running silently down her ruddy cheeks, sat upon the sofa, her elbows upon her knees and her chin upon her hands, rocking herself slowly backwards and forwards.|$|E
5000|$|The museum {{created the}} central {{core of a}} ship {{depicting}} a mast, saloon, galley and cabins. The ships figureheads are on display along with the boats; the prominent figurehead displayed, a male figure, once decorated the ship, the [...] "California". In addition, nautical trappings, a number of ships in bottles and <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> are also on display. Paintings of ships (docked either in Hull, Antwerp, Hong Kong or elsewhere), done by local artists who were specially commissioned by the captain of every ship, are exhibited in the museum. Models of ships of different time periods are displayed on a uniform scale so {{that the difference between}} a Baltic schooner and an ocean-going windjammer could be easily discerned.|$|R
5000|$|Sado Shima-dansu: These chests were prized {{as among}} the finest {{examples}} of tansu craftsmanship. With funa-dansu (<b>sea</b> <b>chests)</b> as an experience base, tansuyas {{in the town of}} Ogi on Sado Island applied their skill to creating both merchant and clothing chests from the later Edo Period. Other than using thick iron hardware incorporating a four diamonds motif cut into the drawer handle back plates, ogi-dansu often evidence ships' cabinet joinery, atypical of other tansu not crafted on the Japan Sea coast. Though late as a production center, tansu makers in the town of Yahata on Sado crafted Kiri chests primarily for the trousseau clothing of merchant families, with unique hardware from the early 20th century.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{historical}} and continuing role of biofouling in marine species invasions through the translocation of marine species between disparate bioregions and/or facilitation of species spread in a recipient region. Factors that influence the process of translocation on a vessel or other biofouled vectors, and how these are influenced by modern antifouling practices and maritime activity, are also reviewed. Most maritime vessels and sectors were found to pose some risk, even on well-maintained ships, often through the establishment of biofouling aggregations in niches such as <b>sea</b> <b>chests,</b> internal <b>sea</b> water systems and areas where antifouling paint is not applied or becomes damaged. Measures {{that can be used}} to manage biofouling, and therefore effectively reduce the risk of translocation of invasive marine species, are discussed...|$|R

6000|$|So, by {{the light}} of the wildly {{swinging}} slush-lamp, to the tumult on deck and to cries of [...] "She's sinking!" [...] I proceeded to ransack my sea-chest for suitable garments. Also, since they would never use them again, I ransacked the <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> of my shipmates. Working quickly but collectedly, I took nothing but the warmest and stoutest of clothes. I put on the four best woollen shirts the forecastle boasted, three pairs of pants, and three pairs of thick woollen socks. So large were my feet thus incased that I could not put on my own good boots. Instead, I thrust on Nicholas Wilton's new boots, which were larger and even stouter than mine. Also, I put on Jeremy Nalor's pea jacket over my own, and, outside of both, put on Seth Richard's thick canvas coat which I remembered he had fresh-oiled only a short while previous.|$|R
40|$|The AUV (autonomous {{underwater}} vehicle) of the University of Canterbury {{targets to}} discover any foreign organisms residing on the <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> of ships, which cause a {{risk for the}} domestic biodiversity, and removes them. With {{the design of the}} AUV finished, the primary goal {{of this paper is to}} design control software that stabilizes the vehicle and minimizes the error in the desired trajectory. The dynamical model with implemented assumptions ultimately leads to a decoupled system of non-linear equations in three directions: surge, heave and yaw. For this system, experiments are designed (but not yet successfully accomplished) to identify the system parameters. With respect to control, a feedback linearization is firstly applied to a 1 D case, which results in a satisfactory PIDcontroller, taking into account parameter perturbation and noise contamination. Finally, the under actuated problem in the 2 D situation is evaluated, for which a path planning method and a state feedback control method is derived...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned {{underwater}} vehicles (UUVs) {{have received}} worldwide attention and been {{widely used in}} various applications. In this paper, a recently developed low cost UUV prototype at the University of Canterbury is introduced, which is designed specifically for shallow water tasks, especially for inspecting and cleaning <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> of ships for bio-security purpose. The main hull of the UUV is made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), with a 400 mm diameter and 800 mm length. External frames mount two horizontal propellers, four vertical thrusters and power is derived from onboard batteries. The maximum thrust force of up to 10 kg that {{is provided by the}} propellers can generate a forward/backward speed of up to 1. 4 m/s for the 112 kg UUV. The vertical thrusters provide depth control with a max thrust force of 20 kg. The UUV is equipped with a range of sensors capable of sensing its instantaneous temperature, depth, attitude and surrounding environment. Costing less than US$ 10, 000 for a prototype, it provides an excellent platform for further underwater vehicle development targeting shallow water tasks with a working depth up to 20 m...|$|R
50|$|Control {{strategies}} include coating all surfaces with an antifoulant such as copper-based {{epoxy paint}} or hot-dip galvanizing. Periodic inspection and replacement of grates and screens also reduces the risk. Increasing {{the size of}} the sea chests by 20 to 30 percent may delay the onset of serious problems that could force an engine shutdown. Thermal treatment is a highly effective strategy for the control of zebra mussels (McMahon et al. 1995). Thermal treatment may include retrofitting a closed loop system to recirculate the heated water to the <b>sea</b> <b>chest</b> or the addition of a second <b>sea</b> <b>chest</b> system, allowing engine cooling water to be discharged through the idle <b>sea</b> <b>chest.</b> Recirculation of engine cooling water as a thermal control strategy has proved extremely effective in controlling zebra mussels (Palermo 1992, U.S. Coast Guard 1994).|$|E

50|$|After a {{difficult}} passage around Cape Horn, the Essex {{arrived in the}} Pacific Ocean in January 1820. On 20 November 1820, in a remote area of the ocean, some 1500 nmi km west of the Galapagos Islands, the Essex was struck twice by a huge sperm whale, estimated to be 85 ft in length. With only three shipkeepers and the crew of Chase's whaleboat on board to repair their damaged vessel, the Essex began taking on water following the second collision with the whale. The crew abandoned the sinking vessel, taking the navigational equipment and Pollard's and Chase's <b>sea</b> <b>chests</b> with them. Meanwhile, Pollard and Joy were hunting smaller whales near the ship, and on their return found the Essex had capsized. The crew chopped off the masts (a necessary move that would enable the ship to stay upright for a longer time) and outfitted the whaleboats with sails and masts using the Essex's spars and sails. They also hastened to retrieve what provisions they could and divided them equally so that each whaleboat had 200 pounds of hardtack, 65 gallons of freshwater, and two Galapagos tortoises. The crew was divided into three whaleboats commanded by Pollard, Chase, and Joy and set sail with provisions estimated to last them 60 days. Pollard, Chase, and Joy set up a council to decide which direction to sail in. The closest islands were the Marquesas Islands, about 1200 mi west of their position but in those days the inhabitants there were believed to practice cannibalism. Pollard suggested sailing to the Society Islands, which were further away but presumed to be safer. However, {{on the grounds that}} very little was actually known about these islands, Chase and Joy disagreed, proposing instead to sail south far enough to pick up a band of variable breezes that would take them to South America. Once again, Captain Pollard reluctantly yielded to their arguments.|$|R
