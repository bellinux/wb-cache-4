40|$|Due to {{a variety}} of factors, it is {{notoriously}} difficult to implement effective physical activity interventions in the workplace. The aim of the proposed symposium is to highlight relevant issues and challenges associated with implementing rather novel workplace physical activity intervention designed to increase physical activity participation and psychological well-being among <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees.</b> The studies presented will have used a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods to a) highlight issues of implementation and feasibility, b) evaluate the effectiveness of a specific intervention, c) examine potential mechanisms underlying physical activity adoption and adherence and d) discuss pertinent challenges in changing physical activity behaviour in the workplace. The first paper discusses components of, and challenges associated with, the design and implementation of a 16 -week lunchtime walking interventions with <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees.</b> The second presentation provides a summary of the evaluation of the above mentioned intervention using quantitative methods. The third presentation uses a qualitative approach to tap into potential mechanisms underpinning physical activity behaviour change in <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees.</b> Using examples from international research, the final presentation considers how aspects of work culture can act as both a promoter and inhibitor of physical activity engagement in the workplace. This series of studies show that the workplace is a viable, but also very challenging, setting for promoting physical activity among {{a large segment of the}} adult working population...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prevalence of {{sedentary}} occupations is on {{the rise}} and sedentary time is independently associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases. Interventions conducted in the work site have potential for reducing prolonged bouts of <b>sedentary</b> time amongst <b>employees</b> working in <b>sedentary</b> jobs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the efficacy of a 12 -week, worksite intervention for reducing time spent sedentary amongst full-time, <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees.</b> Methods: Forty, full-time, <b>sedentary,</b> <b>employees</b> working at desk dependent jobs were randomized to either: 1) an intervention group (N= 23; 47. 6 ± 9. 9 yrs; 94. 1 % female; 33. 2 ± 4. 5 kg/m 2); 2) or wait list control group (N= 17; 42. 6 ± 8. 9 yrs; 86. 9 % female; 31. 7 ± 4. 9 kg/m 2). Participants in the 12 -week intervention group received an under the desk, portable pedal exercise machine, a pedometer, and access to an internet-based program designed to improve self-efficacy, self-monitoring and social support for physical activity. Time spent sedentary was measured objectively by a StepWatch activity monitor. Results: The intervention group significantly reduced daily minutes sedentary time (P< 0. 01) and percent daily time spent sedentary (P= 0. 03) compared to the control group from baseline to 12 weeks. The intervention group also significantly increased percent daily time spent in moderate intensity activity (P= 0. 04) compared to the control group. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that the intervention was efficacious at reducing time spent sedentary amongst full-time <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees.</b> These findings are significant due to the growing number of sedentary jobs in the U. S. and the potential of for this technology to be implemented in large-scale work site health programs. M. S...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} short- and {{long-term}} effects of a limited, individualized, and need-supportive physical activity coaching, based on the self-determination theory, provided by specialized master students in kinesiology. Method: <b>Sedentary</b> <b>employees</b> (n = 92) {{of the university of}} Leuven received a four-month need-supportive physical activity coaching, consisting of five contact moments (i. e. an intake session, three follow-up contacts and an outtake session) by master students in kinesiology (n = 30). They completed self-report measures of physical activity and various psychosocial variables, i. e. well-being, motivational behaviour, self-efficacy, social norms and social support, before the intervention, after the intervention (post-test) and one year after pre-test measurements (follow-up-test). A control group (n = 34) only completed the measurements. After the intervention period, a process evaluation was sent to the participants of the intervention group. At follow-up, also job satisfaction was questioned within all the participants. Results: Contrary to the control group, participants in the intervention group reported significant increases in self-reported physical activity, physical well-being, autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, social norms and social support at post-test (i. e. after the intervention period). Moreover, participants in the intervention group were on average very satisfied with the coaching and reported high support by the coach with respect to autonomy, structure and involvement. Analysis of the long-term effects (i. e. follow-up-test) is still ongoing. Conclusions: A limited individualized need-supportive physical activity coaching by students in kinesiology proved to be effective in the short-term in increasing physical activity and improving related psychosocial variables among <b>sedentary</b> university <b>employees.</b> Conclusions concerning {{long-term effects of}} a limited need-supportive physical activity coaching by students in kinesiology could not be drawn yet. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{positive}} benefits of physical activity, workplaces have made many attempts to increase {{physical activity levels}} of <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees,</b> typically {{through the use of}} an exercise intervention. The main purpose of the present research was to investigate whether the simple act of supplying employees engaged primarily in sedentary office-type work, who were intent on becoming physically active, with a tool capable of measuring walking activity (a pedometer) would enhance their physical activity levels over an eight-week period. As predicted, those who received a pedometer reported a significant increase in physical activity from Time 1 to Time 2, while those who did not reported no change. Furthermore, changes in physical activity levels were found to be negatively correlated with perceived barriers to physical activity at Time 1 and also with changes in perceived barriers over the eight-week period. These findings offer a simple and cost-effective alternative to traditional exercise interventions and highlight the importance of reducing barriers to physical activity to increase success when implementing future physical activity initiatives. No relationships between changes to physical activity and life satisfaction, job satisfaction or work-related stress were found. Implications of these results and suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R

High intensity strength training effectively rehabilitates musculoskeletal disorders among <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees,</b> but less is known about the effect among workers with repetitive and forceful work demands. Before performing randomized controlled trials it may be beneficial to assess the cross-sectional connection between exercise and musculoskeletal pain. We investigated the association between high intensity physical exercise and pain among 595 slaughterhouse workers in Denmark, Europe. Using logistic regression analyses, odds ratios for pain and work disability as a function of physical exercise, gender, age, BMI, smoking, and job position were estimated. The prevalence of pain in the neck, shoulder, elbow, and hand/wrist was 48 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 52 %, respectively.

40|$|As {{more than}} 70 % of {{individuals}} in Western societies can be categorized as sedentary and inactivity has been recognized {{to lead to a}} series of serious physical and psychological disorders, the importance of physical activity promotion is ever more emphasized. Many social marketing campaigns use threat (or fear) appeals to promote healthy behaviors. Theoretical models, such as the Extended Parallel Process Model integrate concepts as 'perceived threat' and 'perceived efficacy' to explain how such messages operate and can cause diverse behavioral reactions. It is however still not entirely clear how these different aspects are valuated and combined to determine desired versus undesired response behaviors in individuals. In a functional integration task, threat-appeal based exercise promotion messages varying in psychological threat and efficacy content were shown to <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees</b> in order to assess how they affect their intention to engage in physical exercise. Our results show that individuals can be categorized in 4 different clusters depending on the way they valuate threat and efficacy appeals: i. e. individuals sensitive to both types of cues, those sensitive to either the threat or the efficacy component in the message and those insensitive to either one of them. As different segments of receivers of the message react differently to threat and efficacy combinations, it is concluded that different approaches to designing effective mass media campaigns may be required for effective exercise promotion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Following an {{extensive}} recruitment campaign, a 16 -week lunchtime intervention to increase walking was implemented with insufficiently physically active University employees to examine programme feasibility {{and the effects}} of the programme in increasing walking behaviour, and in improving well-being and work performance. Methods/design A feasibility study in which participants were randomised to an immediate treatment or a delayed treatment control (to start at 10 weeks) group. For the first ten weeks of the intervention, participants took part in three facilitator-led group walks per week each of thirty minutes duration and were challenged to accumulate another sixty minutes of walking during the weekends. In {{the second phase of the}} intervention, the organised group walks ceased to be offered and participants were encouraged to self-organise their walks. Motivational principles were employed using contemporary motivational theory. Outcome measures (including self-reported walking, step counts, cardiovascular fitness, general and work-related well-being and work performance) were assessed at baseline, at the end of the 16 -week intervention and (for some) four months after the end of the intervention.

40|$|Purpose: The year-round {{effects and}} {{mediators}} of a need-supportive physical activity program were examined. Methods: <b>Sedentary</b> <b>employees</b> (n = 92) {{of the university}} of Leuven received four months of physical activity coaching based on the Self-Determination Theory by bachelors in kinesiology (n = 30). The program consisted of five individual contact moments between coach and client (i. e. an intake session, three follow-up contacts and an outtake session), either face-to-face, by phone or by e-mail. Self-reports on physical activity, social support, self-efficacy and autonomous motivation were completed in an intervention condition (n = 92) and a control condition (n = 34) at three moments: before the intervention (pre-test), after the intervention (post-test) and one year after pre-test (follow-up-test). Results: Repeated measurement analyses showed that changes in physical activity were significantly different over time between the conditions. More specifically, the intervention condition increased in moderate, strenuous and total physical activity from pre- to post-test, whereas the control condition did not change. Additionally, the intervention condition increased in mild, moderate, strenuous and total physical activity from pre- to follow-up-test, while no changes occurred in the control condition. Bootstrapping analyses indicated that self-efficacy and autonomous motivation significantly mediated the intervention effect on physical activity from pre- to post-test, while social support significantly contributed to the long-term effect.

40|$|The {{research}} has demonstrated that giving appropriate information to carefully targeted <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees</b> who work in a supportive environment can help increase physical activity levels. At the adoption phase {{there seems to be no}} advantage in carrying out a fitness assessment or an exercise consultation. Information giving is most cost effective and one that can be implemented in the many and varied opportunities which exist for health professionals. The general trend, as discerned from the plots of PA over time, showed that any initial positive change dropped markedly in the period between three months to six months post test. Furthermore, the stage of change by time interaction showed, rather surprisingly, that 'contemplators' required relatively less support than 'preparers' in the maintenance phase. No matter what type of intervention takes place, it was clear that on-going support was required to assist individuals maintain any initial positive change. Exercise consultation is a new approach to helping sedentary individuals increase physical activity levels. This type of intervention was found to be appealing from a subjective level and there was some evidence (from planned comparison) to suggest that it was more effective than fitness assessment in helping sustain the change in the move from adoption to maintenance. It is important that sedentary individuals who adopt more physically active lifestyles are given further support and a range of choices to maintain this behaviour change. Exercise consultation is particularly suited to help individuals in this dynamic process...|$|R

Well-designed studies are still needed to determine the treatment efficacy of worksite interventions targeting such risk factors. This randomized controlled trial was conducted at one of Australia's casinos in 2002 – 2003, to investigate {{the effects of a}} comprehensive exercise and lifestyle intervention on physical fitness. Only 6. 4 % of the workforce expressed interest in being study participants. Seventy-three employees (aged 32 ± 8 years, 51 % overweight/obese, 73 % shift workers and 52 % women) were recruited and randomized to treatment or wait-list control groups for 24 weeks, 44 of whom completed the intervention. Components of the intervention include supervised moderate-to-high intensity exercise including combined aerobic (at least 20 min duration 3 days/week) and weight-training (for an estimated 30 min completed 2 – 3 days/week), and dietary/health education (delivered via group seminars, one-on-one counselling and literature through the provision of a worksite manual). ANCOVA, by intention-to-treat and of study completers, found significant between-group differences in the mean waist circumference and predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), favouring the intervention, but effects were concentrated in one subject. For study completers, between-group differences in the mean waist circumference (82. 3 ± 9. 2 versus 90. 5 ± 17. 8 cm, p = 0. 01) and predicted VO 2 max (47 versus 41 ml/kg/min, p < 0. 001) remained significant without the outlier, favouring the intervention. Higher intervention compliance predicted greater improvements in physical fitness. No significant effects on body mass or body mass index were found. This worksite intervention significantly improved waist circumference and aerobic fitness in healthy but <b>sedentary</b> <b>employees,</b> most of whom were shift workers. Worksite interventions have the potential to counter the increasing burden of overweight and obesity, particularly visceral adiposity, as well as physical inactivity; however, substantial barriers to adoption/adherence need to be overcome for greater feasibility and impact on employee physical health.

Health problems among these employees were detected {{as a result of a}} medical examination including: blood pressure tests, biological analyses and, for those 40 and over, electrocardiograms. The medical history of each participant was established in which particular attention was devoted to the taking of medication, treatment for diabetes, hypercholesterolemia or arterial tension, as well as previous Personal and family characteristics. Life habits were examined through replies to a questionnaire filled in by each participant before his medical examination. The following variables were tested: level of physical activity; consumption of alcohol, tobacco and medication. Mental health was examined in two ways: medical history and medical interview on the one hand, and a scale of psychological health included in the questionnaire on the other.

40|$|Purpose Encouraging {{office workers}} to ‘sit less and move more’ {{encompasses}} two public health priorities. However, {{there is little}} evidence on the effectiveness of workplace interventions for reducing sitting, even less about the longer term effects of such interventions and still less on dual-focused interventions. This study assessed the short and mid-term impacts of a workplace web-based intervention (Walk@WorkSpain, W@WS; 2010 - 11) on self-reported sitting time, step counts and physical risk factors (waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure) for chronic disease. Methods Employees at six Spanish university campuses (n= 264; 42 ± 10 years; 171 female) were randomly assigned by worksite and campus to an Intervention (used W@WS; n= 129; 87 female) or a Comparison group (maintained normal behavior; n= 135; 84 female). This phased, 19 -week program aimed to decrease occupational sitting time through increased incidental movement and short walks. A linear mixed model assessed changes in outcome measures between the baseline, ramping (8 weeks), maintenance (11 weeks) and followup (two months) phases for Intervention versus Comparison groups. A significant 2 (group) × 2 (program phases) interaction was found for self-reported occupational sitting (F[3]= 7. 97, p= 0. 046), daily step counts (F[3]= 15. 68, p= 0. 0013) and waist circumference (F[3]= 11. 67, p= 0. 0086). The Intervention group decreased minutes of daily occupational sitting while also increasing step counts from baseline (446 ± 126; 8, 862 ± 2, 475) through ramping (+ 425 ± 120; 9, 345 ± 2, 435), maintenance (+ 422 ± 123; 9, 638 ± 3, 131) and follow-up (+ 414 ± 129; 9, 786 ± 3, 205). In the Comparison group, compared to baseline (404 ± 106), sitting time remained unchanged through ramping and maintenance, but decreased at follow-up (- 388 ± 120), while step counts diminished across all phases. The Intervention group significantly reduced waist circumference by 2. 1 cms from baseline to follow-up while the Comparison group reduced waist circumference by 1. 3 cms over the same period.

40|$|Objective: Adherence to {{physical}} activity interventions is poorly understood. Using Self-Determination Theory as an organising framework, {{this study explored}} the processes of physical activity adoption through to adherence of <b>sedentary</b> University <b>employees</b> participating in a 16 -week lunchtime walking programme (‘Step by Step’). Design: An interpretative phenomenological approach was used to answer three inter-related questions: How do sedentary adults experience {{the transition from a}} sedentary to the commencement of a physically active lifestyle? How do adults cope with temptations of returning to a sedentary lifestyle? What are the main factors affecting relapse and drop-out from a physical activity programme? Method: 17 participants were interviewed one-to-one on three separate occasions (prior, at mid-term and immediately post) during the 16 -week intervention (10 -week group led followed by six-week independent phase). Interviews explored motivations for engagement and adherence to the walking programme, satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs within the activity, challenges regarding handling barriers, and perceived social/autonomy support throughout the programme. Results: Introjected reasons (guilt) for engagement was a prominent theme during the adoption stage of the intervention. As the programme continued, temptations of returning to a sedentary lifestyle were reduced in individuals who demonstrated more internalised and integrated motivations for engagement (enjoyment of the activity). Adhering individuals experienced increases in competence, relatedness and to some extent autonomy. Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesised inter-relationships between need satisfaction, self-regulation and positive behavioural aspects towards physical activity and offers additional in-depth and longitudinal detail to complement existing cross-sectional and qualitative research. ...|$|R
40|$|Illness-related {{absenteeism}} is a {{major threat}} to work productivity. Our objective was to assess the relationship between physical activity and unplanned illness-related absenteeism from work. We implemented physical activity program for <b>sedentary</b> non-clinician <b>employees</b> of a tertiary medical center. Financial rewards were available for reaching accelerometer-measured ambulatory physical activity goals over a 24 -week period. We categorized participants into three groups based on mean levels of physical activity: low (0 - 74 min/week), medium (75 - 149 min/week) and meeting CDC guidelines (≥ 150 min/week). We built a multivariable Poisson regression model to evaluate the relationship between physical activity and rates of unplanned illness-related absenteeism. The sample consisted of 292 employees who participated in the program. Their mean age was 38 years (SD 11), 83 % were female, and 38 % were obese. Over the 24 intervention weeks, participants engaged in a mean of 90 min/week (SD 74) of physical activity and missed a mean of 14 hours of work (SD 38) due to illness. Unplanned absenteeism due to illness was associated with physical activity. As compared to the group meeting CDC guidelines, in multivariable analyses those in the medium physical activity group had a 2. 4 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 4. 5) fold higher rate of illness-related absenteeism and those in the lowest physical activity group had a 3. 5 (95 % CI 1. 7 - 7. 2) fold higher rate of illness-related absenteeism. Less physical activity was associated with more illness-related absenteeism. Workforce-based interventions to increase physical activity may thus be a promising vehicle to reduce unplanned illness-related absenteeism...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{explored}} {{these issues}} qualitatively among <b>sedentary</b> university <b>employees</b> recruited to a 10 -week randomised controlled trail. The trial compared walking routes, walking within daily tasks and controls on daily step totals, showing that, compared to controls, interventions resulted in @ 1000 extra steps per day. METHOD: Fifteen participants representing both trial arms contributed semi-structured interviews at post-intervention assessments, supported by six recorded peer debriefings. Interviews were transcribed verbatim {{and subject to}} inductive coding. RESULTS: Increased walking at work resulted in an overall effect of 2 ̆ 7 Improved sense of self within the organisation 2 ̆ 7. Attention provided by pedometers, physiological monitoring and weekly e-mail motivational messages were all considered important contributors in producing this effect and were seen as an institutional investment in staff. Increased walking helped to feel healthier (2 ̆ 7 When steps were higher, it was obvious I felt better 2 ̆ 7), generated autonomy and provided variety within normal work days. Walking within daily tasks helped to establish much-valued face-to-face contact with colleagues (2 ̆ 7 Talking to colleagues in person was more effective than emails it was more sociable 2 ̆ 7). This also simplified completion of daily tasks, while walking together on routes helped colleagues to resolve inter-personal tensions. However, reducing time spent at desks caused concern for some supervisors who questioned employee productivity; this challenge was rarely offered to more senior employees. CONCLUSION: Extra walking at work, however it was achieved, produced a powerful effect on employee morale which was linked to improved emotional control and mental focus, better mood and increased energy. These collective effects are central to improved morale and subjective estimates of more effective work performance based on increased walking during the working day...|$|R

These interventions often utilize an educational session prior to participants engaging, yet limited studies have specifically examined the effect education has on compliance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect pre-intervention participant education had on the odds of compliance to a passive e-health software program designed to increase non-exercise activity thermogenesis throughout the workday. Participants in the experimental group (n= 46) were exposed to multifaceted pre-intervention participant education one day prior to initiating the e-health software intervention for an eight-week study period. The control group (n= 33) also received the intervention for eight weeks, however these participants received no education prior to initiation. The e-health software had a self-report progress recording function, which recorded all logged movement entries to gain frequency counts of per day usage. The experimental group logged more active days, more movements per day and was significantly more compliant to the e-health software (OR= 1. 87, 95 % CI = 1. 56 - 2. 24).

40|$|The Internet has the {{potential}} for delivering innovative, interactive physical activity (PA) interventions to large numbers of people. This study was designed to test the efficacy of an Internet intervention that consisted of a Web site plus 12 weekly e-mail tip sheets, compared with a waiting list control group. The Internet intervention was theory based and emphasized clear, graphical presentation of PA information. Sixty-five (30 intervention and 35 control) <b>sedentary</b> adult <b>employees</b> of several large hospitals (9 men and 56 women) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 study arms. Of the 65 participants, 57 completed the 1 -month follow-up, and 52 completed the 3 -month follow-up. At both 1 and 3 months, those in the intervention group {{were significantly more likely to}} have progressed in stage of motivational readiness for PA than participants in the control group: 1 month, c 2 (1, N = 52) = 4. 05, p <. 05; 3 months, c 2 (1, N = 52) = 6. 45, p <. 01. We hypothesized that at 1 and 3 months, the intervention group would exhibit significant increases relative to the control group on the number of minutes of moderate activity. At the 1 -month assessment, the intervention group did exhibit significant increases, relative to the control group in moderate minutes, F(1, 54) = 5. 79, p <. 05; however, at the 3 -month assessment this difference was no longer significant. In addition, secondary analyses were conducted to examine total number of minutes of walking reported. At 1 month, the intervention group did exhibit significant increases, relative to the control group, in walking minutes, F(1, 54) = 12. 1, p <. 001. At the 3 -month assessment, amount of time spent in walking activity continued to be significantly higher for the intervention group compared with the control group, F(1, 48) = 5. 2, p <. 05. These findings show that a theoretically based PA Web site and weekly e-mail tip sheets can have a short-term impact on PA motivation and behavior both at 1 and 3 months. As Internet access increases, and as bandwidth and other technical attributes of this medium improve, Web site delivered health behavior interventions will become increasingly useful in public health promotion. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{workplace}} {{offers an}} ideal setting for facilitating {{physical activity and}} reducing sedentary behaviours. Understanding employees’ current health behaviours is required to inform appropriate, tailored, health promotion interventions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compare the physical activity and sedentary behaviours over 12 months of employees within and across five UK organisations. The paper also explores the association of these health behaviours with objective and self-reported health outcomes; and investigates the association between physical activity and sedentary behaviours. Design/methodology/approach – Self-reported physical activity and sedentary behaviours were recorded at four time points (baseline, three, six, 12 months). BMI, per cent body fat, waist circumference, blood pressure and resting heart rate were collected in health checks (baseline, 12 months). Well-being and health were collected via questionnaire. Findings – Low physical activity and high sedentariness were evident. Sitting levels varied by occupational role and organisation. More activity was associated with improved health outcomes; no association was evident for sedentary behaviour. No direct effects of occupational role or organisation on health outcomes emerged after accounting for physical activity/sedentary behaviours. Physical activity and sedentary levels were weakly associated. Practical implications – The low activity levels are of particular concern as linked to health outcomes for this sample. The weak association between behaviours suggests worksite interventions should target both behaviours. Originality/value – This study provides insight into both the physical activity and <b>sedentary</b> behaviours of <b>employees</b> of large UK employers across different occupational sectors over 12 months; importantly it is informed by the most recent guidance for these health behaviours...|$|R
40|$|Sedentary {{behaviour}} {{increases the}} risk for morbidity. Our primary aim {{is to determine the}} proportion and factors associated with objectively measured total and occupational sedentary time in three work settings. Secondary aim is to study the proportion of physical activity and prolonged sedentary bouts. Data were obtained using ActiGraph accelerometers from employees of: 1) a financial service provider (n = 49 men, 31 women), 2) two research institutes (n = 30 men, 57 women), and 3) a construction company (n = 38 men). Total (over the whole day) and occupational sedentary time, physical activity and prolonged sedentary bouts (lasting ≥ 30 minutes) were calculated by work setting. Linear regression analyses were performed to examine general, health and work-related factors associated with <b>sedentary</b> time. The <b>employees</b> of the financial service provider and the research institutes spent 76 - 80 % of their occupational time in sedentary behaviour, 18 - 20 % in light intensity physical activity and 3 - 5 % in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Occupational time in prolonged sedentary bouts was 27 - 30 %. Total time was less sedentary (64 - 70 %), and had more light intensity physical activity (26 - 33 %). The employees of the construction company spent 44 % of their occupational time in sedentary behaviour, 49 % in light, and 7 % in moderate intensity physical activity, and spent 7 % in sedentary bouts. Total time spent in sedentary behavior was 56 %, 40 % in light, and 4 % in moderate intensity physical behaviour, and 12 % in sedentary bouts. For women, low to intermediate education was the only factor that was negatively associated with occupational sedentary time. Sedentary behaviour is high among white-collar employees, especially in highly educated women. A relatively small proportion of sedentary time was accrued in sedentary bouts. It is recommended that worksite health promotion efforts should focus on reducing sedentary behaviour through improving light intensity physical activity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{doctoral}} thesis was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of three physical activity interventions with various strategies to fac ilitate implementation. More specifically, we wanted to examine if inter ventions that are less money and time consuming can also be successful. In the first intervention study among <b>sedentary</b> university <b>employees</b> we examined the effectiveness of a 3 -month coaching program. This coaching program consisted of one intake session with a physical activity coach f ollowed either by four face-to-face support contacts, or by four telepho ne support contacts. The results showed that, besides a minor difference on active transportation in favor of the face-to-face program, both int erventions were equally effective in motivating sedentary university emp loyees to become more physically active and in improving their mental he alth. In particular, both interventions significantly increased leisure- time physical activity, self-efficacy and social support and decreased s itting time and trait anxiety. Because programs with telephone support a re cheaper and require less time and effort from both the coach and the participant, it was concluded that a coaching program with telephone sup port can be preferred to the same program with face-to-face support. In the second intervention study we evaluated the effects of a 11 -month lifestyle physical activity intervention, including an individualized ho me-based program supported by phone calls, and a 11 -month structured exe rcise intervention, consisting of three weekly supervised sessions in a private fitness center, in adults over 60 years old. The results were co mpared with an assessment-only control group. The physical activity resu lts showed that at the end of the interventions both programs had signif icantly increased the total physical activity level of the participants. However, one year after the end of the interventions the structured pro gram was no longer superior to the control group. By contrast, the lifes tyle program still showed larger increases in physical activity, in part icular in active transportation and daily steps. The results concerning the psychological effects indicated that both interventions had signific ant positive effects on physical self-perceptions in both the short as t he long term. Because the lifestyle intervention outperformed the struct ured intervention on the long term physical activity effects and because it was almost four times cheaper than the structured intervention, it w as concluded that a home-based lifestyle intervention should be preferre d to a center-based structured intervention in the promotion of physical activity in older adults. In a third intervention study, maximal attention was paid to facilitating lat er implementation by integrating a physical activity intervention into t he existing structures of a womens organization and by limiting the amo unt of contact hours. This minimal-contact intervention consisted of one group meeting, a self-help booklet and five reminder letters. The inter vention had a significant positive effect on objectively measured physic al activity, on psychological well-being and on trait anxiety. The chang es in psychological well-being and trait anxiety were partially mediated by changes in perceived benefits and barriers of physical activity and by changes in self-efficacy, but not by changes in physical activity. No ne of the examined psychosocial constructs (i. e., perceived benefits of physical activity, perceived barriers of physical activity, behavioral p rocesses of change, experiential processes of change, self-efficacy, soc ial support) mediated the intervention effect on physical activity. The positive effects of this intervention on physical activity and mental he alth are especially valuable with regard to the special efforts that wer e made to increase the implementation possibilities of this intervention because strategies such as limiting the number of contact hours can hyp othesize the effectiveness of an intervention. Moreover the strategies t o increase the implementation possibilities of this intervention paid of f, because the intervention was implemented on a national scale by the w omens organization itself. Overall it was concluded that physical activity interventions that are l ess money and time consuming can also be effective. Moreover, they are often more cost-effective than their more expensive and intensive c ounterparts. By consequence, in order to achieve a public health impact it is important to focus on strategies that can facilitate later impleme ntation during the development of physical activity interventions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|How {{to motivate}} {{sedentary}} {{people to become}} (more) physically active in the long run? Lessons from Leuven In this keynote, I will give an overview {{of a number of}} recent intervention studies that we have conducted at the KU Leuven to promote physical activity among different target groups. These interventions are inspired by the Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000), which is currently the most dominant motivational framework within the domain of exercise psychology. SDT assumes that individuals possess three basic psychological needs that are essential for their growth and well-being: 1) the need for autonomy (i. e., the desire to be the origin of one’s own behavior); 2) the need for competence (i. e., the desire to experience mastery and success), and 3) the need for relatedness (i. e., the desire to have meaningful relations with other people). According to SDT, the more the social context provides an environment to satisfy these basic needs, the more individuals will experience autonomous forms of motivation. These autonomous forms of motivation have been found to facilitate sustained behavioral change, in contrast to controlled forms of motivation, which only lead to short-term adherence. In a first intervention study, we developed and tested a cost-efficient need-supportive individual counseling program to stimulate <b>sedentary</b> university <b>employees</b> to become more physically active (Van Hoecke, et al., 2012). Ninety-two participants received 4 months of coaching by bachelors students in kinesiology who were specializing in health-related physical activity (n = 30). The program consisted of a limited number of individual contact moments (i. e. an intake session, three follow-up contacts and an out-take session), either face-to-face, by phone or by e-mail. Various measures were assessed both in the coaching group (n = 92) and in a control group (n = 34) at three moments: before the intervention (i. e., pre-test), after the intervention (i. e., post-test), and 1 year after pre-test measurements (i. e., follow-up test). The results revealed that while the control group remained stable from pre- to post-test, the coaching group increased significantly in moderate and strenuous physical activity. Additionally, the coaching group increased significantly in mild, moderate, and strenuous physical activity from pre- to follow-up tests, whereas the control group did not change. This study provided evidence for the long-term effectiveness of a need-supportive physical activity program that might be efficient at the community level. In a second intervention study, we developed and tested a need-supportive walking program for the elderly (Pelssers et al., 2013). This structured walking program “Every Step Counts!” took place within a community-based senior organization and lasted for 10 weeks. The program prescribed pedometer-defined walks in weekly walking schedules, which were fitness-tailored and structured in walking load (intensity/volume) according to the principles of training progression. In addition, the program was offered as a social activity at meeting points of the organization to satisfy their the basic needs. Twenty-nine meeting points (n = 432) constituted the intervention condition, while ten meeting points (n = 148) formed the wait-list control condition. Measurements were organized {{at the start of the}} intervention (pretest) and at the end (posttest). Intention-to-treat linear mixed models showed small positive intervention effects on physical activity, fitness, and aspects of well-being. These results confirm the effectiveness of structured walking interventions with systematic training progression for the elderly and underscore the value of community-based senior organizations as intervention settings. In a third intervention study, besides supporting individuals’ personal needs, we also targeted participants’ social identity to further facilitate lasting behavioral change. One-hundred ninety-six sedentary adults aged 55 to 70 years (n = 169) were randomized into three identity-based PA promoting interventions: (1) a personal identity need-supportive condition (PI), in which participants’ personal self was targeted during need-supportive counseling based on SDT; (2) a social identity condition (SI), in which participants’ social self was targeted during counseling based on the Self-Categorization Theory; (3) a joined identity condition (JI), in which participants’ personal and social self were targeted at the same time. Participants completed measures of physical activity (i. e., pedometer-based steps, pedometer-based aerobic minutes, self-reported) before (pre-test), immediately after (i. e., post-test) and one year after (i. e., follow-up) the six-week intervention. Mixed models showed significant increases in pedometer-based and self-reported PA from pre- to post-test, and from pre-test to follow-up, with no differences in changes over time between the conditions. There results suggest that in order facilitate behavioral change in the long run, one can either support individuals’ basic needs or focus on the norms associated with their social identity. The general implications of these three studies will be discussed. Key references: Pelssers, J., Delecluse, C., Opdenacker, J., Kennis, E., Van Roie, E., & Boen, F.

40|$| {{determinants}} of older adults subjective health over a one-year follow-up period. The third intervention study aimed at examining and comparing {{the effectiveness of}} three six-week identity-based physical activity counseling strategies among adults aged 55 to 70 years who did not attain the physical activity recommendations for health (n = 169). The first strategy (personal identity condition; n = 56) consisted of an individually-tailored need-supportive physical activity coaching based on the Self-Determination Theory. A Health Fitness Specialist targeted participants personal self, and thus their unique characteristics. Participants were encouraged to engage in physical activity for their own personally valued reasons (e. g., because of the health-related benefits, because of the social contact, {{in order to work}} off steam etc.). The second strategy (social identity condition; n = 57) embraced a socially-oriented physical activity promoting program based on the Self-Categorization Theory. A Health Fitness Specialist targeted participants social self and provided group-based normative support for physical activity. More specifically, physical activity behavior was proposed as prototypical for a relevant reference group within this population. Based on the results of a preliminary survey (n = 1340), socially engaged persons and independent persons were considered as the most appropriate reference groups {{to be used in the}} physical activity intervention. The third strategy (joined identity condition; n = 56) comprised a physical activity counseling procedure based on the Self-Determination and Self-Categorization Theory. A Health Fitness Specialist facilitated participants physical activity behavior by targeting both their personal and social self. With respect to physical activity, each of the strategies yielded significant and substantial increases in daily steps, daily aerobic minutes and self-reported physical activity, from baseline to six-week follow-up (e. g., steps: personal identity condition: + 75 %; social identity condition: + 68 %; joined identity condition: + 71 %) and from baseline to one-year follow-up (e. g., steps: personal identity condition: + 62 %; social identity condition: + 56 %; joined identity condition: + 69 %). Changes over time did not significantly differ between the interventions, except for aerobic minutes, which increased significantly more in the social identity condition from baseline to six-week follow-up than in the personal identity condition. Consistent with the tenets of the Self-Determination Theory, the relation between perceived need-support and physical activity was mediated by identified regulation (i. e. being physically active because of its valued outcomes such as health benefits). Consistent with the Self-Categorization Theory, the relation between perceived normative support and physical activity was mediated by integrated regulation (i. e. being physically active because it fits your personality and your overall lifestyle and goals). With respect to the self-rated health, significant increases emerged in the social identity condition and the joined identity condition from baseline to six-week follow-up and from baseline to one-year follow-up whereas no changes emerged in the personal identity condition. Physical well-being significantly increased in the joined identity condition from baseline to six-week follow-up and from baseline tot one-year follow-up whereas no changes occurred in the personal identity condition and the social identity condition. Finally, psychological well-being significantly improved in the joined identity condition from baseline to six-week follow-up whereas no changes emerged in the personal identity condition and the social identity condition. Participants self-rated health and physical well-being were positively related to their daily steps. In addition, participants degree of identification with a relevant social identity was significantly and positively related to each of the proposed dimensions of their subjective health. We concluded that physical activity promoting strategies targeting individuals personal self, their social self or both their personal and social self are (equally) effective in increasing physical activity in the older adult population, even after a one-year follow-up period. However, the socially-oriented strategy that postulated group-based physical activity norms involved a non-individualized approach, and accordingly entailed relatively low costs. Therefore, a Self-Categorization Theory-based program appears to be particularly beneficial to implement in the wider community compared with individually-tailored Self-Determination Theory-based physical activity coaching. Moreover, the findings pointed out the importance of activating a highly qualitative behavioral regulation, either identified or integrated, to perform physical activity behavior in the short and the long term. With respect to perceived health, it was concluded that emphasizing older adults membership of a meaningful and positively valued group can positively affect their subjective health and well-being. In this respect, it seems that not only being but also perceiving oneself as a physically active person contributes to satisfactory health perceptions. In conclusion, both the Self-Determination and Self-Categorization Theory have been demonstrated to be valuable frameworks within the domain of physical activity promotion. Specifically, various individually-tailored need-supportive strategies as well as a socially-oriented procedure that postulated normative support yielded substantial and equal increases in (older) adults physical activity level, even after a one-year follow-up period. In this respect, the number of individuals who attained the physical activity recommendations for health increased up to 50 % after participation in one of the programs. In addition to facilitating behavioral changes, each of these strategies has been shown to positively affect different dimensions of subjective health and well-being. However, it should be pointed out that both a one-contact need-supportive strategy and a group-based counseling are less time-consuming procedures than a multiple-contact personalized physical activity coaching. Therefore, these two strategies appear to be particularly beneficial to implement at a large scale, and accordingly impact on public health. Finally, both personally-oriented and socially-oriented physical activity programs should strive to facilitate highly qualitative forms of behavioral regulation, either identified, integrated or intrinsic, in order to successfully encourage individuals to perform physical behavior in the short and the long term. Physical activity promoting strategies should thus put emphasis on the valued outcomes of physical activity, on its harmony with individuals lifestyle or on the fun that is associated with it.
