40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} generic {{security}} architecture {{designed for a}} multidomain and <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> based on programmable <b>networks.</b> The <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> allows users of an IP network to run programmable services using programmable nodes located in {{the architecture of the}} network. The programmable nodes execute codes to process active packets, which can carry user data and control information. The <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> model defined here considers the more pragmatic trends in programmable networks. In this scenario, new security risks that do not appear in traditional IP networks become visible. These new risks are {{as a result of the}} execution of code in the programmable nodes and the processing of the active packets. The proposed security architecture is based on symmetric cryptography in the critical process, combined with an efficient manner of distributing the symmetric keys. Another important contribution has been to scale the security architecture to a multidomain scenario in a single and efficient way. Publicad...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{integration}} of distributed multimedia systems support into a communications architecture encompassing the new <b>multiservice</b> <b>networks</b> poses significant challenges. A key observation {{about the new}} environment is that Quality of Service (QOS) provides a unifying theme around {{which most of the}} new communications requirements can be grouped. For applications relying on the transfer of multimedia information, and in particular continuous media, it is essential that QOS is guaranteed system-wide, including the distributed system platform, the transport protocol and the <b>multiservice</b> <b>network.</b> Enhanced protocol support such as end-to-end QOS negotiation, renegotiation, indication of QOS degradations and co-ordination over multiple related connections are also required.

This paper debates and points out solutions to mitigate the negative impact that distributed admission of flows might have on the service level guarantees provided to network customers.

40|$|Introduction The role {{of traffic}} {{engineering}} {{is to ensure}} that a telecommunications network has just enough capacity to meet expected demand with adequate quality of service. A critical requirement is to understand the three-way relationship between demand, capacity and performance, each of these being quantified in appropriate units. The degree to which this is possible in a future <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> remains uncertain, due notably to the inherent self-similarity of traffic and the modelling difficulty that this implies. The purpose of the present chapter is to argue that sound traffic engineering remains the crucial element in providing quality of service and that the network must be designed to circumvent the self-similarity problem by applying traffic controls at an appropriate level. Quality of service in a <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> depends essentially on two factors: the service model which identifies different service classes and specifies how network reso...|$|R

Service disciplines devised for <b>multiservice</b> <b>networks</b> therefore need to be flexible, i. e., able to provide different types of service, in order to accommodate different traffic classes efficiently. In this paper, we present and analyze an innovative Timed Token Service Discipline (TTSD, which has been given Patent Application No. TO 2000 A 001000) which is able to schedule both rate-guaranteed and best-effort traffic simultaneously at a feasible computational complexity. The service paradigm approximated by TTSD is unveiled by means of a fluid-flow analysis and proven to be different from the well-known Generalized Processor Sharing. We then describe the TTSD properties, deriving minimum rate guarantees and delay bounds for leaky-bucket constrained traffic, both in a single node and in a multinode environment. Furthermore, algorithms for selecting the TTSD parameters in order to achieve a prespecified rate and delay guarantees are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{researches}} {{have been}} done on modeling the traffic flows in a <b>multiservice</b> <b>network.</b> Recently, an alternative proposal was made by Addie et al. The authors argued that because the central limit theorem {{can be applied to}} heavy traffic processes, therefore as more traffic is aggregated together through the sharing of a transmission link, the aggregated traffic will weakly converges to a Gaussian process. In this paper, we apply this Gaussian model to the Connection Admission Control (CAC) of a <b>multiservice</b> <b>network.</b> We also make efficiency comparison with a CAC based on an Effective Bandwidth model. Two scenarios were considered: the first assumes that all a priori traffic specifications are known before a CAC acceptance/rejection decision is made; while the second assumes that only the peak rate of a new (requesting admission) connection is declared to the CAC mechanism. The latter scenario entails measurement-based CAC approach. 1. INTRODUCTION We consider a store-and-forward (p [...] ...|$|R
