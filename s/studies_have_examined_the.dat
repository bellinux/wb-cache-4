500|$|With an {{increasing}} focus on gender {{studies in the}} early 21stcentury, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> topic of [...] "Women in the Crusades". An essay collection on the topic was published in 2001 under the title Gendering the Crusades. In an essay on [...] "Women Warriors", Keren Caspi-Reisfeld concludes that [...] "the most significant role played by women in the West was in maintaining the status quo", {{in the sense of}} noble women acting as regents of feudal estates while their husbands were campaigning. The presence of individual noble women in Crusades has been noted, such as Eleanor of Aquitaine (who joined her husband, Louis VII). The presence of non-noble women in the Crusading armies, as in medieval warfare in general, was mostly in the role of logistic support (such as [...] "washerwomen"), while the occasional presence of women soldiers was recorded by Muslim historians.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between diet and acne is unclear, {{as there is}} no high-quality evidence that establishes any definitive link between them. High-glycemic-load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity. Multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lower-glycemic-load diet to be effective in reducing acne. There is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne. Milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine IGF-1 and precursors of dihydrotestosterone. These components are hypothesized to promote the effects of insulin and IGF-1 and thereby [...] increase the production of androgen hormones, sebum, and promote the formation of comedones. [...] Effects from other potentially contributing dietary factors, such as consumption of chocolate or salt, are not supported by the evidence. Chocolate does contain varying amounts of sugar, which can lead to a high glycemic load, and it can be made with or without milk. Few <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship between}} obesity and acne. Vitamin B12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne (acneiform eruptions), or worsen existing acne, when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake.|$|E

2500|$|Various <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} {{health effects of}} β-glucan. Oat fiber β-glucan at intake levels of at least 3 g per day can decrease the levels of saturated fats in the blood and may {{reduce the risk of}} heart disease. Some studies have suggested that cereal-derived β-glucan may also have immunomodulatory properties. Yeast- and medicinal mushroom-derived β-glucans have been investigated for their ability to modulate the immune system. [...] β-glucans are further used in various nutraceutical and cosmetic products, as texturing agents, and as soluble fiber supplements, but can be problematic in the process of brewing.|$|E
2500|$|Melungeons {{are one of}} {{numerous}} multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented {{that many of the}} Melungeon groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and the result of unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas. Several efforts, including a number of ongoing <b>studies,</b> <b>have</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> genetic makeup of families historically identified as Melungeon. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have Native American heritage as well. Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{has shown that}} 40% of adult panic disorder patients reported that their disorder began {{before the age of}} 20. In an article examining the phenomenon of panic disorder in youth, Diler et al. (2004) found that only a few past <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of juvenile panic disorder. They report that these studies have found that the symptoms of juvenile panic disorder almost replicate those found in adults (e.g. heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, hot flashes, nausea, abdominal distress, and chills). The anxiety disorders co-exist with staggeringly high numbers of other mental disorders in adults. [...] The same comorbid disorders that are seen in adults are also reported in children with juvenile panic disorder. Last and Strauss (1989) examined a sample of 17 adolescents with panic disorder and found high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and conduct disorders. Eassau et al. (1999) also found a high number of comorbid disorders in a community-based sample of adolescents with panic attacks or juvenile panic disorder. Within the sample, adolescents were found to have the following comorbid disorders: major depressive disorder (80%), dysthymic disorder (40%), generalized anxiety disorder (40%), somatoform disorders (40%), substance abuse (40%), and specific phobia (20%). Consistent with this previous work, Diler et al. (2004) found similar results in their study in which 42 youths with juvenile panic disorder were examined. Compared to non-panic anxiety disordered youths, children with panic disorder had higher rates of comorbid major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.|$|E
