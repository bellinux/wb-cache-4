40|$|There {{exists a}} rarely {{observed}} association between pulmonary histiocytosis X and <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer.</b> However, {{the frequency of}} <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> in these patients is {{higher than in the}} general population. A 28 -year-old patient who currently smokes ten packs of cigarettes a year came to our department of pneumology with complains of cough and hemoptysis. An x-ray of the thorax revealed bilateral cysts and a shadow in {{the upper part of the}} right pulmonary field. In addition, a chest tomography showed multiple cysts dispersed throughout the two pulmonary fields and an irregular mass with a diameter of four centimetres in the upper right lobe. Bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma was diagnosed during a cytologic exam of the bronchial washing. We decided to perform a thoracotomy on the patient, since there was no far metastasis. An upper lobectomy and wedge resection of the upper segment of the lower right lobe, which had been invaded by the tumour, were performed. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. A pulmonary biopsy was carried out on the tumour-free site and showed the presence of histiocytosis X. There is a hypothesis that a neoplasm developed on the pulmonary fibrosis could be an epiphenomenon of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> in patients who smoke and have pulmonary histiocytosis X. It is interesting to note that histiocytosis X and <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> were diagnosed at the same time, since the <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> may have occurred within a few years following the diagnosis of histiocytosis X, even if she was a smoker. Hemoptysis, which is found in 5 % of patients with histiocytosis X, may suggest cancer. This young patient, a smoker, who complained of hemoptysis, is a particularly rare case of the association between pulmonary histiocytosis X and <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> whose pathogenesis is not clear cut. It is thus important to note that smoking can have major consequences, even in young people...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} which morphologic or densitometric parameters are modified in cell nuclei from <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> based on 18 parameters involving shape, intensity, chromatin, texture, and DNA content {{and develop a}} <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> screening method relying on analysis of sputum sample cell nuclei. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 25 sputum samples from controls and 22 bronchial aspiration samples from patients presenting with <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> who were professionally exposed to cancer were used. After Feulgen staining, 18 morphologic and DNA content parameters were measured on cell nuclei, via image cytom- etry. A method was developed for analyzing distribution quantiles, compared with simply interpreting mean values, to characterize morphologic modifications in cell nuclei. RESULTS: Distribution analysis of parameters enabled us to distinguish 13 of 18 parameters that demonstrated significant differences between controls and cancer cases. These parameters, used alone, enabled us to distinguish two population types, with both sensitivity and specificity > 70 %. Three parameters offered 100 % sensitivity and specificity. When mean values offered high sensitivity and specificity, comparable or higher sensitivity and specificity values were observed {{for at least one}} of the corresponding quantiles. CONCLUSION: Analysis of modification in morphologic parameters via distribution analysis proved promising for screening <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> from sputum...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuperior vena cava {{syndrome}} (SVCS) groups all {{the signs}} secondary to the obstruction of superior vena cava drainage {{and the increase in}} the venous pressure in the territories upstream. There are two major causes of SVCS: malignant, dominated by <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer,</b> and benign, often secondary to the presence of poorly positioned implantable venous devices. CT scan is the key examination for the exploration of SVCS. It specifies the characteristics of the stenosis, its aetiology and detects collateral venous routes.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this work}} was to {{establish}} recommendations for the medical follow-up of workers currently or previously exposed to lung carcinogens. Methods A critical synthesis of the literature was conducted. Occupational lung carcinogenic substances were listed and classified according to their level of lung cancer risk. A targeted screening protocol was defined. Results A clinical trial, National Lung Screnning Trial (NLST), showed the efficacy of chest CAT scan (CT) screening for populations of smokers aged 55 – 74 years with over 30 pack-years of exposure who had stopped smoking for less than 15  years. To propose screening in accordance with NLST criteria, and to account for occupational risk factors, screening among smokers and former smokers needs to consider the types of occupational exposure for which the risk level is at least equivalent {{to the risk of}} the subjects included in the NLST. The working group proposes an algorithm that estimates the relative risk of each occupational lung carcinogen, taking into account exposure to tobacco, based on available data from the literature. Conclusion Given the lack of data on <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> (BPC) screening in occupationally exposed workers, the working group proposed implementing a screening experiment for <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> in subjects occupationally exposed or having been occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens who are confirmed as having high risk factors for BPC. A specific algorithm is proposed to determine the level of risk of BPC, taking into account the different occupational lung carcinogens and tobacco smoking at the individual level...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: The {{aim was to}} compare, in {{a cohort}} of asbestos-exposed workers, the {{sensitivity}} and the specificity of low-radiation helical chest CT scan with chest radiograph for the biennial screening of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer,</b> according {{to the size of}} detected nodules. Material and METHODS: The screening procedure consisted of biennial chest radiograph and monodetector chest CT scan, given to 972 individuals who had been highly exposed to asbestos. A total of 2555 screening procedures were performed. The study focuses on the 1230 screening procedures for which a 2 -year follow-up period was available. RESULTS: Twenty-four cases of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> were diagnosed. CT scan detected 20 cancers, 12 of which had not been detected by chest radiograph. Sensitivity of chest radiograph and CT scan were, respectively, 33 % and 83 %, lesions measuring over 2 mm in diameter being considered as suspect. The specificity of chest radiograph and CT scan were, respectively, 95 % and 78 %. Calculation of the differential false positive/true positive (FP/TP) ratio and the receiver operating characteristic curve, performed for both chest radiograph and CT scan, facilitated the determination of the best possible compromise between specificity and sensitivity, according to the diameter threshold applied for considering a nodule as suspect. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study confirms the superior sensitivity of chest CT scan compared with conventional chest radiograph, the associated loss in specificity leads to a recommended diameter of 5 mm as the threshold for considering non-calcified lesions as "suspect", for the surveillance of asbestos-exposed individuals...|$|R
40|$|Forty {{patients}} (average age 57) who {{had undergone}} surgery for <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> were divided into three groups according to antibiotic administered before operation: erythromycin ethyl succinate (1 g) — 7 oral doses at 12 -h intervals; amoxycillin (05 g), 7 oral doses at 12 -h intervals; erythromycin lactobionate (05 g), one intravenous injection on morning of surgery. Three hundred and seventy-one microbiological assays were carried out, and the following serum levels were obtained: 137 mg/ 1 ± 089, l h after erythromycin ethyl succinate (last dose); 305 mg/ 1 ± 097, 1 h after injection of erythromycin lactobionate; 59 mg/ 1 ± 263 amoxycillin, 2 h after amoxycillin Oast dose). Levels of antibiotics were determined in healthy, peritumoral and tumoral tissue, in lymph nodes and in per-operation bronchial mucus. Ratios between tissue and pulmonary serum concentrations demonstrate a good diffusion of erythromycin, particularly in healthy lung = ratio of 547 (erythromycin per os), 462 (iv erythromycin) and in the tumour— 3 * 12 (erythromycin per os) and 327 (iv erythromycin). These ratios are compared with those obtained for amoxycillin: 094 in healthy lung, 084 in tumour...|$|R
40|$|During tumor invasion, tumor {{epithelial}} cells acquire migratory and invasive properties involving important phenotypic alterations. Among these changes, one can observe reorganization or {{a loss of}} cell-cell adhesion complexes such as tight junctions (TJs). TJs are composed of transmembrane proteins (occludin, claudins) linked to the actin cytoskeleton through cytoplasmic adaptor molecules {{including those of the}} zonula occludens family (ZO- 1, - 2, - 3). We here evaluated the potential role of ZO- 2 in the acquisition of invasive properties by tumor cells. In vivo, we showed a decrease of ZO- 2 expression in <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancers,</b> with a preferential localization in the cytoplasm. In addition, in vitro, the localization of ZO- 2 varied according to invasive properties of tumor cells, with a cytoplasmic localization correlating with invasion. In addition, we demonstrated that ZO- 2 inhibition increases invasive and migrative capacities of invasive tumor cells. This was associated with an increase of MT 1 -MMP. These results suggest that ZO- 2, besides its structural role in tight junction assembly, can act also as a repressor of tumor progression through its ability to reduce the expression of tumor-promoting genes in invasive tumor cells.

40|$|Ki-ras {{activation}} by {{point mutation}} on codon 12 {{has been reported}} in non-small-cell lung carcinomas and in various models of experimental lung tumours induced by chemical carcinogens. The cellular targets for carcinogenic compounds of tobacco smoke are usually considered to be the cells of the bronchial mucosa or alveolar epithelium. However, little is known about preneoplastic events in bronchopulmonary carcinogenesis. The hypothesis of the presence of widespread target cells containing Ki-ras mutation was investigated by evaluating concurrent neoplastic and non-neoplastic bronchial and alveolar samples from 51 patients with non-small-cell lung carcinomas. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method used can detect one cell with a mutation on codon 12 among 10 (2) normal cells. In tumour samples, a mutation was detected in 20 % of adenocarcinomas, but in none of the adenosquamous or squamous cell carcinomas. No mutation was detected in the non-neoplastic bronchial or parenchymal samples. When using an enriched PCR-RFLP method detecting one mutated allele among 10 (3) normal alleles a mutation was detected in 23 % of adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, Ki-ras activation by mutation on codon 12 was not observed in non-neoplastic bronchial or parenchymal tissues in patients with <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancers</b> and {{does not appear to be}} a genetic event present in non-malignant epithelial target cells exposed to tobacco smoke...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although {{the role}} of {{asbestos}} in the genesis of mesothelioma and primary <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancers</b> has been established, results from studies focusing {{on the relationship between}} occupational exposure to asbestos and digestive cancer remain contradictory. AIM: To determine whether occupational asbestos exposure increases the incidence of digestive cancers. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective morbidity study based on 2024 subjects occupationally exposed to asbestos. The incidence of digestive cancer was calculated from 1 st January 1978 to 31 st December 2004 and compared with levels among the local general population using Standardized Incidence Ratios. Asbestos exposure was assessed using the company's job exposure matrix. RESULTS: Eighty-five cases of digestive cancer were observed within our cohort, for an expected number of 66. 90 (SIR = 1. 27 [1. 01; 1. 57]). A significantly elevated incidence, particularly notable among women, was observed for peritoneal mesothelioma, independently of exposure levels. A significantly elevated incidence was also noted among men for cancer of small intestine and oesophagus, for cumulative exposure indexes for asbestos above 80 fibres/mL x years. A significantly elevated incidence of cancer of the small intestine was also observed among men having been exposed to asbestos for periods in excess of 25 years and for mean exposure levels in excess of 4 fibres/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the existence of a relationship between exposure to asbestos and cancer of the small intestine and of the oesophagus in men...|$|R

40|$|The hypervascularization of the bronquial wall, <b>secondary</b> {{to chronic}} <b>bronchopulmonary</b> {{inflammation}} is a bleeding etiology in smokers, but insufficient to explain certain massive recurrent cases. We report {{a case of}} a woman with a smoking history who presented a recurrent and massive hemoptysis. A diagnostic study with laboratory tests, bronchoscopy, computed tomography and echocardiogram did not identify the etiological cause. However, bronchial arteriography showed right and left bronchial tortuous and dilated arteries and demonstrated that a bronchovascular fistula was the origin of the hemoptysis. An acquired form of the Dieulafoy's disease in this context of a smoking history might justify such findings. Bronchial arteriography as a diagnostic method should be the preferred choice rather than bronchoscopy in these cases.

40|$|Abstract Introduction This is {{the first}} report to {{describe}} the feasibility and effectiveness of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in the <b>secondary</b> treatment of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> dysplasia. Case presentation A former male preterm of Caucasian ethnicity delivered at 29 weeks gestation developed severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At {{the age of six}} months he was in permanent tachypnea and dyspnea and in need of 100 % oxygen with a flow of 2. 0 L/minute via a nasal cannula. Intermittent nocturnal noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was then administered for seven hours daily. The ventilator was set at a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cmH 2 O, with pressure support of 4 cmH 2 O, trigger at 1. 4 mL/second, and a maximum inspiratory time of 0. 7 seconds. Over the course of seven weeks, the patient's maximum daytime fraction of inspired oxygen via nasal cannula decreased from 1. 0 to 0. 75, his respiratory rate from 64 breaths/minute to 50 breaths/minute and carbon dioxide from 58 mmHg to 44 mmHg. Conclusion Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may be a novel therapeutic option for established severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the case presented, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation achieved sustained improvement in ventilation and thus prepared our patient for safe home oxygen therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV) is a {{developmental}} disorder of the lungs, primarily affecting their vasculature. FOXF 1 haploinsufficiency due to heterozygous genomic deletions and point mutations {{have been reported}} in most patients with ACDMPV. The majority of mice with heterozygous loss-of-function of Foxf 1 exhibit neonatal lethality with evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage in some of them. By comparing transcriptomes of human ACDMPV lungs with control lungs using expression arrays, we found that several genes and pathways involved in lung development, angiogenesis, and in pulmonary hypertension development, were deregulated. Similar transcriptional changes were found in lungs of the postnatal day 0. 5 Foxf 1 +/- mice when compared to their wildtype littermate controls; 14 genes, COL 15 A 1, COL 18 A 1, COL 6 A 2, ESM 1, FSCN 1, GRINA, IGFBP 3, IL 1 B, MALL, NOS 3, RASL 11 B, MATN 2, PRKCDBP, and SIRPA, were found common to both ACDMPV and Foxf 1 heterozygous lungs. Our results advance knowledge toward understanding of the molecular mechanism of ACDMPV, lung development, and its vasculature pathology. These data may also be useful for understanding etiologies of other lung disorders, e. g. pulmonary hypertension, <b>bronchopulmonary</b> dysplasia, or <b>cancer.</b> Partha Sen, Avinash V.
