40|$|We {{theoretically}} and empirically {{examine the}} effects of reputation concerns on the effort and performance of security analysts. We develop a two-period Bayesian learning model in which a representative analyst influences her relative forecast performance through <b>her</b> unobserved <b>ability</b> and effort. The analyst’s effort in each period, the market’s inferences of her unobserved effort, her assessments of <b>her</b> own <b>ability,</b> and the market’s assessments of <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> are all endogenously determined in a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium of the dynamic game between the analyst and the market. We explicitly derive the equilibrium and show that (i) the analyst’s effort declines with the average assessment of <b>her</b> own <b>ability,</b> the market’s average assessment or <b>her</b> <b>ability,</b> and with <b>her</b> prior average relative performance; (ii) the market’s inference of the analyst’s effort declines with its average assessment of <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> and with <b>her</b> prior average relative performance, (iii) the market underestimates (overestimates) the analyst’s effort when its assessment of <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> is greater (less) than her own assessment; (iv) the sensitivity of effort to prior performance declines with the analyst’s experience. We use our model to develop testable structural hypotheses that link an analyst’s contemporaneous relative performance to her prior average relative performance and experience and show significant empirical support for the hypotheses. Using a direct empirical proxy for an analyst’s perceived effort, we also show significant empirical support for the theoretical predictions for the relations among effort, prior performance and experience...|$|R
