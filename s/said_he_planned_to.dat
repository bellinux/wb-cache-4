5|$|Parseghian, who was 51 at the time, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> take {{at least}} a year off from {{coaching}} before considering a run at a job in the professional ranks.

5|$|In the January 2006 {{transfer}} window, {{he joined}} Grimsby Town on a two-year deal, {{three years after}} they first {{expressed an interest in}} signing him. He made his debut against former club Peterborough United in League Two, on 28 January 2006 in a 2–1 home defeat, and scored his first and {{what turned out to be}} only goal for the club against Mansfield on 14 February 2006.

5|$|On 22 August 2007, Robinson made {{a mistake}} that {{resulted}} in Germany scoring their first goal of the match. England lost the match 2–1 for their first loss at the new Wembley Stadium. He was substituted at half-time and replaced by David James, although then England manager Steve McClaren <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> make this substitution before the match. Despite this error, Robinson was still the number one goalkeeper, featuring in four further European Championship qualifiers, and keeping a clean sheet in three of them. He made another mistake, however, in a 2–1 defeat against Russia: Robinson palmed a shot {{into the path of}} Russian forward Roman Pavlyuchenko's path, resulting in the striker scoring Russia's winning goal. As a result, McClaren dropped Robinson for the final qualifying match against Croatia in November, replacing him with Scott Carson. England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals as they lost 3–2 in their final match against Croatia; Carson made an error from a Niko Kranjčar shot for the first goal.|$|E

25|$|A G20 {{financial}} transaction tax (G20 FTT) was first proposed in 2008. The {{next year the}} G20 FTT received {{the support of the}} US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

According to Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and a supporter of a G20 FTT, even a small tax of 10 basis points on equities and 2 basis points on bonds could generate about $48 billion from G20 member states or $9 billion if only adopted by larger European countries.|$|E

Henderson employs satire to present perceived flaws with evolutionary biology and discusses history and lifestyle from a Pastafarian perspective. The gospel urges readers to try Pastafarianism for thirty days, saying, [...] "If you don't like us, your old religion will most likely take you back".

500|$|Over the years, Harvey Pollack, who at {{the time}} was in charge of {{publicity}} and statistics for the Warriors, has given conflicting statements on the question. In a 1992 book, he was twice quoted as saying that the game ended with 46 seconds remaining. But in a 2002 interview quoted by Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry, Pollack said that the last 46 seconds were played, and that Chamberlain just stood in the middle circle, waiting for the game to end and not wanting to touch the ball, as [...] "100 sounded better than 102". The game's official box score notes that Warrior Joe Ruklick missed two free throws after the break. Ruklick <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> miss the second free throw in hopes that Chamberlain might rebound it and get 102points.|$|E
500|$|When Air Wonder Stories was {{launched}} {{in the middle of}} 1929 there were already pulp magazines such as Sky Birds and Flying Aces which focused on aerial adventures.

By contrast, Gernsback <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> fill Air Wonder solely with [...] "flying stories of the future, strictly along scientific-mechanical-technical lines, full of adventure, exploration and achievement." [...] Non-fiction material on aviation was printed, including quizzes, short popular articles, and book reviews. The letters column {{made it clear that the}} readership comprised more science fiction fans than aviation fans, and Gernsback later commented that the overlap with Science Wonder readers was 90% (a figure that presumably referred only to the subscription base, not to newsstand sales).|$|E
