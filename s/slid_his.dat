25|$|According to Hindu legend, there lived a demon (asura) Tharukasuran, who conquered Prithvi (earth) and Svarga (heaven). Indra, {{the leader}} of {{celestial}} deities and other gods suffered {{at the hands of}} Tharukasuran and sought the help of the creator-god Brahma, who asked them to worship Shiva in Thiruverumbur. In order to deceive Tharukasuran, the devas transformed into ants and reached the temple. Since the surface of the lingam (aniconic form of Shiva) was slippery, the ants found it difficult to climb up and worship. Shiva transformed himself into an ant hill and <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> head, which enabled the ants to climb and worship. Hence the name Erumbeeswarar is derived from Erumbu meaning ant and Easwaran referring to Shiva. This is one of the three places where Shiva <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> head for his worshippers, the other two being the temples at Virinjipuram and Thiruppanandal. The temple is also referred as Rathinakoodam, Thirverumbipuram, Erumbeesam, Brahmapuram, Laskhmipuram, Madhuvanam, Rathnakoodapuram, Manikoodapuram and Kumarapuram in various religious literature. The temple is locally called as Kailash (the abode of Shiva) of South India.|$|E
25|$|After tea Australia {{continued}} {{to settle into}} their batting rhythm as Hussey reached his 50 in the 64th over. England began to lose the advantage they had established early in the day, with runs coming more easily to Australia. In the 73rd over Hussey survived a dramatic run out chance {{which had to be}} referred to the third umpire as he <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> bat back into his crease {{a fraction of a second}} before Geraint Jones broke the stumps off a James Anderson throw-in. It was not until after the new ball had been taken in the 83rd over that England got a breakthrough. Matthew Hoggard was again the successful bowler, claiming Ponting for 142 and later Hussey for 91 in the 91st over. After the fall of Hussey's wicket, Michael Clarke and Adam Gilchrist established themselves at the crease to end the day on 30 and 13 respectively. The Australian score was 312 for 5, 40 runs short of the follow-on target.|$|E
25|$|All {{cars were}} ordered to park in the pit lane while marshals cleared the track of debris. Twenty minutes later, the race was {{restarted}} behind the safety car. Racing resumed on lap four, with Leclerc leading the field back up to speed, {{but was unable to}} hold off Rosenqvist who retook the lead through the Mandarin Bend while MacLeod took advantage of the situation and moved up to third by passing Leclerc under braking for Lisboa turn. On the following lap, Sims attempted to line up an overtaking manoevure on Leclerc but could not successfully take third place from him. Rosenqvist opened up a two-second lead, until MacLeod lost second place to Leclerc who overtook him around the outside at Lisboa corner on lap seven. MacLeod fell out of the top three as he <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> car at Moorish corner and made contact with the wall. MacLeod was forced to limp back to the pit lane to replace a punctured right-rear tyre. At that point in the race, Rosenqvist led Leclerc, Sims, Giovinazzi, Pommer, Ferrucci, Stroll and Lorandi.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} group of five qualifiers, where drivers waited for the optimum time to set their lap times, Bird paced the session despite having an {{oversteer}} in his car, ahead of Abt and Robin Frijns. Carroll was fourth and António Félix da Costa was off the pace and was {{the first group}}'s slowest qualifier. Vergne drove cleanly and was the fastest driver in the second group. He was ahead of Prost who lost time in the first sector and d'Ambrosio. Engel and Loïc Duval rounded out the top five. In the third group, Rosenqvist set the overall fastest lap time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 8.171 seconds. López was second-fastest, nearly two-tenths of a second in arrears with di Grassi third. Both Piquet and Evans were off the pace and were the third group's slowest two drivers; the latter made minor contact with the barrier on his maximum power lap. In the fourth group, Heidfeld was the fastest driver, nearly-three tenths of a second in front of Turvey, who was in turn, two-tenths ahead of Sarrazin. Buemi was the first driver to venture onto the track in the fourth group but struggled on his maximum power lap with a large amount of oversteer, and Dillmann rounded out the top five qualifiers. At the end of group qualifying, the lap times set by Rosenqvist, Bird, Heidfeld, López and di Grassi were fast to enable them progression into super pole. Di Grassi clinched the second pole position of his career with a time of one minute and 8.312 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by López who recorded a lap time 0.001 seconds slower than di Grassi. The margin of gap was the closest in Formula E history. Rosenqvist clipped the turn nine kerb, causing him to lose momentum, and <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> car lightly driving through turn ten, restricting him to third. Heidfeld qualified fourth, and Bird struggled for pace, going one second slower than di Grassi in the first sector, to round out the top five.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time {{under the auspices of}} the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team {{travelled}} to Australia for the 1903–04 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two. Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings. In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a [...] "very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [...] demonstration". Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. [...] The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. [...] Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. [...] Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. [...] Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. [...] Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> bat to make his ground. The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting [...] "Crock!, Crock!, Crock!" [...] Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. [...] At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground. Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. [...] Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216runs.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he <b>slid,</b> <b>his</b> foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't. I looked at my foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E

2500|$|At Charlotte, Earnhardt, Jr was {{battling for}} a {{position}} inside the top 10 when he made contact Carl Edwards and hit the wall ending up 29th. At Kansas, Earnhardt, Jr had to pit for a loose wheel under green and ended up finishing 21st, 2 laps down. Heading into Talladega, he basically needed to win to advance. He led 61 laps, but he <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> tires coming onto pit road and ended up having to take 2 tires instead of fuel only while others were taking fuel only. He {{ended up on the}} front row, heading into the only GWC. But a wreck behind him ended up cutting it short and he ended up 2nd upon a review, eliminating him from the championship. At Martinsville, the week after he was eliminated from Chase Contention, he was strong all race taking home a 4th-place finish at the track. [...] At Texas the following week Earnhardt recovered from an early spin to finish 6th. Earnhardt Jr. managed to get his 3rd victory of the season at Phoenix, after the race was called for rain. At the season finale at Homestead Earnhardt crashed early in the race, winding up 40th. For the 13th consecutive year, Earnhardt won the NMPA Most Popular Driver Award.|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt {{started the}} 2016 {{season with a}} crash in the Sprint Unlimited on lap 23 when Brian Vickers cut down a tire and hit him, {{damaging}} {{the side of his}} car. This would allow him to finish 15th, four laps down. He then {{went on to win the}} first Can-Am Duel race for the second year in a row. In the Daytona 500, he was strong early in the race but with 30 laps to go, he spun off of turn 4 while trying to make a move and hit the SAFER barrier head-on. He would wind up 36th. The following week in Atlanta he was very strong, finishing second. [...] The following week, at Las Vegas, Earnhardt had a car that was solid all day and ended with an 8th-place finish. At the spring race in Phoenix, he led for a good portion of the race [...] but stayed out on old tires during overtime. Because of this, he <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> tires on the start, finishing 5th. At Fontana the next week, he struggled throughout the race in the early stages, even being as low as 34th. But in overtime, he made a charge, finishing 11th. At Martinsville, he spun on lap 5, spending 300 laps one lap down. But in the end, he finished 14th and on the lead lap. In Texas, he was strong late in the race, finishing 2nd to Kyle Busch, who won back to back races. At Bristol, he stalled his car on the start, going 2 laps down. But as the race went on, his car came to life and he finished 2nd.|$|E
2500|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session ran for an {{hour and}} was divided into four groups of five cars. Each group was determined by a lottery system and was permitted six minutes of on-track activity. All drivers were limited to two timed laps with one at maximum power. The fastest five overall competitors in the four groups participated in a [...] "Super Pole" [...] session with one driver on the track at any time going out in reverse order. Each of the five drivers was limited to one timed lap; the starting order was determined by the participants' fastest times. The driver and team who recorded the fastest time were awarded three points towards their respective championships. Qualifying was held in dry and warm weather conditions, and the track appeared slower than in practice. In the first group of five runners, where drivers waited three and a half minutes before venturing onto the track, Duval was fastest, three-tenths of a seconds quicker than Abt. The duo were followed by Bird who could not use the maximum amount of power available to him due to a mapping issue. Piquet heavily locked his tyres on his maximum power lap, and Jérôme d'Ambrosio was the first group's slowest (and overall) driver as he failed to reach the timing line to start his full power lap. Track conditions improved in the second group which saw the five drivers wait until the closing seconds to begin their maximum power laps. Sarrazin recorded the fastest lap time and Prost took second. Frijns was third-fastest. António Félix da Costa attacked but struggled with understeer and <b>slid</b> <b>his</b> car to go half a second slower than Sarrazin. López was the second group's slowest participant after a similar mapping error to teammate Bird left him driving at a slower pace.|$|E
