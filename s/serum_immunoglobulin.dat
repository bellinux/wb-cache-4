Milk whey from infected dams provided a modest level of protection when fed to pups. Immunoglobulins from T. spiralis-infected rat serum protected suckling pups when injected intravenously (i. v.) into lactating dams 2 days prior to pup challenge. Intraperitoneal injection of pups with <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> also enabled them to express rapid expulsion. The protective component of serum was precipitated with 40 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and was not affected by heating to 56 degrees, although antibodies mediating passive cutaneous anaphylaxis were inactivated by both treatments. Oral transfer of biliary immunoglobulins collected from infected rats at various times during a primary infection provided no protection to pups.

The rats six sets- control set (I) and (IV) exposed to ambient air for 30 and 60 days, experimental set (II) and (V) exposed to SO 2 gas for 30 and 60 days and experimental set (III) and (VI) exposed to SO 2 gas with pre-exposure supplementation of aqueous extract of ashwagandha root (5 mg/rat/day) for 30 and 60 days.

40|$|In B-cell development, {{expression}} of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (VH) gene repertoires {{is determined by}} genetic mechanisms that favor rearrangement of the most D-proximal genes, resulting in overutilization of the VH 7183 gene family early in ontogeny and in differentiating B cells of the adult bone marrow.

By comparing VH gene family expression in the bone marrow (emergent) and peripheral (available and actual) B-cell repertoires of germ-free and conventionally raised BALB/c mice, we found that peripheral selection of VH gene family utilization does not occur in germ-free animals.

50|$|Hyper IgM syndromes is a {{group of}} primary immune {{deficiency}} disorders characterized by defective CD40 signaling; via B cells affecting class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation. Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination deficiencies are characterized by elevated <b>serum</b> <b>Immunoglobulin</b> M (IgM) levels and a considerable deficiency in Immunoglobulins G (IgG), A (IgA) and E (IgE). As a consequence, people with HIGM have decreased concentrations of serum IgG and IgA and normal or elevated IgM, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis is {{difficult}} because {{of the diversity of}} phenotypes seen in people with CVID. For example, <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> levels in people with CVID vary greatly. Generally, people can be grouped as follows: no immunoglobulin production, immunoglobulin (Ig) M production only, or both normal IgM and IgG production. Additionally, B cell numbers are also highly variable. 12% of people have no detectable B cells, 12% have reduced B cells, and 54% are within the normal range. In general, people with CVID display higher frequencies of naive B cells and lower frequencies of class-switched memory B cells. Frequencies of other B cell populations, such as IgD memory B cells, transitional B cells, and CD21 B cells, are also affected, and are associated with specific disease features. Although CVID is often thought of as a <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> and B cell-mediated disease, T cells can display abnormal behavior. Affected individuals typically present with low frequencies of CD4+, a T-cell marker, and decreased circulation of regulatory T cells and iNKT cell. Notably, approximately 10% of people display CD4+ T cell counts lower than 200 cells/mm3; this particular phenotype of CVID has been named LOCID (Late Onset Combined Immunodeficiency), and has a poorer prognosis than classical CVID.|$|E
40|$|Serological {{studies are}} often {{conducted}} to examine exposure to infectious agents in wildlife populations.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} (OSMF) is {{a chronic}} {{condition of the}} oral cavity which results in permanent disability. The pathogenesis is poorly understood and the disease is difficult to treat. OSMF is associated with immunological changes (altered levels of <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulins)</b> {{and the effect of}} treatment (especially antioxidants and levamisole) on <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> (Ig) is not known. This study was carried out to evaluate the clinical effects of levamisole (VERMISOL), and antioxidants (ANTOXID) and its effect on <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> IgG, IgA and IgM. Meterials and Methods: Forty-five study subjects were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups. There were 15 patients in each group; group I patients received levamisole, 50 mg three times daily for three alternate weeks, group II patients received 2 capsules of antoxid daily for six weeks, group III patients received levamisole and antoxid. The results were analyzed with paired ′t′ test and unpaired ′t′ test. Results: The results indicated that levamisole, antoxid and the combination of levamisole and antoxid showed significant improvement in mouth opening and reduction in burning sensation. Significant reduction of serum IgG, IgA and IgM was seen in the levamisole group and combination group whereas in the antoxid group significant reduction was observed only in serum IgA and IgM. Interpretation and Conclusion: Levamisole can bring about clinical improvement and is better than antoxid and the combination regimen.

5000|$|There is {{a strong}} {{association}} of C. pneumoniae with long-standing asthma among the non-atopic asthma in comparison to atopic asthma. [...] In fact, the severity of asthma can {{be determined by the}} elevated titres to C. pneumoniae, but not to other potential pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenovirus, influenza A and B or parainfluenza virus. [...] It is hypothesized that C. pneumoniae is associated with asthma because C. pneumoniae has been found to cause ciliostasis in bronchial epithelial cells. [...] Meanwhile, sero-epidemiological data also provide evidences to support that C. pneumoniae plays a role in asthma by amplifying inflammation and inciting the disease process. [...] The association of C. pneumoniae and asthma begins with C. pneumoniae producing 60-kDa heat shock proteins that provide a prolonged antigenic stimulation. [...] This particular heat shock protein is known as a member of hsp60 family of stress proteins, which can be found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The production of hsp60 remains unaltered even when C. pneumoniae is dormant and does not replicate, since that hsp60 serves as a protective antigen. [...] Its antigenic stimulation strongly amplifies chronic inflammation by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ by infected cells, which ultimately leads to immunopathological tissue damage and scarring in the asthmatic lungs. [...] Furthermore, infection with C. pneumonia also induces <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> M (IgM), IgA, and IgG responses, which are associated with chronic asthma.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To measure serum {{levels of}} {{immunoglobulin}} A byimmunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) in {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus (DM- 1) patients and to verify the prevalence of immunoglobulin A deficiency(IgAD) in diabetic patients. Methods: The <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> Alevel was determined in 149 DM- 1 patients by three methods. IgADwas defined as <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> A level lower than 5 mg/dl. If <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> A level was undetectable by turbidimetry,radial immunodiffusion was performed in low plate concentration. For patients with undetectable <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> A levelby the two previous methods, quantification was performed byELISA. In patients with IgAD, the levels of immunoglobulins Gand M were measured by turbidimetry to exclude other humoralimmunodeficiencies. Results: Out of 149 DM- 1 patients evaluated, 141 (94. 6 %) had normal <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> A levels byturbidimetry. Eight patients (5. 3 %) had undetectable serumimmunoglobulin A levels by turbidimetry and radial immunodiffusion. In these eight patients, the determination of serum immunoglobulinA was performed by ELISA, a more sensitive method. Very lowlevels of <b>serum</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> A were detected in these diabeticpatients. In all diabetic patients, immunoglobulins G and M werenormal for age by turbidimetry.
