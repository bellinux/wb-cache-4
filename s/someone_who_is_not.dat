The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.|$|E

25|$|While {{it works}} in {{preventing}} speech, {{a person who has}} been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, {{it is for this reason}} that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she feels any kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> careful.|$|E
25|$|The most {{plausible}} {{suggestion is}} that having women read the Torah affronts communal “dignity” {{because they are not}} generally members of the obligated public community. Relying on <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> usually—and in the case of Torah reading, not at all—a member of the public community suggests that the regular members were either unable or chose not to shoulder their communal responsibilities (out of ignorance or apathy). Outsourcing obligations betrays an undignified attitude toward the obligation itself; educating future members of the congregation does not.|$|E
25|$|Ocasio v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{clarified}} whether the Hobbs Act's definition of conspiracy to commit extortion only includes attempts to acquire property from <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a member of the conspiracy. The case arose when Samuel Ocasio, a former Baltimore, Maryland police officer, was indicted for participating in a kickback scheme with an automobile repair shop where officers would refer drivers of damaged vehicles to the shop in exchange for cash payments. Ocasio argued that he should not be found guilty of conspiring to commit extortion because the only property that was exchanged in the scheme was transferred from one member of the conspiracy to another, and an individual cannot be found guilty of conspiring to extort a co-conspirator.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{prayer is}} {{considered}} acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten adults—a minyan—is {{the most highly}} recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means {{over the age of}} 12 or 13 (bat or bar mitzvah). Judaism had originally counted only men in the minyan for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-specific positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being bound up in an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan. Since 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the minyan. A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a minyan mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a minyan. All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors. In Orthodox Judaism, according to some authorities, women can count in the minyan for certain specific prayers, such as the Birchot HaGomel blessing, which both men and women are obligated to say publicly.|$|E

500|$|Prefix writer Craig Hubert {{rated the}} album 5 out of 10, {{and said it}} had more [...] "definable hooks" [...] than most other metal albums, but that still made the record no better or more accessible.

Speaking from his perspective as an aged listener and <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a fan of modern rock music, Jay Bennett of the Phoenix New Times gave the album a grade of B. He described the album as “a pleasant surprise”, saying that he was not a fan of metal from recent years but that the album has “a lot more in common with the late-‘70s and early-‘80s-era Judas Priest and Iron Maiden”, which he liked.|$|E

Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to each one of us. As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women. She does not treat men {{as if they are}} {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men just happen to come and go in her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end.
