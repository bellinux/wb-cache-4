5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{takeover}} was impossible in the Medici Bank. The essential structure {{was that of}} a single partnership based in Florence, which immutably held the lion's share of shares in each branch (and the three textile factories in Florence), which were themselves incorporated as independent partnerships. At {{the end of the year}} on March 24 (by the then used calendar), each partnership would be dissolved, although the Medici could dissolve a partnership at any time with six months' notice. The books were thoroughly gone through and checked, and a reckoning of profits would be made. Indeed, the structure of the Medici Bank resembles nothing <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> modern holding company.|$|E

This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler; but, that aside, his footwork was perfection. I never saw a better forcer of the ball to the on-side, and for this stroke his body moved beautifully into position." [...] However, Ponsford was not a stylish batsman. Bradman said [...] "There were more beautiful players, but for absolute efficiency and results where can one turn to equal ?"

500|$|Many {{criticized the}} {{inclusion}} of yodeling and [...] "The Lonely Goatherd" [...] sample. In a review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called the track [...] "yodel-trocious" [...] and argued that [...] "the problem isn't the Swiss Miss motif <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> fourth-rate Neptunes track. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian {{was pleased with the}} track, describing the yodeling as [...] "off-her-head", and referred to the track as [...] "a pinnacle of madness". IndieLondon's Jack Foley noted [...] "Wind It Up" [...] as a highlight of The Sweet Escape and called it [...] "Stefani's gift that she can take something that, on paper, sounds cheesy and make it utterly, utterly cool." [...] USA Todays Ken Barnes, however, found the track [...] "campy" [...] and [...] "a tacky attempt at sexiness", adding that the combination of yodeling and the interpolation was [...] "awkward". Alex Miller of the NME also found the song campy, commenting that its [...] "dumb sexual bravado has all the sophistication of a teenage boy's wet dream", and compared the yodeling, interpolation, and [...] "erotic rap" [...] to [...] "a trench foot which screams for amputation from the tracklisting".|$|E
500|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek {{independence}} from Macedon in {{what became known}} as the Lamian War. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: [...] "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of Creon in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> temple unpolluted." [...] After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the Prytaneum.|$|E

500|$|Within {{hours of}} Toivonen's crash, Jean-Marie Balestre and the FISA decided to ban Group B cars from {{competing}} in the 1987 season. The planned Group S was also cancelled and manufacturers were stuck with cars they could not race. Audi and Ford withdrew from Group B racing immediately, but other teams competed {{until the end of}} the season. The Tour de Corse continued the next day and Bruno Saby won with his Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2. Prior to Santos' and Toivonen's crashes, many commentators and drivers had warned of accidents resulting from drivers simply being unable to control their powerful cars. FISA was criticised for recognising the problem too late. A FISA investigation later proved that drivers' reactions were too slow to keep up with the speed of the Group B cars, and drivers' eyes could not adjust their focus between the fast corners, resulting in tunnel vision. However, due to the high speed of the cars, rallying was more popular among spectators than ever. FISA had to face criticism also for overreacting to Toivonen's accident. John Davenport, author and former rally co-driver, stated in 2004 that [...] "Group B could have been tamed. They were only unsafe in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> fuel system, which caused Toivonen's death, and the crowd control needed changing– it wasn't the actual cars." [...] Group B cars have been described as [...] "too fast to race." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel's format, {{its various}} {{multiple}} sources, its manipulation of linear time and its inclusion of supernatural elements (talking dogs and meteor rifles, for example) all serve to deconstruct {{the idea of}} absolute power, by creating an ambiguity between fact and myth, between Dr Francia and the Supreme, and between Roa Bastos and the Compiler. Francia places himself above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet in the Compiler's notes and retelling of events, the novel {{is presented as a}} genuine version of history, one that contradicts and questions the Supreme's. In their collectivity, they deny the illusion of absolute power, whether the power is that of Francia the dictator or Roa Bastos the writer. This ambiguity between myth and fact is elaborated on {{at the end of the}} novel in the fictional debate over the Supreme's remains; it questions the nature of national political myth, and how heroes and villains are created in it and where the Supreme falls into those categories after being portrayed as both by Roa Bastos. As Deiner poses the question raised by the novel, [...] "Is he to be portrayed as a valiant leader who held the country together in the face of enormous external aggression, or as a despot who laid the basis for almost two centuries of exploitation of Paraguay’s peoples by its leaders?" [...] The answer is not so much of importance to the novel, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> fact that the question itself exists, thereby confirming the power of writing over so called [...] "absolute" [...] power.|$|E

In this particular play, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> characters' names {{call attention to}} contemporary politics: Cleon was a major political figure of the time, and through these characters, Aristophanes freely criticizes the actions of this prominent politician in public.
