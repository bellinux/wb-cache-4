5|$|In 1832, Rogers {{partnered with}} two investors from New York City, Morris Ketchum and Jasper Grosvenor. Jefferson Works was renamed Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor, {{and the company}} began to diversify into the {{railroad}} industry. The company soon manufactured springs, axles and other <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> for railroad use.|$|E

5|$|Reubens {{has also}} had <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> dubbing or making cameos {{in a series of}} Cartoon Network {{projects}} such as the 2006 television film Re-Animated, the animated cartoon series Chowder, Tom Goes to the Mayor, and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!.|$|E
5|$|The German {{print of}} the film on the DVD is missing <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> of the film and runs at 121 minutes. A Region 2 DVD of the film was {{released}} by Eureka! in a box set titled The Complete Fritz Lang Box Set. This set included the two other Mabuse films directed by Lang, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler and The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse.|$|E
5|$|Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi {{stated that}} he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first Mother video game, and that it was made for the players. He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and wanted to run wild with the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E
50|$|At the 2007 election, it {{encompassed}} all of City of Cessnock, a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of the City of Newcastle (including Beresfield and Tarro), a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of the City of Lake Macquarie (including Barnsley and West Wallsend) and a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of Singleton Council (including Belford). At the 2013 redistribution {{it gained}} Broke, Milbrodale and Wollombi from Upper Hunter and lost Beresfield and Tarro to Wallsend.|$|R
50|$|The spt {{function}} (<b>smallest</b> <b>parts</b> function) is {{a function}} in number theory that counts {{the sum of the}} number of <b>smallest</b> <b>parts</b> in each partition of a positive integer. It is related to the partition function.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the table}} below {{are given the}} mean square {{fluctuations}} of the thermodynamic variables [...] and [...] in any <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of a body. The <b>small</b> <b>part</b> must still be large enough, however, to have negligible quantum effects.|$|R
5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} {{obtained}} by mining, are divided into <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E
5|$|Since 1887, {{the borough}} has {{included}} the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> of Earley and Tilehurst. By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham {{and still more}} of Tilehurst. A small area of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An attempt {{to take over a}} small area of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997. Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of new genes can also involve <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions. When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, {{which can be}} mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions. For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.|$|E
5000|$|ApexDC++ is {{an example}} of a program that uses multi-source downloading.

40|$|The theorem `the {{number of}} {{partitions}} of n with unique <b>smallest</b> <b>part</b> and largest part at most twice the <b>smallest</b> <b>part</b> equals {{the number of}} partitions of n in which the largest part is odd and the <b>smallest</b> <b>part</b> is larger than half the largest part' was stated by Ramanujan in his last letter to Hardy. This was proved by both Watson and Andrews. In this paper we give a new bijective proof of this result...|$|R

5|$|This {{treatise}} {{was thought}} lost until {{the discovery of}} the Archimedes Palimpsest in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses infinitesimals, and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results. As with The Cattle Problem, The Method of Mechanical Theorems was written {{in the form of a}} letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} being made to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E
5|$|Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth {{were cast}} as Yash and Nandini's mothers, respectively. The film also {{featured}} Johnny Lever as Haldiram (a shopkeeper in Chandni Chowk), Himani Shivpuri as Haldiram's wife, Jibraan Khan as Krish Raichand (Rahul and Anjali's son), Amar Talwar as Mr. Kapoor (Yash's friend and Naina's father). Ramona Sunavala, Jeroo Writer and Vikas Sethi feature as Poo's friends Sonya, Tanya and Robbie, respectively. Additionally, Ashutosh Singh features as Ashfaque, Rukshaar's husband. Shilpa Mehta, Shashikala and Parzan Dastur were cast as Ashfaque's mother, grandmother and nephew, respectively. Shashikala played the in-law to Rukhsaar. Punit Malhotra and Johnny Lever's real-life son Jesse Lever had <b>small</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of {{the estate}} was {{demolished}} in 2007. Another <b>smaller</b> <b>part</b> {{of the estate}} was demolished in 1990 due to mining subsidence and the site was redeveloped as Walker Grange, a residential home for elderly people which was opened on 27 February 1992.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon {{assigned}} a very <b>small</b> <b>part</b> {{of the territory}} of the county to Czechoslovakia. The rest stayed in Hungary and merged with the eastern part of Moson county and a very <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of Pozsony county to form Győr-Moson-Pozsony county.|$|R
5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A Little Bit of Heaven, Priest, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E
5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of Jim Raynor in all released StarCraft games to date, has revealed {{that for the most}} part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours, a fact mirrored in a similar interview with Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell. Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E
5|$|To protect crops {{from wind}} and drought, the grain intendant Zhao Guo (趙過) created the {{alternating}} fields system (daitianfa 代田法) during Emperor Wu's reign. This system switched {{the positions of}} furrows and ridges between growing seasons. Once experiments with this system yielded successful results, the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it. Han farmers also used the pit field system (aotian 凹田) for growing crops, which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain. In southern and <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> of central Han-era China, paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice, while farmers along the Huai River used transplantation methods of rice production.|$|E
5|$|The prehistoric {{period of}} Jordan ended at around 2000 BC when the Semitic nomads {{known as the}} Amorites entered the region. During the Bronze Age and Iron Age, present-day Jordan was home to several ancient kingdoms, whose populations spoke Semitic {{languages}} of the Canaanite group. Among them were Ammon, Edom and Moab, which are described as tribal kingdoms rather than states. They are mentioned in ancient texts such as the Old Testament. Archaeological finds have shown that Ammon was {{in the area of}} the modern city of Amman, Moab in the highlands east of the Dead Sea and Edom in the area around Wadi Araba. These Transjordanian kingdoms were in continuous conflict with the neighbouring Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah, centered west of the Jordan River, though the former was known to have at times controlled <b>small</b> <b>parts</b> east of the River. Frequent confrontations ensued and tensions between them increased. One record of this is the Mesha Stele erected by the Moabite king Mesha in around 840 BC on which he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and victory against the Israelites. The stele constitutes one of the most important direct accounts of Biblical history. Subsequently, the Assyrian Empire reduced these kingdoms to vassals. When the region was later under the influence of the Babylonians, the Old Testament mentions that these kingdoms aided them in the 597 BC sack of Jerusalem.|$|E

50|$|The UB {{postcode}} area, {{also known}} as the Southall postcode area, is a group of eleven postcode districts in England, which are subdivisions of six post towns. These postcode districts cover parts of west and north-west London, as well as a very <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of Buckinghamshire. UB comes from an abbreviation of Uxbridge. The main sorting office is in Greenford (Green Park Way) and the area served includes much of the London Borough of Hillingdon and {{the western part of the}} London Borough of Ealing, while the western part of UB9 covers a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of the South Bucks district of Buckinghamshire, the southern part of UB2 covers a very <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of the London Borough of Hounslow, and a very <b>small</b> <b>part</b> of UB5 lies within the London Borough of Harrow.|$|R
