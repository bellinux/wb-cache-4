40|$|Fully {{differential}} amplifiers yield large differential {{gains and}} also high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), provided {{they do not}} include any unmatched grounded component. In biopotential measurements, however, the admissible gain of amplification stages located before dc suppression is usually limited by electrode offset voltage, which can saturate amplifier outputs. The standard solution is to first convert the differential input voltage to a single-ended voltage and then implement any other required functions, such as dc suppression and dc level restoring. This approach, however, yields a limited CMRR and {{may result in a}} relatively large equivalent input noise. This paper describes a novel fully differential biopotential amplifier based on a fully differential dc-suppression circuit that does not rely on any matched passive components, yet provides large CMRR and fast recovery from dc level transients. The proposed solution is particularly convenient for low supply voltage systems. An example implementation, based on standard low-power op amps and a single 5 -V power <b>supply,</b> <b>accepts</b> input offset voltages up to /spl plusmn/ 500 mV, yields a CMRR of 102 dB at 50 Hz, and provides, in accordance with the AAMI EC 38 standard, a reset behavior for recovering from overloads or artifactsPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a working-model xenon ion propulsion subsystem (XIPS) designed for north-south stationkeeping (NSSK) of 2500 -kg-class geosynchronous communication satellites. The XIPS {{consists of a}} 25 -cm-diameter laboratory-model thruster, a breadboard-model power supply, and a flight-prototype pressure regulator (the critical component of the pressure-regulated xenon feed system). With a thrust of 63. 5 mN, specific impulse of 2800 sec, and thruster efficiency of 65 percent, the XIPS performance {{is believed to be}} the highest ever reported for an ion thruster operated at 1. 3 -kW input power.

NAOMI (New Astrosat Observation Modular Instrument) is a telescope installed on the spacecraft, with a 200 mm diameter mirror that has a resolution of 2.5 m panchromatic and 10 yd in four different spectral regions.
