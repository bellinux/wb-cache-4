2500|$|In 1990, Bob, Paul, John, and Susan again regrouped as The Cowsills. The {{original}} {{plan was to}} simply hit the [...] "oldies circuit", but after some deliberation, they decided to showcase new material written by Bob and his wife, Mary Jo. This incarnation of the band started playing small clubs and showcases in the Los Angeles area and eventually spread out to similar venues {{across the country and}} into Canada. Their performances generated positive reviews from critics and fans alike, including a very well received performance on The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. On that show, <b>Susan</b> <b>said</b> in mock frustration that she could never figure out which of the two girls on The Partridge Family was supposed to represent her.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Bobby Fischer stayed {{for a time in}} the Polgár household. He had been living in {{seclusion}} in Yugoslavia due to an arrest warrant issued by the United States for violating the U.N. blockade of Yugoslavia with his 1992 match against Spassky, and for tax evasion. Susan Polgár met Bobby with her family and persuaded him to come out of hiding [...] "in a cramped hotel room in a small Yugoslavian village". During his stay, he played many games of Fischer Random Chess and helped the sisters analyse their games. <b>Susan</b> <b>said,</b> while he was friendly on a personal level and recalled mostly pleasant moments as their guest, there were conflicts due to his political views. On the suggestion of a friend of Fischer, a match of blitz chess between Fischer and Polgár was arranged and announced to the press. However, problems ensued between Fischer and László Polgár and Fischer cancelled the match, saying to a friend on whether the match would take place, [...] "No, they're Jewish." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{schooner}} {{carries a}} big crew for a fisherman," [...] <b>Susan</b> <b>said,</b> thoughtfully. [...] "There {{must be as}} many as twenty-five or thirty on her deck." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Susan</b> <b>said</b> he was, and Kenneth {{was delighted}} to find that his change of voice and costume {{disguised}} him so completely that Susan did not recognise him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{we went to}} bed, {{but were}} too excited to sleep. Really, as <b>Susan</b> <b>said</b> solemnly this morning, 'Mrs. Dr. dear, I think {{politics}} are too strenuous for women.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Other critics differed. <b>Susan</b> Sontag <b>said</b> it was [...] "mesmerizing", and Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "intensely {{personal}} and so very beautiful".|$|R

6000|$|... "She's no fisherman!" [...] Mark cried, {{becoming}} perplexed as {{he observed}} {{the truth of}} what <b>Susan</b> had <b>said.</b> [...] "So many people never could work on a craft of that size." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, sister, why not?" [...] {{said the}} little maiden; [...] "I think I shall go." [...] And <b>Susan</b> <b>said</b> {{this in a}} tone so mildly {{positive}} that Silence was amazed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do that first, {{and then}} look after myself," [...] <b>Susan</b> <b>said,</b> as she went toward the house, {{and a moment later}} Mark heard from her a cry of distress.|$|E
60|$|Florence, who {{was seated}} at her chamber window, {{with her face}} resting on her hand, sat looking out, and hardly seemed to hear what <b>Susan</b> <b>said,</b> she was so lost in thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be a}} moon to-night," [...] <b>Susan</b> Harding <b>said,</b> quietly, and Mark {{knew she}} was {{thinking}} of what might be expected after the sun had set, therefore he replied, to encourage her: ...|$|R
6000|$|... ["Oh, <b>Susan!</b> I've <b>said,</b> in {{the moments}} of mirth, [...] What's devotion to thee or to me? [...] I devoutly believe there's a heaven on earth, [...] And believe that that heaven's in thee." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>Susan</b> had <b>said,</b> {{the moon}} was in the third quarter, {{therefore}} {{it would be impossible}} for the Indians to paddle across the waters of the harbor without exposing themselves to the view of the island defenders.|$|R

60|$|Everything {{happened}} as usual, {{down to the}} point where <b>Susan</b> <b>said</b> her young mistress was well, and Mr Toots said it was of no consequence. To her amazement, Mr Toots, instead of going off, like a rocket, after that observation, lingered and chuckled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ran down}} to talk with mother and aunt," [...] <b>Susan</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} with difficulty because of her heavy breathing.

5000|$|In The New York Times, <b>Susan</b> Chira <b>said</b> that Milton {{had written}} [...] "a vivid, {{scrupulously}} researched biography ... it is a sheer pleasure to read Milton's vivid {{portraits of the}} small corps of foreigners who traded at the sufferance of Japanese feudal lords." ...|$|R
6000|$|Something {{in these}} {{northern}} melodies sank deep into my mother's inherited memories, also, {{and her eyes}} were wide and still with inward vision, but my Aunt <b>Susan</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "That's a fine invention, but I'd rather hear you sing," [...] and in this judgment Maria concurred.

60|$|On the {{far side}} of the {{platform}} a yellow, two-seated wagon was waiting, and away they drove through the village, with its old houses and its sleepy streets and its orchards, and its ancient tavern dating from stage-coach days. Just outside of it, on the tree-dotted slope of a long hill, was a modern brick building, exceedingly practical in appearance, surrounded by spacious grounds enclosed in a paling fence. That, <b>Susan</b> <b>said,</b> was the Sutton Home.|$|E
