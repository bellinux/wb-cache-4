60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> and {{her tiny}} foot beat impatiently upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> {{and turned}} away. When she resumed the conversation, {{her tone was}} {{completely}} changed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> She {{was moved}} by some emotion, but he was unable, for the moment, to {{classify}} it.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> to {{keep from}} crying out. She looked {{out of the window}} again, seeking control.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not catch}} his remark at first, as was natural {{in a person}} preoccupied. Then <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> to repress a smile.|$|R
60|$|The abrupt {{change in}} her manner startled him to a {{recollection}} of Susy, and he blushed. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and moved towards the window.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> For {{a moment}} a frown of {{annoyance}} clouded her face. She had {{said more than}} she intended.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> for a moment. If {{indeed he}} had known her actual position, his hopes would have been higher still.|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} wrists so cruelly {{that she could}} have screamed with the pain, but <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> to still the cry.|$|E
60|$|Miss Truefitt did {{not deny}} it, but <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and shot a sharp glance at him. She {{began to think that}} her pity was uncalled-for.|$|R
60|$|Yet, {{the next}} moment, <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{as if the}} {{expression}} had unwittingly escaped her; and with a reckless shrug of her shoulders she lay back on her pillow.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> hard. They were {{crossing}} the road now. After all, {{it was only}} a few months since she had bidden him go his own way and leave her to regulate her own friendships.|$|R
60|$|Letitia became {{suddenly}} more serious. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> {{and frowned}} distinctly into the fire. At that {{moment she was}} furious with a thought.|$|E
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> {{as though}} she regretted the words, which had escaped her almost involuntarily. But he was ready enough with his answer.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> {{and moved}} haughtily to one side. I made a {{movement}} {{as though to}} pass her, but she turned suddenly and prevented me.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you are, Mademoiselle?" [...] {{he asked}} quietly, {{for she had}} paused and he saw that <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> with <b>her</b> tiny white teeth as if she meant to check the words that would come {{tumbling}} out.|$|R
60|$|L. Well; then I was {{a little}} angry myself, and hoped St. Barbara would be quite angry; but <b>she</b> wasn't. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> first; and then gave a great sigh--such a wild, sweet sigh--and then she knelt down and hid her face on Neith's knees. Then Neith smiled a little, and was moved.|$|R
60|$|She became daring. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> under <b>lip</b> {{and flashed}} <b>her</b> spirit at him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> feeling vexed at his flippancy. A man on {{the point}} of death should take the last hours of his life more seriously.|$|E
60|$|Ruth was jaunty, but {{her voice}} was strained, and <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> with staccato {{nervousness}} when she was not speaking. Carl ventured to face the dragon.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> {{and faced}} me there, a sweet flushed living thing, with a tear {{coursing}} down her cheek, {{and her mouth}} now firm and steady.|$|E
60|$|With {{infinite}} relief, {{she made}} her final curtsey to her partner, and allowed him to lead {{her back to her}} official place beside the royal daïs. She could not see clearly, for her eyes had suddenly filled with burning tears of shame and bitter self-accusation. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> lest a cry of pain escaped them.|$|R
6000|$|But {{no sooner}} had she got outside, after that strange outburst, than <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> to keep back an angry, miserable feeling. He had been rude to her, she had been rude to him; {{that was the way}} they had said good-bye! Then, as she emerged into the sunlight, she thought: [...] "Oh! well; he doesn't care, and I'm sure I don't!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's breathless silence. Then {{the door}} was softly opened. Violet Brown went {{staggering}} back like a woman who sees a ghost. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> till the blood came. It was Peter Ruff who stood looking in upon them--Peter Ruff, carefully dressed in evening clothes, his silk hat at exactly the correct angle, his coat and white kid gloves upon his arm.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> in chagrin. They paced {{in silence}} to the lawn's end, and turned again. Then: [...] "You {{treat me like}} a fool," [...] she reproved him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Did {{you know}} him?" [...] It was Donna Dolores' {{turn to be}} embarrassed. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> and {{slightly}} contracted her eyebrows. For a moment they both stood on the defensive.|$|E
60|$|The sparkle came in Miss Gething’s eye again, then <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> {{and turned}} her head away miserably realizing her {{inability}} to treat this transgressor with the severity that he deserved.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> hesitated, <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> {{and turned}} {{towards the door}} without another word. A servant stood upon the threshold, summoned by the bell.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> coral <b>lips</b> [...] . but {{she also}} smiled. I could see that my {{personality}} and my manners had greatly impressed her.|$|R
60|$|He made a short pause. Her eyes wandered restlessly {{over the}} distant prospect, and <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> nether <b>lip</b> {{to stop that}} busy mouth.|$|R
6000|$|His eyebrows {{were ever}} so {{slightly}} uplifted. She was not absolutely sure {{that there was not}} something very suggestive of amusement in his deep-set eyes. <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> Naturally he was not a gentleman! ...|$|E
6000|$|It was undignified! <b>She</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> {{and felt}} her false position, as with a quiver of the voice she replied, 'We shall make nothing but {{mischief}} if we talk now. Go on with your business.' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{look was}} not lost on Jessie; and <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> in a way that showed she was not {{altogether}} pleased. Then Mr. Appleby, the manager of the moving-picture company, came forward, followed by several others.|$|E
60|$|Then, asserting {{itself as}} real at once {{over all the}} sounds her mind had imagined, came a stir in the thicket, then a {{vigorous}} movement. There was a snap. The reeds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice, and then everything was still save a measured swishing. She heard a low tremulous growl, and then everything was still again. The stillness lengthened--would it never end? She held <b>her</b> breath; <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> to stop screaming. Then something scuttled through the undergrowth. Her scream was involuntary. She did not hear the answering yell from the mound.|$|R
50|$|A {{post-mortem}} {{was carried}} out and no sign of semen was found. The ligature mark around her neck measured nine centimetres. She had bruises on her nose and temple, on her neck, and both her eyelids. At some stage during the struggle, <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> causing damage to the inner lining of her mouth. There was a wound on her cheek, which was an open cut that had a small, semi-circular abrasion which was a few centimetres away from it. The examiner noted the victim's diamond ring was still present, suggesting {{that she had not}} been killed for money.|$|R
60|$|Chauvelin {{had taken}} sure aim when he shot this tiny shaft. Marguerite's fresh young cheeks became a touch more pale and <b>she</b> <b>bit</b> <b>her</b> under <b>lip,</b> for <b>she</b> {{would not let}} him see that the shaft had struck home.|$|R
