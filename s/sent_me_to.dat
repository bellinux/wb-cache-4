25|$|When General Bell first <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to}} the perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E
500|$|In the 1897 season, Peel was {{suspended}} by Yorkshire for drunkenness. Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers, and {{the careers of}} several Yorkshire players in this period, including Peate, had been ended for this reason. Peel was always {{known to be a}} heavy drinker, but his behaviour had been tolerated. His fame, brought about by his performances, made the problem worse. Derek Hodgson, in the official Yorkshire club history, writes: [...] "A cheerful, gregarious man, [...] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society, particularly in London, that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was fobbed off by a man who announced himself as 'Peel's secretary', adding: 'He does not like interviews and has little to say. He <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take his place.'" [...] Hodgson observes: [...] "It is not impossible, of course, that Bobby was either shy, or 'indisposed' at that particular moment", and suggests that Peel's downfall, like Peate's before him, was because he [...] "was too often the toast of the town".|$|E

2500|$|Born in 1929 in Matsumoto, Nagano into an {{affluent}} family of merchants {{who owned a}} plant nursery and seed farm, Kusama started creating art {{at an early age}} and began writing poetry at age 18. Her mother was apparently physically abusive, and Kusama remembers her father as [...] "...the type who would play around, who would womanize a lot". Kusama says that her mother would often send her to spy on her father's extra-marital affairs, which instilled within her a lifelong contempt for sexuality, particularly the male body and the phallus: [...] "I don’t like sex. I had an obsession with sex. When I was a child, my father had lovers and I experienced seeing him. My mother <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> spy on him.

[...] Liu Bei's facial expression turned serious and he said, [...] "So Kong Rong knows that Liu Bei exists in this world!" [...] He then sent 3,000 troops to follow Taishi Ci back to Duchang. When the rebels heard that reinforcements had arrived, they fled and the siege of Duchang was automatically lifted. Kong Rong regarded Taishi Ci even more highly after this event. He told Taishi Ci, [...] "You are a young friend of mine." [...] When Taishi Ci returned home and told his mother about it, she said, [...] "I am very happy that you can repay Kong Rong's kindness in this way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Gaozu was sailing {{on a lake}} {{inside the}} Palace City {{during the time of}} the coup. [...] speculates that the emperor was alarmed by the {{impending}} crisis, thus he withdrew himself from the situation. He also surrounded himself with senior officials who were friendly to Li Shimin, because he possibly realized that Li Shimin was the cause of this and had better military connections that provided him with the advantage. The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (竇誕), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde—who was still fully armed—into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu asked what was disturbing the peace and why he came. Yuchi Jingde replied: [...] "The Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi committed treason. The Prince of Qin mobilized his troops and executed them. He feared that Your Imperial Majesty would be shocked and he <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> protect you." [...] Emperor Gaozu accepted the answer that he received from Yuchi Jingde. Subsequently, as the Zizhi Tongjian states, Emperor Gaozu turned to his officials and asked them: [...] "I did not anticipate that today I should see such a thing as this. What ought to be done about it?" [...] Two of them spoke highly meritoriously of Li Shimin and said that the killings of the two princely brothers served as a punishment. They also recommended Emperor Gaozu to appoint Li Shimin as the heir apparent.|$|E
