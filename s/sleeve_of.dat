They had no children together and divorced in 1975. Trim died in 2001.|$|E

5|$|A {{painting}} of the band by John Byrne was at an earlier point under consideration {{to be used as}} the album's cover. The piece was later used for the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the compilation album The Beatles' Ballads, released in 1980. In 2012 the original artwork was put up for auction.|$|E

5|$|During the 2011 Rugby World Cup the All Blacks had an {{embroidered}} William Webb Ellis {{cup on the}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> their jerseys {{with the}} year '1987' underneath. This was to signify which year the team had won the tournament. Each of the four teams who had won the competition had the same detailing on their jerseys.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} icon representing the wing is the Connecticut Wing's patch, with an ultramarine blue background and bearing {{the image of}} its mascot, Connie the Search and Rescue Dog. The wing patch was required to be worn on the left <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the battle dress uniform until 2006 when National Headquarters made it optional.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} brand of their kit {{manufacturers}} Kappa, IFK Göteborg have the logos {{of the following}} companies visible on their shirt and shorts: Prioritet Finans, a financial-services company; Serneke, a construction company; Elkontakt, an electrical contractor; Morris Law, a law firm; NRC Group, a rail-infrastructure contractor; Atea, an IT-infrastructure company; Rasta, a chain of road restaurants and motels; German automakers Volkswagen; and league sponsors Svenska Spel, a government-owned gambling company (whose logo {{is on the right}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the shirts of all Allsvenskan teams).|$|E

5|$|The UK edition {{contained}} Bob Cato's colour {{photo of}} Harrison {{sitting in front}} of an antique car, with art direction for the package being credited to Cream designs. The international CD release of the album uses the latter cover. The inner <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the original LP in Britain contained a picture by Michael Putland, showing Harrison on a wintry beach in Cannes, where he was attending the Midem music-industry trade fair in January 1976. A third front-cover option came with MFP's budget reissue during the 1980s, which reproduced Harrison's 1968 White Album portrait.|$|E
5|$|The credits {{printed on}} the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the first release were largely {{incomplete}} and made no distinction between the recording sessions of 1982-84 and those of 1987-88, apparently validating the false assumption that the original line-up of Blue Öyster Cult had reunited for {{the making of the}} album. Aside from the list of band members, the credits reported only some session musicians {{and other members of the}} so-called Guitar Orchestra of the State of Imaginos, and omitted other personnel who had contributed to Imaginos.|$|E
5|$|The crest was {{modified}} in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate {{moved to the}} top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to Football Club. Three stars were added to the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the team's away shirt for the 2004–05 season, and also to the home kit for the 2005–06 season. These stars were added to represent the three major trophies which Ipswich Town have won; the FA Cup, the UEFA Cup and the old Division One. The stars were relocated directly above the crest when the shirt was redesigned prior to the 2007–08 season.|$|E

5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> the 1966 album Freak Out! Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting {{the rest of the}} class with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.|$|E
25|$|Shea Stadium, {{while not}} part of the fairgrounds proper, was listed in the fair's maps and was served by the same subway line. During the 1964 and 1965 {{baseball}} seasons, the New York Mets added a World's Fair commemorative patch to the left <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> their home jersey and the right <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> their road jersey.|$|E

25|$|Cats {{have been}} venerated in the Near East since antiquity, a {{tradition}} adopted by Islam, albeit {{in a much}} modified form. According to many hadiths, Mohammad prohibited the persecution and killing of cats. Muhammad purportedly allowed a cat to give birth on his cloak, and cut off the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> his prayer robe rather than wake his favourite cat, a female named Muezza, who was sleeping on it.|$|E
