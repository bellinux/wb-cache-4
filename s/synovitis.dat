5|$|Suffering <b>synovitis</b> to {{his right}} knee, Maxwell was hospitalised for two days and posted to a {{training}} battalion in England on 28 November 1916. He stayed there for five months before embarking for France on 9 May 1917 and rejoining the 18th Battalion five days later. Maxwell was only briefly in France before being selected for officer training. Shortly after arriving in England, he attended a boisterous party {{with a group of}} soldiers. The military police raided the party and called the local police for assistance after confronting Maxwell's group. Maxwell was fined £20 and sent back to his unit for his actions.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{there have}} been speculations about {{possible}} complications after transient <b>synovitis.</b> The current consensus however {{is that there is}} no proof of an increased risk of complications after transient <b>synovitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|More {{advanced}} imaging techniques {{can be used}} if the clinical picture is unclear; the exact role of different imaging modalities remains uncertain. Some studies have demonstrated findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) that can differentiate between septic arthritis and transient <b>synovitis</b> (for example, signal intensity of adjacent bone marrow). Skeletal scintigraphy can be entirely normal in transient <b>synovitis,</b> and scintigraphic findings do not distinguish transient <b>synovitis</b> from other joint conditions in children. CT scanning does not appear helpful.|$|E
25|$|An {{ultrasound}} {{scan of the}} hip can easily demonstrate fluid inside the joint capsule (Fabella sign), although {{this is not always}} present in transient <b>synovitis.</b> However, it cannot reliably distinguish between septic arthritis and transient <b>synovitis.</b> If septic arthritis needs to be ruled out, needle aspiration of the fluid can be performed under ultrasound guidance. In transient <b>synovitis,</b> the joint fluid will be clear. In septic arthritis, there will be pus in the joint, which can be sent for bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not always}} a {{reliable}} indicator of treatment effect. One major limitation is that low-grade <b>synovitis</b> may be missed.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{advances}} in ultrasonography like high-frequency transducers (10MHz or higher) have improved the spatial resolution of ultrasound images depicting 20% more erosions than conventional radiography. Color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound {{are useful in}} assessing the degree of synovial inflammation as they can show vascular signals of active <b>synovitis.</b> This is important, since {{in the early stages}} of RA, the synovium is primarily affected, and <b>synovitis</b> seems to be the best predictive marker of future joint damage.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{arthritis}} {{is in an}} undifferentiated stage (i.e. none of {{the above}} criteria is positive), even if <b>synovitis</b> is witnessed and assessed with ultrasound imaging.|$|E
25|$|There are no set {{standards}} for the diagnosis of suspected transient <b>synovitis,</b> so the amount of investigations {{will depend on the}} need to exclude other, more serious diseases.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common signs of CMML is splenomegaly, found in {{approximately}} half of cases. Other less frequent signs and symptoms consist of anaemia, fever, weight loss, night sweats, infection, bleeding, <b>synovitis,</b> lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and peritoneal effusion.|$|E
25|$|Transient <b>synovitis</b> causes {{pain in the}} hip, thigh, groin or knee on the {{affected}} side. There may be a limp (or abnormal crawling in infants) with or without pain. In small infants, the presenting complaint can be unexplained crying (for example, when changing a diaper). The condition is nearly always limited to one side. The pain and limp can range from mild to severe.|$|E
25|$|One such {{previously}} suspected complication was coxa magna, {{which is}} an overgrowth of the femoral head and broadening of the femoral neck, accompanied by changes in the acetabulum, which may lead to subluxation of the femur. There was also some controversy about whether continuous high intra-articular pressure in transient <b>synovitis</b> could cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), but further studies did not confirm any link between the two conditions.|$|E
25|$|Arthritis {{of joints}} {{involves}} {{inflammation of the}} synovial membrane. Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (polyarthritis). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. <b>Synovitis</b> can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function.|$|E
25|$|Transient <b>synovitis</b> usually affects {{children}} {{between three and}} ten years old (but {{it has been reported}} in a 3-month-old infant and in some adults). It is {{the most common cause of}} sudden hip pain and limp in young children. Boys are affected two to four times as often as girls. The exact cause is unknown. A recent viral infection (most commonly an upper respiratory tract infection) or a trauma have been postulated as precipitating events, although these are reported only in 30% and 5% of cases, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} include pain, refusing to walk or bear weight and limping -bruising and deformity are absent. On clinical examination, {{there can be}} warmth and swelling over the fracture area, as well as pain on bending the foot upwards (dorsiflexion). The initial radiographical images may be inconspicuous (a faint oblique line) and often even completely normal. After 1–2 weeks however, callus formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for osteomyelitis, transient <b>synovitis</b> or even child abuse. Contrary to CAST fractures, non-accidental injury typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{fracture}}s, {{such as a}} toddler's fracture (spiral {{fracture of}} the shin bone), can also cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. Soft tissue injuries can be evident when bruises are present. Muscle or ligament injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, {{it is important not}} to miss a slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient <b>synovitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scleroderma, polymyositis, and {{dermatomyositis}} elicit {{little or}} no CRP response. CRP levels also tend not to be elevated in SLE unless serositis or <b>synovitis</b> is present. Elevations of CRP {{in the absence of}} clinically significant inflammation can occur in renal failure. CRP level is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Patients with high CRP concentrations are more likely to develop stroke, myocardial infarction, and severe peripheral vascular disease. Elevated level of CRP can also be observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Transient <b>synovitis</b> is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion. The diagnosis {{can be made in}} the typical setting of pain or limp in a young child who is not generally unwell and has no recent trauma. There is a limited range of motion of the hip joint. Blood tests may show mild inflammation. An ultrasound scan of the hip joint can show a fluid collection (effusion). Treatment is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and limited weight-bearing. The condition usually clears by itself within seven to ten days, but a small group of patients will continue to have symptoms for several weeks. The recurrence rate is 4–17%, most of which is in the first six months.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular <b>synovitis,</b> and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E
25|$|The dose-limiting {{side effects}} are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in >1% of those treated with it) are, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, hair loss, high blood pressure, rash, nausea, bronchitis, headache, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, back pain, indigestion, urinary tract infection, dizziness, infection, joint disorder, itchiness, weight loss, loss of appetite, cough, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, tenosynovitis, vomiting, weakness, allergic reaction, chest pain, dry skin, eczema, paraesthesia, pneumonia, rhinitis, <b>synovitis,</b> cholelithiasis and shortness of breath. Whereas uncommon side effects (occurring in 0.1-1% of those {{treated with the}} drug) include: constipation, oral thrush, stomatitis, taste disturbance, thrombocytopenia and hives. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: anaphylaxis, angiooedema, anaemia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe infection, interstitial lung disease, cirrhosis and liver failure.|$|E

2500|$|Transient <b>synovitis</b> {{of the hip}} (also called toxic synovitis; {{see below}} for more synonyms) is a {{self-limiting}} condition {{in which there is}} an inflammation of the inner lining (the synovium) of the capsule of the hip joint. The term irritable hip refers to the syndrome of acute hip pain, joint stiffness, limp or non-weightbearing, indicative of an underlying condition such as transient <b>synovitis</b> or orthopedic infections (like septic arthritis or osteomyelitis). In everyday clinical practice however, irritable hip is commonly used as a synonym for transient <b>synovitis.</b> [...] It {{should not be confused with}} sciatica, a condition describing hip and lower back pain much more common to adults than transient <b>synovitis</b> but with similar signs and symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Septic {{arthritis}} can {{be difficult}} to separate from less serious conditions such as transient <b>synovitis.</b> [...] Factors that can help indicate septic arthritis rather than <b>synovitis</b> include a WBC count greater than 12×109/l, fever greater than , ESR greater than 40mm/h, CRP greater than 2.0mg/dL, and refusal to walk. [...] People with septic arthritis usually look clinically toxic or sick. [...] Even {{in the absence of any}} of these factors, however, septic arthritis may be present. [...] Joint aspiration is required to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Transient <b>synovitis</b> is a {{reactive}} arthritis {{of the hip}} of unknown cause. [...] People are usually able to walk and may have a low grade fever. [...] They usually look clinically nontoxic or otherwise healthy. [...] It may only be diagnosed once all other potential serious causes are excluded. [...] With symptomatic care it usually resolves over one week.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rheumatoid}} nodule, {{which is}} {{sometimes in the}} skin, {{is the most common}} non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA. It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a [...] "necrotizing granuloma". The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the <b>synovitis,</b> since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of fibrinoid necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts, corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells, corresponding to the subintimal zone in <b>synovitis.</b> The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the elbow, the heel, the knuckles, or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF (rheumatoid factor) titer, ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{causes of}} limping are many {{and can be}} either serious or non-serious. [...] It usually results from pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a {{skeletal}} deformity. [...] In 30% of cases, the underlying cause remains unknown after appropriate investigations. [...] The most common underlying cause of limping in children is minor physical trauma. [...] In those with no history of trauma, 40% are due to transient <b>synovitis</b> and 2% are from Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome. Other important causes are infectious arthritis, osteomyelitis, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012, {{after getting}} a {{matching}} tattoo, Gaga announced on her social media that the record would be titled Artpop, stating that she would prefer it capitalized for stylization. The album was originally expected {{to be released in}} early 2013, but was indefinitely postponed after Gaga developed <b>synovitis</b> and a labral tear to her hip that required surgical correction. This resulted in the cancellation of the remainder of her Born This Way Ball. In July 2013, Gaga confirmed that Artpop would be released on November 11, 2013 in the United States in the traditional CD and digital mediums, in addition to an application developed by the Haus of Gaga technology division, TechHaus. The app was made compatible with both Android and iOS-running mobile devices, and featured bonus content. It was the third album-app to be released in mainstream commercial markets after Björk's Biophilia (2011) and Jay-Z's Magna Carta... Holy Grail (2013). The album and app pre-order were initially supposed to begin on September 1, 2013, but were moved up to August 19, 2013 [...] "due to public anticipation". This was later changed to August 12 to coincide with the early release of [...] "Applause".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Synovitis</b> {{may occur}} in {{association}} with arthritis as well as lupus, gout, and other conditions. <b>Synovitis</b> is more commonly found in rheumatoid arthritis than in other forms of arthritis, and can thus serve as a distinguishing factor, although it is also present in many joints affected with osteoarthritis.
