Florida pastor Melvin Moody and his brother Leon Moody were brought in as school administrators and the school opened its doors on September 8, 1964.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, Blount {{became a}} devoted evangelical Christian. A {{biography}} entitled The Man from Steamtown {{was written by}} James R. Adair in 1967 which focuses heavily on his spiritual life. [...] Blount sought to preserve an evangelical Christian legacy by donating his Dublin, New Hampshire homestead and its surrounding farm buildings, pastures, and forest {{to a group of}} committed Christian educators in 1964, headed by Mel Moody, who worked together to develop <b>Staghead</b> Farm (as it was then called) into Dublin Christian Academy, a combined elementary school and secondary boarding school.|$|E
5000|$|The James Gowing Farm, also {{once known}} as <b>Staghead</b> Farm, is a {{historic}} farmstead on Page Road in Dublin, New Hampshire. It is now {{the centerpiece of the}} Dublin Christian Academy campus. The original 1.5 story Cape style house was built c. 1788 by James Gowing, Jr., not long after moving to the area. This structure is now part of a larger complex of buildings, many of which are Colonial Revival buildings built in the 1930s, when the house was also restored. [...] The farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

Diseases discussed include scab, nursery blight, wood-rotting fungi, brown leaf spot, crown gall, anthracnose, powdery mildew, mistletoe, dieback, rosette, <b>staghead,</b> tipburn, kernel spot, and black pit...|$|E
40|$|Frost cankers in poplar are freeze-killed {{areas of}} bark and wood around which woody calluses develop and form buris and frost ribs. Frost dieback is a freeze-killed {{segment of the}} stem at the base, tip, or mid-portion of a branch or leader. It {{may or may not}} enhance natural pruning or poplar {{branches}} depending on whether the basal parts are damaged or alive and able to form abscission layers. In addition to abscission, low temperature affects increment, growth patterns, and vigor of poplar. Tree become stunted from persistent leader dieback. Suckers, crooks, and sweeps also characterize many stands of poplar. These characteristics of frost damage in mature forest stands are valuable in assessing the hazard of frost if the stands are to be clear-cut and reforested. The effects of frost damage are controlled somewhat in amenity, parks, and recreational areas because pruning is necessary to prevent wind breakage of <b>staghead</b> and frost-cankered trees...|$|E
