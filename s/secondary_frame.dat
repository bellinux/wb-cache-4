The switch among the differently encoded versions of the video sequence is realized at need via the transmission of a complementary encoded representation, named <b>secondary</b> SP <b>frame.</b> Since both primary and <b>secondary</b> SP <b>frames</b> encompass a motion compensation stage[13], bitstream switching is provided without resorting to the transmission of a dedicated INTRA frame.

During the streaming phase, primary or <b>secondary</b> SP <b>frames</b> are transmitted at user convenience, depending on whether a switching is performed or not.

This particular cathedral was built in 1878, given its massive dimension it can accommodate up to 2, 200 people. Situated opposite to the Rockefeller centre, the cathedral is surrounded by massive skyscrapers and despite its twin spires rising up to 100 m tall, the structure stands apart {{from the rest of the}} site. In order to preserve the function and the symbolic value of the cathedral, the objective is to design with minimal disturbance to the site. The idea is to build beyond the limit of the site, and since the adjacent space is a large surface of water, the structure aims to reach out for water while having an appropriate connection to the cathedral itself. A greenhouse at this particular location has numerous benefits; the glass structure is orientated to receive maximum sunlight exposure (absence of the shadows casted by the skyscrapers); its proximity to a large body of water raises the humidity and encourages research in desalination [...] . The greenhouse is open for public exposition and has a restaurant at sea level, there is also an entire level for research and control. A greenhouse requires a relatively large amount of sunlight exposure, it is important that the design of the structural frame has a light weight secondary structure fixing the translucent cladding material and creating the flexibility in the interior space. This <b>secondary</b> <b>frame</b> is supported by the main structure which consists of a series of shifting platforms supported by two main columns and a load bearing wall at the back. The idea is to hide the load bearing wall which is aesthetically ‘heavy’ in comparison to a delicate transparent structure which explains the relative position between the cathedral and the greenhouse. The transparency of the design is also complemented by its proximity of the water. The material is an essential part of the design; the glass component should be able to allow sunlight to penetrate but also keeping the heat within the structure. The glass which was chosen is partly translucent and the <b>secondary</b> <b>frame</b> is made of light weight steel, together forming a transparent crystalline structure taking the form of the wave. The enclosed area of the frame could be further developed into solar panels, an alternate power source for the greenhouse. BDES 1020 (Architecture Studio 102...|$|E

This is an attractive assumption for practicing engineers, as it provides simplifications during the analysis and design phases. However, when efficiency and economy are concerned, especially in low-to-moderate seismic regions, this normally neglected frame resource may be interesting to consider in design. Gusset plates can provide a certain degree of stiffness and strength following the bracing failure, and may even prevent global collapse. In particular, when the shear deformation demand of the braced cell remains limited, as in the case of low-to-moderate seismic actions, it may become reasonable to take this extra stiffness and strength into account. Ongoing research project RFSR-CT- 2013 - 00022 MEAKADO investigated this phenomenon by means of experimental and numerical studies with the perspective of setting new inputs for the design rules of the future generation of Eurocodes. This paper presents the results of full scale tests performed inside this research project, which characterized resistance, stiffness, and ductility resources of CBF systems designed for moderate seismicity.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the seismic {{behaviour}} of steel frames with particular focus on structures that employ tubular members as either columns or bracing elements. It addresses a number of design and assessment issues at the local (connection), frame, and overall (system interaction) levels. At the connection level, two experimental investigations on: (i) blind-bolted and angle connections, and (ii) combined channel/angle connections, are presented. The main behavioural patterns {{and the effects of}} key design parameters on the connection performance are examined. Refined mechanical models able to estimate the response of these connecting details are developed. These mechanical models are subsequently employed to perform parametric studies based on which simplified design-oriented expressions for the estimation of stiffness, strength and ductility are suggested. The susceptibility to low-cycle fatigue within critical connection components and the predictions of available fatigue damage models are also assessed. At the frame level, an evaluation of the inelastic demands on moment-resisting, partially-restrained and concentrically-braced steel structures is performed and equivalent linear models for the estimation of peak deformations are proposed. Particular attention is given to the influence of a number of scalar ground-motion frequency content parameters on the estimation of peak displacements. Additionally, simplified models based on rigid-plastic dynamics, and implemented within response history analysis, are proposed. It is shown that such rigid-plastic models can predict global deformations with reasonable accuracy. At the system interaction level, a comparative assessment of the peak response of one-way, two-way and mixed framing configurations under bi-directional earthquake loading is studied by means of idealized 3 D simplifications and refined 2 D models. This enables a detailed quantification of the contribution of gravity frames to the reduction of seismic risk and highlights the benefits of proper <b>secondary</b> <b>frame</b> design in mitigating the probabilities of dynamic instability. Finally, the findings of the thesis are summarized and future research areas are identified.

HBCUs comprise a small but important segment of U. S. higher education, as {{they are responsible for}} 20 % of African American graduates in the country. Unfortunately, many of these institutions have yet to address the urgent need to internationalize their campus in a systematic, relevant way. This research study was conducted on the campuses of three public HBCUs working to advance internationalization. This study explores answers to the following questions: (a) What {{is the role of the}} President in advancing or sustaining internationalization on an HBCU campus? (b) What is the relationship between the President and the Senior International Officer (SIO) ? and (c) What leadership frames do the Presidents use to advance or sustain comprehensive internationalization? Site visits to each institution included interviews with the President, the Provost, the SIO, and faculty. ^ Results show that the Presidents recognized their responsibility to articulate why internationalization is important for the university and how it aligns with the mission of preparing students to navigate a globally connected world. Results indicate that the Presidents impact how internationalization gets implemented through direct and indirect interaction with the SIO and by sustaining a strong infrastructure, particularly in the form of a unit responsible for internationalization initiatives. The findings indicate that while the SIO does not report directly to the President, a more effective reporting line assigns the SIO a faculty rank with a reporting line to the Provost. Analysis of the data shows that each President utilized at least one dominant leadership frames identified by Bolman and Deal (2013), two of them also exhibited a <b>secondary</b> <b>frame,</b> and none applied a multi-frame approach.

As the demand increases for wireless communication services, cognitive radio technology attracts huge attention from both commercial industries and academic researches. The purpose of this thesis is to provide an analytical evaluation of the cognitive radio system performance while taking into consideration of some realistic conditions. Several problems are investigated in this thesis. First, by adopting a dynamic primary user traffic model with one primary user occupancy status change and exponentially distributed channel holding times, its effect on the cognitive radio system performance is evaluated. In the evaluation, the sensing-throughput tradeoff of the cognitive radio is used as the examination criteria, while energy detection is applied during the spectrum sensing. The thesis then takes the investigation further by establishing a primary user multiple changes traffic model which considers multiple primary user occupancy status changes and any reasonable channel holding time distributions. The effect of the primary user multiple changes traffic on the spectrum sensing performance is investigated while the channel holding times are assumed to be exponential, Gamma, Erlang and log-normal distributed. The analytical evaluation of cognitive radio is also carried out from the secondary user transmission perspective, where the performance of the adaptive modulation in cognitive radio system is investigated. The effect of the cognitive radio distinctive features on the performance of both the adaptive continuous rate scheme and the adaptive discrete rate scheme of the adaptive modulation are examined. The BER performance and the link spectral efficiency performance are derived for both schemes. A novel frame structure where the spectrum sensing is performed by using the recovered received <b>secondary</b> <b>frames</b> is also evaluated in this thesis. A realistic scenario which considers the secondary user signal decoding errors is examined for the novel structure, while an ideal upper bound performance is given when the decoding process is assumed perfect. By extending the system to include multiple consecutive <b>secondary</b> <b>frames,</b> the performance of the novel structure is compared to the performance of the traditional frame structure proposed by the IEEE 802. 22 WRAN standard. The effect of the primary user multiple changes traffic is also examined for the novel structure. Several major findings are made from the analytical evaluations presented in this thesis. Through numerical examinations, it was shown that, first, the dynamic primary user traffic degrades the performance of cognitive radio systems. Second, the degree of the performance degradation of the cognitive radio systems is related to the number of primary user status changes and the primary user traffic intensity. Different primary user channel holding times distributions also lead to different sensitivities of the system performance to the primary user traffic. Third, cognitive radio distinctive features degrades the performance of the adaptive modulation. When the novel structure is applied for cognitive radio, a higher secondary achievable throughput can be obtained with a limited saturation threshold...|$|R

Currently, ASCE 7 - 05 permits a variety of structural systems {{to be used in}} combination as a dual system yet the design requirements are limited to the following statement: Moment frames must be capable of resisting 25 % of the seismic forces while the moment frames and braced frames or shear walls must be capable of resisting the entire seismic forces in proportion to their relative rigidities. This thesis assesses the significance of the 25 % design requirement for the <b>secondary</b> moment <b>frames</b> (SMF) in dual systems with consideration of current structural engineering practice.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{products}} find extensive application in modern construction in both low-rise and high-rise steel buildings. In low-rise construction, primary {{as well as}} <b>secondary</b> <b>framing</b> members are fabricated using cold-formed steel sections, while in high-rise buildings; roof and floor decks, steel joists, wall panels, door/window frames, and sandwich panel partitions are successfully built using cold-formed steel sections. In cold roll steel construction, fibre cement board is used as cladding material over steel sections on inside and outside, which creates a cavity wall action. Later on, glass wool and mineral wool insulation are also inserted in these walls making buildings more energy efficient in summer {{as well as in}} winter. In this paper, a comparison has been carried out between ordinary/conventional construction of a two roomed simple building and cold roll steel construction for the same type of building. The comparison includes design, analysis, structural detailing, cost and management on site for execution of both types of systems. It was found that cold roll steel construction has highest strength-to-weight ratio, easy to handle, quick and precise in manufacturing, fast in construction and dimensionally stable - does not expand or contract with moisture content. Also there is less probability of foundation problems due to less weight and less probability of damage due to earthquakes and heavy winds. Lighter structure with stronger connections results in less seismic forces.
