5|$|In North America, the {{original}} Jefferson flock of Shetlands did not persist. Other importations {{were made at}} the beginning of the twentieth century most notably to Mrs. W.W. Burch of Coopersville, MI (wife of the Editor of the American <b>Sheep</b> <b>Breeder</b> at the time), and Mr. L.V. Harkness of the Walnut Hall (the same of Standardbred Horse fame). There is record of these flocks surviving until 1916, and also record of another flock in Illinois in 1917. By 1921, it was recorded that Shetlands could not be bought in the U.S. (The <b>Sheep</b> <b>Breeder,</b> 1921). It was not until the mid-twentieth century that Shetlands were imported into Canada, and then from Canada into the United States in the 1980s. Since then, a North American Shetland Sheep Registry has been established, and there are now thousands of the breed in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Napoleonic wars (1793–1813) almost {{destroyed}} the Spanish Merino industry. The old cabañas were dispersed or slaughtered.

60|$|What {{sort of a}} <b>sheep</b> <b>breeder</b> {{would he}} be who should content himself with picking out the worst fifty out of a thousand, leaving them on a barren common till the weakest starved, and then letting the {{survivors}} go back to mix with the rest? And the parallel is too favourable; since in {{a large number of}} cases, the actual poor and the convicted criminals are neither the weakest nor the worst.|$|E
