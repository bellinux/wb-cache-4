500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would <b>say</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to a bunch of white filmmakers: how could you do this to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E

The Gemara interpreted the words [...] "The Lord, the Lord" [...] in [...] to teach that God is the Eternal (exhibiting mercy) before humans sin and the same after they sin and repent.

50|$|Early in 1992 {{the science}} fiction writer Orson Scott Card {{reviewed}} reissues of several Diana Wynne Jones novels. He wrote concerning Witch Week:Thus {{it is that}} underneath {{what seems to be}} rather low comedy—brooms that demand to be taken riding by witches (and hoes and rakes and mops that can be ridden, but behave more like mules and pigs than noble steeds); prankster spells at about the level of magic spitwads—there is a continuous foundation of truth. Children need powerful adult intervention to help them get control of their powers and keep their powers from taking control of them. Instead of using them for immediate self-gratification, the children instead have to create and respect certain limits in order to avoid destroying themselves and others. Not that anyone ever <b>says</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> outright. Rather the stories are that lesson, learned over and over again, yet with such humor and extravagant imagination and devastating satire that few readers will imagine that they are being civilized as they read.|$|R
