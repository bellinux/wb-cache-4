50|$|The {{organizers}} of the convention may designate one of these speeches as the keynote address, one which above all others is stated to underscore the convention's themes or political goals. For instance, the 1992 Democratic National Convention keynote address was delivered by Georgia Governor Zell Miller, whose stories of an impoverished childhood echoed the economic themes of the nominee, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. The 1996 Republican National Convention was keynoted by U.S. Representative <b>Susan</b> <b>Molinari</b> of New York, intended to reassure political moderates about the centrism of the nominee, former Senator Bob Dole. And the 2004 Democratic National Convention featured Senator Barack Obama, whose speech brought the future President national recognition for the first time.|$|E

However, supporters in the socially conservative grassroots organizations such as the Christian Coalition directed the convention to adopt a conservative platform with little controversy, and Buchanan released his delegates at the last minute.|$|E

This program with Bill Moyers examines both the disenchantment of American voters and the frustrations of members of Congress {{as they try to}} work within the system. Voters say they have heard too many promises, and have seen too few results; politicians say that a sensational press and uninformed voters make it hard to govern. The program features five politicians (former Senator Warren Rudman and representatives Barney Frank, Dave Obey, <b>Susan</b> <b>Molinari,</b> and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen) and their responses to the exasperation of the American people.
