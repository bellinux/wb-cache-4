50|$|ASA is {{structurally}} {{very similar}} to ABS. The spherical particles of slightly crosslinked acrylate rubber (instead of butadiene rubber), functioning as an impact modifier, are chemically grafted with <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> <b>copolymer</b> chains, and embedded in styrene-acrylonitrile matrix. The acrylate rubber differs from the butadiene based rubber by absence of double bonds, which gives the material about ten times the weathering resistance and resistance to ultraviolet radiation of ABS, higher long-term heat resistance, and better chemical resistance. ASA is significantly more resistant to environmental stress cracking than ABS, especially to alcohols and many cleaning agents. n-Butyl acrylate rubber is usually used, but other esters can be encountered too, e.g. ethyl hexyl acrylate. The latter has lower glass transition temperature than the former, -65 °C vs -45 °C, providing better low-temperature properties to the material.|$|E

It is clearly demonstrated that the phase morphology of these blends and the acrylonitrile (AN) content of the SAN component are important factors with respect to the ultimate mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation at fracture). Following injection molding, a very fine phase distribution is observed for blends with SAN components containing 15 to 29 % AN. By annealing of the blends at 200 -degrees-C. i. e. above T(g) (PC), it has been possible to obtain different degrees of domain sizes. From this range of morphologies, quite similar phase structures can be selected differing only in AN-content of the SAN blend components. This allows a systematic investigation of the effect of the AN-content on the tensile stress-strain properties of PC/SAN blends. The elongation at fracture exhibits an optimum for blends with SAN containing 24 % AN. A coarsening of the phase morphology only results in a decrease of the ductility and not in a shift of the optimum.

We have fabricated {{materials that are}} entirely interphase by forced assembly of two immiscible polymers. Assemblies of thousands of alternating layers of two polymers, with individual layer thickness on the nanometer size scale of the interphase, were created by layer multiplying coextrusion. The properties of the interphase materials were probed with conventional tools of polymer analysis. In this study, the effect of interaction strength was examined with assemblies that combined an amorphous polyester {{with a series of}} <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> <b>copolymers</b> that varied in acrylonitrile content from 0 to 30 wt %. Continuous, uniform layers were directly observed using atomic force microscopy. Interphase thickness was extracted from the layer thickness dependence of oxygen permeability. The interphase thickness showed the predicted dependency on the χ parameter and correlated with interphase strength as measured with the T-peel test. Unexpectedly, volumetric properties of the interphase deviated from additive predictions. Correspondence between the decrease in specific volume from macroscopic density and the decrease in free volume hole size from positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy suggested that densification of the interphase occurred primarily by a decrease in free volume hole size rather than by a {{decrease in the number of}} free volume holes.

Two glass transitions appear in the DSC thermograms of the blend at the same temperatures as in the pure components which, in principle, indicates that the blend consists of two phases formed by pure PC and pure SAN. In order to detect small changes in the glass transition process that could be indicative of different mobility of the polymer chains in the blend {{with respect to the}} pure polymers, blends of different compositions were subjected to different thermal treatments that included annealing at temperatures below both glass transitions, and then the DSC thermograms were recorded.

40|$|The {{framework}} of the present research {{is the study of}} the effects of viscoelasticity on the yield behaviour of amorphous glassy polymers. The research regards the shear yielding mechanism in an amorphous glassy polymer and the identification of a yield criterion, which takes into account the effect of mechanical history on the yield point (defined as the onset of plastic strain), is set as its final goal. To this end, constant strain-rate, creep and stress relaxation tests were carried out at room temperature under uniaxial compression conditions on a <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> <b>copolymer.</b> The results obtained emphasise that yield onset cannot be identified by a critical value of the applied stress or strain. Referring to models of the plastic deformation mechanism previously proposed in the literature, the anelastic strain, the anelastically stored energy and the viscoelastic energy were suggested to reach a threshold value at the yield point. All three parameters were evaluated at the yield threshold and showed fairly constant values irrespective of the mechanical history.

40|$|The {{design of}} environmentally-benign polymer {{processing}} techniques {{is an area}} of growing interest, motivated by the desire to reduce the emission of volatile organic compounds. Recently, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) has gained traction as a viable candidate to process polymers both as a solvent and diluent. The focus of this work was to elucidate the nature of the interactions between scCO 2 and polymers in order to provide rational insight into the molecular interactions which result in the unexpected mixing thermodynamics in one such system. The work also provides insight into the nature of pairwise thermodynamic interactions in multicomponent polymer-polymer-diluent blends, and the effect of these interactions on the phase behavior of the mixture. In order to quantify the strength of interactions in the multicomponent system, the binary mixtures were characterized individually in addition to the ternary blend. Quantitative analysis of was made tractable {{through the use of a}} model miscible polymer blend containing <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> <b>copolymer</b> (SAN) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (dPMMA), a mixture which has been considered for a variety of practical applications. In the case of both individual polymers, scCO 2 is known to behave as a diluent, wherein the extent of polymer swelling depends on both temperature and pressure. The solubility of scCO 2 in each polymer as a function of temperature and pressure was characterized elsewhere. The SAN-dPMMA blend clearly exhibited lower critical solution temperature behavior, forming homogeneous mixtures at low temperatures and phase separating at elevated temperature. These measurements allowed the determination of the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ 23 for SAN (species 2) and dPMMA (species 3) as a function of temperature at ambient pressure, in the absence of scCO 2 (species 1). Characterization of the phase behavior of the multicomponent (ternary) mixture was also carried out by SANS. An in situ SANS environment was developed to allow measurement of blend miscibility in the presence of scCO 2. The pressure-temperature phase behavior of the system could be mapped by approaching the point of phase separation by spinodal decomposition through pressure increases at constant temperature. For a roughly symmetric mixture of SAN and dPMMA, the temperature at which phase separation occurred could be decreased by over 125 °C. The extent to which the phase behavior of the multicomponent system could be tuned motivated further investigation into the interactions present within the homogeneous mixtures. Analysis of the SANS results for homogeneous mixtures was undertaken using a new multicomponent formalism of the random phase approximation theory. The scattering profiles obtained from the scCO 2 -SAN-dPMMA system could be predicted with reasonable success. The success of the theoretical predictions was facilitated by directly employing the interactions found in the binary experiments. Exploitation of the condition of homogeneity with respect to chemical potential allowed determination of interaction parameters for scCO 2 -SAN and 2 -dPMMA within the multicomponent mixture (χ 12 and χ 13, respectively). Studying this system over a large range of the supercritical regime yielded insight on the nature of interactions in the system. Near the critical point of scCO 2, χ 12 and χ 13 increase monotonically as a function of pressure. Conversely, at elevated temperature away from the critical point, the interaction parameters are found to go through a minimum as a pressure increases. Analysis of the critical phenomenon associated with scCO 2 suggests that the observed dependence of χ 12 and χ 13 on pressure are related to the magnitude of scCO 2 density fluctuations and the proximity of the system to the so-called density fluctuation ridge. By tuning the system parameters of the multicomponent mixture, the phase behavior can be altered through the balance of pairwise interactions been the constituent species. The presence of scCO 2 in the mixtures appears to eliminate the existence of the metastable state that epitomizes most polymer-polymer mixtures. Thus it is shown that knowledge of the individual pairwise interactions in such multicomponent mixtures can greatly influence the resulting phase behavior, and provide insight into the design of improved functional materials with decreased environmental impacts...|$|E
40|$|Periodic microstructures in <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> (SAN) <b>copolymers</b> are {{fabricated}} by two-beam direct laser interference patterning using a nanosecond {{pulsed laser}} operating at a wavelength of 266 [*]nm. The SAN copolymers are synthesized using different molar ratios (styrene to acrylonitrile) by a free radical polymerization process. The chemical {{composition of the}} copolymers and their properties are determined using Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Depending on {{the composition of the}} irradiated copolymer films, with weight ratios ranging from 58 to 96. 5 % of styrene to acrylonitrile, different ablation behaviors are observed. The laser fluence necessary to locally ablate the copolymer is found to be dependent on the copolymer composition. Unlike other dielectric polymers, the laser irradiation produced both direct ablation of the irradiated material and collapse of the surface. It is shown that, by varying the laser fluence and the copolymer composition, the surface structure can be changed from a periodic pattern with a swelled topography to an ablated-like structure. The number of holes does not depend monotonically on the amount of PS or PAN units but shows a more complex behavior which depends on the copolymer composition and the laser fluence...|$|R
40|$|We {{report in}} this work the results of {{dielectric}} studies on microphase separation in blends of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) and <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> (SAN) <b>copolymers</b> with 0, 25, 50, 90 and 100 % SAN (w/w). The dielectric techniques used include broadband ac dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS, in the frequency range of 10 (- 2) to 10 (7) Hz and a temperature range of 20 - 200 degrees C, and thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) techniques in the temperature range of - 170 - 30 degrees C. These techniques enable us to observe the primary alpha relaxations and the secondary gamma and beta relaxations of TPU and SAN in the pure components and in the blends and to follow the dependence of their characteristic parameters on composition. DRS proves to be very sensitive in monitoring the melting of the crystalline soft segments of TPU in the blends. In addition the investigation of de conductivity effects in the blends provides information on the morphology of the blends at mesoscopic level. The {{results suggest that the}} extent of partial miscibility of the two components is very limited, whereas the addition of SAN in TPU promotes the separation of hard and soft segments in TPU.

40|$|Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based carbon {{materials}} have high carbon yield and high thermal stability after pyrolysis. The presence of tertiary coordinated nitrogen contributes to enhanced catalytic activity when noble metals are incorporated in PAN-based catalytic supports. It also improves selectivity when PAN-based carbon materials {{are used as}} solid sorbents for CO 2 capture. This work involves the synthesis of <b>Styrene-Acrylonitrile</b> (SAN) <b>copolymer</b> based materials for CO 2 capture application and synthesis of novel Platinum and Palladium incorporated PAN-based materials for catalysis of hydrogenation reactions. Copolymers with varying PAN/Polystyrene ratio and particle size were synthesized using micellar and coagulative homogenous nucleation mechanisms in an emulsion polymerization system. An appropriate synthesis recipe for all ratios of SAN copolymer nanoparticles was deduced. Platinum-incorporated PAN material was produced by mini-emulsion technique. TEM-EDX mapping revealed good dispersion of platinum in the polymer nanoparticle. Palladium incorporation was brought about by batch emulsion polymerization with water-soluble palladium precursor. Macropores are introduced in the produced polymeric materials by formation of fractal gels with appropriate fractal dimension. Colloidal destabilization (Gelation) is brought about by induced aggregation due to addition of electrolytes. Micropores are created by thermal treatment process comprising of oxidation, stabilization and pyrolysis at optimum temperatures. The {{bimodal pore size distribution}} helps in increasing the diffusion rate and hence uplifts separation capabilities. In addition, the thermal treatment protocol for different catalysts are being optimized. Structure and morphology of materials at various stages of synthesis and heat treatment were monitored by combination of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Nitrogen/CO 2 sorption studies for surface area and pore size distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} employs a {{standardized}} progressive load scratch test (ASTM D 7027 /ISO 19252) {{to investigate the}} fundamental physical and mechanistic origins of scratch deformation in <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> (SAN) random <b>copolymers.</b> Previous findings from numerical simulation using finite element methods are used to establish correlation between mechanical properties and key scratch deformation mechanisms of the SAN model systems. For SAN, the acrylonitrile (AN) content and molecular weight (MW) can be changed to alter mechanical properties such as tensile strength and ductility. The key scratch deformation mechanisms are identified as: scratch groove formation, scratch visibility, periodic micro-cracking and plowing. Groove formation has been correlated to the secant modulus at the compressive yield point while micro-cracking and plowing {{are related to the}} tensile strength of the material. The fundamentals and physical origins of scratch visibility are discussed. It is explained how unbiased evaluation is accomplished by means of an automatic digital image analysis software package (ASV?). Frictional behavior and the effects of scratch speed and moisture absorption are also addressed. Increasing the AN content and/or the MW of the SAN random copolymers generally enhances the scratch resistance of the material with regard to the onset of the key deformation mechanisms. Increasing the scratch speed increases the brittleness of the material, resulting in failure at lower applied loads. Moisture absorption increases with AN content and imparts a degree of plasticization as the moisture diffuses into the sub-surface. This plasticization initially results in a degradation of scratch resistance with respect to the key deformation mechanisms, but then, after saturation, the moisture on the surface provides lubrication and improves the scratch resistance. It {{is important to note that}} polymers are fundamentally different in nature, but the findings of this study serve as an important stepping stone down the path to a deeper understanding of polymer scratch behavior...|$|R
