Many middle class, lower middle class and even working class families <b>scrimp</b> and save {{to send their children}} to private schools. The government of Quebec gives a Pro rata subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Stanton smiled, and waived the subject, {{wondering}} mentally {{where his}} friend would find an elsewhere to <b>scrimp,</b> {{if he had}} the management of his concerns.

60|$|Born in 1721, he was {{a younger}} son of Archibald, a younger son of Sir James Smollett of Bonhill, {{a house on the}} now {{polluted}} Leven, between Loch Lomond and the estuary of the Clyde.

The father, Archibald, died; the grandfather left nothing to the mother of Tobias and her children, but they were assisted with <b>scrimp</b> decency by the heirs. Hence the attacks on the grandfather and cousins of Roderick Random: but, later, Smollett returned to kinder feelings.|$|E

60|$|He {{was like}} so many taciturn Spaniards, not inconversable, {{and we had a}} {{pleasure}} in his unobtrusive intelligence which I should be sorry to exaggerate. He supplied us with such statistics of his city as we brought away with us, and as I think the reader may join me in trusting, and in regretting that I did not ask more. Still it is something to have learned that in Toledo now each family lives English fashion in a house of its own, while in the other continental cities it mostly dwells in a flat. This is because the population has fallen from two hundred thousand to twenty thousand, and the houses have not shared its decay, but remain habitable for numbers immensely beyond those of the households. In the summer the family inhabits the first floor which the patio and the subterranean damp from the rains keep cool; in the winter it retreats to the upper chambers which the sun is supposed to warm, and which are at any rate dry even on cloudy days. The rents would be thought low in New York: three dollars a month get a fair house in Toledo; but wages are low, too; three dollars a month for a manservant and a dollar and a half for a maid. If the Toledans from high to low are extravagant in anything it is dress, but dress for the outside, not the inside, which does not show, as our guide satirically explained. They <b>scrimp</b> themselves in food and they pay the penalty in lessened vitality; there is not so much fever as one might think; but {{there is a great deal}} of consumption; and as we could not help seeing everywhere in the streets there were many blind, who seemed oftenest to have suffered from smallpox. The beggars were not so well dressed as the other classes, but I saw no such delirious patchwork as at Burgos. On the other hand, there were no idle people who were fashionably dressed; no men or women who looked great-world.|$|E

[...] The critic continued:Too many storylines tend to dilute the strongest strands, while pic misses a trick by <b>scrimping</b> on viewpoints of local Indians. Lensing by Yoav Shamir himself is competent, but transfer to 35mm looks blurry and curiously drab given the story's colorful setting.
