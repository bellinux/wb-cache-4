500|$|In the episode's audio commentary, Parker only {{comments}} on the opening scene, noting that they did the episode as intended and sent it in. He and Stone comment {{that they are not}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it. For the next several moments, a large audio beep obscures the commentary before Stone says [...] "Yeah, that's pretty much it." [...] During the commentary in both [...] "201" [...] and [...] "200" [...] Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as [...] "the prophet of the Muslim faith". Despite the package claiming otherwise, both [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201" [...] were omitted from the Region 4 release and have been completely omitted from the Region 2 (which contains the predominantly Islamic Middle East and North Africa) release as well.|$|E
2500|$|Women {{have the}} right to drive in all Arab {{countries}} except Saudi Arabia. Having said that, younger women regularly stage protests and in one case, a Saudi woman got a Dubai licence and was able to drive to Saudi Arabia. However once she was on Saudi territory, she was arrested. [...] In Jordan, travel restrictions on women were lifted in 2003. [...] "Jordanian law provides citizens the right to travel freely within the country and abroad except in designated military areas. Unlike Jordan's previous law (No. 2 of 1969), the current Provisional Passport Law (No. 5 of 2003) does not require women to seek permission from their male guardians or husbands in order to renew or obtain a passport." [...] In Yemen, women must obtain approval from a husband or father to get an exit visa to leave the country, and a woman may not take her children with her without their father's permission, {{regardless of whether or not}} the father has custody. The ability of women to travel or move freely within Saudi Arabia is severely restricted. However, in 2008 a new law went into effect requiring men who marry non-Saudi women to allow their wife and any children born to her to travel freely in and out of Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, women must travel with their guardians permission and they are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to strange random men, even if their lives are in danger. Many years ago, some Saudi policemen prevented their colleagues from rescuing some school girls.|$|E

Just at present it wouldn't do, I <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her about a new sweetheart. But, Dale, the time will come; the time will come;--the time always does come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eva {{is a good}} girl,--a dear girl. But I am not at all so {{sure about}} that young fellow Abraham Grundle. It's a pity, President, your son had not been born a few years sooner." [...] At this moment my boy was half a head taller than young Grundle, and a much better {{specimen}} of a Britannulist. [...] "But {{it is too late}} now, I <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of that. It seems to me that Jack never even thinks of looking at Eva." ...|$|R
60|$|But she {{had other}} moods besides the arch and naïve. After breakfast; {{when the two}} elders withdrew--I <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over certain of Mrs. Bretton's {{business}} matters--and the Countess, Dr. Bretton, and I, were {{for a short time}} alone together--all the child left her; with us, more nearly her companions in age, she rose at once to the little lady: her very face seemed to alter; that play of feature, and candour of look, which, when she spoke to her father, made it quite dimpled and round, yielded to an aspect more thoughtful, and lines distincter and less mobile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{and have}} some tea at once," [...] Lady Mary insisted, {{looking up at the}} judge. [...] "I want to hear all about this {{wonderful}} Clancorry case. Oh, I know you're not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it, but that really doesn't matter down here. You shall have a comfortable chair by my side, and some hot muffins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've run away," [...] {{said the}} music thing. [...] "After you left, old Dr. Pipt and I had a dreadful quarrel and he {{threatened}} to smash me to pieces if I didn't keep quiet. Of course I wouldn't do that, because a talking-machine is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and make a noise--and sometimes music. So I {{slipped out of the}} house while the Magician was stirring his four kettles and I've been running after you all night. Now that I've found such pleasant company, I can talk and play tunes all I want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|After the walk, Kate had {{lessons to}} learn {{for the next}} day--poetry, dates, grammar, and the like; and after them came her tea; and then her evening toilette, when, as the aunts were out of hearing, she {{refreshed}} herself with play and chatter with Josephine. She was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> French to her; {{but it was very}} odd sort of French, and Josephine did not insist on its being better. She was very good- natured, and thought [...] "Miladi" [...] had a dull life; so she allowed a good many things that a more thoughtful person would have known to be inconsistent with obedience to Lady Barbara.|$|E
6000|$|... "One would <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> {{hear you}} <b>talk,</b> Fitz Hamilton, {{that the end}} had come--that we were doomed beyond {{possibility}} of escape." ...|$|R
2500|$|Staines {{says his}} {{credibility}} was damaged by {{his enthusiasm for}} drugs and raves. [...] "One minute l would be on News at One saying [...] "there's no drugs at these parties" [...] and the next minute I'm <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> about civil war in Angola. It wasn't working." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{call that}} pretty white," [...] said Fulkerson. [...] "It's a bargain {{as far as}} I'm concerned. I <b>suppose</b> you'll want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it over with your wife, March?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Miss Mason, I {{know you}} don't like this talking over {{of things in}} the office. Neither do I. It's part of the whole thing, I guess; a man ain't <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{anything}} but business with his stenographer. Will you ride with me next Sunday, and we can talk it over thoroughly then and reach some sort of a conclusion. Out in the hills is the place where you can talk something besides business. I guess you've seen enough of me to know I'm pretty square. I--I do honor and respect you, and ... and all that, and I..." [...] He was beginning to flounder, and the hand that rested on the desk blotter was visibly trembling. He strove to pull himself together. [...] "I just want to harder than anything ever in my life before. I--I--I can't explain myself, but I do, that's all. Will you?--Just next Sunday? To-morrow?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was very}} angry,--though he hardly knew why or with whom. A girl {{when she is}} engaged is not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to no one but her {{recognised}} lover in a mixed party of ladies and gentlemen, and she is especially absolved from such a duty when they chance {{to meet in the}} house of a comparative stranger. In such a house and among such people it was natural that the talk should be about hunting, and as the girl had accepted the loan of a horse it was natural that she should join in such conversation. She had never sat for a moment apart with Lord Rufford. It was impossible to say that she had flirted with the man,--and yet Morton felt that he was neglected, and felt also that he was only there because this pleasure-seeking young Lord had liked to have in his house the handsome girl whom he, Morton, intended to marry. He felt thoroughly ashamed of being there as it were in the train of Miss Trefoil. He was almost disposed to get up and declare that the girl was engaged to marry him. He thought that he could {{put an end to the}} engagement without breaking his heart;--but if the engagement was an engagement he could not submit to treatment such as this, either from her or from others. He would see her for the last time in the country at the ball on the following evening,--as of course he would not be near her during the hunting,--and then he would make her understand that she must be altogether his or altogether cease to be his. And so resolving he went to bed, refusing to join the gentlemen in the smoking-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} do something. I've got a splendid idea. Look here, you must join. I'm sure you've got any amount of stuff in you, though you look--well, as if you'd lived all your life in a garden." [...] She sat up, and began to explain with animation. [...] "I belong to a club in London. It meets every Saturday, so it's called the Saturday Club. We're <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about art, but I'm sick of talking about art--what's the good of it? With all kinds of real things going on round one? It isn't as if they'd got {{anything}} to say about art, either. So what I'm going to tell 'em is that we've talked enough about art, and we'd better talk about life for a change. Questions that really matter to people's lives, the White Slave Traffic, Women Suffrage, the Insurance Bill, and so on. And when we've made up our mind {{what we want to do}} we could form ourselves into a society for doing it. [...] . I'm certain that if people like ourselves were to take things in hand instead of leaving it to policemen and magistrates, we could put a stop to--prostitution"--she lowered her voice at the ugly word--"in six months. My idea is that men and women ought to join in these matters. We ought to go into Piccadilly and stop one of these poor wretches and say: 'Now, look here, I'm no better than you are, and I don't pretend to be any better, but you're doing what you know to be beastly, and I won't have you doing beastly things, because we're all the same under our skins, and if you do a beastly thing it does matter to me.' That's what Mr. Bax was saying this morning, and it's true, though you clever people--you're clever too, aren't you?--don't believe it." ...|$|E
5000|$|On rehearsing, Davidson related: “I had a tape {{recorder}} and I would read the scene and turn it off when the character I was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talked.</b> I ran lines that way. The major way that I knew it was working was because the crew was laughing, and I was laughing, we were cracking up all the time.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be angry, Charlie, but I cannot help it. The idea of your going, in disguise, I <b>suppose,</b> {{and trying}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over the Jewish clothiers and cannie Scotch traders, {{is one of}} the funniest things I ever heard. And do you think the king was really in earnest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-morning, Mr. Rooper," [...] said Asaph, in a {{loud and}} cheery voice. [...] "I <b>suppose</b> you've come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. McJimsey about the work you've got to do here to make this house fit to live in. But there ain't no Mrs. McJimsey. She's Mrs. Scantle now, and I'm your tenant. You can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R

50|$|Children {{stay away}} from elders {{as a sign of}} respect. They are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with them at all. During some occasions, parents/adults will invite elders to come to their home for dinner.|$|E
50|$|A {{residual}} rule {{of everyday}} interaction on the New York City Subway is that seats {{are on a}} first-come, first-served basis and individuals are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to one another in}} such close quarters.|$|E
50|$|For instance, in a restaurant, an embarrassed Alex apologises to the maître d' {{after his}} dinner guest answers {{a call on}} his mobile, which has been frowned upon in the past. The maître d's claim that the restaurant's policy on phones is very relaxed these days does not {{alleviate}} Alex's embarrassment since his concern was due to being seen with a companion who was not using the latest model, and not (as the reader may have <b>supposed)</b> due <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> on a cellphone in a restaurant.|$|R
5000|$|On September 10, 1973, {{controllers}} in Houston were {{startled to}} hear a woman's voice beaming down from Skylab. Using a sexy tone of voice and calling startled capsule communicator (CAPCOM) Bob Crippen by name, the woman explained: [...] "The boys haven't had a home-cooked meal in so long I thought I'd bring one up." [...] After several minutes in which she described forest fires seen from space and the beautiful sunrise, the woman said: [...] "Oh oh. I have to cut off now. I think the boys are floating up here toward the command module and I'm not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you." [...] As the Skylab crew subsequently revealed, Garriott had recorded his wife Helen during a private radio transmission the night before.|$|R
2500|$|In a May 2011 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Cramer {{explained that he}} was unprepared for Stewart's intense interview, saying [...] "As soon as he started, I realized Stewart was on a mission to make me look like a clown. I didn't defend myself because I wasn't prepared. What was I <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>talk</b> about how often I had been right? Praise myself? Get mad? I was mad, but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, which I did, and made me into a buffoon... They wanted to make me the Face of the Era, and they succeeded. Rick Santelli's a conservative. Ideological. O.K., I get that. But me? I was very anti-Bush. I'm a Democrat, I've got the canceled checks to prove it, and suddenly I'm the enemy? Me? Me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In June 2014, Anderson and comedian David Vox Mullen began {{producing}} Push The Button a podcast on The DVM Production Empire. Together {{the two men}} tackle Religion, Sex, Politics and all of {{the other}} things that you're not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about.|$|E
50|$|In An Evening {{with the}} Scooby Gang, a bonus feature on the Aloha, Scooby-Doo! DVD, Fred {{mentions}} a sixth {{member of the}} gang, to the gang's shock and dismay. Shaggy mentions they weren't <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Scrappy. Freddy {{was talking about the}} Mystery Machine.|$|E
50|$|Bayes {{introduces}} his play, {{and claims}} that it will begin with two men whispering to one another. The egotistical playwright justifies the whispering {{on the grounds that}} they’re politicians and not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about matters of state. We later discover the two men are plotting against the two kings of Brentford, and Bayes wants to foreshadow the future overthrowing of the kings.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Classy Christmas" [...] Toby {{has to go}} {{on leave}} so he can report for jury duty. The case {{turns out to be}} that of the Scranton Strangler, a fact Toby lets slip out despite his not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> about the case. He later says to the camera crew he likes the attention. Michael is visibly disgusted when Toby returns on jury recess to attend the Christmas party and tells the staff to not ask Toby any {{questions}} as he will not leave and this will prevent Holly from returning. In {{the second part of the}} episode, Michael attempts to frame Toby for vandalizing Holly's beloved Woody Doll but Toby immediately denies it and flips it around on Michael claiming the vandalism is something he would do, to which everyone agrees to eventually.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Rennie {{was here}} to dinner tonight. My head was aching again, and Mother said I needn't go down to dinner if I'd rather not; but a dozen {{headaches}} could not have kept me back, or a dozen men either, even <b>supposing</b> I'd have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them all. I wanted to see Mrs. Rennie. Nothing has been talked of in Riverton for the last fortnight but Mrs. Rennie. I've heard of her beauty and charm and costumes until I'm sick of the subject. Today I spoke to Sidney about her. Before I thought I said right out, [...] "Mrs. Rennie is to dine with us tonight." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bruce Willis as David Addison: David Addison is a cheeky, chappy, fearless detective {{running the}} City of Angels Detective Agency. Faced with the {{prospect}} of being put out of business, he convinces Maddie that they have always lost money because they were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> and <b>talks</b> her into rebranding the agency and going into business with him as her partner. Glenn Gordon Caron had to fight with ABC to put Willis in the lead role having already signed Shepherd for both the pilot and series. Caron claims he tested Willis {{about a third of the}} way through testing over 2,000 actors, knew [...] "this was the guy" [...] immediately, and had to fight through twice as many more acting tests and readings while arguing with ABC executives before receiving (initial) conditional authorization to cast Willis in the pilot. ABC, according to Caron, did not feel that anyone viewing would think there could possibly be any [...] "believable" [...] sexual tension between Shepherd and Willis.|$|R
5000|$|The chick first calls Daffy [...] "Daddy", then [...] "cousin", [...] "uncle", etc. When Daffy {{points out}} {{he is not}} a relative, the chick says he is not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to strangers, and runs away with Daffy in hot pursuit of his charge. The chick first simply eludes Daffy, and then begins to torment the duck with one violent gag after another (anticipating Home Alone by decades).|$|E
5000|$|As {{the start}} of {{production}} neared, Ava Gardner got cold feet about co-starring with an actor she had idolized since childhood. Hornblow asked Gable to call her, and he told her: [...] "I'm <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> you into doing this thing. But I'm not going to. I hated it when they did that to me. But I hope you change your mind, kid, I {{think it would be}} fun to work together." [...] The two remained friends for life.|$|E
50|$|These palanquins are also, {{contrary}} to what was believed formerly by many researchers and even many Ga, still used and built by the same craftsmen who make the figurative coffins. One {{of the most important}} palanquin builders of the last 30 years was Paa Joe who was known until now only for his figurative coffins. But as artisans are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about figurative palanquins and other royal insignias, Paa Joe is not giving out easily informations about the palanquins he had formerly built.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be a {{very natural}} one {{in the case of}} a man," [...] said Laura. [...] "You can smoke if you like. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|A straggly {{little girl}} {{came up from}} the candy-shop below his room, demanding, [...] "Say, are you Mr. Daggett? Say, there's some woman wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you on our telephone. Say, tell them we ain't <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be no messenger-office. You ain't <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> call no upstairs people on our telephone.

5000|$|Andrews sang in a soulful type voice; {{she told}} the Milwaukee Journal after moving to Nashville, [...] "When I first came down here from Akron and met {{different}} people who listened to my tape they all said , 'You sound so different'. Later on {{they said it was}} good, but at the time it made me feel really bad". One of the reasons for Andrews’ unique voice was a result of surgery that removed a tumor from her thyroid. Andrews revealed that after the surgery, [...] "They didn't tell me I wasn't <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> sing or <b>talk</b> loud for a year. I started singing after the operation and it lowered on me. It used to be three or four octaves higher. Now when I talk everyone thinks I have a cold." ...|$|R
