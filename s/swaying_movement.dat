60|$|The lower internode, when it ceased revolving, became {{upright and}} rigid; {{but as the}} whole shoot was left to grow unsupported, it became after a time bent into a nearly {{horizontal}} position, the uppermost and growing internodes still revolving at the extremity, but of course no longer round the old central point of the supporting stick. From the changed position of the centre of gravity of the extremity, as it revolved, a slight and slow <b>swaying</b> <b>movement</b> {{was given to the}} long horizontally projecting shoot; and this movement I at first thought was a spontaneous one. As the shoot grew, it hung down more and more, whilst the growing and revolving extremity turned itself up more and more.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The post-buckling {{behavior}} of rectangular frames in an elastic domain is studied in depth. In analysis, unsymmetrical geometry, sway possibility and support conditions are considered {{in order to}} find their influences on load-deflection paths and non-linear deformations. The static perturbation technique is used for analysis and discussion. The first, a second order perturbation problem as an accurate measurement for the frame, is solved and the solutions compared with previously published papers. The results reveal that symmetric frames with a <b>sway</b> <b>movement,</b> due to lack of an axial force in the beam in the first order perturbation analysis, have a symmetric bifurcation point. However, the post-buckling {{behavior of}} un-symmetric frames with or without sway is bifurcated in an asymmetric manner...|$|R
500|$|Mantises, like stick insects, show rocking {{behavior}} {{in which the}} insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this {{behavior in}}clude the enhancement of crypsis {{by means of the}} resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive <b>swaying</b> <b>movements</b> may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field. As ants may be predators of mantises, genera such as [...] Loxomantis, Orthodera, and Statilia, like many other arthropods, avoid attacking them. Exploiting this behavior, a variety of arthropods, including some early-instar mantises, mimic ants to evade their predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} expansion and lateral <b>sway</b> <b>movement</b> {{of the deck}} are {{taken care of by}} expansion and articulation joints. There are two main expansion joints, one at each interface between the suspended span and the cantilever arms, and there are others at the towers and at the interface of the steel and concrete structures at both approach. There are total 8 articulation joints, 3 at each of the cantilever arms and 1 each in the suspended portion. These joints divide the bridge into segments with vertical pin connection between them to facilitate rotational movements of the deck. The bridge deck has longitudinal ruling gradient of 1 in 40 from either end, joined by a vertical curve of radius 4,000 ft. The cross gradient of deck is 1 in 48 between kerbs.|$|R
60|$|With the Hop we {{have seen}} that three internodes were at the same time revolving; and this was the case with most of the plants {{observed}} by me. With all, if in full health, two internodes revolved; so that by the time the lower one ceased to revolve, the one above was in full action, with a terminal internode just commencing to move. With Hoya carnosa, on the other hand, a depending shoot, without any developed leaves, 32 inches in length, and consisting of seven internodes (a minute terminal one, an inch in length, being counted), continually, but slowly, swayed from side to side in a semicircular course, with the extreme internodes making complete revolutions. This <b>swaying</b> <b>movement</b> was certainly due to the movement of the lower internodes, which, however, had not force sufficient to swing the whole shoot round the central supporting stick. The case of another Asclepiadaceous plant, viz., Ceropegia Gardnerii, is worth briefly giving. I allowed the top to grow out almost horizontally to the length of 31 inches; this now consisted of three long internodes, terminated by two short ones. The whole revolved in a course opposed to the sun (the reverse of that of the Hop), at rates between 5 hrs. 15 m. and 6 hrs. 45 m. for each revolution. The extreme tip thus made a circle of above 5 feet (or 62 inches) in diameter and 16 feet in circumference, travelling at the rate of 32 or 33 inches per hour. The weather being hot, the plant was allowed to stand on my study- table; and it was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot sweeping this grand circle, night and day, in search of some object round which to twine.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for computing the Center of Mass (COM) from empirical {{estimates of the}} Center of Pressure (COP) obtained {{by means of a}} force platform.

The equations are solved by approximating the solution with best fitting spline functions. The implications for movement control are discussed. Introduction. In spite of its apparent simplicity, the nature of the control mechanisms that allow humans to stabilise postural sway is still an object of controversy. Sway is the persistent oscillation of the COM (Center Of Mass), the controlled variable, in the AP (Antero-Posterior) and ML (Medio-Lateral) planes. This variable is not measurable in a direct way, although is frequentl...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To analyze gait {{patterns}} {{associated with}} sadness and depression. Embodiment theories suggest a reciprocal relationship between bodily expression {{and the way}} in which emotions are processed. Methods: In Study 1, the gait patterns of 14 inpatients suffering from major depression were compared with those of matched never-depressed participants. In Study 2, we employed musical mood induction to induce sad and positive mood in a sample of 23 undergraduates. A Fourier-based description of walking data served as the basis for the computation of linear classifiers and for the analysis of gait parameters. Results: Gait patterns associated with sadness and depression are characterized by reduced walking speed, arm swing, and vertical head movements. Moreover, depressed and sad walkers displayed larger lateral <b>swaying</b> <b>movements</b> of the upper body and a more slumped posture. Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that a specific gait pattern characterizes individuals in dysphoric mood.

50|$|The birds nest in {{colonies and}} the nest is a thick {{platform}} of twigs {{placed on a}} low tree. The breeding season varies from October to May. In Tamil Nadu, the breeding season follows {{the onset of the}} northeast monsoon. The courtship display of the males involves a distention of the pouch with swinging motions of the head up and down followed by sideways swings followed by the head being held back over the back. Bill claps may also be produced during the head <b>swaying</b> <b>movements.</b> The nests are usually built alongside other colonial waterbirds, particularly painted storks. Three to four chalky white eggs is the usual clutch. The eggs become dirty with age. Eggs hatch in about 30-33 days. The young stay in or near the nest from three to five months. In captivity the young are able to breed after two years. Like other pelicans, they cool themselves using gular fluttering and panting.|$|R
5000|$|The Indian {{chameleon}} (Chamaeleo zeylanicus) is {{a species}} of chameleon found in Sri Lanka, India, {{and other parts of}} South Asia.

Strangely, they do not choose the background colour and may not even be able to perceive colour differences. They are usually in shades of green or brown or with bands. They can change colour rapidly and the primary purpose of colour change is for communication with other chameleons and for controlling body temperature by changing to dark colours to absorb heat.|$|E
50|$|Sembiyan Mahadevi was {{a consummate}} temple builder {{and a highly}} {{respected}} patron of the arts. During her lifetime, special celebrations marked her birthday in the Shiva(Śiva) temple {{in the town of}} Sembiyan Mahadevi, named after her, and a metal portrait of the beloved queen was presented to the temple in her honor, possibly commissioned by her son. As such, it would have been recognized as Sembiyan Mahadevi by its use in processions celebrating her birthday. This highly stylized bronze image is an instance of the blurring of lines between royal and divine portraiture in ancient Indian art. The pose is reminiscent of the goddess Parvati. Indian artists often portray Hindu deities with great attention to arm/hand details to emphasize their omnipresence and omnipotence. A variety of hand gestures, known as mudras, are used to express the mood and meaning of the images of the gods. For instance, when the palm is raised to face the worshiper, it is the gesture of protection (abhaya), while a lowered hand with the fingers pointing downward signifies a promise to grant the devotee's wishes (varada). The contrapposto pose, known in India as tribhanga, or triple-bent, was a popular stance; it produced a sense of <b>swaying</b> <b>movement,</b> and most images, whether human or divine, are thus poised.|$|E

500|$|Males find females by {{following}} their scent trails, sometimes tracking them {{for hundreds of}} meters a day. If a female is found and flees, the male follows. Courtship involves side-by-side parallel [...] "flowing" [...] behavior, tongue flicking along the back and excited lashing of the tail. Pairs stay together {{for one or two}} days after mating. Males chase away their rivals and engage in combat. Often, this also starts with the aforementioned flowing behavior before culminating in the dramatic [...] "adder dance." [...] In this act, the males confront each other, raise up the front part of the body vertically, make <b>swaying</b> <b>movements</b> and attempt to push each other to the ground. This is repeated until one of the two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate. Interestingly, Appleby (1971) notes that he has never seen an intruder win one of these contests, as if the frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate. There are no records of any biting taking place during these bouts.|$|R

To obtain {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} Fu’s subcutaneous needling (FSN) on needling distance by assessment of endplate noise (EPN) recorded from the myofascial trigger spots (MTrSs) in rabbit skeletal muscle. Method. Eighteen New Zealand rabbits weighing 2. 5 – 3. 0 kg were randomly {{divided into two}} groups as follows: proximal needling (PN) group and distal needling (DN) group. The needling procedure followed the instructions described by the inventor of FSN, including needling insertion and <b>swaying</b> <b>movement.</b> The amplitudes of EPN on the MTrS region of BF muscle were recorded as an index of MTrS irritability. Random sampling of EPN tracings were taken for further analyses before, during, and after FSN treatment. Results. In PN and DN groups, the trends of EPN amplitude alterations were similar at conditions before, during, and after FSN treatment. The degree of reduction in the EPN amplitude in PN group was significantly higher than that in DN group. There were no significant changes in EPN amplitudes in the MTrS of contralateral BF without FSN intervention either in DN or PN group. Conclusion. The irritability of proximal MTrSs could be modulated after ipsilateral FSNs. The placement of FSN may affect the effectiveness of suppression of irritability of MTrSs...|$|E
