40|$|Abstract—This paper shows {{a simple}} and {{effective}} approach to the design and implementation of Industrial Information Systems (IIS) oriented to control the characteristics of each individual product manufactured in a production line and also their manufacturing conditions. The particular products considered in this work are large <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> that are <b>coiled</b> just after their manufacturing. However, the approach is directly applicable to <b>coiled</b> <b>strips</b> in other industries, like paper, textile, aluminum, etc. These IIS provide very detailed information of each manufactured product, which complement the general information managed by the ERP system of the production line. In spite of the high importance {{of this type of}} IIS to guarantee and improve the quality of the products manufactured in many industries, there are very few works about them in the technical literature. For this reason, this paper represents an important contribution to the development of this type of IIS, providing guidelines for their design, implementation and exploitation.

The influence rules of two factors including the cross sectional area of <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and vertical compression were investigated. The results show that, as for unreinforced masonry wall, {{the relationship of the}} shear capacity of unreinforced masonry wall and the vertical compressive strain is linear under lateral load; the speed of stiffness degeneration is accelerated after the peak point of the curves, but decrease with the increasing of lateral displacement. As for masonry wall strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> the shear capacity increases significantly, and shows nonlinear relationship with the cross section area of the <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and vertical compression; ductility is improved. Finally, a computational formula of shear capacity based on a lot of parametric analysis is proposed to calculate the sectional dimension of <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> and it provides theoretical foundation for establishing thorough design method of masonry wall strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the {{production}} of pocket type electrodes for Ni-Cd batteries perforation of proper <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and then nickel platting of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> were made. In the nickel platting process, the organic solvent, trichloroethylene, has previously been used for cleaning. Due to the carcinogenic nature of trichloroethylene and the many operations previously required during cleaning, it was considered to do cleaning of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> without use of the mentioned organic solvent. In the purpose of elimination of trichloroethylene from the cleaning process of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> the tests of perforation of <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> with use of oils of different viscosity were made. It was shown {{that there was no}} dysfunction during the work of the perforation plants, meaning there was no additional heating of the strips, deterring of the steel filings, nor excessive wearing of the perforation apparatus. The perforation percent was the same irrelevant of the viscosity of the used oil. Before being perforated using the oils with different viscosity, the nickel platting <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> were cleaned in different degreasers (based on NaOH as well as on KOH). It was shown that efficient cleaning without the use of trichloroethylene is possible with the use of oil with smaller viscosity in the perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> process and the degreaser based on KOH in the cleaning process, before nickel platting. It also appeared that the alkali degreaser based on KOH was more efficient, bath corrections were made less often and the working period of the baths was longer, which all in summary means less quantity of chemicals needed for degreasing of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractReactive {{annealing}} of semi-processed electrical steels is {{an important}} process to reduce electro-magnetic losses. The annealing process involves heating of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> which is passed continuously through the furnace, to a certain temperature. The heated <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> gets decarburised and annealed in a warm gas atmosphere containing N 2 -H 2 -H 2 OCO-CO 2 mixture. The composition of the warm gas atmosphere {{plays a major role}} in both the decarburisation and selective oxidation of carbon from the <b>steel</b> <b>strip.</b> The furnace settings are often changed to cater for products with different metallurgical properties and varying dimensions. Often the line speed of the process too needs to be changed to cater to varying input parameters of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> such as composition, width, thickness etc. Thus an advanced mathematical model based system is desired to optimize the running of the furnace to achieve the desired properties at improved productivity. For effective control of system, mathematical model for the heating of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is developed. Decarburisation model for the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> has been coupled with the thermal model. The model takes in various inputs like line speed, composition of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> width and its thickness. Temperatures in the different zones of the furnace along with the decarburising gas flow rate, H 2 /H 2 O ratio etc, are taken as input parameters. The model predicts the thermal profile of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> inside the furnace. It also predicts the carbon composition in the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> along the length of the furnace. Based on optimized temperature and carbon profile for different grades, the model suggests the desired line speed and the temperature settings in the different zones of the furnace. If there is a mismatch in the desired and the actual line speed the model also generates the desired set points of temperature for increasing or decreasing the furnace temperature which is downloaded to PLC in order to control the furnace parameters in real-time...|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements is established to investigate the structural performance of bolted connections between cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and hot rolled steel plates under shear. Non-linear material, geometrical and contact analysis is carried out to predict the load-extension curves of typical bolted connections with cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> of high yield strength and low ductility. The failure mode {{of interest in the}} present investigation is the bearing failure of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> around bolt holes; a full description of the {{finite element model}} is presented. Based on test data, a stress-strain curve for the cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is proposed which allows the cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> to yield and degrade in strength at large strain. The load-extension curves of four sets of test specimens were successfully predicted up to an extension of 3 mm.
