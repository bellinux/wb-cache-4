5000|$|H.R. 1981 {{is similar}} to Canada's Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act which [...] "requires Internet {{providers}} to acquire the ability to engage in multiple <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interceptions</b> and gives law enforcement the power to audit their surveillance capabilities. Should it take effect, the bill would create a new regulatory environment for Internet providers, requiring them to submit a report within months of the law taking effect describing their equipment and surveillance infrastructure. Moreover, they would actively work with law enforcement to test their facilities for interception purposes and even provide the name of employees involved in interceptions to allow for possible RCMP background checks." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Typhon/SPG-59 {{started as}} a {{response}} to the introduction of sea-skimming anti-ship missiles into service with Soviet Naval Aviation groups. First-generation missile systems like Talos and Terrier used a combination of beam riding and semi-active radar homing (SARH) that required a special targeting radar to illuminate the target through the entire interception. Typical installations included either two or four such illumination radars, which limited the number of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interceptions.</b> Facing volleys of missiles such systems could easily be overwhelmed. Adding additional radars was possible, but difficult to arrange as the radars were fairly large and required a clear view of the sky, limiting the number of suitable locations. This led to a [...] "specification convergence"; since there could only be a small number of radars, the missile receivers were built to tune in only a small number of potential [...] "channels". That meant that increasing the number of radars would also require the missiles to be updated as well.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{estrogen}} receptor (ER) pathway and the epidermal {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) pathway play pivotal roles in breast cancer progression. Targeted therapies able to intercept ER or signaling downstream to EGFR and its kin, HER 2, are routinely used to treat distinct groups of breast cancer patients. However, patient responses are limited by resistance to endocrine therapy, which {{may be due to}} compensatory HER 2 /EGFR signaling. This raises the possibility that <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interception</b> of HER 2 and ER may enhance therapeutic efficacy. To address the question, we treated breast cancer cells with both fulvestrant (ICI 182780), an ER antagonist with no agonist effects, and lapatinib, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific to EGFR and HER 2. Our results indicate that the combination of drugs is especially effective when applied to HER 2 -overexpressing, ER-positive cancer cells. Interestingly, fulvestrant activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway of these cells, but complete inhibition of MAPK signaling was observed on cotreatment with lapatinib. Taken together, our observations reinforce the possibility that the effectiveness of combining anti-ER and anti-HER 2 /EGFR drugs may be especially effective on a relatively small subtype of HER 2 -overexpressing, ER-positive tumors of the breast...|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a late-onset progressive degeneration {{of motor}} neurons occurring {{both as a}} sporadic and a familial disease. The etiology of ALS remains unknown, but one fifth of instances are due to specific gene defects, the best characterized of which is point mutations in the gene coding for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD 1). Because sporadic and familial ALS affect the same neurons with similar pathology, {{it is hoped that}} understanding these gene defects will help in devising therapies effective in both forms. A wealth of evidence has been collected in rodents made transgenic for mutant SOD 1, which represent the best available models for familial ALS. Mutant SOD 1 likely induces selective vulnerability of motor neurons through a combination of several mechanisms, including protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, cytoskeletal abnormalities and defective axonal transport, excitotoxicity, inadequate growth factor signaling, and inflammation. Damage within motor neurons is enhanced by noxious signals originating from nonneuronal neighboring cells, where mutant SOD 1 induces an inflammatory response that accelerates disease progression. The clinical implication of these findings is that promising therapeutic approaches can be derived from multidrug treatments aimed at the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interception</b> of damage in both motor neurons and nonmotor neuronal cells...|$|R
40|$|The process {{industries}} {{are characterized by}} the enormous use of natural resources such as raw materials, solvents, water, and utilities. Additionally, significant amounts of wastes are discharged from industrial facilities. As the world moves toward sustainable progress, that is, meeting the demand of the current generation without affecting or compromising the new generation, future process facilities must focus on resource conservation and pollution prevention. The purpose of this work is to introduce a new process integration methodology for the conservation and optimization of resources in the {{process industries}}. The work is also geared towards reducing waste discharge from the processing facilities. The optimal management of fresh resources and waste disposal requires the appropriate allocation, generation, and separation of streams and species. Material recycle/reuse/substitution, reaction alteration, and process modification {{are some of the}} main strategies employed to conserve resources in the process industries. The overall problem addressed in this dissertation can be stated as follows: Given is a process with a number of streams (sources) that are characterized by certain criteria (e. g., compositions of certain compounds, targeted properties) where these streams can be utilized in a number of process units (sinks) if they satisfy given constraints on flow rate, compositions, and/or properties. Additionally, interception devices may be used to adjust stream criteria. The objective is to develop targeting procedures and synthesis tools for the identification of minimum usage of fresh resources, minimum discharge of waste, and maximum integration of process resources. The devised methodology addresses four classes of problems: ?? Targeting techniques using direct recycle strategies ?? Recycle and interception procedures for single-component systems ?? Recycle and interception procedures for multi-component systems ?? Property integration for direct recycle strategies The framework provided by this dissertation couples traditional mass integration with groundbreaking property integration techniques to target, synthesize and optimize a plant for maximal conservation of resources. In particular, this work introduces new techniques such as material recycle pinch analysis, <b>simultaneous</b> recycle and <b>interception</b> networks, and property-based allocation. Additionally, graphical, algebraic, and optimization approaches are developed and validated with case studies in order to illustrate the applicability of the devised procedures...|$|R
