5|$|The {{irregular}} Nefyn Coaches service 8b has {{an early}} morning weekday Nefyn–Tudweiliog–Llangwnnadl–Penygroeslon–Rhydlios bus, which operates only during school holidays. On Wednesdays throughout the year, a return journey runs the Rhydlios–Porth Or–Uwchmynydd–Aberdaron–Penycaerau–Y Rhiw–Botwnnog–Mynytho–Llanbedrog–Pwllheli route. On other weekdays a Nefyn–Tudweiliog–Llangwnnadl–Penygroeslon–Aberdaron–Uwchmynydd bus runs. On Wednesdays during school terms, an afternoon journey runs on the Y Rhiw–Botwnnog–Mynytho–Llanbedgrog–Pwllheli route. At weekends, a Saturday morning bus operates Nefyn–Dinas–Rhos-ddu–Brynmawr–Sarn Meyllteyrn–Pant–Uwchmynydd. This then makes a journey {{through the heart of}} Llŷn on the Uwchmynydd–Porth Or–Rhydlios–Pant–Sarn Meyllteyrn–Brynmawr–Rhos-ddu–Dinas–Llaniestyn–Garnfadryn–Rhyd-y-clafdy–Efailnewydd–Pwllheli route, returning in the afternoon.

5|$|Independence, however, did {{initiate}} {{the abolition of}} slavery in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the field}} of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are {{concerned}} with the relations between mental and physical states and processes: Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation. Cognitive neuroscience studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes. Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain. Lastly, evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages. Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the gene-based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> long time periods.|$|E

The longest stance duration was found in the highest obstacle 15. 2 cm, which might reflect relatively fast degrading gait function of the faller group.

25|$|The Clapham Sect, {{although}} their {{religious and political}} influence was more active in Spanish Latin America, were a group of evangelical reformers that campaigned {{during much of the}} 19th century for the United Kingdom to use its influence and power to stop the traffic of slaves to Brazil. Besides moral qualms, the low cost of slave-produced Brazilian sugar meant that British colonies in the West Indies were unable to match the market prices of Brazilian sugar, and each Briton was consuming 16 pounds (7kg) of sugar a year by the 19th century. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> three decades.|$|E

40|$|International audience— Humanoid robots {{are getting}} {{increasingly}} {{attention in the}} robotics community, {{not only for the}} scientific challenge of the complex multibody system issues and mechatronic designs, but also due to their high mobility and versatility. Humanoid robots have the potential to navigate through complex environ-ments such as the standard living surrounding of humans. This is mainly due to the bipedal legged nature of the robotic system, which allows higher mobility than its wheeled counterpart. One of the advantages is that it can negotiate obstacles by <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> them, which is the topic of the work presented in this paper. The main focus of this research is to investigate <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> large obstacles. Previous work has reported on algorithms using quasi-static balancing, which resulted in somehow unnatural slow motions. This work however is focussing on <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> larger obstacles in a fluent dynamic motion, using stability criteria on zero moment point instead of center of gravity. All the work is formulated in function of the elaborate HRP- 2 humanoid research platform. In this paper a preliminary 2 D study on <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> leg trajectories and their dynamic implications on the overall stability are investigated. The paper discusses the implementation of the <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> procedure in the overall dynamic motion generator, the implications on the kinematics and dynamics and finally the actual <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> foot trajectory planner...|$|R

25|$|The SRTV has a {{range of}} up to 350 miles, and can operate in {{difficult}} environmental conditions, and including at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above mean sea level. The vehicle can travel at a speed over 100mph and climb vertical grades over 70 degrees, move on side slopes angles of over 60 degrees and climb vertical <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> three feet. It can turn on a 20' (6.1 m) diameter curb to curb. Maneuverability is enhanced with cutting brakes allowing U-turns on steep hills within the length and width of the vehicle, also allowing high speed J-turns. The vehicle provides rollover safety for all occupants without limiting mission operational performance. Storm can carry up to three liters inside the rollover protection frame, without modifications, while still maintaining 360° of weapon field of fire.|$|E
25|$|Avon {{tells the}} rest of the group that Orac has traced Blake to Gauda Prime, an {{agricultural}} planet. Blake is masquerading as a bounty hunter; his latest quarry is Arlen, whom he hopes to recruit for his rebellion. Scorpio approaches Gauda Prime and is attacked. The crew, except Tarrant, use the teleport to abandon the damaged craft. Slave is rendered non-functional and Tarrant remains aboard to pilot Scorpio and is injured during a crash landing. Blake arrives, rescues and takes Tarrant to his base and purportedly captures Tarrant as bounty. Tarrant thinks that Blake has betrayed the group, and Blake lets Tarrant escape. Tarrant is nearly killed by Blake's colleagues when Avon and his crew save him, giving credence to Tarrant's accusation that Blake has betrayed them to the Federation. Becoming very suspicious of Blake, Avon kills him. Arlen reveals that she is a Federation officer and Federation guards arrive. Tarrant, Soolin, Vila, and Dayna are gunned down by Federation troops, who slowly surround Avon. Avon <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> Blake's body, raises his gun and smiles. Shots are heard.|$|E

Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E

25|$|The steady {{expansion}} and {{rapid population growth}} of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, {{but on the whole}} hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude of most Americans. While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons {{for tens of thousands of}} pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were two of the richest men in the world by 1900. Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized upward mobility, and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.|$|E

Maguire's apartment also displays a collection of photographs of dead bodies, some of them actual police stills from the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Hilt-and-point sword dances {{exist in}} many places in Europe. In this kind of dance the swords {{interlock}} to form a “rose,” or “lock,” that is placed {{around the neck of}} a participant to simulate decapitation. As well, crossed-sword dances are common in Europe. Typically, dancers execute complicated patterns of <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> and between the swords. In some variations, clay pipes may replace the swords. Many European sword dances were appropriated by trade guilds, with tools replacing the swords. In Turkey and Greece there exists a butchers’ dance called the hassapikos. It is now a social dance, but goes back to a battle mime in the Middle Ages performed with swords and performed by members of by the butchers' guild. [...] Also in Turkey are the so-called “guerrilla dances”, performed by dances arranged in a circle who make swishing and whiffling sounds with their swords (possibly to clear the area of evil spirits), followed by mock combat.|$|E

Bond is woken with a weapon pointing at him and Nash reveals himself to be the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is to shoot Bond through the heart and dispose of Romanova after leaving a film of their love-making in the luggage; in addition, the Spektor is booby-trapped to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal cigarette case between the pages of a book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet.

500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{leading up}} to the tug of war begins at around midnight {{on the eve of the}} festival. Both teams repair to their respective ropes and offer prayers for victory; this rite is known as goyu (...) [...] During this time, the teams guard their ropes against tampering, as well as preventing members of the opposing team from stepping over it (it is believed that a woman who <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> the rope at this time will conceive a male heir). Punishments can be severe; there are records of a woman being stoned to death in the early 20th century for such an infraction. The teams then gather at the festival site and perform further prayers, this time for the safety and prosperity of the village; sacrifices are also offered to Teojushin, the earth goddess. These communal rituals are called gosa (...) [...] At dawn, after the completion of these ceremonies, the two teams fetch their ropes to the site; this involves a procession with flags and costumes, accompanied by percussion music. There is then a staged debate over the connection of the two ropes, which has a symbolic sexual aspect; innuendo and bawdy taunts of the other team are common.|$|E

[...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAlthough visual input is used heavily during {{locomotion}} [1], intermittent visual input {{is sufficient}} for most walking tasks. A number of techniques provide evidence that suggests that short-term visual memory is used {{to fill in the}} resulting gaps. When <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> obstacles, for example, humans fixate the obstacle primarily one or two steps before they reach it [2], and removing their vision during the <b>step</b> <b>over</b> the obstacle does not affect their ability to <b>step</b> <b>over</b> it accurately [3]. Walking cats consistently look two or three steps ahead when walking [4], and can continue stepping accurately among obstacles for about four steps when visual input is suddenly removed [5]. This use of short-term memory raises questions pertinent for those interested in the neurobiology of walking as well as those interested in memory in general. Our laboratory has begun to exploit the fact that walking quadrupeds must rely on some form of visual memory to guide their hind legs over obstacles. Our experiments show that <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> obstacles triggers long-lasting memories in walking cats...|$|R
