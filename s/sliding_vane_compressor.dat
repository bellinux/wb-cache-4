40|$|Heat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular, but poor electricity generating efficiency limits the potential energy savings of electrically powered units. Thus the work reported in this thesis concerns {{the development of a}} range of gas engine driven heat pumps for industrial and commercial heating applications, which recover heat from the prime mover, normally rejected to waste. Despite the convenience of using proprietary engine heat recovery packages, investigations have highlighted the necessity to ensure the engine and the heat recovery equipment are compatible. A problem common •to all air source heat pumps is the formation of frost on the evaporator, which must be removed periodically, with the expenditure of energy, to ensure the continued operation of the plant. An original fluidised bed defrosting mechanism is proposed, which prevents the build-up of this frost, and also improves system performance. Criticisms have been levelled against the rotary <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> <b>compressor,</b> in particular the effects of lubrication, which is essential. This thesis compares the rotary <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> with other machines, and concludes that many of these criticisms are unfounded. A confidential market survey indicates an increasing demand for heat pumps up to and including 1990, and the technical support needed to penetrate this market is presented. Such support includes the development of a range of modular gas engine driven heat pumps, and a computer aided design for the selection of the optimum units. A case study of a gas engine driven heat pump for a swimming pool application which provided valuable experience is included...|$|E
40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{the project}} to develop and test a {{high-temperature}} compression heat pump of a low capacity with water as working fluid. For that purpose a heat pump was constructed and tested in combination with a distillation of water from aqueous solutions at atmospheric pressure. Since no low-cost compressor, appropriate for that purpose, was available, a dry-running <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> was adapted for the compression of water vapour at a temperature of about 100 C. The distillate output and the specific energy consumption of the compressor per liter distillate depend strongly on the evaporation temperature. In order to get economically reasonable results, the evaporation temperature should be at least 80 C. The distillate output was about 10 l/h at 90 C and raised with the evaporation temperature corresponding to the raising vapour density and the specific energy consumption of the compressor was lower than 100 Wh/l.

40|$|In Sliding Vane Rotary Compressors, {{as well as}} in most of {{positive}} displacement machines, the oil is injected to fulfill sealing and lubrication purposes. However, the oil injection could produce an additional effect during the compression phase with a great saving potential from the energetic point of view. Being the air inside the cell at a higher temperature than the oil injected, a cooling effect could be achieved so decreasing the mechanical power required for the compression. At the moment, the oil is introduced inside the compressor vanes through a series of simple holes that are only able to produce solid jets. In this way any effective heat transfer is prevented, as demonstrated by p-V measurements inside the cells during the compression phase. In the current study, a theoretical model of a sprayed oil injection technology was developed and further experimentally validated. The oil was injected along the axial length of the compressor through a number of pressure swirl atomizers which produced a very fine spray. The conservation equations, solved with a Lagrangian approach, allowed to track the droplets evolution from the injection until the impingement onto the metallic surfaces of the vanes. The theoretical approach assessed the cooling effect due to the high surface to volume ratio of the droplets and a reduction of the indicated power was predicted. The model validation was carried out through a test campaign on an mid-size <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> equipped with a series of pressure swirl injectors. The reconstruction of the indicator diagram as well as the direct measurements of torque and revolution speed revealed a reduction of the mechanical power absorbed close to 7 % using an injection pressure of 20 bar. The model is in a satisfactory agreement with the tests and it also confirms the experimental trends available in the literature. A parametric analysis on the injection pressure and temperature and on the cone spray angle was eventually carried out in order to identify an optimal set of operating injection parameters...|$|E

An experimental test bench was designed and built to reproduce the compressor operating conditions. Tests at different injection pressures and temperatures allowed to estimate some macroscopic features of the spray, namely break-up length and cone spray angle. In particular, measurements showed that while break-up length decreased at high pressure and temperature up to 3. 1 mm at 65 °C and 10 barg, the cone aperture tended to diverge from the nominal value of 80 ° up to 106 °. Furthermore, measurements with a laser diffractometric particle size analyzer allowed to retrieve the droplet size distribution and to estimate a key parameter for the heat transfer capabilities of the spray, namely the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD). At 55 °C and 9 barg the droplet size distribution fitted a Rosin Rammler function with shape parameter of 1. 87 and scale parameter of 228 μm while the spray SMD was 122 μm.
