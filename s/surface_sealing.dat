Petroleum-based rust-inhibitors provide several benefits, including the ability to creep over metal, covering missed areas.

Other benefits of petroleum-based rust protection include the self-healing properties that come naturally to oils, which helps undercoatings to resist abrasion caused by road sand and other debris. The disadvantage of using a petroleum-based coating is the film left over on surfaces, rendering these products too messy for top side exterior application, and unsafe in areas where it can be slipped on.

Analysis of a number of sections in Gauteng, South Africa, has shown that <b>surfacing</b> <b>seals</b> lost a large proportion of their aggregate where the road was crossed by a bridge. As all original properties of the seal components as well as the traffic on the road were similar, it was deduced that the micro-climate where the road traveled underneath the bridge should have caused this localized failure condition.

50|$|Surge Irrigation is {{a variant}} of furrow {{irrigation}} where the water supply is pulsed on and off in planned time periods (e.g. on for 1 hour off for 1½ hour). The wetting and drying cycles reduce infiltration rates resulting in faster advance rates and higher uniformities than continuous flow. The reduction in infiltration {{is a result of}} surface consolidation, filling of cracks and micro pores and the disintegration of soil particles during rapid wetting and consequent <b>surface</b> <b>sealing</b> during each drying phase. On those soils where surging is effective it has been reported to allow completion of the irrigation with a lower overall water usage and therefore higher efficiency and potentially offer the ability to practice deficit irrigation. The effectiveness of surge irrigation is soil type dependent; for example, many clay soils experience a rapid sealing behaviour under continuous flow and therefore surge irrigation offers little benefit.|$|E
50|$|If no preexisting {{channel is}} present, {{the water is}} {{initially}} released in a broad-front jökulhlaup which can have a flow front that is tens of kilometers wide, spreading out in a thin front. As the flow continues, it tends to erode the underlying materials and the overlying ice, creating a channel even as the reduced pressure allows most of the glacial ice to settle back to the underlying <b>surface,</b> <b>sealing</b> off the broad front release and channelizing the flow. The direction of the channel is defined primarily by the overlying ice thickness and secondarily by the gradient of the underlying earth, and may be observed to “run uphill” as {{the pressure of the}} ice forces the water to areas of lower ice coverage until it emerges at a glacial face. Hence the configuration of the various tunnel valleys formed by a specific glaciation provide a general mapping of the glacier thickness when the tunnel valleys were formed, particularly if the original surface relief under the glacier was limited.|$|E
50|$|Studies on {{soil erosion}} suggest that {{increased}} rainfall amounts and intensities {{will lead to}} greater rates of soil erosion. Thus, if rainfall amounts and intensities increase {{in many parts of}} the world as expected, erosion will also increase, unless amelioration measures are taken. Soil erosion rates are expected to change in response to changes in climate for a variety of reasons. The most direct is the change in the erosive power of rainfall. Other reasons include: a) changes in plant canopy caused by shifts in plant biomass production associated with moisture regime; b) changes in litter cover on the ground caused by changes in both plant residue decomposition rates driven by temperature and moisture dependent soil microbial activity as well as plant biomass production rates; c) changes in soil moisture due to shifting precipitation regimes and evapo-transpiration rates, which changes infiltration and runoff ratios; d) soil erodibility changes due to decrease in soil organic matter concentrations in soils that lead to a soil structure that is more susceptible to erosion and increased runoff due to increased soil <b>surface</b> <b>sealing</b> and crusting; e) a shift of winter precipitation from non-erosive snow to erosive rainfall due to increasing winter temperatures; f) melting of permafrost, which induces an erodible soil state from a previously non-erodible one; and g) shifts in land use made necessary to accommodate new climatic regimes.|$|E

According to German waste disposal and landfill regulations (TA Siedlungsabfall 1993), untreated municipal waste may only be deposited in landfills until the year 2005. Land-fills, which do not meet the standards of the EC landfill directive and its German counterpart, will have to stop operation by the year 2009.

40|$|Robust {{estimation}} of soil moisture using {{microwave remote sensing}} depends on extensive ground sampling for calibration and validation of the data. Soil <b>surface</b> <b>sealing</b> is a frequent phenomenon in dry environments.

We addressed this issue using a physically-based modeling approach that accounts explicitly for <b>surface</b> <b>sealing</b> at the hillslope scale. Simulated mean soil moisture at the respective layers corresponding to both the ground validation probe and the radar beam’s typical effective penetration depth were considered. A cyclic pattern was found in which, as compared to an unsealed profile, the seal layer intensifies the bias in validation during rainfall events and substantially reduces it during subsequent drying periods. The analysis of this cyclic pattern showed that, accounting for soil moisture dynamics at the soil surface, the optimal time for soil sampling following a rainfall event is a few hours {{in the case of an}} unsealed system and a few days in the case of a sealed one. <b>Surface</b> <b>sealing</b> was found to increase the temporal stability of soil moisture.

In this research work we eliminate <b>surface</b> <b>seals</b> by means of a novel practice of using cone splash-guards and examine the undisturbed transient cavity dynamics by impact of hydrophobic spheres for Froude numbers ranging. This enabled the measurement of extremely accurate pinch-off heights, pinch-off times, radial cavity collapse rates, and jet speeds in an extended range of Froude numbers compared to the previous work of Duclaux et al.
