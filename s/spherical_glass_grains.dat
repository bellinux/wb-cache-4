40|$|Elementary {{processes}} in dusty plasmas were studied experimentally in 3 separate projects. The 1 st project {{was devoted to}} the investigation of basic charging processes of dust particles. The samples were the time-tested spherical grains of glass and zinc dust grains that were irregular in shape. The secondary emission from zinc dust had been commonly studied previously. It {{was found that the}} yield of secondary emission from zinc grains was considerably larger than expected which could be probably the effect of the shape of the sample or its size. The ion field emission from <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> was studied. In the 2 nd project a study of dust charging on surfaces was performed. The charging processes examined were induced charge due to electric field, charging by contact potential, and the effect of UV irradiation. Both conducting and insulating dust samples were used. The contacting surfaces were exclusively metals. In the 3 rd project the collision cross sections of small water clusters has been measured. The water cluster production was realized in a free-jet expansion of water vapour to produce supersonic molecular beams. The beam attenuation method was used to measure the apparent collision cross-sections of water cluster molecules with 3 different gases. It was found that these collision cross sections are considerably larger than the geometrical size of the water cluster molecules. This data can be used for modelling the performance of rocket-born instruments. They also provide a starting point for estimating of the nucleation rate of ice crystals in the mesosphere.

40|$|The {{breakage}} {{initiation of}} soil grains {{is controlled by}} its tensile capacity. Despite the importance of tensile strength, it is often disregarded due to difficulties in measurement. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation {{on the effect of}} tensile strength on Hertzian response of a single soil grain. Hertz theory is commonly used in numerical simulation to present the contact constitutive behaviour of a purely elastic grain under normal loading. This normal force:displacement comes from stress distribution and concentration inside the grain. When the stress reaches the tensile capacity, a crack initiates. A series of numerical tests have been conducted to determine the sensitivity of Hertzian response to the selected tensile strength used as an input data. An elastic-damage constitutive model has been employed for spherical grains in a combined finite-discrete element framework. The interpretation of results was enriched by considering previous theoretical work. In addition, systematic experimental tests have been carried out on both <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads and <b>grains</b> of two different sands, i. e. Leighton Buzzard silica sand and coarse carbonate sand from Persian Gulf. The preliminary results suggest that lower tensile strength leads to a softer response under normal loading. The wider range of responses obtained for the carbonate sand, are believed {{to be related to the}} large variety of grain shape associated with bioclastic origin of the constituent grains...|$|R
40|$|DWPF is {{considering}} replacing irregularly shaped <b>glass</b> frit with <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads in the Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) process {{to decrease the}} yield stress of the melter feed (a non-Newtonian Bingham Plastic). Pilot-scale testing was conducted on <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads and glass frit to determine how well the glass beads would transfer {{when compared to the}} glass frit. Process Engineering Development designed and constructed the test apparatus to aid in the understanding and impacts that <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads may have on the existing DWPF Frit Transfer System. Testing was conducted to determine if the lines would plug with the glass beads and the glass frit slurry and what is required to unplug the lines. The flow loop consisted of vertical and horizontal runs of clear PVC piping, similar in geometry to the existing system. Two different batches of glass slurry were tested: a batch of 50 wt% <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads and a batch of 50 wt% glass frit in process water. No chemicals such as formic acid was used in slurry, only water and glass formers. The glass beads used for this testing were commercially available borosilicate glass of mesh size - 100 + 200. The glass frit was Frit 418 obtained from DWPF and is nominally - 45 + 200 mesh. The <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads did not {{have a negative impact on}} the frit transfer system. The transferring of the <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads was much easier than the glass frit. It was difficult to create a plug with glass bead slurry in the pilot transfer system. When a small plug occurred from setting overnight with the <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads, the plug was easy to displace using only the pump. In the case of creating a man made plug in a vertical line, by filling the line with <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads and allowing the slurry to settle for days, the plug was easy to remove by using flush water. The glass frit proved to be much more difficult to transfer when compared to the <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads. The glass frit impacted the transfer system to the point that the test apparatus had to be disassembled to dislodge the plugs created in the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between critical state and particle shape {{corresponds to the}} most fundamental aspect of the mechanics of granular materials. This paper presents an investigation into this relationship through macro-scale and micro-scale laboratory experiments in conjunction with interpretation and analysis {{in the framework of}} critical state soil mechanics. <b>Spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads and crushed angular glass beads of different percentages were mixed with a uniform quartz sand (Fujian sand) to create a sequence of mixtures with varying particle shape. On the micro-scale, particle shape was accurately measured using a laser scanning technique, and was characterized by aspect ratio, sphericity and convexity; a new shape index, taken as the average of the three shape measures and referred to as overall regularity, was proposed to provide a collective characterization of particle shape. On the macro-scale, both undrained and drained triaxial tests were carried out to provide evidence that varying particle shape can alter the overall response as well as the critical states in both stress space and volumetric compression space. The mixtures of Fujian sand and <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads were found to be markedly more susceptible to liquefaction than the mixtures of Fujian sand and crushed angular glass beads. The change in liquefaction susceptibility was shown to be consistent with the change in the position of the critical state locus (CSL) in the compression space, manifested by a decrease in the intercept and gradient of the CSL due to the presence of <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads. Quantitative relationships have been established between each of the critical state parameters and each of the shape parameters, thereby providing a way to construct macro-scale constitutive models with intrinsic micro-scale properties built in. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Spring slider {{experiments}} are performed with a varying normal load, spring stiffness, load point velocity and grain size {{to determine the}} influence of these parameters on the displacement, force drop, maximum velocity and the reoccurrence time of a slip event and to validate the numerical model QDYN (Quasi DYNamic earthquake cycle simulator). The friction volume used, consist of <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads with a uniform grain size to create reproducible slip events (i. e. events with similar stress drops and displacements). The experimental results are used to validate QDYN, a numerical model based on rate-and-state friction laws. The rate-and-state friction parameters used by QDYN are fitted to the experimental data and the effect of changing these parameters on the displacement, force drop and maximum velocity is investigated. Using <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads as a friction volume the following trends where observed: An increase in the normal load results in a linear increase of the displacement, force drop and maximum velocity; An increase of the spring stiffness results in a negative power law relation with the measured variables and an increase of the load point velocity results in the increase of the measured variables according to a negative logarithmic law. It is shown that Dc cannot be used as a substitute for the grain size in QDYN. The <b>spherical</b> <b>glass</b> beads were substituted with angular quartz sand to determine what the effect of a different material is on rate-and-state parameters. The results show similar trends with the glass beads experiment. To obtain these results the RSF parameters used for the glass beads had to be adjusted: (a-b) increased, Dc decreased. We observed dependencies of dx, dF and Vmax on (a-b) and Dc using QDYN. Due to the quasi-dynamic nature of QDYN, the model is not capable of a precise prediction of the maximum size of an earthquake event, but can provide an approximation. The results of this study show similar relations to events found in nature and it is perhaps possible to extract RSF parameters of these events using large-scale simulation models such as QDYN...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Chromium, a {{potentially}} harmful element, occurs commonly within the urban sediment cascade {{as a result}} of abundant industrial and transport-related sources. The risks that Cr-bearing particles pose to ecosystems and humans depend on the solid-phase chemical speciation of Cr and its environmental mobility. In this study, we adopt an integrated geochemical approach to investigate and determine the long-term fate of Cr in the urban sediment cascade. Materials and methods We use bulk chemical digests, sequential chemical extraction analysis, electron microscopy, electron microprobe and microfocus XANES analysis to describe the solid-phase speciation, geochemical characteristics and potential long-term behaviour of Cr in urban particulate matter from both aquatic sediment and road dust sediment (RDS) in Manchester, UK. Results and discussion Cr-bearing grains within RDS and aquatic sediment are predominantly iron oxides and alumino-silicate <b>glass</b> <b>grains.</b> Electron microprobe analysis indicates Cr concentrations up to 3300 and 133, 400 μg g− 1 in the RDS and aquatic grains, respectively. XANES analysis indicates that Cr(III) is the dominant oxidation state, with only trace amounts of Cr(VI). Importantly, Cr speciation {{does not appear to have}} changed between sedimentary environments and the dominance of Cr(III) suggests limited bioavailability or toxicity under predominant environmental (anoxic and neutral pH) conditions in the aquatic sediment sink. Furthermore, geochemical analyses suggest the environmental mobility of Cr in the aquatic sediment sink is low (compared to other toxic metals) due to its association mainly with alumino-silicate <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> and its inclusion as an integral part of the glass structure. Conclusions Industrial <b>glass</b> <b>grains</b> are a major component of urban sediment worldwide. The speciation and geochemical investigations performed in this study suggest most Cr within the urban sediment cascade may be resistant to environmental processes that could mobilise other toxic metals...|$|R
