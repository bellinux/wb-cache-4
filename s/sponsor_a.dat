5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember {{the victims of the}} bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to <b>sponsor</b> <b>a</b> victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed {{as a result of the}} blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 the Havana Chess Club {{offered to}} <b>sponsor</b> <b>a</b> match between Steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent. Steinitz {{nominated}} the Russian Mikhail Chigorin, {{on the condition}} that the invitation should not be presented as a challenge from him. There is some doubt about whether this was intended to be a match for the world championship: both Steinitz's letters and the publicity material just before the match conspicuously avoided the phrase. The proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games, and Steinitz had said that fixed-length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because the first player to take the lead could then play for draws; and Steinitz was at the same time supporting the American Chess Congress' world championship project. Whatever the status of the match, it was played in Havana in January to February 1889, and won by Steinitz (ten wins, one draw, six losses).|$|E

5|$|In March 2013 it was {{announced}} that Feyenoord signed a four-year deal which would make Opel the club's main sponsor and would return the name Opel to its match kit beginning {{at the start of the}} 2013–14 season. It marks a return for Opel as Feyenoord's main <b>sponsor,</b> <b>a</b> position it held from 1984 to 1989. The match kits for the new season were presented in April 2013. The home jersey was similar to the previous season version with an updated sponsor name. The away kit took design cues from the white and green colours of the flag of Rotterdam and incorporates the coat of arms of Rotterdam on the side of the jersey.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to <b>sponsor</b> <b>a</b> new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E
5|$|The Munneswaram temple is {{well known}} for its celebration of Navaratri and Sivarathri functions. Navaratri lasts for nine days and is {{dedicated}} to various aspects of the presiding goddess, whereas Sivarathri is dedicated to Siva. Both these functions primarily attract Hindus to the temple. The annual Munneswaram festival {{is an important part of}} the temple calendar and it attracts Hindus, Buddhists, Catholics and even Muslims. Until the 1830s the festival lasted up to 18 days but since the 1960s it lasts for 28 days in the months of August and September. The festival begins with the hoisting of the temple flag. This is followed by 13 days of internal temple processions conducted in the outer pathways of the Siva temple. On each day of the festival, the images of Ganesha, Skanda, and the presiding consort goddess are paraded around the temple. Local Pattuva village deity temples also have festivals that coincide with the annual festival. Villagers belonging to Maradankulama and Uddappu <b>sponsor</b> <b>a</b> day each of the 28-day festival.|$|E
