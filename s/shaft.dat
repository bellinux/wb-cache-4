5|$|Built in 1483, it has {{a square}} base, a {{transitional}} segment leading into an octagonal <b>shaft,</b> then a 10 - sided polygon <b>shaft,</b> followed by a cylindrical <b>shaft</b> that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first <b>shaft</b> is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this <b>shaft</b> is the second octagonal <b>shaft</b> which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this <b>shaft</b> with the final cylindrical <b>shaft,</b> decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E

5|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{used at the}} Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter differs from most other lead blast {{furnaces}} in {{that it has a}} double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used. The lower <b>shaft</b> of the furnace has a chair shape with {{the lower part of the}} <b>shaft</b> being narrower than the upper. The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the <b>shaft.</b> This allows the upper part of the <b>shaft</b> to be wider than the standard.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the characteristics of}} hybrid propulsion <b>shafting</b> and builds mathematical models and vibration equations of <b>shafting</b> using the lumped parameter method. Main {{focus is on the}} asymmetric double diesel propulsion <b>shafting</b> operation process and the impact of the phase angle and motor excitation on torsional vibration of <b>shafting.</b> Model result is validated by testing results conducted on double diesel propulsion <b>shafting</b> bench.

5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the glans (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora), the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the labia minora) and the vestibular or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the <b>shaft</b> (or internal <b>shaft),</b> while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the <b>shaft</b> (or external <b>shaft)</b> because, like the <b>shaft</b> as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the <b>Shaft</b> of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The <b>Shaft</b> of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5|$|A rudder and {{a section}} of {{propeller}} <b>shaft</b> were {{on display at the}} Arashiyama Art Museum until it closed around 1991. The rudder, an anchor and one propeller have been relocated to the JMSDF Kure Museum, directly {{across the street from the}} Yamato Museum. The left-side 410mm gun from No. 3 turret is displayed outside as well, in Daiwa Park, Kure. The current whereabouts of the propeller <b>shaft</b> is now unknown.|$|E

50|$|Buildings {{may have}} {{maintenance}} <b>shafts</b> for passage of pipes and ducts between floors. Climbing these <b>shafts</b> {{is known as}} <b>shafting.</b> The practice is similar to buildering, which is done on the outsides of buildings.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>shafting</b> {{alignment}} {{results are}} greatly different with each other, although {{a series of}} domestic container vessels are with the same propulsion systems, which are built in Dalian Shipyard. With the transition matrix method improved, the <b>shafting</b> alignment models are analyzed. According to the results analysis, the different gravity centers of propellers and hull transfigurations {{in the process of}} shipbuilding influenced the different <b>shafting</b> alignment results obviously. With vessels built larger and larger in the future, hull transfigurations and other factors, which influence the quality of <b>shafting</b> alignment, must be considered to avoid the similar <b>shafting</b> accidents, when the calculated models of <b>shafting</b> alignment are built...|$|R
5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek <b>Shaft</b> and the No. 2 <b>Shaft</b> were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 <b>Shaft.</b> As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E
5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the <b>shaft</b> horsepower per <b>shaft</b> of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per <b>shaft.</b> This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator <b>shaft</b> and volunteers to go down the <b>shaft,</b> where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the <b>shaft,</b> where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} <b>shaft</b> and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the <b>shaft</b> is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the <b>shaft</b> and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E

5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its <b>shaft</b> circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the <b>shaft</b> a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the <b>shaft</b> length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal <b>shaft</b> circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.|$|E
