Throughout the 15 weeks of the experimental period, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed diets fortified with cocoa butter, <b>sal</b> <b>stearin</b> (SAL), palm mid fraction (PMF) and high-oleic sunflower oil (HOS). The sn- 1, 3 positions were varied by 16 : 0, 18 : 0 and 18 : 1, whilst the sn- 2 position was preserved with 18 : 1. The HOS-enriched diet was found {{to lead to the}} highest fat deposition. This was in accordance with our previous postulation. Upon normalisation of total fat deposited with food intake to obtain the fat:feed ratio, interestingly, mice fed the SAL-enriched diet exhibited significantly lower visceral fat/feed and total fat/feed compared with those fed the PMF-enriched diet, despite their similarity in SFA-unsaturated fatty acid-SFA profile. That long-chain SFA at sn- 1, 3 positions concomitantly with an unsaturated FA at the sn- 2 position exert an obesity-reducing effect was further validated. The present study is {{the first of its kind}} to demonstrate that SFA of different chain lengths at sn- 1, 3 positions exert profound effects on fat accretion...|$|E
