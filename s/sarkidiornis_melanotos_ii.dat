50|$|The {{knob-billed duck}} (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos),</b> or African comb duck, is a duck found in {{tropical}} wetlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar and south Asia from Pakistan to Laos and extreme southern China.|$|R
50|$|Typical for a wetland, BBWR is {{the habitat}} of many water birds, which also include geese. Among them comb duck (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos,</b> spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis), white-faced {{whistling}} duck (Dendrocygna viduata), garganey (Anas querquedula), northern pintail (Anas acuta), African pygmy goose (Nettapus auritus) {{and the northern}} shoveler (Anas clypeata).|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 340 faunal species {{are known to}} inhabit the area, {{including}} 82 species of birds, 33 species of reptiles, 15 species of frogs and 14 species of mammals. Notable examples include the snake Acrantophis dumerili, the white-lipped bright-eyed frog (Boophis albilabris) and the Malagasy rainbow frog (Scaphiophryne gottlebei). The many species of bird found here include Benson's rock thrush (Monticola sharpei bensoni), the knob-billed duck (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos)</b> and the Madagascar ibis (Lophotibis cristata).|$|R
40|$|The authors, {{in company}} with Rafael Ramirez {{and a group}} of Iowa State University students, observed, photographed, and {{documented}} a male Comb Duck of the South American subspecies (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos</b> sylvicola) at the large drying wetland in Palo Verde National Park, Costa Rica on 18 March 2010. The bird was present the following day and last reported 25 March 2010. The record is supported by photographs and becomes the first for Costa Rica and northernmost in the Western Hemisphere...|$|R
50|$|The {{wintering}} migrant birds which {{flock to}} the sanctuary were recorded at different periods during the winter months. The early arrivals in October were gadwall (Aythya ferina), northern pintail (Anas acuta), northern shoveller (Anas clypeata), common teal (Anas crecca), common pochard (Aythya ferina), and common coot (Fulica atra). The birds recorded during November were mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha), and knob-billed duck (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos).</b> The departure of the birds from the sanctuary was also noted in different months, {{towards the end of}} the winter season. The summer birds recorded were the lesser whistling duck (Dendrocygna javanica) and the cotton teal (Nettapus coromandelianus).|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} is a wintering {{place or}} feeding place for {{many species of}} birds.It provides the main winter habitat for species such as northern pintail (Anas acuta), American wigeon (Anas americana), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Native species include great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), military macaw (Ara militaris), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), scarlet macaw (Ara macao), red-and-green macaw (Ara chloroptera) chestnut-fronted macaw (Ara severus), northern screamer (Chauna chavaria), Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), knob-billed duck (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos),</b> black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), fulvous whistling duck (Dendrocygna bicolor), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti).Endangered birds include the recurve-billed bushbird (Clytoctantes alixii) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Characterizing the {{interface}} between wild and domestic animal populations is increasingly recognized as essential {{in the context of}} emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that are transmitted by wildlife. More specifically, the spatial and temporal distribution of contact rates between wild and domestic hosts is a key parameter for modeling EIDs transmission dynamics. We integrated satellite telemetry, remote sensing and ground-based surveys to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of indirect contacts between wild and domestic birds to estimate the risk that avian pathogens such as avian influenza and Newcastle viruses will be transmitted between wildlife to poultry. We monitored comb ducks (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos</b> melanotos) with satellite transmitters for seven months in an extensive Afro-tropical wetland (the Inner Niger Delta) in Mali and characterise the spatial distribution of backyard poultry in villages. We modelled the spatial distribution of wild ducks using 250 -meter spatial resolution and 8 -days temporal resolution remotely-sensed environmental indicators based on a Maxent niche modelling method. Results Our results show a strong seasonal variation in potential contact rate between wild ducks and poultry. We found that the exposure of poultry to wild birds was greatest {{at the end of the}} dry season and the beginning of the rainy season, when comb ducks disperse from natural water bodies to irrigated areas near villages. Conclusions Our study provides at a local scale a quantitative evidence of the seasonal variability of contact rate between wild and domestic bird populations. It illustrates a GIS-based methodology for estimating epidemiological contact rates at the wildlife and livestock interface integrating high-resolution satellite telemetry and remote sensing data. </p...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{availability}} for Afrotropical waterbirds {{is highly}} dynamic with unpredictable rainfall patterns and ephemeral wetlands resulting in diverse movement strategies among different species. Movement strategies among waterfowl encompass resident, regional and intercontinental migrants, but little quantitative information exists on their specific movement patterns. We studied the movement ecology of five Afrotropical waterfowl species marked with satellite transmitters in Malawi, Mali and Nigeria. Resident species, including White-faced Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna viduata, Fulvous Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna bicolor and Spur-winged Geese Plectropterus gambensis, remained sedentary {{during the rainy}} season and only flew limited distances during other months. In contrast, Knob-billed Ducks <b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos</b> made short regional movements ? 50 km in all months and showed little site fidelity to previously used habitats in subsequent years. Garganey Anas quequedula followed an intercontinental strategy and made long-distance jumps across the Sahara and Mediterranean to their Eurasian breeding grounds. Most species flew farthest during the dry season, as mean daily movements varied from 1. 5 to 14. 2 km and was greatest in the winter months (January-March). Total distance moved varied from 9. 5 km for White-faced Whistling Ducks (October-December) to 45. 6 km for Knob-billed Ducks (April-June). Nomadic behaviour by Knob-billed Ducks was evidenced by long exploratory flights, but small mean daily movements suggested that they were relying on previous experience. Improving our understanding of these movement strategies increases our ability to assess connectivity of wetland resources that support waterfowl throughout their annual cycle and focuses conservation efforts on their most important habitats.

40|$|Understanding and {{modeling}} the wildlife-livestock interface {{is essential for}} controlling emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The contact rate between hosts is a key parameter for mathematical modeling of EIDs dynamics. Because modifications of the contact rate can modify greatly the epidemiologic dynamic, {{it is important to}} take into account its seasonal variability. We developed a distribution model based on satellite telemetry and remote sensing data to directly evaluate the dynamic of contacts between wild birds and domestic poultry in African villages. In the Inner Niger Delta of Mali, five Comb ducks (<b>Sarkidiornis</b> <b>melanotos),</b> were tracked with satellite transmitters providing GPS data for seven months. We used 250 -meter spatial resolution and 8 -day temporal resolution remotely sensed environmental indicators to model the distribution of these wild birds with the MAXENT method. For each 8 -day period, we estimated the potential contacts between wild and domestic birds by calculating the number of villages harbouring predicted suitable habitats for Comb ducks. A period of increased potential contacts occurred {{at the end of the}} dry season when wild birds were looking for the last suitable habitats. Comb ducks subsequently performed regional movements to reach their breeding grounds during the rainy season. We could directly estimate the seasonal variation of potential contacts between Comb ducks and domestic poultry. It allowed us to identify period of potential transmission and spread of pathogens by wild birds. The estimation of the dynamic of contacts between wild and domestic animals with our method could feed epidemiological models of the wildlife-livestock interface. (Texte intégral...|$|R
