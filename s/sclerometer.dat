Beside them, also non-standard methods (through Mašek P. D., for instance) are in use to measure informative concrete strength. Theoretically it is supposed that same compressive strengths is obtained from same test area measured with different <b>Sclerometers.</b> But this presumption wasn’t confirmed yet. In case of nonconfirmed tests of concrete it's needed to use only one type of impact hammer.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the investigation of universal calibration dependences used in testing of the concrete strength by shear, rebound and ultrasound test methods. Many of the instruments currently used do not provide the required measurement accuracy, especially when using universal calibration dependences. The introduction of new more sophisticated instruments for nondestructive testing of concrete strength requires an assessment of their accuracy, taking into account the composition of concrete and other parameters. The shear test method, called “direct”, does not provide the required accuracy of measurements, and the use of this method for the calibration of <b>sclerometers</b> and ultrasonic devices is unacceptable. The aim of the research is to clarify the dependences, taking into account the data on concrete composition, parameters of materials used, and the age of concrete. The studies will allow you to set the values of the coefficients {{to be used in the}} generalized calibration curve, with considering the concrete information obtained at a particular construction site (where concrete strength is tested) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, the {{concepts}} of seismic risk vulnerability and structural health monitoring have become very important topics {{in the field of}} both structural and civil engineering for the identification of appropriate risk indicators and risk assessment methodologies in Cultural Heritages monitoring. The latter, which includes objects, building and sites with historical, architectural and/or engineering relevance, concerns the management, the preservation and the maintenance of the heritages within their surrounding environmental context, in response to climate changes and natural hazards (e. g. seismic, volcanic, landslides and flooding hazards). Within such a framework, the complexity and the great number of variables to be considered require a multi-disciplinary approach including strategies, methodologies and tools able to provide an effective monitoring of Cultural Heritages form both scientific and operational viewpoints. Based on this rationale, in this study, an advanced, technological and operationally-oriented approach is presented and tested, which enables measuring and monitoring Cultural Heritage conservation state and geophysical/geological setting of the area, in order to mitigate the seismic risk of the historical public goods at different spatial scales*. The integration between classical geophysical methods with new emerging sensing techniques enables a multi-depth, multi-resolution, and multi-scale monitoring in both space and time. An integrated system of methodologies, instrumentation and data-processing approaches for non-destructive Cultural Heritage investigations is proposed, which concerns, in detail, the analysis of seismogenetic sources, the geological-geotechnical setting of the area and site seismic effects evaluation, proximal remote sensing techniques (e. g. terrestrial laser scanner, ground-based radar systems, thermal cameras), high-resolution aerial and satellite-based remote sensing methodologies (e. g. aeromagnetic surveys, synthetic aperture radar, optical, multispectral and panchromatic measurements), static and dynamic structural health monitoring analysis (e. g. screening tests with georadar, sonic instruments, <b>sclerometers</b> and optic fibers). The final purpose of the proposed approach is the development of an investigation methodology for short- and long-term Cultural Heritages preservation in response to seismic stress, which has specific features of scalability, modularity and exportability for every possible monitoring configuration. Moreover, it allows gathering useful information to furnish guidelines for Institution and local Administration to plan consolidation actions and therefore prevention activity. Some preliminary results will be presented for the test site of Calabria Region, where some architectural heritages have been properly selected as case studies for monitoring purposes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether hardness of the superficial layer is a useful parame-ter to characterise cartilage produced by periosteal neochondrogenesis, using rabbit knee lesions as a model. A cartilage defect was created in the right hind knee of anesthetised young adult rabbits, and the defect was then covered with an autologous periosteal graft. At one and eight months post-surgery, rabbits were euthanised, and the articular cartilage lesion sites were evaluated for the histologi-cal parameters in a modified O’Driscoll scale, which is the current ‘gold standard ’ for new cartilage prop-erties.

40|$|International audienceThe shear {{strength}} of discontinuities {{plays a key}} role in the stability of rock masses, particularly in the case of analysing the sliding stability of the rock foundations of gravity dams. This paper proposes a methodology for analysing the spatial variability of {{shear strength}} along the joints of rock mass, based on the input parameters of the Barton and Choubey's model. The aim of this approach is to evaluate the reduction of the variance of the parameters involved at full-scale by identifying a deterministic trend varying in depth and a spatial correlation calculated from a variographic analysis.

However, it erodes {{faster than}} other construction {{materials in the}} circumstances of average usage of civil structures. Therefore, built features made of wood, especially historical features and structures, require repairs and reinforcements more frequently than those made of other materials. Non-destructive testing is usually carried out in structures that are currently in use and is aimed at early detection of failures and taking appropriate remedial measures. It can be generally assumed that diagnostic testing of wood is a difficult process due to its structure.

Furthermore, the paper presents problems related to direction of test content on the results of non-destructive testing (<b>sclerometer,</b> ultrasonic tests and cutting resistance measurements).

We have conducted the analysis of existing concreting methods of CFST members. In this respect, the most dangerous types of possible technological defects of concrete core of CFST members are inhomogeneity along the height, voids, caverns, and concrete “weak spots”. The authors considered the influence of such technological factors of concreting: placeability, time, concrete mixture compaction method, concreting height on the concrete core strength of CFST members.

40|$|Abstract. The shear {{stresses}} and pressures in the socket-stump interface {{were calculated for}} four transfemoral amputees, using the finite element method. A dynamic explicit model was developed for the simulation of the fitting procedure of the socket and the applying of the loads corresponding to the support phase during the gait, and a constitutive multilayer hyper-elastic model was employed for the soft tissues (skin, fat and muscle) because of their large strains and displacements, and lineal isotropic models for the bone and socket. In {{order to determine the}} influence of the friction coefficient on the socket-skin interface, its value was varied from a minimum value of 0. 5 to a maximum of 1. 0. Then, the zones where the greatest pressures and stresses occurred were identified, where the use of a horizontal strip was proposed with a variation of the friction coefficient from 0. 2 to 0. 6, in order to ob-serve its effect on the obtained stresses. The strip has a width of 10 cm and is located approx-imately 2. 0 cm below the ischial support of all the individuals. It was observed that the pres-sure does not change significantly when varying the friction coefficient. However, the average shear stress tends to rise when increasing the friction coefficient, and after applying the strip the average shear stress reduced up to 25 %, while the pressure variation was not significant. Finally, the experimental validation of the behavior of the friction coefficient between the polypropylene and the skin was performed with a <b>sclerometer.</b> This experiment considered factors such as the patient’s sweat, the amount of hair and the surface texture of the polypro-pylene coating, and it proved that the surface texture of the coating must be accounted for when measuring the friction coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} provide new qualitative information {{on the strength of}} reinforced concrete structures of two prominent examples of modern architecture by using innovative, non-invasive testing techniques. The first one is Lion Chambers in Glasgow (Scotland, United Kingdom) designed by the architects Salmon, Son and Gillespie and completed in 1907. It was the second example of the use of François Hennebique’s reinforced concrete system in a building in Glasgow and one of the earliest in Britain. The second example is Duni Theatre in Matera (Southern Italy), designed by the architect Ettore Stella and completed in 1949. The tests on the internal reinforced concrete columns were undertaken by using “SonReb” (SONic + REBound) method that enables assessing the concrete resistance by combining the speed of ultrasound waves and the index of surface bounce through a scleorometric test. In fact, the <b>sclerometer</b> index only gives information regarding the surface layer of the building's structure. In fact, due to the effects of the natural ageing, catalysed by the presence of humidity, surface layers of concrete are affected over time by carbonatation, which increases surface rigidity, providing as a result a greatly “altered” rebound index (much greater than one would have under normal conditions). On the other hand, the ultrasound speed, on the contrary to resistance, is inversely proportional to the age of the concrete (this seems to be due to the cracks that occur and reduce the speed). The hardening process continues over time with a consequent increase in resistance, which diminishes with the passage of time. The paper provides the results of the tests run on the structure of the Lion Chambers and the Duni Theatre. The tests carried out are the basis of a diagnostic project that is possible to implement and monitor to guarantee a deeper knowledge, with the goal of attaining a level of thorough understanding aimed at the preservation of “Modern Architecture” in Europe. The analysis and qualification of the structures of built heritage show how this approach is useful for classifying the pathological events on each building and to implement the innovative solutions to improve the durability of a restoration intervention...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} a systematic {{experimental study of}} the large strain surface mechanical properties of certain semicrystalline polymers, at the nanometre scale. A poly(etheretherketone) (PEEK) was selected as a model semicrystalline polymer for these investigations, as PEEK is currently finding extensive use in high performance composites. The central theme of the Thesis is to elucidate the nano normal indentation response and the scratch deformation mechanisms of semicrystalline polymers. Effective selection and design improvements of materials in surface engineering and tribological applications require knowledge of their near-to-surface mechanical properties. Therefore, this experimental study seeks to elucidate {{an understanding of the}} response of semicrystalline polymers in single point contacts. This Thesis approaches the nano surface mechanical property characterisation using indentation and scratching techniques. Indentation is a relatively simple and virtually nondestructive means of assessing mechanical properties of materials by an indenter, inducing a localized deformation into a solid surface. PEEK and other commercially available common polymers were indented and the data were analysed using a contact compliance method in conjunction with an MTS Nano IIs indenter system. The load-displacement curves, the hardness, the elastic modulus, the plasticity index and the creep response data and associated analysis for the PEEK surfaces are presented {{as a function of the}} contact displacement. A comparison of the data for the load-displacement curves, the hardness and the elastic modulus for common commercial polymers is described. A study of surface deformations of the PEEK surfaces when it undergoes scratching by means of conical indenters drawn along the surfaces under different contact conditions is also described. The scratch deformations produced considerable loss in optical appeal and surface mechanical properties of polymeric materials. The experimental investigation of the scratch response of the PEEK is focused upon the contact conditions. Scratch deformation maps have been constructed showing the effect of the normal load, the strain (the contact geometry), the strain rate (the scratching velocity), the contact temperature, the state of interfacial lubrication and the crystallinity of the polymer upon the scratching behaviour of the polymeric surface. The extent and the geometric characteristics of the surface damage produced are determined subjectively using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical profilometry techniques. The nano hardness and the elastic modulus results as a function of contact displacement for PEEK composites are also presented. The fibre oriented PEEK composites were scratched using a pendulum <b>sclerometer</b> to analyze the orientation effects on scratch deformations. Finally, nano indentation results for the modified PEEK surfaces under thermal, solvent and mechanical disruptions are reported. The major conclusions of this Thesis are that the nanoindentations into the polymers show a surface hardening response and are dependent upon the contact conditions. The semicrystalline polymers have bimodal nanoindentation characteristics due to presence of the hard crystalline lamella and the soft amorphous phase. The semicrystalline polymers exhibit periodic fluctuations in surface mechanical properties with increasing penetration depth. The scratch deformations of semicrystalline polymers depend upon the contact conditions. A peculiar fibrillation of the polymeric surface was observed when scratched under severe contact conditions (high normal load and sharp conical indenters). The scratch deformations of fibre oriented polymers are highly fibre orientation dependent relative to the scratch direction. Surface plasticisation of amorphous PEEK has been observed in organic solvents mainly in chlorinated solvents. Semicrystalline PEEK was seen to exhibit considerable inert behaviour to common organic solvents but chlorinated organic solvents has caused decrease in surface mechanical properties. A surface hardening of amorphous PEEK has been observed after immersion in water. A qualitative methodology, based on nanoindentation data, to analyze subsurface deformations of polymers resulting from scratch deformations are also presented.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in medicine today is disorders of the articular cartilage and arthritis. These conditions cause disabilities with many social and financial consequences. Autologous periosteal transplantation has become a well-established method for replacing, or partially regenerating, articular cartilage. It has been reported that this method has brought promising results {{but the fact is that}} all these experiments were performed under ideal conditions in knees that, apart from the cartilage lesion, had no other concomitant lesion. This is something that is very rare in everyday practice. In addition, the ability of the explants to withstand compressive loading has never been investigated. Hardness of the outer surface is probably the most important physical property of articular cartilage. The present study aims to elucidate periosteal neochondrogenesis following insult to the knee articular cartilage, and to investigate if there are any other factors (ligamentous instability, menisceal lesions, area of implantation, postoperative motion) that contribute or inhibit this chondrogenic potential. In addition, the quality of the neocartilage was investigated, based on its ability to withstand compressive load. The new parameter, “hardness” of the outer surface of neocartilage, was introduced into the gold standard, “O’Driscoll’s evaluation scale”. Statistical analysis was used in order to check if the new parameter improved the reliability, the validity and the internal consistency of the scale In the first part of this study, the micro and macro anatomy of articular cartilage is investigated, as well as its physiology. In addition, extensive reference is made to the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage and a detailed description of the technique of periosteal implantation is presented herein. In the second part, 60 rabbits were used and a cartilage defect 0. 5 ? 0. 5 ? 0. 2 cm deep was created in the medial femoral condyle of both rabbit knees. Each defect was then covered through the same incision with a periosteal graft harvested from the upper third of the animal's tibia. The graft, with its cambium layer facing the joint, was sutured at the lesion site. In addition, apart from the chondral lesion and the periosteal transplantation, an additional lesion was created in the right knee of each rabbit.. In the first group, the ACL was transected. In the second group, both the ACL and the medial collateral was experimentally transected (grossly unstable knees). Transection to the medial meniscus took place in the third group.. In the fourth group, ACL and MCL transection, as well as total medial meniscectomy, was performed. Finally, in the fifth group, a lesion in the cartilage of the patella was combined with ACL and a medial collateral ligament (MCL) transection. All knees were examined macroscopically and histologically. To augment the histological examination, the specimens were tested biomechanically. An indentation test was performed in the National Technical University of Athens, using a Shore-A <b>sclerometer..</b> At one and eight months after the surgery, groups of the rabbits were euthanized by intravenous administration of an overdose of thiopental. On the basis of the results of this study the following conclusions are drawn 1. Autologous periosteal transplantation, named by O’Driscoll ‘periosteal arthroplasty has shown promising results in treating defects of articular cartilage, and it is now possible to produce new cartilage that is histologically almost indistinguishable (both macroscopically and histologically) from normal hyaline-like cartilage. 2. Based upon this method, large articular cartilage defects can be substituted in one stage with good quality neocartilage. This would have been impossible with other current treatment methods, without the need for re-operation. 3. The method of periosteal transplantation has a short learning curve, but it requires special care to perform certain technical details intraoperatively. 4. In the patella, especially for large defects, the outcome was poor both histomorphologically and biomechanically with regard to the quality of the repair tissue. 5. With moderate knee instability (isolated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament) the lesion was occupied with neocartilage, sometimes of greater thickness than the original cartilage. Macroscopically it looks almost like normal hyaline cartilage (it has a whitish colour, compared to the hyaline cartilage which is semi-transparent). In grossly unstable knees (combined deficiency of several ligaments) the repair tissue following periosteal transplantation was mostly fibrocartilage, without any weight- bearing capacity in compressive loads. 6. Menisceal excision does not affect the chondrogenic potential. The procedure of periosteal neochondrogenesis progresses normally, and the knees do not show degenerative changes for up to eight months postoperatively [...] . ...|$|E
