5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat <b>straw</b> and rice <b>straw),</b> wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E

50|$|Polypropylene is {{becoming}} favored over polystyrene for manufacturing plastic drinking <b>straws</b> as polystyrene is brittle {{and tends to}} crack easily. Polystyrene is also denser than water, causing <b>straws</b> to sink when placed into beverages. Polypropylene <b>straws,</b> by contrast, are much more durable and do not sink.|$|R
5000|$|Special [...] "color-changer" [...] <b>straws</b> {{change color}} when cold (or hot) liquid passes through them. At some restaurants, frozen {{beverages}} like slush or frappes are served with color changing <b>straws.</b> Many {{of these are}} larger in diameter than typical <b>straws</b> to aid in drinking the thicker beverages.|$|R

5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or <b>straw,</b> can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or <b>straw</b> dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E

40|$|Semen from {{yellowtail}} flounder was cryopreserved in 0. 25 ml and flat 1. 7 ml <b>straws.</b> Semen frozen in 1. 7 ml <b>straws</b> was collected from males {{that had been}} stimulated to increase semen output by treatment with a GnRH analogue. The semen extender was a modification of a diluent {{that had previously been}} used to cryopreserve salmonid semen with 10 % propylene glycol added as a cryoprotectant. The semen was frozen in liquid nitrogen vapour and stored in liquid nitrogen. Freezing rates inside the <b>straws</b> were measured using a thermocouple. In a preliminary fertility trial, {{there were no significant differences}} in egg fertilization rates and hatching rates between freshly collected semen and semen frozen in 1. 7 ml <b>straws.</b> A larger trial compared the fertility of freshly collected semen, semen frozen in 0. 25 ml <b>straws</b> and semen frozen in 1. 7 ml <b>straws.</b> The mean fertilization rates for these groups were 64. 7, 59. 2 and 54. 4 % respectively; the hatching rates were 36. 7, 52. 5 and 42. 8 % respectively. The mean fertilization rate for semen frozen in 1. 7 ml <b>straws</b> was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than that of fresh semen. There were no other significant differences among treatments. The freezing rate to - 15 degrees C was slower for 1. 7 ml <b>straws</b> than for 0. 25 ml <b>straws</b> but was slightly faster from - 15 degrees to - 45 degrees. ...|$|R

5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the <b>straw</b> poll and scientific public opinion polls by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered <b>straw</b> polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine {{the best time to}} act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E

40|$|The <b>straws</b> {{which are}} {{discharged}} from the combine harvester are chopped and distributed over {{the field and the}} dried <b>straws</b> after chopping are gathered by the machine such as the hay baler. In this paper, we have examined the influence of the many factors on the chopped <b>straws</b> picking up with the flail knives type and obtained the basic data of the pick up of the chopped <b>straws</b> on the field. As the first step, the case of the fixed knives type was experimented. The pick up characteristics of the spreading chopped <b>straws</b> were investigated by the pick up ratio, the scatter ratio in front and the sides or the remainder ratio and the pick up height distribution ratio of each stage in the collecting box. The factors which gave a large influence on the pick up performance were the rotating speed, the length of the chopped <b>straws,</b> the clearance between knives and rotor housing. the clearance of knives and the knife width...|$|R

They are found from summer to autumn.|$|E
5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings of evolutionary biology (see <b>straw</b> man argument). This also means that advocates of creationism and evolutionary biologists often simply speak past each other.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack <b>Straw</b> (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). <b>Straw</b> stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E

40|$|The {{nutritive value}} of 17 <b>straws</b> was {{determined}} {{on the basis}} of their chemical composition, in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility and rumen fermentation kinetics (from gas production curves measured in vitro). Five roughages were from the cereal species Avena sativa (oat), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Secale cereale (rye), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Zea mays (maize stover). The other 12 samples were legume <b>straws,</b> two samples from each of the species Cicer arietinum (chickpea), Lens culinaris (lentil) and Phaseolus vulgaris (bean) and one sample from each of the species Lathyrus sativus (chickling vetch), Lupinus albus (white lupin), Pisum sativum (field pea), Vicia articulata (one-flowered vetch), Vicia ervilia (bitter vetch) and Vicia sativa (common vetch). All samples were collected after harvesting from different farms located in León (northwestern Spain). Based on their chemical composition, digestibility and gas production characteristics, species could be clustered into two groups with a significant linkage distance, one for cereal <b>straws</b> that merged at a level of similarity of 80 % and the other for legume <b>straws</b> with a degree of similarity of 50 %. Species varied widely and significant differences (P < 0. 05) were observed between the two groups of <b>straws.</b> Legume <b>straws</b> showed higher crude protein (74 ± 6. 1 vs 29 ± 2. 2 g kg- 1 DM) and lower fibre (584 ± 18. 1 vs 793 ± 27. 5 g neutral detergent fibre kg- 1 DM) contents than cereal <b>straws</b> and, consequently, DM digestibility coefficients (0. 670 vs 0. 609; standard error of difference 0. 0054) and metabolisable energy values (7. 4 ± 0. 15 vs 5. 7 ± 0. 24 MJ kg- 1 DM) were significantly greater in legume than in cereal <b>straws.</b> Although there were noticeable differences among species within each botanical family, legume <b>straws</b> showed better nutritional quality than cereal <b>straws,</b> indicating that they could be considered promising and interesting sources of roughage for incorporation into ruminant diet...|$|R
