It was later determined that the whale had most likely been struck by a large <b>shipping</b> <b>vessel,</b> damaging its spine, and leading to its death. The whale died after beaching on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it took three large cranes and 50 workers more than 13 hours to shift the whale onto the back of a truck.|$|E
