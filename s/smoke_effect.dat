500|$|In 1992, Gaven {{played the}} {{character}} Mrs. Walker {{in a new}} production called The Who's Tommy at La Jolla Playhouse. The musical was a success, resulting in its move to Broadway in 1993. Gaven was praised by critics for her performance and received a Tony Award nomination in the [...] "Best Featured Actress in a Musical" [...] category. She eventually [...] had to leave The Who's Tommy before its Broadway run ended because of an allergic reaction to a <b>smoke</b> <b>effect</b> used in the show. In 1995, she won an Ovation Award and a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for her portrayal of Florence Vassy in Chess at Hudson Theatre. She was also awarded an Ovation Award {{for the role of}} Mother in the staging of the musical Ragtime at Shubert Theatre in 1997. Gaven's latest role in a musical was in a 2001 production of 1776 by UCLA's Freud Playhouse. Since then she has appeared in concerts and fundraisers.|$|E

Filming was done at a remote airstrip in the Mojave Desert in California.

50|$|During {{the first}} season, {{in black and}} white, the <b>smoke</b> <b>effect</b> was usually a screen overlay of {{billowing}} smoke, sometimes combined with animation.

30|$|In {{addition}} to smokeâ€™s potential importance to plant regeneration following fire, smoke technology {{could have a}} wide variety of applications. For example, smoke can be used to pre-treat seeds to increase germination for revegetation projects, an application used in Australia since the early 1990 s to revegetate open-pit mines on former Eucalyptus forest sites (Roche et al. 1997). In areas where burning cannot be conducted, aqueous smoke could be useful for stimulating emergence (Van Staden et al. 2000). As Keeley and Baer-Keeley (2000) pointed out, however, there have been few assessments of <b>smoke</b> <b>effects</b> in field settings compared to <b>smoke</b> <b>effects</b> in greenhouse settings. There also have been relatively few studies examining more than one of the seed, seed bank, or field scales (Dixon et al. 1995, Lloyd et al. 2000).|$|R
5000|$|The {{software}} is an optical disc authoring utility, which {{allows users to}} burn CDs and DVDs with multisession support, disc duplication, burning VIDEO_TS folders, disc spanning {{as well as a}} searchable disc index, dubbed Discography.

This smoke responds to microphone input, as well as mouse input, causing perturbations in the <b>smoke</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Two {{music videos}} were {{created for the}} single. The first was a surreal video that Osbourne did not like because he felt the video did not match the song. He then created a second music video with Samuel Bayer, which was more to his liking. Osbourne {{compared}} the effects in the second video to the hazy <b>smoke</b> <b>effect</b> seen in the video for Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which was also directed by Bayer.|$|E

The action on the screen {{extended}} into the audience, including asteroids, lasers, laser impacts, <b>smoke</b> <b>effects,</b> and starfields that filled the theater.

5000|$|Gun f/x {{has also}} {{developed}} Improvised Explosive Device and Mine Training Simulators [...] The IED and mine simulators {{have been used}} to train troops in the deployment, detection, and disarming of mines and IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The IED and mine simulators utilize a 12 gram CO2 cartridge and frangible burst cup. The devices are used with an inert talc powder that gives off a <b>smoke</b> <b>effect.</b> Both designs give a concussive report in the 100 decibel range, which simulates the sound made by real IEDs and mines. Both models can be configured for remote command detonation.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by the Le Maitre Pyrotechnics and Special Effects {{company in}} England, the Pea Souper <b>smoke</b> <b>effect</b> machine creates a low-lying fog for stage and other effects uses. It uses a cage of dry ice pellets which are lowered into a bath {{of hot water}} (which is kept hot via an {{internal}} heating element). The dry ice (frozen/solid carbon dioxide) sublimates into a dense heavy [...] "smoke" [...] which lasts a short while until it dissipates into the atmosphere. The effect creates a rolling cloud of low lying fog which will follow the ground to the lowest point, [...] "rolling" [...] over stairs, stage fronts and other obstacles.|$|E

50|$|No {{one knows}} exactly how many bottles were used during the show, but members of the {{production}} have estimated that 12 bottles were painted and used during {{the run of the}} series. The stunt bottle used mostly for the <b>smoke</b> <b>effect</b> was broken frequently by the heat and chemicals used to produce Jeannie's smoke. In the pilot episode, several bottles were used for the opening scene on the beach; one was drilled through the bottom for smoke, and another was used to walk across the sand and slip into Tony's pack. Two bottles were used from promotional tours to kick off the first season, and one bottle was used for the first-season production.|$|E
50|$|By 1985, {{there were}} no steam {{locomotives}} still operational in Kenya. Therefore, rather than return one to operating condition as was done to three, twenty years later, the producers and their advisors decided to assemble a simulated steam powered train using a non operational steam locomotive that was, instead, pushed from behind by an available diesel locomotive. The diesel was coupled directly behind the steam locomotive and disguised as a box car. Due to mechanical problems, this covering had to be disassembled and reassembled to effect repairs during filming. The steam locomotive burned rubber tires in its firebox for <b>smoke</b> <b>effect,</b> and liquid oxygen {{was used as an}} oxidizer to give the appearance of steam escaping from the cylinders of the originally coal-fired locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The German {{performance}} featured Jamie-Lee {{performing on}} stage in a blue Japanese Decora Kei style outfit with four backing vocalists. The staging presentation included tree props with green lasers, transparent projection screens that displayed more trees and a <b>smoke</b> <b>effect</b> that covered the stage floor. The stage colours were blue, purple and green with the LED screens displaying a rising full moon. The four backing vocalists that joined Jamie-Lee on stage were Anne Leyne, Tina Frank, Ray Lozano and Helen Kaiser. Germany placed twenty-sixth (last) in the final, scoring 11 points: 10 points from the televoting and 1 point from the juries. Germany became the first country since Malta in 1971 and 1972 to finish last in the final in two consecutive years.|$|E

These hybrid guns feature an electrically powered, full blowback system and operate on a [...] "round-per-shell" [...] basis such that for every pellet fired, a shell casing is ejected and the cap is fired providing a realistic sound and <b>smoke</b> <b>effect.</b> Since its debut, the only hybrid guns seen on the market are TOP M4A1, as well as M1 Garand, Kar98, and other rifle models. These guns are the least common type of gun on the market today and are generally used by collectors and re-enactors rather than skirmishers.|$|E

5000|$|Four Northern Ireland only idents were created. In one, which {{debuted in}} February 2002, the 2 clicks its fingers and creates the Giant's Causeway (the ident was edited before its first {{transmission}} after the tall {{height of the}} columns, the overuse of the [...] "shaky-cam" [...] effect, and the <b>smoke</b> <b>effect</b> were too evocative of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original version was broadcast in October 2014, when BBC Northern Ireland celebrated 90 years of coverage with special idents). In another, the 2 forms a camera from its 'beak' and takes {{a photograph of the}} large fish sculpture located {{on the banks of the}} Lagan at Donegall Quay, Belfast.
