40|$|The {{resistance}} of fibrous reinforced silver matrix composites to repeated make-break arc erosion {{has been investigated}} in this study. Three different types of <b>short</b> <b>fibers</b> were used as reinforcements, including graphite <b>short</b> <b>fibers,</b> Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibers,</b> and silicon carbide whiskers. The weight losses of eroded composites increase with fiber content, applied current, and test number due to the worse thermal conductivity of the composites and the higher remained temperatures on contact surfaces. The composites reinforced with Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibers</b> exhibit the best erosion {{resistance of}} all reinforcements in the study {{because of the small}} spacings between Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibers</b> and the strengthening of strong short-fiber skeletons.

50|$|In general {{there are}} two main systems of {{preparing}} fiber for yarn: the worsted system and the woollen system.

50|$|<b>Short</b> <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced}} thermoplastics have a {{broad range}} of applications due to fiber reinforcement properties. <b>Short</b> <b>fiber</b> thermoplastics are able to withstand up to 30,000 psi of applied tensile load and have an elastic modulus on the order of 2 x 106 psi. They are ideal for applications for which toughness is of critical importance, high volume production is involved, and long shelf life and scrap recycling are important issues. With all of these performance capabilities, one of the greatest advantages to using <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced thermoplastics is their ease of processing and reprocessability.Ease of processing has been the key factor to the widespread use of <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced thermoplastics. Effective processing techniques and the ability to recycle scrap offer significant cost reductions that compare to those of thermoset compounds and metals. Because of this, <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced thermoplastics are desired in the electrical and electronic, automotive, oilfield, chemical process, and defense industries. Although <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> thermoplastics have progressed considerably over the years and have a secured spot in a colossally-sized market, further refinement of compounding and process technology along with improvements in part design could allow the performance window of these materials to widen significantly, allowing them to be used for more applications in the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The tensile {{properties}} of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composites, which were reinforced with <b>short</b> <b>fibers,</b> such as <b>short</b> carbon <b>fiber</b> (SCF), <b>short</b> glass <b>fiber</b> (SGF), or filled with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTEF), expanded graphite and nano material TiO 2 were examined and studied. The weight content of <b>short</b> <b>fibers,</b> PTFE and expanded graphite was varied from 0 - 15 %, and of TiO 2 was varied from 0 - 8 %. The results showed, with increasing {{of the weight}} content of <b>short</b> <b>fibers,</b> the tensile performance (tensile strength and modulus) of PEEK composites was increased rapidly. If the weight percent of <b>short</b> <b>fibers</b> was more than 10 %, this increasing tendency became slowly. With the increasing of PTFE content, the tensile strength was increased {{at first and then}} decreased rapidly. However, the tensile modulus kept constant during the change of PTFE content. The influence of expanded graphite and nano particles TiO 2 on mechanical properties of PEEK composites was also be studied here. Meanwhile, the reasons of different influence of these fillers were analyzed during microstructure changes of PEEK composites with SEM photographs.

50|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced composites depend critically on the fiber length distribution (FLD) and the fiber orientation distribution (FOD). In particular, {{the strength of}} <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced composites increases {{with the increase of}} the mean fiber length and with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle (angle between the fiber axis and the loading direction).The elastic modulus (E) of misaligned <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced polymer composites depends on the distributions of fiber lengths and orientations within the composite structure. In general, the composite elastic modulus increases with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle and with the increase of the fiber orientation coefficient; and the elastic modulus increases with the increase of mean fiber length when the mean fiber length is small. When the mean fiber length is large, it has nearly no influence on the elastic modulus of <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced composites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Short</b> <b>fiber</b> {{thermoplastics}} can be modelled as {{a matrix}} with fiber inclusions. According to the inclusion model, the stress within {{the material is}} proportional to the product of inclusion volume fraction and the stress within a single inclusion.

Using Mean Field Theory and the Mori-Tanaka model, the stresses within a <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> thermoplastic can be modelled computationally.Assuming the matrix is a newtonian material, the creep from an applied shear stress can be approximated from equilibrium thermodynamics.

A higher aspect ratio will result in lower values of strain at failure and toughness, due to angular particles inducing crack formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Short</b> <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced}} composites {{are used}} increasingly as a structural material {{because they provide}} superior mechanical properties and can be easily produced by the rapid, low-cost injection molding process, by extrusion and with spray-up technique. An important issue for <b>short</b> <b>fiber</b> thermoplastic composites is void formation and growth during production processes. It {{has been shown that}} voids tend to nucleate at fiber ends, and their content depends on processing conditions, fiber concentration, and fiber length. For example, in an injection molding process bubble growth is suppressed by cooling the material under pressure. Density measurements confirm a much lower void content (-1%) in the injection-molded samples in comparison with the extrudates. Another factor playing an important role in void formation is the cooling rate. While the melt is cooled external surface layers solidify first. These layers restrain the contraction of material within the melt. This leads to internal voiding. As a result, slower cooling rates decrease void content in the composite. Finally, {{it is interesting to note}} that in an extruded structure, longer fibers result in higher void contents. This unexpected behaviour is due to the overcoming of other factors like viscosity, extrusion pressure and shear rate, which make the analysis on this phenomenon very complicated.|$|E

40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>short</b> <b>fibers</b> has been experimentally observed {{to slow the}} stress relaxation of viscoelastic polymers, producing {{a change in the}} relaxation time constant. Our recent study attributed this effect of fibers on stress relaxation behavior to the interfacial shear stress transfer at the fiber-matrix interface.

In our previous study, we developed an analytical model for the effect of fully aligned <b>short</b> <b>fibers,</b> and the model predictions were successfully compared to finite element simulations. However, in most industrial applications of short-fiber composites, fibers are not aligned, and hence it is necessary to examine the time dependence of viscoelastic polymers containing randomly oriented <b>short</b> <b>fibers.</b> In this study, we propose an analytical model to predict the stress relaxation behavior of short-fiber composites where the fibers are randomly oriented. The model predictions were compared to results obtained from Monte Carlo finite element simulations, and good agreement between the two was observed. The analytical model provides an excellent tool to accurately predict the stress relaxation behavior of randomly oriented short-fiber composites...|$|R
