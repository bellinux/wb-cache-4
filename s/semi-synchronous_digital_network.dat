40|$|What {{constitutes}} an affect cycle in <b>digital</b> <b>networks?</b> How is it enacted {{and what are}} the conse- quences for individuals, for digital data and for the society that comprises both? Further, {{what is the relationship between}} affect and emotion, and what is their relationship with <b>digital</b> <b>networks?</b> Is it possible for an affect cycle to be established between people and <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> between peo- ple via <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> and between <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> themselves? By examining recent affect theo- ry in combination with Simondon&# 039;s theories of technical evolution and other theories of interaction and knowledge, I will define the nature of affect as it emerges through the cycle of interaction be- tween people and <b>digital</b> <b>networks.</b> I trace these cycles through and between the overdetermined, underexamined sites of interaction across <b>digital</b> <b>networks</b> in order to identify who and what are participating in the capture and escape of affect. I also show how this is facilitated and what is changed during, and as a result of, these affective interactions. Using a deep understanding of the technical workings of <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> combined with receptiveness to the affective potential of emotional agency in our digital world, I situate human affective practice in the uneasy environment of algorithmic <b>digital</b> corporate <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a software package for the purpose of analyzing <b>digital</b> <b>networks.</b> The software package consists of two graphic user interfaces, one for the signal flow graph schematic drawing, and one for the analysis of <b>digital</b> <b>network.</b> Both are written in the WATFOR- 77 programming language and by using the VGAWAT graphics library. The first graphic user interface software is to draw the signal flow graph of a 1 -D, 2 -D, or 3 -D <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> using adders, delays, and multipliers. It can extract the graphical representation of a <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> with error checking capability into a netlist for analysis purpose. The netlist is formatted in the simplified matrix compute the frequency response, group delay and slope of magnitude response, first-order coefficient sensitivity, noise, and impulse response of a 1 -D, 2 -D, or 3 -D <b>digital</b> <b>network.</b> Results are plotted in 2 -D graphs for 1 -D <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> and in 3 -D graphs for 2 -D and 3 -D <b>digital</b> <b>networks.</b> Examples of 1 -D, 2 -D and 3 -D <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> are given in this thesis.
