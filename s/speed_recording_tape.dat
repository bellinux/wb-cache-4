40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which allows the}} elimitation of eye blinks and other artifacts from the evoked potentials averaged from tape-stored EEG data. The method includes the reading at faster <b>speed</b> of the <b>recorded</b> <b>tape</b> in reverse (with respect to the initial record) into comparator and gate functions which write on a separate track a step function-during and before baseline shifts. The method consistently eliminates the inclusion of tape sections with spurious baseline shifts in the multichannel EEG samples subsequently averaged. © 1974.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this {{discussion}} to point out certain of the approaches and problems that inhere in the study of that form of nervous activity giving rise to "brain waves, " especially as seen from the comparative point of view. Brain waves will be loosely considered as any fluctuating electrical potentials ascribable to the brain or to the highest ganglia of the central nervous system in the absence of apparent external stimulation. It is considered undesiralble for the present purpose to attempt an artificial separation of one portion of the frequency spectrum from others by restricting the term ta those frequencies that appear as waves instead of spikes at a certain <b>speed</b> of the <b>recording</b> <b>tape.</b> It is not intended to present the results of a finished investigation, but simply to call attention to some significant problems raised by our present knowledge of brain waves in lower animals, supplemented by some new records, and to certain bearings which this knowledge has upon existing interpretations o...|$|R

5000|$|GRT Records was {{established}} by parent company General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> in 1969, and existed until 1979, when General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> went bankrupt. [...] Artists who released material on GRT Records in the United States included The Mojo Men, Sam Taylor, Lighthouse, Bobby Jameson, Edwards Hand, Terry Bush, Ronnie Hawkins, Colosseum, Mainline, Minnie Riperton, Flower Travellin' Band, Rastus, String Driven Thing, Lotti Golden, Van der Graaf Generator and Steve Hackett. [...] Contrary to original expectations, the label was not {{a major component of}} the operations of parent General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape.</b> Instead of its record releases being referenced to the GRT label, as originally announced, General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> referred to its Chess/Janus record operations. [...] In contrast, the Canadian subsidiary of General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape,</b> also known as GRT Records, became a major source of original releases by Canadian artists.|$|R

5000|$|General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> later grew {{to acquire}} major labels {{in its own}} right, such as Chess Records and Janus Records, and also {{released}} music under its own label, GRT Records. Its acquisition of Chess Records occurred in 1969, when the company paid Leonard Chess and Phil Chess $6.5 million and 20,000 shares of General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> stock {{for all of the}} shares of Chess Records. [...] Also in 1969, the company established a Canadian subsidiary, GRT Records, which became a major label in Canada during the 1970s. [...] The company in 1969 also established a joint venture with Pye Records, based in England, to form Janus Records in the United States. In 1972, General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> purchased Pye Records' interest in Janus Records and by 1976 reorganized its record production business around Janus Records. At the time, Janus Records proved to be particularly profitable for General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape,</b> due to Al Stewart's [...] "Year of the Cat" [...] achieving gold record status. [...] Earlier, in 1974, General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> had publicly denied rumours that it was in negotiations to merge with ABC Records. At the time, Bayley insisted that the product lines of General <b>Recorded</b> <b>Tape</b> had strengthened through licensing arrangements with Private Stock Records, which was owned by EMI Records and former executives of Bell Records.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether speed listening practice could improve comprehension of pitch-altered rapid speech, 66 high school students blind since at least age 6 were divided into experimental (E) and control (C) groups, matched {{on the basis of}} age (range 15 to 19 years), 10 (range 85 to 130), and pretest comprehension of material presented at normal rates. Using the pitch altering method of <b>speeding</b> up <b>tape</b> <b>recorded</b> material, training was given the E-group at 275 and 300 words loer minute (wpm) while the C-group received similar training at the standard 175 wpm level. Subjects were administered two training sessions per day of three trials of taped material (about 875 words each) followed by 10 five-foil multiple choice questions after each trial with a maximum number of 14 sessions. The E-group did significantly better than the C-group on the comprehension posttest administered at 300 wpm (p. 001). While a clear cut training effect was obtained, the degree of improvement due to this training (9. 47) was not large. (Author...|$|R
