50|$|An {{atmospheric}} window {{is a dynamic}} property of the atmosphere, while the <b>spectral</b> <b>window</b> is a static characteristic of the electromagnetic radiative absorption spectra of many greenhouse gases, including water vapour. The {{atmospheric window}} tells what actually happens in the atmosphere, while the <b>spectral</b> <b>window</b> tells {{of one of the}} several abstract factors that potentially contribute to the actual concrete happenings in the atmosphere. Window radiation is radiation that actually passes through the atmospheric window. Non-window radiation is radiation that actually does not pass through the atmospheric window. Window wavelength radiation is radiation that, judging only from its wavelength, potentially might or might not, but is likely to pass through the atmospheric window. Non-window wavelength radiation is radiation that, judging only from its wavelength, is unlikely to pass through the atmospheric window. The difference between window radiation and window wavelength radiation is that window radiation is an actual component of the radiation, determined by the full dynamics of the atmosphere, taking in all determining factors, while window wavelength radiation is merely theoretically potential, defined only by one factor, the wavelength.|$|E

KIM, C. ALLEMAND AND T. W. EAGAR ABSTRACT. An experimental study was carried out to map the light emissions from a gas tungsten arc using 24 combi-nations of weld parameters. Data were collected with a computer-interfaced double monochromatic imaging system which has a rejection ratio of 1 . The intensity scale was calibrated throughout the wavelength range from 4880 A to 7300 A, using a spectral radiance stan-dard lamp which is traceable to NBS standards. Lines were identified by ele-ment and wavelength with 0. 65 A wave-length resolution. The effect of intensity calibration was found to be very important in terms of comparing spectral maps and intensities. The emissions were found to be dramat-ically different with different shielding gases, welding current and base metals. <b>Spectral</b> <b>windows,</b> where the {{external sensors}} will have the least disturbance from welding arc emission, were also determined. An improved image of the weld pool can be obtained by operating within these <b>spectral</b> <b>windows.</b> Two-dimensional distributions of major ele-ments in an arc plasma are also present-ed, and the anode spot on the molten weld surface was observed...|$|R

50|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{can be used}} as multifunctional biological transporters and near-infrared {{agents for}} selective cancer cell destruction. Biological systems are known to be highly transparent to 700- to 1,100-nm near-infrared (NIR) light. Researchers showed that the strong optical absorbance of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in this special <b>spectral</b> <b>window,</b> an intrinsic property of SWNTs, can be used for optical stimulation of nanotubes inside living cells to afford multifunctional nanotube biological transporters. They used oligonucleotides transported inside living Hela cells by nanotubes. The oligonucleotides translocated into the cell nucleus upon endosomal rupture triggered by NIR laser pulses. Continuous NIR radiation caused cell death because of excessive local heating of SWNT in vitro. Selective cancer cell destruction was achieved by functionalization of SWNT with a folate moiety, selective internalization of SWNTs inside cells labeled with folate receptor tumor markers, and NIR-triggered cell death, without harming receptor-free normal cells. Thus, the transporting capabilities of carbon nanotubes combined with suitable functionalization chemistry and their intrinsic optical properties can lead to new classes of novel nanomaterials for drug delivery and cancer therapy.|$|E

40|$|We present a modified {{retrieval}} {{strategy for}} solar absorption spectra {{recorded by the}} Karlsruhe Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, which is operational within the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). In typical TCCON stations, the 3800 – 11   000 cm − 1 spectral region is measured on a single extended Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) detector. The Karlsruhe setup instead splits the spectrum across an Indium Antimonide (InSb) and InGaAs detector {{through the use of}} a dichroic beam splitter. This permits measurements further into the mid-infrared (MIR) that are of scientific interest, but are not considered TCCON measurements. This optical setup induces, however, larger variations in the continuum level of the solar spectra than the typical TCCON setup. Here we investigate the appropriate treatment of continuum-level variations in the retrieval strategy using the spectra recorded in Karlsruhe. The broad <b>spectral</b> <b>windows</b> used by TCCON require special attention with respect to residual curvature in the spectral fits. To accommodate the unique setup of Karlsruhe, higher-order discrete Legendre polynomial basis functions have been enabled in the TCCON retrieval code to fit the continuum.
