5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially <b>self-induced,</b> forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E
5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react {{with a blanket}} of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through <b>self-induced</b> fission events.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of <b>self-induced</b> abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor many {{chemical}} and industrial processes, {{the understanding of}} mixing, self-induction and flow structure in a stirred tank is very important. In this work, we simulated numerically, using the Fluent software, the phenomena taking place in a stirred tank equipped with a <b>self-inducing</b> turbine, the Pitched Blade Turbine Downflow (PBTD). To refine our study, we studied the cases of two different blade inclinations, i. e., PBTD 45 degrees and PBTD 60 degrees. The same rotational speed of the blades was considered for each simulation, namely N = 480 rpm. A numerical description of the flow structure generated by the <b>self-inducing</b> turbine is given. The results were compared with experimental data available in the literature. The gas induction rate, the power number and the power provided by the turbine are in good agreement with these experimental studies. Finally the last stage of this work was devoted to a comparative study of each turbine performance. The CFD results given by our work show that the PBTD 60 degrees is more efficient than the PBTD 45 degrees. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>self-inducing</b> {{turbines}} {{are among}} mobile agitations which present {{a very interesting}} potential in terms {{of energy in the}} field of wastewater treatment by activated sludge. Often, the reactions involved in this type of contactors are limited by the gas-liquid mass transfer. The objective of this experimental work is the determination of the oxygenation capacity of a new <b>self-inducing</b> turbine, a holed hollow cylinder, having a thickness of W = 1. 5 cm and a diameter D = 9 cm, with 6 holes having a diameter of 0. 5 cm each. During this experimental work, we evaluated the volumetric mass transfer coefficient k(L) a, which {{is directly related to the}} oxygenation capacity (OC) and this for various rotational speeds of the turbine as well as for various submergences. We finally succeeded to find an empirical correlation for our new self inducing turbine. The most common method used to estimate experimentally the coefficient k(L) a is the technique of dynamic oxygenation and deoxygenation. We finally concluded that this new turbine had a satisfying aeration capacity, which increases with the increase of the rotational speed, and decreases when increasing the submergence of the impeller.
