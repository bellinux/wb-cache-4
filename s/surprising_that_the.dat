5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cure for {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E
25|$|In the 1961–1962 season, the Duleep Trophy {{was inaugurated}} as a zonal competition. It {{was named after}} Ranji's nephew, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji (1905–59). With Bombay in its catchment, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> West Zone won six of the first nine titles.|$|E
50|$|It is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> as <b>the</b> country {{developed}} and as towns became cities, churches and schools which were {{once at the}} fringes of towns, are now engulfed {{in the midst of}} city centres.|$|R
500|$|All <b>the</b> more <b>surprising</b> given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vindolanda tablets show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Roman {{nickname}} {{for the north}} British locals was Brittunculi meaning [...] "nasty little Britons".|$|R
5000|$|It is {{therefore}} not <b>surprising</b> <b>that,</b> at <b>the</b> present time (2009), {{the validity of the}} Uralic-Yukaghir family is controversial. <b>The</b> questions <b>that</b> need to be answered to make a definitive determination in favor of it or against it are: ...|$|R
25|$|Given his record, {{it is not}} <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other Party {{leaders were}} {{suspicious}} of Beria's motives. Khrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov, but he was initially unable to challenge them. His opportunity came in June 1953 when a spontaneous uprising against the East German Communist regime broke out in East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|N-oxides {{are prone}} to undergo the Polonovski {{rearrangement}} when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. It is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results.|$|E
25|$|The {{topographic}} location {{marks the}} Glauberg {{as a long-term}} focus of human activity. It combines access to fertile arable land and water with an easily defensible site and a strategic location along several natural traffic routes. Thus, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hill {{was the site of}} human occupation long before and long after its Celtic phase, well into the medieval period.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not then}} perhaps too <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> Autumn International window the Warriors lost both matches against the Scarlets and the Ospreys. The run of defeats {{continued}} with a one-point loss to Munster {{at the start}} of December.|$|R
60|$|LIGHT meals procure light slumbers; and {{therefore}} it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that,</b> considering <b>the</b> fare which Caleb's conscience, or his necessity, assuming, as will sometimes happen, that disguise, had assigned to the guests of Wolf's Crag, their slumbers should have been short.|$|R
50|$|Before their {{eventual}} {{inheritance of}} these lands in Wiltshire, {{it is not}} <b>surprising</b> then <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ernle family concentrated their activities on Sussex, while maintaining a presence in both counties.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the results}} of the trial, it is perhaps not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project was {{scrapped}} almost immediately over safety concerns. However, it has since been suggested that the entire project was a hoax devised as part of Operation Fortitude, to convince the Germans that plans were being developed to attack the heavily fortified defences surrounding the Pas-de-Calais rather than the less-defended Normandy coastline.|$|E
25|$|However, certain EU {{member states}} admit to having lacking quality control in {{occupational}} safety services, to {{situations in which}} risk analysis takes place without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of certain EU OSH directives. Based on this, it is hardly <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from 2.6% to 3.8% of GNP between the EU member states.|$|E
25|$|Schloss Trautenfels and {{the picturesque}} hamlet of Pürgg have {{attracted}} numerous tourists and excursionists. In addition, {{the area is}} popular for mountain climbers, who climb the Grimming, the Totes Gebirge mountains, and in the southern Niedere Tauern. In Wörschachwald is a small winter sports area and the Spechtensee lake, a popular destination. Therefore, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> municipality has numerous inns and hostels.|$|E

25|$|Bearing in mind Fillingham's {{expertise}} in these matters, it is <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> while <b>the</b> enclosure map (by William Attenburrow of East Stoke, covering 769 acres or about 300 hectares), is dated 1792, the Award itself was not signed until {{as late as}} 27 June 1795.|$|R
25|$|Control of {{the process}} of gene {{transcription}} affects patterns of gene expression and, thereby, allows a cell to adapt to a changing environment, perform specialized roles within an organism, and maintain basic metabolic processes necessary for survival. Therefore, it is hardly <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In Escherichia coli bacteria, more than 100 transcription factors have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.|$|E
25|$|All tracklaying had {{to start}} {{from one end of}} the line, to ensure the rack was {{correctly}} aligned; so although the first locomotives were delivered in July 1895 very little track was laid until August, when the two large viaducts between Llanberis and Waterfall were completed. Progress up the mountain was then quite rapid, with the locomotives being used to move materials as required. Considering the exposed location and possible effects of bad weather, it is <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first train reached the summit in January 1896. As the fencing and signals were not then ready, the opening was set for Easter.|$|E
25|$|At the War Council (5August) Kitchener and Lt.-General Sir Douglas Haig {{argued that}} the BEF should be {{deployed}} at Amiens, where it could deliver a vigorous counterattack once the route of German advance was known. Kitchener {{argued that the}} deployment of the BEF in Belgium would result in having to retreat and abandon much of its supplies almost immediately, as the Belgian Army {{would be unable to}} hold its ground against the Germans; Kitchener was proved right, but given the belief in fortresses common at the time, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> War Council disagreed with him.|$|E

25|$|A {{beneficial}} {{side effect}} of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, {{it was thought that}} tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissue, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. In contrast tamoxifen appears to be associated with bone loss in premenopausal women who continue to menstruate after adjuvant chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{correlations}} can be {{made between}} the number of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is likely that cycad diversity was affected more by the great angiosperm radiation in the mid-Cretaceous than by extinctions. Very slow cambial growth was first used to define cycads, and because of this characteristic the group could not compete with the rapidly growing, relatively short-lived angiosperms, which now number over 250,000species, compared to the 1080remaining gymnosperms. It is <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cycads are still extant, having been faced with extreme competition and five major extinctions. The ability of cycads to survive in relatively dry environments where plant diversity is generally lower, may explain their long persistence and longevity.|$|E
25|$|Knowing her {{background}} in anthropology and various Native American organizations, {{it is not}} <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most prevalent image in her poetry are bones. In her poetry, the image of battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self. The bones of dead Indians almost form {{the words on the}} page and are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry. Stemming from her work with anthropology, she writes about bones auctioned, objects sold, and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display. Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry {{and at the same time}} are given new life and the chance to speak out in her poetry.|$|E
50|$|Accordingly, {{the figurative}} palanquins of the Ga are very rarely shown {{in public and}} {{especially}} for foreigners they are difficult to see. Therefore, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> palanquins look similar to the figurative coffins which are well known to the western art market, the figurative palanquins remained completely unknown until recently.|$|R
40|$|WITH the contractions IPM and ICM {{becoming}} more and more widely used in public health and crop protection, it was perhaps not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> Brighton Conference a complete session was devoted to them.

50|$|The name 'moroka' means 'rain maker' in Setswana and the {{township}} was probably named after Chief Moroka of Barolong boo-Seleka {{who became the}} president of the ANC in 1940s. It is hardly <b>surprising</b> therefore <b>that</b> <b>the</b> club was renamed the 'rain bird'.|$|R
25|$|Both sFlt-1 and sEng are {{upregulated}} in all {{pregnant women}} to some extent, supporting {{the idea that}} hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of maternal immune tolerance for a foreign placenta, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maternal immune system might respond more negatively {{to the arrival of}} some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled spiral arteries in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.|$|E
25|$|Further {{indications}} of the legend's connection with West Yorkshire (and particularly Calderdale) are {{noted in the}} fact that there are pubs called the Robin Hood in both nearby Brighouse and at Cragg Vale; higher up in the Pennines beyond Halifax, where Robin Hood Rocks can also be found. Robin Hood Hill is near Outwood, West Yorkshire, not far from Lofthouse. There is a village in West Yorkshire called Robin Hood, on the A61 between Leeds and Wakefield and close to Rothwell and Lofthouse. Considering these references to Robin Hood, it is not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people of both South and West Yorkshire lay some claim to Robin Hood, who, if he existed, could easily have roamed between Nottingham, Lincoln, Doncaster and right into West Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} {{originally}} also the smoking room, {{so it is}} <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original painted ceiling has survived and could be fully restored. The ceiling is heavily painted, gilded and sculptured in an eclectic manner, taking its general design from classical sources. The background is cream, but there is much use of Pompeiian red, an earth colour which gained popularity in Victorian England after the renewed excavations by Giuseppe Fiorelli in 1860. Small panels feature clearly painted classical motifs and portraits with distressed backgrounds, to look like pieces of ancient frescoes. Four medallions show the named poets Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer and Tennyson, all admired by the Romantics. All the spaces on the cream background are filled with illustrations imitating the original maiolica style, featuring stylised goats and fauns, cornucopia, grapes, birds and flowers, but also angels and putti in the centre. The decoration around the edge has a Green Man.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institution of Washington {{reported}} <b>the</b> <b>surprising</b> finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rocks {{from the}} Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System.|$|R
5000|$|The sixpence was {{the only}} pre-decimal Australian coin which never had the design on its reverse altered. <b>That</b> is {{especially}} <b>surprising</b> given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coat of arms depicted was obsolete for almost all of that time, having been superseded by the current one in 1912.|$|R
