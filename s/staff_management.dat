40|$|AbstractThis paper {{establishes}} a behavioral game model between coalmine <b>management</b> <b>staff</b> and coalmine enterprise, exploring {{the issue of}} coalmine <b>management</b> <b>staff's</b> psychological contract violation. On the basis of researching into coalmine <b>management</b> <b>staff's</b> return judgment mechanism of behavior choice, the authors propose the hypotheses of the game model, introducing some influencing factors such as organizational justice degree k, organizational support degree s, mutual trust coefficient r, coefficient of the perception of psychological contract violation c, return share α required by coalmine <b>management</b> <b>staff,</b> return share β that coalmine enterprise expects and doubled production coefficient t, etc. Based on this, the profit matrix of two-side game theory is established and the situations of coalmine <b>management</b> <b>staff's</b> profit under different combination strategies are analyzed, and the condition of <b>management</b> <b>staff's</b> no violation of psychological contract is concluded. From the perspective of influencing factors and correlated relations, the corresponding regulation strategies of coalmine <b>management</b> <b>staff's</b> psychological contract violation are proposed {{in order to help}} coalmine enterprises to reduce the perception of <b>management</b> <b>staff's</b> psychological contract violation and promote psychological contract fulfillment, better ensuring safety production and sustainable development of coalmine enterprises...|$|R
2500|$|Constitutionally {{the monarch}} is {{entitled}} to compensation from the annual state budget {{for the maintenance of}} his family and household administration, and freely distributes these funds in accordance with the laws. According to the Royal Household, [...] "he purpose of these resources is to ensure that the Head of State may carry out his tasks with the independence which is inherent to his constitutional functions, as well as with due effectiveness and dignity". The annual budget pays the remunerations for senior management <b>staff,</b> <b>management</b> staff and career civil servants, other minor staffing positions, and for general office expenses. The Head of Household, Secretary General, and other management staff salaries must be comparable to other administration ministers within the government, though in no way do they form part of the government or administration. As such, the management staff experience increases, decreases, or freezes to their pay in accordance with the fluctuations of government minister salaries. Additionally, the annual budget pays for the maintenance and expenses of senior {{members of the royal family}} who undertake royal duties; which includes grocery, clothing, and toiletries allotments. [...] The budget approved by the Cortes for 2010 was just under 7.4 million euros, a budget only slightly larger than that spent on the Luxembourg monarchy. In 2011 the king addressed the perennial critique of the monarchy; that of how the annual budget awarded to the monarchy and royal household is spent. The report revealed that only 9.6% of the 8.4 million euros budgeted that year for the monarchy are paid to royal family members as 'salaries and representative duties', with the difference marked for royal household operational expenses such as household staff salaries, various insurance premiums and liabilities, services, [...] and 'supplementals' such as overhead. In 2012, the monarchy volunteered an additional 7% pay-cut in solidarity with government officials.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} in the international collaborative strategy area has {{paid little attention to}} the matter of alliance staffing, limiting insight into conditions framing the adoption of alternative <b>management</b> <b>staffing</b> approaches.

We suggest that risk perceptions are fundamental to parent firms' choice of staffing objectives, but are stimulated and tempered by other influences. Theory development on ISA <b>management</b> <b>staffing</b> is enhanced through the provision of a substantive, testable model along with a set of research propositions. The complex analytic focus of this study exposes important directions for research on the subject and offers guidelines for management practice. Furthermore, our typology of managerial decision perspectives provides a new tool for studying ISA staffing issues.
