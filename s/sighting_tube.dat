He performed optical experiments with camera obscura just decades after Ibn al-Haytham {{was the first}} to do so. He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical <b>sighting</b> <b>tube,</b> which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the pole star (which had shifted over centuries of time). Shen Kuo was also known for hydraulic clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank clepsydra which had more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.|$|E
5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved <b>sighting</b> <b>tube.</b> There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the head}} {{official}} for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo {{was an avid}} scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical <b>sighting</b> <b>tube,</b> Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely. This came about due {{to the position of}} the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at −350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.|$|E

25|$|The {{armillary sphere}} was reintroduced to Western Europe via Al-Andalus {{in the late}} 10th century with the efforts of Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later Pope Sylvester II (r. 999–1003). Pope Sylvester II applied the use of <b>sighting</b> <b>tubes</b> with his armillary sphere in order to fix the {{position}} of the pole star and record measurements for the tropics and equator.|$|R
5|$|Alongside his {{colleague}} Wei Pu, Shen planned {{to map the}} orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, <b>sighting</b> <b>tube,</b> and invented {{a new type of}} inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.|$|E
25|$|Richer {{wrote about}} another of Gerbert's last armillary spheres, which had {{sighting}} tubes {{fixed on the}} axis of the hollow sphere that could observe the constellations, the forms of which he hung on iron and copper wires. This armillary sphere was also described by Gerbert {{in a letter to}} his colleague Constantine. Gerbert instructed Constantine that, if doubtful of the position of the pole star, he should fix the <b>sighting</b> <b>tube</b> of the armillary sphere into position to view the star he suspected was it, and if the star did not move out of sight, it was thus the pole star. Furthermore, Gerbert instructed Constantine that the north pole could be measured with the upper and lower sighting tubes, the Arctic Circle through another tube, the Tropic of Cancer through another tube, the equator through another tube, and the Tropic of Capricorn through another tube.|$|E
25|$|True north, concept of: The Song Dynasty (9601279) {{official}} Shen Kuo (10311095), {{alongside his}} colleague Wei Pu, improved the orifice {{width of the}} <b>sighting</b> <b>tube</b> to make nightly accurate records of the paths of the moon, stars, and planets in the night sky, for a continuum of five years. By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; {{this was due to}} the precession of the Earth's rotational axis. When making the first known experiments with a magnetic compass, Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as magnetic declination, and wrote that the compass needle in fact pointed towards the magnetic north pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a critical step in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.|$|E
50|$|Wire reticles are {{the oldest}} type of reticles and are {{made out of}} metal wire or thread. They are mounted in an {{optically}} appropriate position in the telescopic <b>sight's</b> <b>tube.</b> Etched reticles are images of the desired reticle layout that are etched on an optic element. This optical element (lens) with the etched reticle is then mounted in the telescopic <b>sights</b> <b>tube</b> as an integrated part of the optics chain of the sight. When backlit through the ocular, a wire reticle will reflect incoming light and not present a fully opaque (black) reticle with high contrast. An etched reticle will stay fully opaque (black) if backlit. Etched reticles are considered by most {{to be a more}} refined solution and offer greater reticle layout flexibility. Because of this, some manufacturers can provide client-designed custom reticles on special order. In the more expensive and high-end contemporary telescopic sights, etched reticles dominate the market. In cheaper telescopic sights, wire reticles are still often mounted to avoid a rather specialized and costly production step.|$|R

50|$|The tool {{was first}} {{described}} by F. J. Cheshire in 1921. It was repopularized in the 1980s {{and is now}} mass-produced. Amateur astronomers in particular use them to collimate reflecting or refracting telescopes.Some modern models of Cheshire eyepieces in common use include extended <b>sight</b> <b>tubes</b> and are equipped with crosshairs. When inserted into a Newtonian telescope whose primary mirror is marked in its center, such aids allow the user to adjust the position and tilt of both the secondary and the primary mirror.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{developments}} {{were made}} after the Han Dynasty that improved {{the use of}} the armillary sphere. In 323 AD the Chinese astronomer Kong Ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired. The Chinese astronomer and mathematician Li Chunfeng (李淳風) of the Tang dynasty created one in 633 AD with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations, calling them 'nests' (chhung). He was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a <b>sighting</b> <b>tube</b> mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes. However, it was the Tang Chinese astronomer, mathematician, and monk Yi Xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere. Ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of Zhou Cong and Shu Yijian in 1050, as well as Shen Kuo's armillary sphere of the later 11th century, but after that point they were no longer employed on Chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the European Jesuits.|$|E
2500|$|In 723 AD, Yi Xing (一行) and {{government}} official Liang Ling-zan (梁令瓚) combined Zhang Heng's water powered celestial globe with an escapement device. With drums hit every quarter-hour and bells rung automatically every full hour, {{the device was}} also a striking clock. The famous clock tower that the Chinese polymath Su Song built by 1094 during the Song Dynasty would employ Yi Xing's escapement with waterwheel scoops filled by clepsydra drip, and powered a crowning armillary sphere, a central celestial globe, and mechanically operated manikins that would exit mechanically opened doors of the clock tower at specific times to ring bells and gongs to announce the time, or to hold plaques announcing special times of the day. There was also the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon, armillary sphere, clepsydra clock, and <b>sighting</b> <b>tube</b> fixed to observe the pole star indefinitely.

This arm was measured against a short vertical bar marked with altitude corrections. The system indicated only corrections, not the actual altitude. Two or more posts had to work in concert to use the system, using two measured angles and simple trigonometry to solve the altitude.|$|R
40|$|Gerbert of Aurillac was {{the most}} {{prominent}} personality of the tenth century: astronomer, organ builder and music theoretician, mathematician, philosopher, and finally pope {{with the name of}} Silvester II (999 - 1003). Gerbert introduced firstly the arabic numbers in Europe, invented an abacus for speeding the calculations and found a rational approximation for the equilateral triangle area, in the letter to Adelbold here discussed. Gerbert described a semi-sphere to Constantine of Fleury with built-in <b>sighting</b> <b>tubes,</b> used for astronomical observations. The procedure to identify the star nearest to the North celestial pole is very accurate and still in use in the XII century, when "Computatrix" was the name of Polaris. For didactical purposes the Polaris would have been precise enough and much less time consuming, but here Gerbert was clearly aligning a precise equatorial mount for a fixed instrument for accurate daytime observations. Through the <b>sighting</b> <b>tubes</b> it was possible to detect equinoxes and solstices by observing the Sun in the corresponding days.

In the second test campaign, the pyrometer was sighted into the top of the radiant syngas cooler through an unused soot blower lance. The pyrometer experienced no more problems with slag occlusions, and the readings were continuous and consistent. However, the pyrometer readings were 800 to 900 F lower than the gasifier thermocouple readings, which is consistent with computer simulations of the temperature distribution inside the radiant syngas cooler. In addition, the pyrometer readings were too sluggish to use for control purposes. Additional funds beyond what were available in this contract would be required to develop a solution that would allow the pyrometer to be used to measure the temperature inside the gasifier...|$|R

50|$|Noon sights {{obtain the}} observer's Latitude. It is {{impossible}} to determine longitude with an accuracy better than 10nm {{by means of a}} noon sight. A noon sight is called a Meridian Altitude. While it is very easy to determine the observer's latitude at noon without knowing the exact time, longitude cannot accurately be measured at noon. At noon the sun's change of altitude is very slow, so determining the exact time that the sun is at its zenith by direct observation is impossible, and therefore it {{is impossible to}} obtain an accurate longitude at the moment of Zenith. However, it is possible to determine the time of zenith for longitude with a useful accuracy by performing a mean time of observation when the sun is on its ascent and descent prior to and following its moment of Zenith. By taking a sextant reading within 15 to 30 minutes prior to local noon (zenith) and noting the time, then leaving the sextant set to the same angle and subsequently observing the moment in time at which the sun passes through the <b>sight</b> <b>tube</b> on its descent from Zenith between a half-hour and hour later, the two times can be averaged to obtain a longitude sufficiently accurate for navigation (within 2nm).|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} notable {{contributors}} {{to the field of}} Chinese science throughout the ages.

After observing the natural process of the inundation of silt and the find of marine fossils in the Taihang Mountains (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation, or geomorphology. He also adopted a theory of gradual climate change in regions over time, after observing petrified bamboo found underground at Yan'an, Shaanxi province. If not for Shen Kuo's writing, the architectural works of Yu Hao would be little known, along with the inventor of movable type printing, Bi Sheng (990-1051). Shen's contemporary Su Song (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of botany, zoology, mineralogy, and metallurgy, and had erected a large astronomical clocktower in Kaifeng city in 1088. To operate the crowning armillary sphere, his clocktower featured an escapement mechanism and the world's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting chain drive.|$|R
