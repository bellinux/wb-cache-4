5000|$|The term {{landslide}} {{refers to}} a variety of mass wasting events (geologic slope failures) that include slumps, slides, falls, and flows. The two major types of slides are rotational slides and translational slides. Rockslides are a type of translational event since the rock mass moves along a roughly planar surface with little rotation or backward tilting. Rock slides are the most dangerous form of mass-wasting because they incorporate a sudden, incredibly fast-paced release of bedrock along a uniform plane of weakness. These uniform weaknesses are key to identifying rock slides because unlike <b>slumps,</b> <b>flows,</b> or falls, the failed material moves in a fairly uniform direction over a layer of solid, pre-existing rock. Rock may break down while falling during rockslides.|$|R

30|$|Slump-flow and T 50 {{were used}} to measure the {{flowability}} and the rate of deformability of all mixes. The <b>slump</b> <b>flow</b> is based on the conventional slump test method and consists of using an inverted slump cone as per ASTM standards (ASTM C 192 – 07 2007). The inverted cone was filled with SCC but no rodding or vibration was carried out. The cone was then lifted vertically and the spread of the concrete pie was measured. The average of two perpendicular diameters of the concrete spread after a full stop is considered as the <b>slump</b> <b>flow</b> value. On the other hand, the rate of concrete deformability was assessed using the T 50 test. This simple test consists of measuring the time needed for the SCC to reach a 50  cm spread during the <b>slump</b> <b>flow</b> test. In general, a <b>slump</b> <b>flow</b> value between 500 and 750  mm and a value of T 50  <  7  s are considered acceptable for SCC design (EFNARC 2005).|$|E

The coincidence in distribution of areas of wave convergence, mass-movement and shore platforms suggests a genetic connection between these marine and subaerial process and response elements. Various types of mass-movement are involved in cliff-retreat, notably <b>slumps,</b> <b>flows,</b> debris slides and soil and rock falls.

The concrete was produced using ordinary Portland cement at a water-cement (W/C) ratio of 0. 38 by weight. CRT glass waste cullet was incorporated in river sand in proportions of 20 or 40 %. To suppress potential viscosity effects limestone powder was added at levels of 5, 10, or 15 % by weight.

40|$|Conventional single-point {{workability}} tests {{continue to}} be used for specification and quality control of concrete despite their inherent limitations.

Thirty numbers of concrete mixes without steel fibers and with steel fibers of specific dose have been considered during experiment.

40|$|The field area of {{interest}} is an intermontane basin lying 100 km northwest of Christchurch on the West Coast Road. Within this roughly triangular, tectonic depression lies a sequence of marine and non-marine sediments of late Cretaceous-Tertiary age. The sediments have been modified by glacial and post-glacial events to leave steep-sided valleys, flights of terraces and limestone hills. Landslides of all types (falls, slides, <b>slumps,</b> <b>flows,</b> complex movements and mass wasting) {{are found in the}} dense, heavily overconsolidated sands, silts and muds. The different types of landslides and their, distribution with respect to lithology and structure is discussed, as is the rates of degradation and their relative age. A select area around Broken River - Hogsback Stream is studied in detail and the stratigraphy, structure and geohydrology is presented. The sediments from the Enys Formation were sampled, tested for index and physical properties, and interpreted in terms of their significance·towards slope stability. A major slump of this area is back-analysed using parameters gained directly or inferred from the geotechnical testing. Several methods are used and a circular arc mode of failure is rejected in favour of a block slide bounded by passive and active wedges. Finally the landslide processes and factors that have been found operating in Castle Hill Basin are outlined and it is seen that the most important factors are those relating to the area's intrinsic climatical, geological and topographical nature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to examine the}} influence of mineral admixture on the rheological properties of fresh concrete mixtures. Rheological properties of fresh concrete mixtures were obtained in three ways, with well known methods <b>slump</b> test and <b>flow</b> table test and with yet fairly non-established coaxial cylindrical rheometer ConTec Viscometer 5. Rheometer is a better and modern way to detect such properties of fresh concrete. Recently the approach has become indispensable, due to growing demands for quality of cast concrete and for adequate design of self-compacting and highly-flowable concrete mixtures. <b>Slump</b> test and <b>flow</b> table test do not provide enough information about rheological properties for this kind of special concrete. We researched the impact of three mineral additives: micro silica, tuff and granulated blast furnace slag, as well as the impact of water-cement ratio, which is a key factor in concrete.

30|$|As for the {{significance}} of the parameters on the responses, for example for the slump flow; the order of influence of the test variables is: the dosage of HRWRA, w/b, and the binder content. The dosage of HRWRA had the greatest effect on the <b>slump</b> <b>flow.</b> The effect of binder content was insignificant to the response. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that flowability is driven by HRWRA dose and w/b rather than the binder content.

40|$|Continental-slope and shelf-edge {{morphology}} off Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula, is investigated using swath-bathymetric {{data and}} parametric sub-bottom profiler records, together with sediment cores. Marguerite Bay has a well-defined cross-shelf trough, and a relatively steep continental slope. The slope beyond the trough mouth is convex in longitudinal profile, whereas {{to the north}} and south it is concave and reaches a maximum of 12 degrees. There are no deep canyons cutting into the prograding outer shelf and slope. Instead, a series of gullies runs down the upper slope, reaching depths of > 200 m south of the trough mouth but < 120 m deep beyond the trough. The mid and lower slope appears to be relatively smooth and downslope sediment transfer is probably by small-scale slides, <b>slumps</b> and debris <b>flows.</b> The continental rise contains dendritic channels related to turbidity currents, and sediment drifts produced by southwest-flowing bottom currents from the fine-grained component of the turbidity currents. Elongate sedimentary bedforms indicate that a fast-flowing ice stream occupied the trough under full-glacial conditions, and transferred deforming subglacial till rapidly to the shelf edge. By contrast, {{on either side of the}} trough mouth, ice is inferred to have been slower-moving and probably cold-based, delivering little sediment to the upper slope. The steepness of the continental slope results in rapid downslope sediment transfer by debris <b>flows,</b> <b>slumps</b> and turbidity currents and accounts for the lack of a well-developed trough-mouth fan, which is typical of many lower-gradient glacier-influenced margins...|$|R
