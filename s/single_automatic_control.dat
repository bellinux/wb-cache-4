40|$|Abstract: The {{principle}} of drive closed-loop for tuning fork comb MEMS vibratory gyroscope is analyzed. The {{core of the}} closed-loop {{is to keep the}} vibration speed stable by adding driving force offset the damping force. The closed-loop with a <b>single</b> <b>Automatic</b> Gain <b>Control</b> (AGC) loop is chosen to maintain the vibration speed stable, and then the closed-loop with AGC is analyzed to obtain its transfer function. The transfer function simplifies the nonlinear AGC system to a linear system which is easy analyzed its parameters impacting the system. The values of two important parameters of AGC were chosen via simulation. The whole closed-loop system was simulated in SIMULINK. The circuit is built and tested in accordance with the theory of analysis and simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the stability of the amplitude of vibration speed is 90 ppm; and that of the frequency of vibration speed is 114 ppm...|$|R

30|$|Image {{acquisition}} {{was performed}} on a 256 -slice CT system (Brilliance iCT; Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). An unenhanced chest CT was acquired during inspiration. The routine dose acquisition was performed with a tube voltage of 100 kVp (body weight[*]<[*] 80  kg) or 120  kV (body weight[*]≥[*] 80  kg). The tube current-time product was 60 mAs at routine dose and subsequently decreased to 33, 24 and 15 mAs to achieve 45 %, 60 % and 75 % dose reduction, respectively. All four acquisitions were acquired consecutively in a <b>single</b> session. <b>Automatic</b> exposure <b>control</b> was off. Images were reconstructed at a slice thickness of 2 mm with FBP, hybrid IR (HIR; iDose level 4, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) and model-based IR (MIR; IMR level 2, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). Kernel filter C was used for both FBP and HIR. MIR is a more advanced reconstruction technique with different kernels; therefore, the vendor-recommended kernel filter Body Routine was used for MIR. The volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP) of each acquisition was recorded. The effective dose was calculated by multiplying the DLP with a conversion factor of 0.0144 (100 kVp) or 0.0145 (120 kVp) [19].|$|R
