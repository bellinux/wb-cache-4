5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle with a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury {{if she did not}} testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E

[...] Concerned about an injury to the football team's quarterback, LaPlante yelled out, [...] "Denard! Please, don't do that again! I'll be fired in 2 seconds!" [...] LaPlante recalled Robinson's reaction: [...] "He had that great big <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face." ...|$|E

500|$|The bronze {{sculpture}} sits on {{a circular}} base {{in the middle of}} the basin. The sculpture is officially known as Boy with a Turtle, as its figure is of a young boy, in the nude, riding a sea turtle. In 1986 the Worcester municipal parks and recreation department described the statue with the sentence, [...] "The boy holding the turtle, his hair flying, a sly <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, is charming and disarming." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaali {{is often}} shown {{standing}} {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest. This represents an episode where Kaali {{was out of control}} on the battlefield, such that she was about to destroy the entire universe. [...] Shiva pacified her by laying down under her foot, both to receive her blessing, but also to pacify and calm her. Shiva is sometimes shown with a blissful <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. She is typically shown with a garland of severed heads, often numbering fifty. This can symbolize the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet and therefore as the primordial sound of Aum from which all creation proceeds. The severed arms which make up her skirt represent her devotee's karma that she has taken on.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones were {{inducted}} into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2007. That October saw {{the release of a}} DVD set containing concert footage of the band: It's Alive 1974-1996 includes 118 songs from 33 performances over the span of the group's career. In February 2011 the group was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Drummers Tommy, Marky, and Richie attended the ceremony. Marky declared, [...] "This is amazing. I never expected this. I'm sure Johnny, Joey, and Dee Dee would never have expected this." [...] Richie noted that {{it was the first time}} ever that all three drummers were under the same roof, and mused that he couldn't [...] "help thinking that [...] is watching us right now with a little <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face behind his rose-colored glasses." ...|$|E

500|$|Greeley {{attended}} the convention {{as a substitute}} for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. [...] On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. [...] After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a broad <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, [...] "it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did".|$|E
500|$|Although Leyland was not {{a stylish}} batsman, he was effective. Cardus {{described}} him as [...] "a sturdy cricketer, not tall, but his sloping bottle-neck shoulders seemed to add inches {{to him and he}} had long arms of impressive thickness, veined with strength at the wrist; also he was broad in the beam, with a rubicund <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> cheerful open countenance." [...] He was a good driver of the ball, with a high backlift, and moved quickly and economically to reach the pitch of the ball. Cardus thought that his style of batting was representative of his character: [...] "He put his nature into every stroke, {{and as soon as he}} had 'got bowling where he wanted it,' he didn't merely hit or drive it—he walloped it." [...] At times, Leyland's desire to score quickly brought about his dismissal. However, when necessary, he defended strongly and used his pads as a second line of defence if he missed the ball with his bat.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
60|$|Tom awoke refreshed, ate {{his breakfast}} with relish, took his {{medicine}} without grumbling, <b>smiled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> comrade, and squeezed {{his hand as}} he went to sleep again with a heavy sigh of comfort.

60|$|Miss Spence {{was smiling}} too: her Gioconda smile, {{he had once}} called it, {{in a moment of}} half-ironical flattery.

She <b>smiled</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> silence while Mr. Hutton shook hands; that was part of the Gioconda business.|$|R

500|$|McCain did join Bush for a {{few days}} of {{appearances}} in late October, emphasizing, {{in the wake of the}} October 12 USS Cole bombing, his belief that Bush was a better choice than Democratic Party nominee Al Gore to deal with international security threats. [...] Bush aide Scott McClellan later described the joint appearances by saying, [...] "The tension was palpable. The two were cordial, but McCain would get that forced <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face whenever they were together." [...] McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates, and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands. [...] McCain would state that he voted for Bush on November 7 (although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not). [...] When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute, McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship, though he did appear on CBS' Face the Nation to say, [...] "I think the nation is growing a little weary of this. [...] We're not in a constitutional crisis, but the American people are growing weary, and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate, to say the least." [...] Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001, McCain's battles with him would resume, with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000.|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was {{very happy with the}} change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|The veteran West Indies cricket writer Tony Becca {{wrote in}} the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "Mendis bowls everything. With a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face as he caresses the ball before {{delivering}} it, he bowls the offbreak, he bowls the legbreak, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a different trajectory and at a different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerises, or bamboozles, batsmen.|$|E

2500|$|On December 10, 2005, {{nine days}} after his 65th birthday, Pryor {{suffered}} a heart attack in Los Angeles. He was taken to a local hospital after his wife Jennifer's attempts to resuscitate him failed. Pryor was pronounced dead at 7:58am PST. He was 65 years old. His widow Jennifer quoted as saying, [...] "At the end, there was a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face." [...] He was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family. Forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter believes Pryor's fatal heart attack was caused by coronary artery disease that was at least partially brought about by years of tobacco smoking.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 June 2008, Cannavaro {{was injured}} during Italy's first {{training}} session for Euro 2008. He sustained a knock following a tackle by fellow defender Giorgio Chiellini and was carried {{off the field}} on a stretcher. Italian squad doctor Paolo Zeppilli said, [...] "We have to do tests {{but it does not}} look like a minor injury." [...] These tests consequently showed that he had torn ligaments in his left ankle. Right after the examinations, Italian journalists waited for Cannavaro, who told them simply, [...] "I'm going home," [...] with a melancholic <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. With that news, Italy manager Roberto Donadoni then called up Fiorentina centre-back Alessandro Gamberini as his official replacement. Alessandro Del Piero captained the team in his place. Cannavaro added that he would stay with the squad to offer support. This would have been Cannavaro's third Euro tournament.|$|E
2500|$|From {{his first}} {{appearance}} until his death five years later, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf became a popular character on the show. Never afraid to express himself, Hank would come across completely unguarded. In terms of being belligerent, Hank's manager Doug Z. Goodstein explained that this tended to only occur when Hank was really drunk and people would heckle him. [...] He described Hank [...] "as a relatively soft-spoken polite guy who quite often had a big <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face." [...] Behind Hank's public persona, an underlying [...] "good nature" [...] tended to shine through, which fans seemed to recognize. [...] During the first few years, Hank would take the bus from Boston each month {{as soon as he}} got his SSI disability check. [...] Hank was a member of the show's Wack Pack and soon attracted a large informal fan base.|$|E

But after a terrible disaster during the New Zealand tour of 2015–16, when Sri Lanka lost all three forms and lost the number one spot of Twenty20 team rankings as well, a Sri Lankan cricket fan at Eden Park after the second T20 match against New Zealand, was overheard asking Dilshan to retire from cricket immediately. Dilshan was somewhat angry at this and asked the fan, [...] "Are you going to replace me?" [...] The issue came on social media as well. After Dilshan landed in Sri Lanka, he stated to the media that he would know when to retire, just as he had in test cricket and Sri Lankans who are engaged outside the country must know their limits.|$|E
