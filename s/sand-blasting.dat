40|$|In {{this work}} three surface {{treatments}} such as: polishing, <b>sand-blast</b> and polishedoxidized {{have been carried}} out on the hot-dip galvanized coatings. The roughness and corrosion resistance of coatings have been studied. Surface morphology of coatings has evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Corrosion behavior was analyzed by salt spray cabinet test and Tafel extrapolation test. The results showed that the sample under <b>sand-blasted</b> treatment exhibited the highest roughness number. Tafel polarization and salt spray cabinet tests reveal the sample with great roughness number have weak corrosion resistance. Difference observed in corrosion behaviour can be explained by difference in surface roughness...|$|R

50|$|Stone {{signs are}} hard to beat for their durability. The most {{commonly}} used rock includes marble, granite, and slate. Marble and Granite can look quite elegant, but do not have much scope for artwork beyond simple line drawings. Any sculptural shaping in these signs is typically very expensive. Slate has its own distinctive appearance which is also popular despite being again not suitable for carving. If gilding is desired, these signs should be hand carved for maximum visual impact. <b>Sand-blasting,</b> though less expensive, creates a rounded groove, with inferior reflective quality.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} required restoration {{work which}} was mainly {{done in the}} early 1980s. The projected cost was over £3million, {{one of the most}} expensive such works ever undertaken by the County Council. [...] The library opened in 1983. The work included <b>sand-blasting</b> the main stonework, which looks more modern than 1630 as a result. Work was also done on the original timber-framed building, including repairs to the roof gables. Carvings were done by a local craftsman in the original Tudor style. These include a self-portrait at the apex of the north-facing gable.|$|E
5000|$|Betograve {{is a type}} of {{concrete}} sculpting. A document published by the Nasher Sculpture Center says that betograve [...] "...involves first pouring concrete into a form tightly packed with gravel, and, once set, precisely <b>sand-blasting</b> the surface of the concrete to expose the gravel beneath it". This [...] "unique system {{of concrete}} placement" [...] was first used by Carl Nesjar, a Norwegian painter, printmaker and sculptor. When Nesjar introduced the technique to Pablo Picasso, Picasso created a sculpture based on his folded sheet metal [...] "Head of a Woman" [...] ("Tête de femme"). The resulting piece [...] "inaugurated a working relationship between Picasso and Nesjar that produced twenty-four works and lasted for the rest of Picasso's life".|$|E

The effectiveness of the hydraulic dampers was nullified, however, because the seals of the units were damaged when the bridge was <b>sand-blasted</b> before being painted.|$|R
5000|$|Lens coating: An {{antireflection coating}} {{is applied to}} the {{finished}} lenses. The lenses are first cleaned, and then loaded into a fixture. The fixture, containing a large number of lenses, is placed in the coating machine. After finishing the process the glass lenses are removed from the holder and the holder is cleaned by <b>sand-blasting</b> or other techniques. Usually the optical coating is done by one of two methods: physical vapour deposition (PVD), in which oxide materials evaporate and are deposited on the lens, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Chemical reactions take place in a vacuum and the reaction product is deposited on the lens. The lenses are coated for two reasons: ...|$|E
50|$|Using walnut shells as an air {{abrasive}} {{was developed}} as a gentler form of cleaning than <b>sand-blasting</b> or glass bead peening. Veloz found that a lower pressure of air is needed than the other varieties, though still a large quantity of air is required due to the finding that using a larger nozzle {{seemed to be more}} efficient (5/16-inch or 3/8-inch nozzle to be used with 35-40 pounds per square inch gauge). Smaller particles are more effective than larger ones (60/200 mesh, referring to particles passing through 60 wires per inch, but not 200 wires per inch). The best angle to hold the nozzle toward the sculpture is near perpendicular, but not quite—nearing closer 15 or 20 degrees away from exactly perpendicular.|$|E
50|$|Zirconia alumina is {{commonly}} used as a <b>sand-blasting</b> medium. It is typically used as an abrasive in casting and foundry processes. Zirconia alumina {{is a mixture of}} zirconium dioxide and aluminium oxide.Zirconia toughened alumina typically consists of alumina with a 10 to 20 percent zirconia concentration, which enhances the toughness of the alumina. To achieve the increase in the composite’s strength, a process known as stress induced transformation toughening takes place. Stress induced transformation toughening results in uniform internal strain, which causes the zirconia structure to crack, and the zirconia particles to switch phases. Because of this phase switch, the amount of zirconia particles increases and creates stresses within the alumina’s structure. These stresses effectively heal the crack and block further cracking—the added zirconia doubles the composite’s strength and enhances toughness between two and four times.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} the ice age erosion that {{occurred}} in the Pleistocene glaciation between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago are visible in the islands. The tops of the hills have been exposed to most of the effects of freezing and thawing. Also, the strong winds that are characteristic of the region carry sand grains up to heights of a metre above ground level; the resulting <b>sand-blasting</b> causes rocks and pillar-shaped rock structures to show the most erosion in their lowest exposed levels, at one metre and below. This unique pattern of erosion is evident in the higher elevations of West Falkland where quartzites of the Port Stephens Formation are exposed at the surface. During the last glaciation, snow that accumulated year after year formed glaciers in some elevated leeward zones. These and previous glaciers modified the landscape on the eastern mountain slopes that were protected from the westerly winds. The reason for glacier accumulation on the eastern slopes could be that the climate could have been very dry, or that the prevailing wind prevented glaciers from forming in places other than eastern slopes.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Korean {{government}} considered {{moving a}} statue to another location, {{but after a}} public debate the plans were cancelled. In November 2010, the statue was removed for 40 days to undergo restoration works. Moving {{for the first time}} in 42 years, it was lifted by a 200-ton crane and transported to a factory in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province. It underwent <b>sand-blasting</b> to remove rust, accumulated grime such as from roadside pollution; and repainted before returning to the Plaza. Other works included fortifying the inner skeleton and the restored statue was unveiled to the public on 23 December 2010. During the time the statue was being renovated, it was replaced by 3 m long, 3 m wide and 6 m high rectangular column displaying life-size photos of the statue. Throughout its four decades, the statue color has changed from bronze to deep green hue and it was decided the renovated statue would be a mix of both colors. During the renovation, Korean public and historians also debated whether his face, sword or armor (the last two criticized by some for being too Chinese or Japanese, and not enough Korean) are accurately represented.|$|E
5000|$|Dent Weil {{tested the}} peening process before use {{and found that}} on average less than 1 µm of metal was lost when applied to an area of 1 cm² when blasted for 10 minutes. Because of the rate in which the {{incrustation}} was removed, they determined that this was negligible at best. [...] They also felt that since they only actually needed to go over {{one section of the}} sculpture for a maximum of 3 seconds (a far cry from the 10-minute test) that this was the best method, as well as the fact that unlike <b>sand-blasting</b> no silica dust is produced and there is no fear of silicosis. [...] One slight technical difficulty that has occurred with this method is in outdoor areas of high humidity the tubes have clogged up with the beads from the moisture. One solution that was proposed and carried out to solve this issue is the use of “wet peening.” This process includes making a “slurry” of clean water and beads, increasing the moisture until it was no longer an issue and flowed smoothly through the tubes. Not only did this solve the problem, but it was found to have drastically reduced the amount of beads needed, as well as limit final cleanup of the area since the beads didn’t ricochet as far.|$|E
