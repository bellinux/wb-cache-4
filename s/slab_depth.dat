40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{evaluation}} of avalanche release depth distributions represents a challenging {{issue for the}} mapping, zoning and long-term hazard management in mountainous regions. To that aim, both the distribution of snowfalls and the occurrence probability of an avalanche release for a given snow height need to be assessed. In this study, a rigorous formalism allowing coupling of these two ingredients into a mechanical-statistical model is presented. The stability criterion of a layered snowpack is investigated using a finite-element analysis accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of weak-layer mechanical properties, while the available snow depth is evaluated by studying the distribution of 3 -day extreme snowfalls. The release depth distributions predicted by this coupled model are then compared to a well-documented database encompassing 369 natural slab avalanches recorded in La Plagne, France. It appears that with only one adjustable parameter, an excellent agreement can be obtained both for the power-law tail of the distribution, corresponding to large <b>slab</b> <b>depths,</b> and for its core corresponding to shallow <b>slab</b> <b>depths.</b> Two important conclusions can be drawn: (1) Small to medium-sized avalanches are controlled mainly by mechanics, whereas large avalanches are influenced by a strong mechanical-meteorological coupling. (2) The release depth distributions, including {{the value of the}} power-law exponent obtained for large <b>slab</b> <b>depths,</b> are highly variable in space and cannot be regarded as universal. Finally, the model is extended using a robust interpolation procedure in order to produce maps of expected release depths for different return periods...|$|R

Currently, most analysis and design methods assume linear distribution of thermal and hygrothermal strains through the <b>slab</b> <b>depth,</b> which usually underestimates the critical tensile stresses in the concrete pavement. A micromechanical approach to calculate the moisture curling stresses in concrete pavements based on measured relative humidity gradients is proposed.

The hygrothermal strain at each point in the <b>slab</b> <b>depth</b> is calculated through the Kelvin-Laplace and Mackenzie equations, which provide a basis for calculating the moisture curling stresses at any time, similarly to the formulation for calculating temperature curling stresses.

In contrast, the Central America volcanic arc {{is parallel to}} the Middle America trench, and the <b>slab</b> <b>depth</b> is ∼ 100 km. A two-dimensional steady-state thermomechanical model explains the calc-alkaline volcanism by high temperature (∼ 1300 °C) in the mantle wedge just beneath the Central America volcanic arc and the strong dehydration (∼ 5 wt%) of the Cocos slab. In contrast, the thermal model for the modern Chiapanecan volcanic arc shows high P-T conditions beneath the coast where the extinct Miocene Chiapanecan arc is present, and is therefore unable to offer a reasonable explanation for the origin of the modern Chiapanecan volcanic arc. We propose a model in which the origin of the modern Chiapanecan volcanic arc is related to the space-time evolution of the Cocos slab in central México. The initiation of flat subduction in central México in the middle Miocene would have generated a hot mantle wedge inflow from NW to SE, generating the new modern Chiapanecan volcanic arc. Because of the contact between the hot mantle wedge beneath Chiapas and the proximity of a newly formed cold, flat slab, the previous hot mantle wedge in Chiapas became colder in time, finally leading to the extinction of the Miocene Chiapanecan volcanic arc. The position and the distinct K-alkaline volcanism at El Chichón volcano are proposed {{to be related to the}} arrival of the highly serpentinized Tehuantepec Ridge beneath the modern Chiapanecan volcanic arc.

40|$|Quaternary mafic rocks {{have been}} erupted from volcanoes {{both on and}} behind the {{volcanic}} front in southeastern Guatemala and western El Salvador. Behind-the-front volcanism extends almost continuously some 110 km from the front. B and Li contents, as well as B/Nb and Li/Yb ratios, are generally higher in the mafic volcanic rocks of the volcanic front and lower in those behind the front. Beryllium concentrations show the opposite relationships, with generally higher values behind the front. In addition, many behind-the-front samples have lower δ 7 Li (2 – 3 ‰ versus 4 – 6 ‰ for the volcanic front). Guatemalan volcanic rocks, in general, have lower δ 7 Li than those found along {{the remainder of the}} Central American margin. The light element variations across northern Central America clearly indicate that the volcanic front receives a much more pronounced fluid contribution from dehydrating, subducting Cocos lithosphere than the behind-the-front region. This dehydration pulse occurs at <b>slab</b> <b>depths</b> between 85 and 105 km, and selective enrichments of B, Cs, and Cl in volcanic rocks of the volcanic front suggest that the source of this pulse is dehydrating serpentinite. In addition, the dehydration pulse from subducted serpentinite is likely superimposed on a continuous dehydration signal provided by subducting oceanic crust which continues behind the volcanic front to <b>slab</b> <b>depths</b> 3 ̆e 200 km. The enhanced fluid contributions at the front produce higher degrees of wedge melting, thus explaining the lower Be contents of front samples. There are two possible explanations of the lower δ 7 Li of many behind-the-front volcanic rocks from southeastern Guatemala/western El Salvador: selective loss of 7 Li during progressive dehydration of subducting Cocos lithosphere or diffusive fractionation accompanying late stage, selective crustal contamination. Since the slightly lower δ 7 Li of Guatemalan volcanic rocks in general is consistent with a minor crustal overprint, the second explanation is favored and could be relevant to the few subduction zones where lower Li isotopic values characterize back-arc regions. Light element variation across southeastern Guatemala and western El Salvador is consistent with the operation of decompression melting behind the volcanic front.

The methodology consists on (i) forward modelling of different spectra of granu-lar and translucent CO 2 ice with varying depth, im-purities of granular CO 2 and dust content [7]; (ii) ob-tain the best linear projection to estimate the depth of the translucent ice with the minimum contribution of other parameters (such impurities of granular CO 2 and dust content) and also estimate the functional relation between the linear projection and the actual slab ice depth; (iii) apply the linear projection and functional relation to estimate the ”equivalent <b>slab</b> ice <b>depth</b> ” to the actual data.

The residual-gravimetric expression of subducting fracture zones extends> 200 km landward of the trench axis. The bathymetric expression of subducting seamounts with height 1 km and area 500 km 2 (N 536), and aseismic ridges (N> 10), is largest near the trench (within 70 km) and above shallow subducting <b>slab</b> <b>depths</b> (<b>SLAB</b> 1. 0 < 17 km). Subducting seamounts are similar in wavelength, amplitude, and morphology to unsub-ducted seamounts. Morphology, spatial distributions, and reduced levels of seismicity are considered incon-sistent with mechanical models proposing wholesale decapitation, and the association of subducting seamounts with large-earthquakes. Subducting aseismic ridges are associated with uplift and steepening of the outer fore arc, a gradual reduction in residual bathymetric expression across the inner fore arc, and a local increase in the width and elevation of the volcanic-arc/orogen. These contrasting expressions reflect the influence of margin-normal variations in rigidity on where and how the upper plate deforms, both to accommodate subducting relief and in response to stresses transmitted across the plate interface. The outer fore arc and arc have lower rigidity due to fracturing and thermal weakening, respectively. Similar associa-tions with complex earthquakes and fault creep suggest aseismic ridge subduction may also be accommo-dated by the development and evolution of a broad fracture network, the geometrical strength of which may exceed the locking strength of a smooth fault. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{phase and}} melting {{relations}} in subducted pelites {{have been investigated}} experimentally at conditions relevant for <b>slabs</b> at sub-arc <b>depths</b> (T¼ 600 ^ 10508 C, P¼ 25 ^ 45 GPa). The fluid-present experiments produced a dominant paragenesis consisting of garnet-phengite-clinopyroxene-coesite-kyanite that coexists with a fluid phase at run conditions. Garnet contains detectable amounts of Na 2 O (up to 05 wt...|$|R
40|$|Very rare, halogen-rich {{andesite}} melt inclusions (HRA) in bytownitic plagioclase phenocrysts (An 89 - 90) from tephra {{fallout of}} the Izu arc volcanic front (Izu VF) provide {{new insights into}} the processes of fluid release from slab trenchward to the volcanic front in a cool subduction zone. These HRA are markedly enriched in Cl, F and Li - by factors of up to 8 (Cl, F) and 1. 5 (Li) - but indistinguishable with respect to the fluid-mobile large-ion lithophile elements (LILE; K, Sr, Rb, Cs, Ba, Pb, U), rare earths (REE) or high field strength elements (HFSE) from the low-K tholeiitic magmas of the Izu VF. We suggest that the chemical signature of the HRA reflects the presence of a fluid in the mantle source that originated from the serpentinized mantle peridotite above the metacrust. This "wedge serpentinite" presumably formed by fluid infiltration beneath the forearc and was subsequently down-dragged with the slab to arc front depths. The combined evidence from the Izu VF (? 110 km above slab) and the outer forearc serpentinite seamounts (~ 25 to 30 km above slab) suggests that the slab flux of B and Cl is highest beneath the forearc, and decreases with increasing <b>slab</b> <b>depths.</b> In contrast, the slab flux of Li is minor beneath the forearc, but increases with depth. Fluorine may behave similarly to Li, whereas the fluid-mobile LILE appear to be largely retained in the slab trenchward from the Izu VF. Consequently, the chemical signatures of both Izu trench sediments and basaltic rocks appear preserved until arc front depths...|$|R
