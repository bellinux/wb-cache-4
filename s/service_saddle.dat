In 1946, when that <b>services</b> were <b>saddled</b> to the university, he became consultant for the hospital as University Morbid Anatomist and Histologist.|$|R
50|$|Pony Express adopted this mochila (a type of mailbag with 4 {{pockets to}} secure letters and mail) for their fast mail <b>service.</b> The <b>saddles</b> and mochilas were {{standardised}} {{and made the}} same so they would work from one horse to another. When full of mail and telegrams it weighed about 20 pounds. The rider would carry additionally a canteen of water, a gun, and a small bible which included the solemn loyalty oath {{he had to take}} as a precondition to becoming a rider. If a horse became injured beyond use or was killed, the rider would strip the mochila with its mail from the saddle and walk to the next relay transfer station.|$|R
5000|$|For a time, Schleifstein {{was hidden}} {{by his father}} {{with the help of}} two anti-fascist German prisoners, but he was {{eventually}} discovered. The SS guards took a liking to him and came to treat him as a [...] "camp mascot", having a small camp uniform made for him and having him take part in morning appells, where he would salute the guard and report, [...] "All prisoners accounted for." [...] Nonetheless, when there were formal inspections by visiting Nazi officials, Schleifstein had to be hidden {{and he said he was}} once lined up for execution but was saved by his father's intervention. His father was valued for his <b>service</b> making <b>saddles</b> and harnesses. Schleifstein also said at one point, he became very ill and had to live at the camp hospital.|$|R
50|$|In April 1855, {{six years}} {{before the start of}} the Civil War, Captain George B. McClellan sailed to Europe as part of a {{military}} commission to study developments in European tactics, weaponry, and logistics. McClellan's focus was the organization of engineer troops and cavalry. After the one-year tour, during which time McClellan observed several battles of the Crimean War, McClellan brought back almost 100 books and manuals. These he read before writing his report, which concluded with his proposed manual for American cavalry adapted from existing Russian cavalry regulations. He also proposed a cavalry saddle that he claimed was a modification of a Hungarian model used in the Prussian <b>service.</b> The <b>saddle</b> was almost certainly a modification of the Spanish tree saddle in common use in Mexico during this period, and which had become common in some parts of the US.|$|R
40|$|Good {{customer}} service {{is very important}} for any business to grow. Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC),Akurebusiness district is responsible for distribution of electricity for people of Akure in Ondo State, Nigeria. Face to face customer contact is time consuming,since the consumershave to be physically present for both parties to meet before solution can be proffered. Telephone communication with BEDC enables the customers to call and make enquiriesand receive responses about information or services required. Consumers need strong communication skills in telephone communication which may be lacking in some cases; customers may need to go through several people before the ideal person who can help him is eventually reached. The BEDC existing customer <b>service</b> system is <b>saddled</b> with limitations such as poor {{customer service}}s and relations, high response time. The need to improve on the weakness of the traditional customer services system {{led to the development of}} this e-customer service system. This paper aims to eliminate these weaknesses by automating the process through an e-Customer Care Service System by which customer makes an enquiries and complaints on the services delivered by the company...|$|R
5000|$|Republic Airlines {{began in}} 1979 with {{the merger of}} North Central Airlines and Southern Airways, the first under airline deregulation. The new airline's {{headquarters}} were at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, though their largest hub was at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Following their buyout of Hughes Airwest in 1980, Republic became the largest airline in the U.S. by number of airports served. They operated the world's largest Douglas DC-9 fleet, with DC-9-10, DC-9-30 and DC-9-50s and also flew Boeing 727-200, Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets. In addition, Republic operated Convair 580 turboprops previously flown by North Central. After the merger, losses mounted and <b>service</b> reductions followed. <b>Saddled</b> with debt from two acquisitions and new aircraft, the airline struggled in the early 1980s, and even introduced a human mascot version of Herman the Duck. They reduced service to Phoenix, a former hub of Hughes Airwest, citing their inability to compete with non-union airlines there [...] and eventually dismantled the former extensive route system operated by Hughes Airwest in the western U.S.|$|R
40|$|Christianity, metaphorically {{referred}} to as the 2 ̆ 2 Jesus road, 2 ̆ 2 came to the Kiowas of southwestern Oklahoma {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. Today, most Kiowas are at least nominally Christian, and, like other Oklahoma Indians, render prayers and hymns in their Native tongue in services that are otherwise Baptist, Methodist, or Pentecostal. In explaining why the Kiowas accepted Christianity and how Kiowa hymns still play a vital part in Kiowa community life, The Jesus Road contributes to a growing body of literature about Native American Christians who have not abandoned their personal and cultural identity. Anthropologist Luke Eric Lassiter, historian Clyde Ellis, and Ralph Kotay, a renowned Kiowa singer, collaborated to produce this short, albeit informative, book and companion CD of twenty-six Kiowa hymns sung by Kotay, accompanied by Pat Kopepasah and Letha Peters. Harry Tofpi Sr. 2 ̆ 7 s 1997 burial <b>service</b> in <b>Saddle</b> Mountain Cemetery-beautifully nestled in the northeastern edge of the Wichita Mountains-opens part 1, Ellis 2 ̆ 7 s historical sketch delineating the arrival of Christianity in Kiowa country after the 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty and how Kiowas converting to the 2 ̆ 2 Jesus way 2 ̆ 2 did so according to their own needs, without giving up their Kiowa identity. Largely based on the works of Isabel Crawford, founder of the Saddle Mountain Kiowa Indian Baptist Church in 1896, and secondary sources, Ellis narrates how other missions were established among the Kiowas in the late nineteenth century, though little attention is paid to the twentieth century, except through the ethnographic present. Lassiter begins part 2 discussing the importance of Kiowa hymns, which are started by a song leader and performed without instrumental accompaniment for specific occasions; every song belongs to a family and has a story behind it, and, as Kotay nicely points out, Kiowa hymns-and other songs-are not 2 ̆ 2 composed, 2 ̆ 2 but 2 ̆ 2 come through the Spirit and the minds of people who really believe. 2 ̆ 2 Part 2 continues with Kotay explaining the personal, deeper meanings of the twenty-six songs on the companion CD. In the afterword, the three authors stress how preserving Kiowa hymns is instrumental to preserving the Kiowa language. Having met Lassiter and Kotay on May 17, 1994, at one of Ralph 2 ̆ 7 s hymn classes, I can attest to their admirable dedication in preserving Kiowa language and culture through songs. One shortcoming of the book, however, is an inconsistent orthography for Kiowa terms and, moreover, the absence of phonetic transcriptions for the hymns. How can this book help maintain the songs and the Kiowa language when only English translations are provided...|$|R
