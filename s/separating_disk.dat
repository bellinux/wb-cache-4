40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for the continuous liquid chromatography separation of a substance mixture having a separation arrangement for the fractions of the substance mixture The separation arrangement is formed by a circular <b>separating</b> <b>disk</b> (3) rotating about its centre relative to a feed and discharge arrangement (1). The <b>separating</b> <b>disk</b> (3) has a self-supporting separation phase (13) impervious to solvent on its exterior, said separation phase having an annular feed channel (11) and an annular discharge channel (12) on its side. The separation phase (13) is so thin that the substance mixture fed and the solvent from one side flow in a radial direction from the feed to the discharge channels (11, 12) through the entire height of the separating material (16). The feed and the discharge arrangements have annular feed lines (4, 5) which end in the feed and discharge channels (11, 12) of the separation phase (13) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the degree of smear layer removal after root canal preparation with TF® instruments, combined with two different irrigating solutions. For the present study twenty-two freshly extracted human roots were selected. All teeth had been extracted for periodontal purpose. Crown were cut off with a <b>separating</b> <b>disk,</b> so all roots were approximately 10 - 12 mm long. After having chosen the two control roots, the remaining ones were randomly {{divided into two groups}} each containing 10 roots. The two experimental groups were prepared as follows.

40|$|In {{a medical}} process and {{assembly}} for isolating cell material from a tissue medium and/or liquid, the novelty is that: (a) the assembly is a vessel(1) {{with an open}} top into which the cells material in a tissue medium and/or liquid can be placed; (b) the assembly (1) has a cell separator which is a flat disk (2) whose rim is sealed {{with respect to the}} vessel (1) inner wall; (c) the flat disk (2) has one or more apertures (5) covered by a cell-permeable membrane; (d) the <b>separating</b> <b>disk</b> (2) is inserted into the vessel (1) from above, exerting pressure on the cell material together with the tissue medium and/or liquid; (e) the cell material is liberated from the tissue by disk rotation and the exertion of shear forces; (f) liberated cells or groups of cells pass through pores in the membrane filter (5), while tissue residues are retained. USE - Process and assembly to separate cells from a tissue medium for esp. medical laboratory purposes. ADVANTAGE - The process and assembly minimise the number of manual processes necessary to obtain a sample, and provides a standardised and reproducible means of obtaining such samples. (CR...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to compare the surface {{roughness}} of enamel margins resulting {{by the use of}} rotating, sonic and ultrasonic devices for cavity margins finishing. Forty-eight anterior intact teeth were selected for this study. Each item was sectioned 1 mm below the CEJ, perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth, with the carborundum <b>separating</b> <b>disk</b> mounted on the high-speed handpiece. With the same bur the crown was separated into two parts along the midline vertically. At the end 96 "half-crowns" were obtained. The samples were divided into 6 groups of 8 samples each, according to enamel margin's finishing technique (A and B: diamond ultrasonic tip; C: multisteel ultrasonic tip; D: fine diamond rotating bur; E: ultra-fine diamond rotating bur; F: sonicflex prep). The surface roughness evaluation of the enamel of each sample has been carried out by using a profilometer. The statistical analysis was performed with a balanced hierarchical ANOVA. The results of this in vitro study showed that the enamel roughness obtained with sonic and ultrasonic devices was significantly higher than roughness obtained with rotating burs. Within the sonic and ultrasonic tips, the multisteel ones gave better results, that were comparable to diamond sonic devic...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the power input of pitched blade impellers and standard Rushton turbine impellers in a cylindrical vessel provided with four radial baffles at its wall under a turbulent regime of flow of an agitated liquid. The influence of the geometry of the pitched blade impellers (pitch angle, number of blades) and the off-bottom impeller clearance of both high-speed impellers tested on the impeller power input is determined in two sizes of the cylindrical vessel (0. 3 m and 0. 8 m diameter of vessel). A strain gauge torquemeter is used in the small vessel and a phase shift mechanical torquemeter is used in the large vessel. All results of the experiments correspond to the condition that the Reynolds number modified for the impeller exceeds ten thousand. The results of this study show that the significant influence of the <b>separating</b> <b>disk</b> thickness of the turbine impeller corresponds fairly well to the empirical equations presented in the literature. Both the influence of the number of impeller blades and the blade pitch angle of the pitched blade impeller were expressed quantitatively by means of the power dependence of the recently published correlations: the higher the pitch angle and the number of blades, the higher the values of the impeller power input. Finally, it follows from results of this study that the impeller off-bottom clearance has a weak influence on the power input of the Rushton turbine impeller, but with decreasing impeller off-bottom clearance the power input of the pitched blade impeller increases significantly...|$|E
