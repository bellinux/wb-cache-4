40|$|The Petrkovice Member is the basal {{unit of the}} paralic {{succession}} of the Ostrava Formation of the Upper Silesian Basin. This member is a valuable {{source of information about}} the transition from a marine basin filled with siliciclastic sediments into a paralic basin with the beginning of coal-bearing sedimentation. Models of: (1) the number of coal seams, (2) their total thickness, and (3) the coal content with respect to the total thickness of the succession were created to describe and assess the coal-bearing capacity of the Petrkovice Member. The authors present models for coal <b>seam</b> <b>thicknesses</b> exceeding either 10 or 40 cm. The coal-bearing capacity of the Petfkovice Member is very low. The average share of coal seams thicker than 0. 1 m is 3 %. The share of coal <b>seams</b> with a <b>thickness</b> that exceeds 0. 4 m is only 1. 66 %. Moreover, in large areas of the basin, in the N and NE parts, the coal-bearing capacity is close to zero, because coal <b>seams</b> of greater <b>thickness</b> were detected only locally there. Based on these models and on other geological data, {{it is obvious that the}} onset of coal sedimentation was gradual and limited to particular sites showing the greatest subsidence of the basin floor.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a stochastic analysis of coalbed methane (CBM) resources for a coal seam in southeast Qinshui Basin, China. Log and laboratory data {{are used to}} predict the coal thickness, coal ash content and coal gas content. Using reservoir modelling, the distributions of the karst collapse column (KCC), coal <b>seam</b> <b>thickness,</b> coal quality and coal gas content are generated. The convergent interpolation and sequential Gaussian simulation methods are used to model the surface {{and structure of the}} coal seam. The structural models are determined by the surface structure and coal <b>seam</b> <b>thickness.</b> Based on the structural models, the coal and KCC are converted to two facies and their distributions are obtained using object modelling. The coal density distributions are simulated based on each facies model using the sequential Gaussian simulation. Finally, different realisations are used to study CBM resources. The results show that the heterogeneities in coal <b>seam</b> <b>thickness</b> and coal quality lead to significant uncertainty in estimating CBM resources. A model with lower heterogeneity gives a greater CBM resource. The distributions of KCC, coal <b>seam</b> <b>thickness,</b> coal quality and gas content are the main sources for uncertainty in CBM resource estimation. The density variogram and top structure contribute less to the uncertainty in CBM resources...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} {{and interpretation of}} geological features {{is essential for the}} planning and ultimate success of any mining venture. Examples of geological features significant for mining are presented, and their identification during exploration discussed. In particular, the importance of coal qualities, <b>seam</b> <b>thickness</b> and seam elevation are emphasised in relation to longwall mining. Geostatistical analysis provides a powerful tool for improving the prediction and decision-making capabilities of both exploration and mine geologists. The availability of geostatistics, and the benefits resulting from its application, are demonstrated using actual data for calorific value, <b>seam</b> <b>thickness</b> and seam elevation. Contamination of run-of-mine coal is a common problem on highly-mechanised collieries. The problem generally arises from over-cutting of the designated mining horizon. A practical system for monitoring and controlling contamination on a mechanised bord-and-pillar and longwall colliery is presented. The results and benefits of applying such a system are cited for an actual longwall colliery. Numerical geological predictions are not always reported in terms of the reliability of such estimates. Many of these values can be reported in terms of confidence limits, particularly for routine grade control purposes. The methods and benefits of such reporting are described and illustrated by way of examples for calorific value and contamination levels. ...|$|E
40|$|Australia is mining {{at greater}} <b>seam</b> <b>thicknesses</b> than most similar western {{countries}} {{and particularly the}} US. The approaches developed by other countries and previous research and innovation are not necessarily directly transferable. Furthermore, the increasing scale of production in thick seam longwalls challenges the maintenance of safe and healthy face environments in Australian collieries. High production rates, longer faces and higher ventilation quantities and velocities further exacerbate dustiness. An ACARP funded scoping study has been undertaken to examine dust problems that are being faced by Australian thick seam longwall mine operators, evaluate options and recommend priorities for improvement. The study involved a number of stages. A detailed survey of six Australian thick seam mine operators to identify individual mine issues was undertaken. A comprehensive literature review, with emphasis on publications from {{the last ten years}} was undertaken on Australian and foreign developments. Views and advice from recognised dust experts both within Australia and overseas were sought. Some approaches to assessment of dust compliance and analysis of trends exhibited were undertaken.

Firstly, logs from nine wells and laboratory data from nine coal seams {{were used to}} predict the coal thickness, ash content and gas content at nine boreholes. Secondly, the structural models were determined using the well correlation, structural contour and coal <b>seam</b> <b>thicknesses</b> maps from coal mine data by the convergent gridder and sequential Gaussian simulation methods. Then, distributions of coal density and ash content were generated in 3 D by using sequential Gaussian simulation based on the well log interpretations. Then, the distributions of gas content for each cell were built by two methods; one is multivariable regression analysis in 3 D {{and the other is}} sequential Gaussian simulation based on the log interpreted gas content. Finally, coalbed methane resources were estimated based on the cell volume, coal density, net to gross ratio and gas content. In coalbed methane resources estimation, four different density cutoffs were used to define the net to gross ratio of coal in 3 D. Results show that the gas contents decreases with increase in depth though with increases of vitrinite reflectance ratio, fixed carbon content and pressure. Calculated gas content from linear multivariate regression by using parameters of ash content, volatile matter content and fixed carbon content and sample 2 ̆ 7 s burial depth matches well with laboratory measured values. The total coalbed methane resources estimated are similar by the two geological modelling processes, the multivariable regression analysis in 3 D and the sequential Gaussian simulation.
