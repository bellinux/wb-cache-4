5|$|According to Boxoffice, The Call was {{expected}} to earn about $11–12 million on its opening weekend in 2,507 theaters across the United <b>States</b> <b>but</b> surpassed this by a significant margin and grossed $17 million in its first three days. This indicated good profits, as the film cost about $13 million to produce and TriStar Pictures paid a much smaller amount to acquire U.S. distribution rights. With box office takings of over $68 million, The Call is WWE Studios' most commercially successful film to date, the previous top-grossing productions being See No Evil, which stars professional wrestler Kane (Glenn Jacobs) ($19 million) and 12 Rounds, which stars professional wrestler John Cena ($17 million).|$|E
5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea {{to be viewed as}} a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United <b>States,</b> <b>but</b> with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5|$|After the Ninth Circuit {{issued its}} ruling in the direct appeal, {{the case was}} remanded to the {{district}} court for further proceedings.

Despite these rulings, the parties in the original case continued to litigate issues relating to apportionment of the fisheries and subsequent rulings have been issued as recently as May 2015.|$|E

5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, {{usually in the}} same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United <b>States,</b> <b>but</b> only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|American reviewers were {{enthusiastic}} of Deep Purple's {{live performances}} {{and the lack}} of a new successful single apparently did not ruin the positive perception of the band in the US, {{to the point that they}} were often addressed as an American band.

5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009.

Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), {{the equivalent of a}} cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly twice that of the United <b>States,</b> <b>but</b> only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty-eight, Metcalfe {{was elected}} to the Sixteenth Congress, {{defeating}} Joshua Desha. During his tenure in the House, which lasted five terms, he was the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Militia.

He also opposed restrictions on slavery in Missouri and the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Grand Lodge era, during the 1720s, James Anderson {{composed}} the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread, continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption, which worked three degrees with the same names as the men's but different content. The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United <b>States,</b> <b>but</b> distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry.|$|E

It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern <b>states,</b> <b>but</b> all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E
