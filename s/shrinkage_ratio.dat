The difference between radial and tangential shrinkage also varies from species to species.

Such capability can {{be beneficial for}} a wide variety of applications including biomedical and electronics products. In this paper, a novel fabrication approach based on a three-dimensional (3 D) printing process is presented for fabricating self-folding structures that can be actuated in a heating environment. The thermo-actuating structures that are designed and fabricated by our method are two-dimensional (2 D) origami sheets, which have multiple printed layers. The middle layer of an origami sheet is a prestrained poly-styrene film with large <b>shrinkage</b> <b>ratios</b> when heated. Both its top and bottom surfaces are covered with cured resin that is printed in designed shapes. A foldable hinge is achieved by constraining the shrinkage of the film on one side while allowing the shrink-age of the film on another side when the origami sheet is exposed to a heating environ-ment. Heuristic models of hinge’s folding angles are developed based on the related folding mechanism. A 2 D origami sheet design and fabrication method is presented for a given 3 D structure. Various experimental tests are performed to verify the self-folding performance of the designed and fabricated origami sheets. Techniques on improving folding angle control are also discussed with possible applications. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4029066...|$|R

However, {{the high cost}} of precursor materials has hampered their wide applications on commercial scale.

The effects of carbonization conditions on the properties of coal-based carbon membrane were investigated by the variation of the weight loss, <b>shrinkage</b> <b>ratio</b> of tube size and pore structure characteristics during carbonization. The results show that carbonization conditions greatly affect the properties of coal-based carbon membranes. The carbon membranes carbonized in the inert gases have more ‘‘open’ ’ porous structure and high gas flux compared to those carbonized in vacuum which makes the carbon membrane possess smaller pores and low gas flux.

Regarding alcohol habit, 667 of the subjects were abstainers, and 157, 362, and 246 of the subjects were light (average 88. 2 g ethanol/week), moderate (181. 2 g/week), and heavy (418. 1 g/week) drinkers, respectively.
