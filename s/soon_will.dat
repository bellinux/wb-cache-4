They plan to impose a moratorium on airport expansion and force this traffic on to the railways, freeing up slots for long-haul flights and removing the need for a third runway at Heathrow and a second runway at Stansted.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 1 May each year the Minehead Hobby Horse visits Dunster and is {{received}} at the Castle. A local newspaper printed in May 1863 says [...] "The origin professes to be in commemoration of the wreck of a vessel at Minehead in remote times, or {{the advent of a}} sort of phantom ship which entered the harbour without Captain or crew. Once the custom was encouraged, but now is much neglected, and perhaps <b>soon</b> <b>will</b> fall into desuetude." [...] Another conjecture about its origin is that the hobby horse was the ancient King of the May. The Hobby Horse tradition begins with the waking of the inhabitants of Minehead by the beating of a loud drum. The hobby horse dances its way about the town and on to Dunster Castle.|$|E

2500|$|Texarkana {{people are}} jittery, plain frightened--and with reason.

You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you <b>soon</b> <b>will.</b> He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard.

2500|$|Recently, Cape Verde {{has been}} {{distancing}} itself from its regional African partners and forging closer {{ties with the}} EU.

Prime Minister José Maria Neves announced that his country will start imposing restrictions on the entrance of citizens from all ECOWAS member states. The Cape Verde government <b>soon</b> <b>will</b> present ECOWAS with proposals for [...] "special status" [...] instead of full membership. This is also an effort to limit the recent rise of illegal immigration of other West African nationals using Cape Verde and its proximity to the Canary Islands as a springboard towards Europe.
