40|$|Many {{security}} protocols {{are built}} as {{the composition of}} an application-layer protocol and a <b>secure</b> <b>transport</b> protocol, such as TLS. There are many approaches to proving the correctness of such protocols. One popular approach is verification by abstraction, in which the correctness of the application-layer protocol is proven {{under the assumption that}} the transport layer satisfies certain properties, such as confidentiality. Following this approach, we adapt the strand spaces model in order to analyse application-layer protocols that depend on an underlying <b>secure</b> <b>transport</b> layer, including unilaterally authenticating <b>secure</b> <b>transport</b> protocols, such as unilateral TLS. Further, we develop proof rules that enable us to prove the correctness of application-layer protocols that use either unilateral or bilateral <b>secure</b> <b>transport</b> protocols. We then illustrate these rules by proving the correctness of WebAuth, a single-sign-on protocol that makes extensive use of unilateral TLS. In this thesis we also present a full proof of the model's soundness. In particular, we prove that, subject to a suitable independence assumption, if there is an attack against the application-layer protocol when layered on top of a particular <b>secure</b> <b>transport</b> protocol, then there is an attack against the abstracted model of the application-layer protocol. In contrast to existing work in this area, the independence assumption consists of eight statically-checkable conditions, meaning that it can be checked statically, rather than having to consider all possible runs of the protocol. Lastly, we extend the model to allow protocols that consist of an arbitrary number of layers to be proven correct. In this case, we prove the correctness of the intermediate layers using the high-level strand spaces model, by abstracting away from the underlying transport-layers. Further, we extend the above soundness results in order to prove that the multi-layer approach is sound. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique by proving the correctness of a couple of simple multi-layer protocols. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

40|$|Current Internet {{communications}} security is typically {{provided by the}} integration of <b>secure</b> <b>transport</b> functionality into client and server software. Two problems arise with this approach: Firstly, the use of integrated security services requires modification to the existing Internet applications, requiring re-development and re-deployment projects. Secondly, high-level security services such as authorisation are not provided by <b>secure</b> <b>transport</b> protocols, requiring applications to rely on customised (and often insecure) mechanisms {{for the provision of}} such services.
