40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Continues {{improvement}} of industrial systems require constant measuring process variation and eliminating extraneous variation whenever possible {{to push the}} target measures {{as close to the}} ideal value as possible. <b>Statistical</b> <b>Processes</b> <b>Control</b> (<b>SPC)</b> technique is a very efficient statistical technique for monitoring and <b>controlling</b> <b>processes</b> variation. In recent years an alternate Shewhart-type statistical quality control charts called g-chart has been developed for <b>controlling</b> <b>process</b> variation where failure is infrequent like hospital acquired infections. However, g-chart, EWMA chart and probability based control charts, which are the main control charts used for monitoring infrequent failure processes fail to detect changes in the process quickly enough. As a solution it was proposed to inspect and follow-up on every failure that occurs in the process. A mathematical model for the long-run cost of a quality control policy is developed. This model is used to compare the cost of following up on every failure policy with the cost of using statistical control chart for monitoring processes. By comparing the total cost per hour of using statistical control chart method with the total cost per hour of following up on every failure, it is concluded that following up on every failure policy results in quick detection of changes in the process and it is also a more cost efficient method...|$|R

This paper proposes an inventory control policy based on a <b>statistical</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> approach (<b>SPC)</b> to handle supply chain dynamics. The policy relies on applying individual control charts to control both the inventory position and the placed orders adequately. A simulation study has been conducted to evaluate and compare the proposed SPC policy with a traditional order-up-to in a multi-echelon supply chain. The comparison showed that the SPC policy outperforms the order-up-to in terms of bullwhip effect and inventory performances.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the application of}} <b>Process</b> <b>Control</b> Techniques (PCTs) {{for the improvement of}} the technical performance of discrete production processes. Successful applications of these techniques, such as <b>Statistical</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Control</b> Techniques (<b>SPC),</b> {{can be found in the}} literature. However, some companies do not manage to apply PCTs successfully. In some cases applying PCTs does not lead to an improvement of the technical performance, or it leads to a reduced financial performance. Lack of management commitment and training are often said to be the reason for a failing implementation. However, it is probable that also situational factors, related to the type of process and production organisation, are influencing the degree of success. Besides the success of implementation activities, the potential success or applicability of PCTs is also determining the total success. In the literature however, one often starts from the point of a ‘best practice’ for the application of PCTs. Considering the assumption of applicability this ‘best practice’ has to be differentiated to prevent companies from trying to implement unsuitable PCTs. In this paper, besides the concept of applicability, a framework for the application of PCTs is presented. By using this framework, the functions of PCTs and their relationships are illustrated. The framework has been developed as a tool for a research on the applicability of PCTs. The aim of this research is to differentiate the best practice concept. This has to result in a decision support system, that helps to determine the most suitable set of techniques, based on situational characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>Statistical</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Control</b> - <b>SPC</b> {{is a set}} of {{statistical}} techniques focused on <b>process</b> <b>control,</b> monitoring and analyzing variation causes in the quality characteristics and/or in the parameters used to <b>control</b> and <b>process</b> improvements. Implementing SPC in organizations is a complex task. The reasons for its failure are related to organizational or social factors such as lack of top management commitment and little understanding about its potential benefits. Other aspects concern technical factors such as lack of training on and understanding about the statistical techniques. The main aim of the present article is to understand the interrelations between conditioning factors associated with top management commitment (Support), SPC Training and Application, as well as to understand the relationships between these factors and the benefits associated with the implementation of the program. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used in the analysis since the main goal is to establish the causal relations. A cross-section survey was used as research method to collect information of samples from Brazilian auto-parts companies, which were selected according to guides from the auto-parts industry associations. A total of 170 companies were contacted by e-mail and by phone in order to be {{invited to participate in the}} survey. However, just 93 industries agreed on participating, and only 43 answered the questionnaire. The results showed that the senior management support considerably affects the way companies develop their training programs. In turn, these trainings affect the way companies apply the techniques. Thus, it will reflect on the benefits gotten from implementing the program. It was observed that the managerial and technical aspects are closely connected to each other and that they are represented by the ratio between top management and training support. The technical aspects observed through SPC application directly affect the benefits from the program...|$|R

The data resulting from these systems, however, still needs to be reviewed by healthcare workers which is a time-consuming process. Methods This paper presents a system that employs <b>statistical</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> techniques (<b>SPC)</b> to automatically detect both positive and negative trends in transfer times. Several SPC techniques, Tabular cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart, Standardized CUSUM and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart were evaluated. The best performing method was further optimized for the desired application. After this, it was validated on both simulated data and real-life data. Results The best performing method was the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average control chart with the use of rational subgroups and a reinitialization after three alarm days. The results from the simulated data showed that positive and negative trends are detected within 14 days after the start of the trend when a trend is 28 days long. When the transition period is shorter, the number of days before an alert is triggered also diminishes. If for instance an abrupt change is present in the transfer time an alert is triggered within two days after this change. On average, only one false alarm is triggered every five weeks. The results from the real-life dataset confirm those of the simulated dataset. Conclusions The system presented in this paper is able to detect both positive and negative trends in the transfer times of older adults, therefore automatically triggering an alarm when changes in transfer times occur. These changes can be gradual as well as abrupt...|$|R

Furthermore, it was shown that the contemporaneous use of numerous univariate <b>statistical</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> charts can address the prevalent problem of class imbalance. This research found that <b>statistical</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> based techniques are an effective method of temporal anomaly detection. <b>Statistical</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> based algorithms were developed and tested on a food industry complaint database of both frequent and infrequent Poisson distributed events.
