5|$|In 1978, the Indian {{conservationist}} Billy Arjan Singh {{attempted to}} rewild a tiger in Dudhwa National Park; {{this was the}} captive-bred tigress Tara. Soon after the release, numerous {{people were killed and}} eaten by a tigress that was subsequently shot. Government officials claimed it was Tara, though Singh disputed this. Further controversy broke out with the discovery that Tara was partly <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bengal tiger is the {{national}} animal of India and Bangladesh. The Malaysian tiger is {{the national}} animal of Malaysia. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> {{is the national}} animal of South Korea. Since the successful economies of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore were described as the Four Asian Tigers, a tiger economy {{is a metaphor for}} a nation in rapid development.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 100 {{species of}} mammal {{are known to}} inhabit, or to have {{recently}} inhabited, the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters. This includes a few species that were introduced in the 20th century; the coypu was introduced for farming in the 1990s, and the muskrat {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century into the Russian Far East and was subsequently first recorded in Korea in the Tumen River basin in 1965. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> and Japanese sea lion have probably been extirpated from Korea, but are still included in standard lists of Korean mammals.|$|E
25|$|The famous white <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> {{found in}} captivity are {{actually}} not pure <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers.</b> They are instead {{the result of}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> breeding with Bengal tigers. The gene for white coating is quite common among Bengal tigers, but the natural birth of a white Bengal tiger {{is still a very}} rare occasion in the wild, where white tigers are not bred selectively.|$|R
50|$|Caspian tigers {{used to live}} {{in northwestern}} to northeastern Iran. In 2010, two <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> sent from Russia to Iran's Tehran Zoological Garden in {{exchange}} for a pair of Persian leopards were set to be reintroduced in the wild to replace the Turan tigers at the Miankaleh peninsula within the next five years, another region near the Caspian sea. In December 2010, one of the captive <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> exchanged for the Persian leopards died in Eram Zoo. In 2011, Iran requested four more <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> and invited conservation experts from Russia to support the reintroduction project to the Caspian Sea coast. Iran received two pairs of <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> in 2012.|$|R
25|$|Prey {{species of}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> include Manchurian wapiti, Siberian musk deer, long-tailed goral, moose, Siberian roe deer, Manchurian sika deer, wild boar, even {{sometimes}} small size Asian black bear and Ussuri brown bear. <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> also take smaller species like hares, rabbits, pikas and salmon as food.|$|R
5|$|In the 1940s, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> was on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male). Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity. However, in a decade later, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened adult. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger,</b> Amur leopard, and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E
5|$|The last {{confirmed}} {{death of}} an Anatolian leopard, {{closely related to the}} Persian (Caucasian) leopard and native to the western regions of Anatolia, took place in the Bağözü village of the Beypazarı district in Ankara Province on 17 January 1974. The Persian (Caucasian) leopard is still found in very small numbers in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Turkey. The Caspian tiger is an extinct tiger subspecies (closely related to the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger)</b> which lived in the easternmost regions of Turkey until {{the latter half of the}} 20th century, with the last confirmed death in Uludere, February 1970. The Eurasian lynx and the European wildcat are other felid species which are currently found in the forests of Turkey.|$|E
5|$|A future rewilding {{project was}} {{proposed}} for <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> {{set to be}} reintroduced to northern Russia's Pleistocene park. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>tigers</b> sent to Iran for a captive breeding project in Tehran are set to be rewilded and reintroduced to the Miankaleh peninsula, to replace the now extinct Caspian tigers.|$|R

5|$|The next day, CIA agent Lacey {{shows up}} at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a transdermal strip that will expose Kim to ricin via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the presidential palace in Pyongyang, they are {{introduced}} to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from an UAV, {{but in order to}} smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger)</b> are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E

25|$|The large, {{distinctive}} and powerful cats are popular zoo exhibits. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> is bred {{under the auspices}} of the Species Survival Plan (SSP), in a project based on 83 tigers captured in the wild. According to most experts, this population is large enough to stay stable and genetically healthy. Today, approximately 160 Siberian tigers participate in the SSP, which makes it the most extensively bred tiger subspecies within the program. Developed in 1982, the Species Survival Plan for the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> is the longest running program for a tiger subspecies. It has been very fortunate and productive, and the breeding program for the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> has actually been used as a good example when new programs have been designed to save other animal species from extinction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> (Panthera tigris altaica), {{also called}} Amur tiger, is a tiger {{subspecies}} inhabiting mainly the Sikhote Alin mountain region {{with a small}} population in southwest Primorye Province in the Russian Far East. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> once ranged throughout all of Korea, north-eastern China, Russian Far East, and eastern Mongolia. In 2005, there were 331–393 adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this region, with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals. The population had been stable {{for more than a}} decade due to intensive conservation efforts, but partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate that the Russian tiger population was declining. An initial census held in 2015 indicated that the <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> population had increased to 480–540 individuals in the Russian Far East, including 100 cubs. This was followed up by a more detailed census which revealed there was a total population of 562 wild Siberian tigers in Russia.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>Tiger</b> Project was founded, {{with the}} aim of {{providing}} a comprehensive picture of the ecology of the Amur tiger and the role of tigers in the Russian Far East through scientific studies. By capturing and outfitting tigers with radio collars, their social structure, land use patterns, food habits, reproduction, mortality patterns and their relation with other inhabitants of the ecosystem, including humans is studied. These data compilations will hopefully contribute toward minimizing poaching threats due to traditional hunting. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>Tiger</b> Project has been productive in increasing local capacity to address human-tiger conflict with a Tiger Response Team, part of the Russian government’s Inspection Tiger, which responds to all tiger-human conflicts; by continuing to enhance the large database on tiger ecology and conservation with the goal of creating a comprehensive <b>Siberian</b> <b>tiger</b> conservation plan; and training the next generation of Russian conservation biologists.|$|E
