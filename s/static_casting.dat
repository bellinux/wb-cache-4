40|$|Traditional {{sand casting}} {{is a well}} {{understood}} method to produce metal shapes and {{has been used for}} many years in industry. It is a relatively simple method but has a significant drawback, with the requirement of a pattern to form the internal cavity. Patterns are produced at high cost through Computer Numerical Controlled machining or wood pattern making with significantly high lead times. Rapid Prototyping is seen as a solution to this problem, with the ability to produce sand moulds directly from Computer Aided Design platforms and thus eliminate the requirement of a pattern. Through layered manufacturing, the sand mould can be produced with complex internal geometry directly, minimising labour costs and involving short waiting times. While initial research was mainly concerned with the use of Selective Laser Sintering, with the advent of 3 D printing, pattern-less sand moulds can be produced more easily and cheaply. With the process gaining more and more popularity, there was a need to scientifically assess the suitability of the process for sand casting as well as, establish influences of typical process parameters on significant responses. Critical mould properties, such as permeability and compressive strength, were investigated with respect to varying time and temperature of baking. To this end, mathematical models of permeability and compressive strength were developed. Also, the influence of mould material, mould coating, alloy type and pouring temperatures were investigated in static sand casting of light metals. Further work utilised the centrifugal casting process using these 3 D printed moulds to establish links between process factors, such as rotational speed and cast strength using light metals. Compressive strength results for the rapidly produced materials were acceptable compared to traditional values. Permeability was however lower than commonly used foundry sand. Results showed, nevertheless, that permeability and compressive strength were both improved by baking times and temperatures. Significant model effects were established for ZP 131 and ZCast 501 with respect to increased compressive strength and mould permeability. Multi-factorial experiments involving simultaneous variation of factors such as mould materials, surface coatings, alloys and pouring temperatures were conducted and <b>static</b> <b>casting</b> results in general show good as-cast mechanical properties with the factors having significant effects on surface roughness, percent elongation and hardness. Centrifugal casting of aluminium alloys initially produced below average tensile properties, due to the large presence of hydrogen porosity. However, upon degassing, much improved tensile strengths were obtained, being superior to both <b>static</b> <b>casting</b> and traditionally sand cast aluminium. Also a Magnesium alloy was successfully trialled with the centrifugal process using 3 D printed moulds in spite of numerous practical difficulties. Substantial data relating to the process factors for mould materials and casting processes was produced. Analysis of factor influences facilitated optimum process configurations for the production of moulds and castings. These combinations of factors at optimum levels comprehensively showed that light metals such as aluminium and magnesium alloys could be successfully processed by rapidly produced moulds, both statically and centrifugally...|$|E

40|$|Introduction 1 1. 0 Introduction The {{relative}} displacement between an object and its cast shadow in an image provides {{an important source}} of visual information about the spatial layout of objects. Leonardo da Vinci elucidated the principle relating shadow displacement and the perception of relative depth in his notebooks: " [...] . when representing objects above the eye and on one side [...] if you wish them to looked detached from the wall [...] show, between the shadow on the object and the shadow it casts, a middle light, so that the body will appear to stand away from the wall. " (da Vinci, 1970) Artists regularly exploit this principle in static drawings and paintings of 3 D scenes, and psychophysical research has shown the salience of <b>static</b> <b>cast</b> shadow information for judgments of depth (Yonas, 1978).

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) are being specified for chloride containing environments {{due to their}} enhanced pitting and stress corrosion cracking resistance. They exhibit improved corrosion performance over the austenitic {{stainless steels}}. Duplex stainless steels also offer improved strength properties and are available in various wrought and cast forms. Selected grades of duplex stainless steel castings and their welds, in comparison with their wrought counterparts, were evaluated, regarding corrosion performance and mechanical properties and weldability. Multiple heats of cast duplex stainless steel were evaluated in the as-cast, solution annealed (SA) <b>static</b> <b>cast</b> and SA centrifugal cast conditions, while their wrought counterparts were characterized in the SA condition and {{in the form of}} as-rolled plate. Welding, including extensive assessment of autogenous welds and a preliminary study of composite welds (shielded metal arc weld (SMAW)), was performed. The evaluations included critical pitting temperature (CPT) testing, intergranular corrosion (IGC) testing, ASTM A 923 (Methods A, B and C), Charpy impact testing, weldability testing (ASTM A 494), ferrite measurement and microstructural evaluations. In the study, the corrosion performances of DSS castings were characterized and assessed, including the wrought counterparts for comparison. The evaluation filled the pore of lack of data for cast duplex stainless steels compared to wrought materials. A database of the pitting corrosion and IGC behavior of cast and wrought materials was generated for a greater depth of understanding for the behavior of cast duplex stainless steel. In addition, improved evaluation methods for DSS castings were developed according to ASTM A 923, A 262, G 48 and A 494. The study revealed that when properly heat treated according to the specification, (1) DSS castings have equal or better pitting and intergranular corrosion resistance than their wrought counterparts; (2) Welding reduces the pitting and intergranular corrosion resistance for both the wrought and cast duplex alloys; (3) Castings generally have better toughness than their wrought counterparts in the temperature range of - 80 C to + 20 C; (4) All shield metal arc (SMA) test welds in DSS castings, with recommended or over matching filler metal, indicate that welding is not a significant factor when considering DSS applications...|$|R
40|$|The informativeness of a cast shadow or {{silhouette}} boundary contour for {{the perception}} of 3 -D object shape has been investigated for a long time. Some researchers {{have focused on the}} informativeness of static shadows (Attneave, 1954; Koenderink, 1984; Richards, Koenderink, 2 ̆ 6 Hoffman, 1987; Norman, Phillips, 2 ̆ 6 Ross, 2001; Tse, 2002) while other researchers have focused on the informativeness of moving or deforming shadows (Miles, 1931; Wallach, 2 ̆ 6 O 2 ̆ 7 Connell, 1953; Norman, 2 ̆ 6 Todd, 1994; Norman, Dawson, 2 ̆ 6 Raines, 2000; Norman, 2 ̆ 6 Raines, 2002). Past research has shown that changing the angle of illumination does not affect {{the perception of}} 3 -D shape from cast shadows (Norman et al., 2000). The current experiment extends the prior experiments by further investigating whether curved background surfaces (with both positive and negative Gaussian curvature) affect the perception and recognition of 3 -D object shape from deforming and/or <b>static</b> <b>cast</b> shadows. In this experiment, the observers viewed either deforming or static shadows of naturally shaped objects (bell-peppers) cast onto either flat, hemispherical, or saddle-shaped surfaces. The results revealed significant main effects of motion (deforming vs. static shadows), object, and the type of background surface. The results revealed that there were also a number of significant interactions involving particular objects, {{the presence or absence of}} motion, and the type of background surface. The observers 2 ̆ 7 ability to recognize objects from deforming shadows was higher than their ability to recognize objects from static shadows. In addition, the observers 2 ̆ 7 ability to recognize objects from the shadows cast onto the hemisphere background surface was generally as accurate as their ability to recognize objects from the shadows cast onto the flat plane. However, the observers 2 ̆ 7 ability to recognize the objects was reduced when the shadows were cast onto the saddle background surface. The results of the experiment confirm previous findings showing that shadow boundary contours, especially deforming contours, are perceptually informative and help observers to perceive and recognize 3 -D object shape. This experiment also extends previous studies by showing how differently curved background surfaces affect the perception and recognition of 3 -D object shape...|$|R
40|$|Localization in {{dynamically}} illuminated environments {{is often}} difficult due to <b>static</b> objects <b>casting</b> dynamic shadows. Feature extraction algorithms may detect both the objects and their shadows, producing conflict in localization algorithms. This work examines a colour model that separates brightness from chromaticity and applies it to eliminate features caused by dynamic illumination. The colour model is applied in two novel ways. Firstly, the chromaticity distortion of a single feature is used {{to determine if the}} feature is the result of illumination alone i. e. a shadow. Secondly, the chromaticity distortion of features matched between images is examined to determine if the monochrome based algorithm has matched them correctly. These two applications are put through a variety of tests in simulated then real world environments to assess their effectiveness in dynamically illuminated scenarios. The results demonstrate a significant {{reduction in the number of}} feature mismatches between images with dynamic light sources.

40|$|Only a small {{fraction}} of the output generated by typical static analysis tools tends to reveal serious software defects. Finding the important defects in a long list of warnings can be a frustrating experience. The output often reveals more about the limitations of the analyzer than about the code being analyzed. There are two main causes for this phenomenon. The first is that the typical <b>static</b> analyzer <b>casts</b> its nets too broadly, reporting everything reportable, rather than what is likely to be a true bug. The second cause is that most static analyzers can check the code for only a predetermined, fixed, set of bugs: the user cannot make the analyzer more precise by defining and experimenting with a broader range of application-dependent properties. We describe a source code analyzer called UNO that tries to remedy these problems. The default properties searched for by UNO are restricted to the three most common causes of serious error in C programs: use of uninitialized variables, nil-pointer dereferencing, and out-of-bound array indexing. The checking capabilities of UNO can be extended by the user with the definition of application-dependent properties, which can be written as simple ANSI-C functions...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} and to often neglected aspect in every freight transportation {{system is the}} presence of empty car ‡ows. Empty car ‡ows arise due to variations in the transportation demand, in the sense that in bound and out bound transportation ‡ows di¤er with respect to volume or weight.

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is the {{analysis}} of the materials and parameters related to the investment casting process,mainly focusing on peculiarities and criticisms of the casting of precious metals in jewelry production. Precious metals casting is traditionally and historically targeted to overcoming limitations in terms of geometries and final quality of the cast part. Moreover, an increasing interest rises concerning the use of new technologies and the industrializations of typical handcraft skills. New materials are therefore introduced into the process, {{in order to be able}} to get thin and intricate shapes, hollow parts and innovative design features. This is leading to a substantial rearranging of the process, with a constant innovation regarding technologies and medication of traditional materials. Considering the whole process, nvestment casting is dealing with a wide range of materials, from metallic, polymeric and ceramic classes. All these materials cannot be considered as single identities, but their synergetic behavior has to be studied, not just meaning that all of them contribute to the final quality of the cast part, but taking into account possible mutual interdependencies. The research work has been divided in a preliminary analysis of the process, in order to deepen the knowledge about material features, and in a extended study on the application of competences deriving from other sectors to the specific one. In fact it's almost impossible to find sector boundaries between jewelry and fashion accessories both in terms of process and in terms of market. Therefore {{the analysis of the}} state of the art has been widened to other processes and applications, in particular focusing on fashion accessories and eyewear component production. Market analysis clearly show a high interest of jewelry towards innovative processes/materials, often deriving from completely different fields of application. For this reason, an analysis of the investment casting process applied in the automotive and biomedical sectors can give valuable hints for the jewelry production optimization. Particular attention has also been paid to fluid dynamic analysis of the casting system, considering metal flow into the flask and following cooling and solidification. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamic has been applied to the process. Material analysis, needed for both the simulation and for a complete understanding of the process, has been carried out. Physical and thermal properties of metals and investment materials have been analyzed in order to get a proper database for casting simulation. Waxes and resins have been tested both in terms of thermal, mechanical and chemical characteristic, in order to understand their respective roles into the process and try to optimize them. Following the analysis, process implementation has been performed in order to apply information deriving from experimental tests to the process. Many parameters can be taken into account when optimizing precious metal casting; in order to focus the research activity, some limitation in terms of process have been applied.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the use of a}} underway sound velocity profiler and the application of sound velocity profiles measured with it to a multibeam survey in the Tamar Estuary, Plymouth, United Kingdom. The differences between rapid and <b>static</b> sound velocity <b>casts</b> from a miniSV and a rapidSV profiler were analysed, followed by an examination of the temporal and spatial sound velocity changes measured during fieldwork. Sound velocity profiles were then applied in an increasing number, to the multibeam data measured and the effect of this on the final grid and crosscheck statistics examined. Finally, ray tracing calculations were undertaken to determine the changes in sound velocity required to induce vertical errors that would make this survey exceed vertical and horizontal allowances for International Hydrographic Organisation Special Publication No. 44 classifications of survey – Special Order, Order 1 a and Order 1 b being considered in this area. The results of this study demonstrate that the Valeport rapidSV is comparable in accuracy to a static sound velocity profiler, however it is able to take significantly more casts with no survey downtime than a static probe. This enabled a clear understanding of the temporal and spatial changes in sound velocity within the survey area, most notably the intrusion of a salinity ‘wedge’ beginning two hours before high water. While processing multibeam data, it was found that when all rapidSV profiles were added to the data and used in the order in which they were taken (as opposed to averaged profiles created within the survey area) the best gridded results and crossline statistics were obtained. All data surveyed in this project was within Special Order Total Vertical Uncertainty limits, and an investigation into the range of sound velocities required to breach these limits found a difference of - 4. 879 ms- 1 or + 4. 692 ms- 1 was needed.

40|$|In this {{doctoral}} thesis, {{we compare}} the forecasting performance of three dynamic factor models on {{macroeconomic and financial}} datasets. The purpose {{of the first two}} chapters is to provide an incremental contribution with respect to the body of literature comparing static versus dynamic factor models. Previous literature compares the forecasting performance of the static factor model SW (see Stock and M. W. Watson, 2002 a, Stock and M. W. Watson, 2002 b) against those of the dynamic factor model FHLR (see Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin, 2000, Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin, 2005). This work adds a third dynamic factor model, which is the recently published FHLZ (see Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Zaffaroni, 2015, Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Zaffaroni, 2016). In the third chapter, we compare the forecasting performance of two <b>static</b> factor models <b>cast</b> in a state-space form. In the first one, the conditional moments of the factors are estimated under proper hypothesis of linearity and gaussianity of the data. In the second one, the assumptions of linearity and gaussianity are relaxed for the estimation of the conditional moments of the factors. Chapter 1 presents an application of the three factor models (SW, FHLR and FHLZ) for forecasting purposes. It compares the pseudo real-time forecast performances of the three factor models against a benchmark AR(4) (an autoregressive process of order 4) over a dataset of 176 EU macroeconomic and financial time series. In this exercise, FHLZ generally outperforms all methods on the forecasting of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Instead, no method seems to outperform the others in forecasting the Industrial Production (IP), but all dynamic factor models outperform the benchmark AR(4). Chapter 2 presents two applications on the same topic of the previous chapter. The most innovative part of these applications is that a genetic algorithm is employed to calibrate the three dynamic factor models. The first application exposed in this chapter employs the same dataset of Chapter 1. Instead, in the second application a dataset of 115 US macroeconomic and financial time series is employed. In this chapter, we show that FHLR tends globally to outperform the other methods on the real variables and that FHLZ tends globally to outperform the other methods on the nominal variables. As to EU dataset, in chapter 1 we found similar results for the CPI, but mixed evidences appeared for the IP. As to the US dataset, Forni, Giovannelli, et al., 2016 found similar but less significant results. Chapter 3 extends a previous study from Banbura and Modugno, 2014, by comparing the forecasting performance of a dynamic factor model cast in state-space form in which the conditional moments relative to the factors are estimated by means of the two following techniques: (i) Kalman filter: as in Banbura and Modugno, 2014, the conditional moments relative to the factors are estimated under the hypothesis that the data generating process (DGP) is linear and that the error terms follow a Gaussian distribution; (ii) Paticle Filter: in this case, the conditional moments relative to the factors are estimated in a more general framework, in which the DGP may be affected by sources of nonlinearity and in which the error terms may not follow a Gaussian distribution. Up to our knowledge, the estimation of the conditional moments of the factors by means of the Particle Filter has not been carried out yet. In this application, we employ the same Small dataset of 14 EU/US macroeconomic and financial time series from Banbura and Modugno, 2014. We show that the assumptions of linearity of the DGP and of a gaussian distribution for the error terms seems to hold in this macroeconomic setting. Hence, the estimation of the conditional moments of the factors by means of the Kalman Filter seems to be the more appropriate choice in macroeconomic forecasting. However, {{it is also possible that}} the particle filter may outperform in financial forecasting. As can be seen in Habibnia, 2017, it appears that accounting for the sources of nonlinearity in the DGP plays a more relevant role on forecasting financial variables...|$|R
