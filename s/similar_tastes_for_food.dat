In particular, it focuses on the moment when popular taste was seen as a serious problem by the GDR state—during the rise of the obesity epidemic in the 1970 s and 1980 s...|$|R

Inspired by cultural theories of taste and identity, this thesis explores end-to-end computational modeling of people's tastes- from model acquisition, to generalization, to application- under various realms. Five aesthetical realms are considered-cultural taste, attitudes, ways of perceiving, <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>food,</b> and sense-of-humor. A person's model is acquired by reading her personal texts, such as a weblog diary, a social network profile, or emails.

40|$|This paper reassesses and revisits the Sectoral Linder Hypothesis due to Hallak (2010), {{according}} to which <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> quality lead to more intensive trade between similar countries. First, it will be shown that allowing for strictly non-homothetic preferences reduces confoundedness and improves results. Moreover, the country/firm level extensive margin is taken into account. This approach allows controlling for unobserved firm level heterogeneity and selection bias (Helpman et al. 2008). The advantage in terms of interpretation is that differences in coefficients at the two margins {{can be linked to}} fixed cost effects. The attempt is to show that the Linder effect is confounded with fixed (opportunity) costs of trade thereby leading to downward biased results. There is some evidence that this effect is exacerbated at the aggregate, intersectoral level. Fixed (opportunity) costs seem to be higher in sectors where similar countries trade a lot. The evidence reinforces the sectoral Linder hypothesis, and suggests that the patterns might prevail at the more aggregate levels. Other robustness checks suggest that results are not confined to products that are vertically differentiated...|$|R

40|$|The legal {{structures}} of market supervision vary widely across countries and market sectors. The European Union frameworks for supervising national supervisors show a remarkably <b>similar</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> divergence. This project aims to increase oversight in those European Union aspects of supervision. In a first phase, {{the project will}} compare and contrast the European Union's legal organisation of market supervision in three different market sectors. It will consider the decentralisation of European competition law supervision, the centralisation of European financial supervision and the approaches to supervision in liberalised markets, more specifically {{in the market for}} railway transport. Throughout the comparison of those approaches, this phase aims at analysing the specificities of sectored supervisory structures. In addition, it will propose possible improvements to specific supervisory problems in light of experiences and alternative structures in different supervisory sectors. The second phase of the project will analyse the abovementioned supervisory structures in light of the foundations of the Internal Market and the search for a European economic constitution. Market supervision will be considered a means to market integration and the different supervisory approaches will be analysed from that point of view. The aim of this research phase is not to design an optimal European supervisory model. Rather, it aims to contribute to the incorporation of supranational supervision in more general (economic) theories about European federalism and market regulation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses a novel {{approach}} to investigate how food consumption in Japan may change as Japanese consumers become more westernised in their <b>tastes</b> and preferences <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> It is widely believed that as food prices in Japan fall to international levels and as Japanese consumers become more westernised in their <b>taste</b> and preferences <b>for</b> <b>food,</b> their meat consumption patterns, in particular, will approach those of western countries. The approach undertaken in this paper involves a comprehensive survey of Japanese expatriates in Los Angeles, California, regarding their food consumption habits. The findings are interesting as they {{shed some light on}} the changing nature of food consumption of accultured Japanese faced with competitive food prices. The results indicate that although household meat consumption of Japanese expatriates have changed, it remains debatable, however, that their food consumption habits will approach those of western consumers in the foreseeable future. The findings have important implications <b>for</b> <b>food</b> marketeers in Japan and elsewhere, particularly as further liberalisation of food import in that country gains momentum...|$|R
