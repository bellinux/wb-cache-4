500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Cage {{underwent}} {{an artistic}} {{crisis in the}} early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned {{with the idea of}} art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: [...] "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer was saying <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had little understanding of his language. And I found other people misunderstanding what I myself was saying when I was saying something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about Indian music in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was [...] "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.|$|E

And she persuaded herself (also under the {{influence}} of [...] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land." ...|$|E

"I walked, sir, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had no money; but I {{assure you}} I {{did not mean}} to be insolent. <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> came here <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wished to ask your advice and assistance, not because you are an {{important}} person, and have a long avenue--as I know to my cost--but <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> you are one of my trustees." ...|$|R

I am furious with myself, <b>simply</b> <b>because,</b> although <b>I</b> have lived {{a great part of}} my life with men, on equal terms with them, working with them, playing with them, seeing more of them at all times than of my own sex, such a thing has never happened to me before." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Rygg commented on the collaboration with Christian Fennesz: “He remixed a song off Perdition City. I wanted Christian to leave his signature on this album <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> love his stuff, {{and he has a}} similar story to ours. He's not at home in his own genre. That [...] "harsh" [...] noise stuff does not appeal to me at all. It lacks the fingerspitzengefühl that turn songs like Christian's [...] "Chateau Rouge" [...] or [...] "A Year in a Minute" [...] into something special. He makes white noise sound like sunlight dappling in the Mediterranean.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Still more {{influences}} {{include the}} novels of Thai humorist Por Intharapalit and an old Thai pop ballad, [...] "Fon Sang Fah" [...] ("When the Rain Bids the Sky Farewell"). [...] "I do love those 'rain' songs. I kept picturing a beautiful frame of two guys shooting {{each other in the}} rain. And that sparked it all", Wisit said in an interview for the film's production notes. Initially Fon Sang Fah was to be the title of the film, but eventually Fah talai jone (literally [...] "the heavens strike the thief") was chosen because the name has different meanings depending on the context. In addition to being the Thai name for an herb, Andrographis paniculata, Fah talai jone [...] "can convey either a sense of obsoleteness or the feel of great chic", the director said. [...] "In terms of the film it refers to predestination, in which most Thais believe. To put it frankly, the main reason is <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> liked the name." ...|$|E

[...] Then she added, [...] "I shall say nothing about it, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> mother and <b>I</b> never talk about anything. You needn't mention it unless you care to, Fan. I really don't believe that mother would feel any {{interest}} in the subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His heart, {{his mind}} {{were full of}} that experience. He was really awed by it, and he was simple enough to let it appear in his speeches. He {{considered}} himself a sort of privileged person, not because a woman had {{looked at him with}} favour, but <b>simply</b> <b>because,</b> how shall <b>I</b> say it, he had had the wonderful illumination of his worship for her, as if it were heaven itself that had done this for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Leonard," [...] she said, [...] "you are {{not very}} clever at hiding your feelings. When you {{came to see me}} the other day, do you imagine I {{believed}} for a single moment that you asked me to marry you <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> you cared? <b>I</b> think, Leonard, that it was because you were afraid, you were afraid of something coming into your life so big, so terrifying, that you were ready to clutch at the easiest chance of safety." ...|$|R

The Sydney Morning Herald said the [...] "The King Has Lost His Crown" [...] is [...] "an interesting song with some neat variations in style". Internet reviewer George Starostin said it [...] "is simply way too pompous and ambitious to be endured". ABBA biograph Carl Magnus Palm said [...] "Perhaps there's ... a sense of [...] "undiscovered gem" [...] about Voulez-Vous, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> what <b>I</b> feel were the best tracks were never international single A-sides, such as 'As Good As New', 'The King Has Lost His Crown' and 'If It Wasn’t For The Nights'." ...|$|R

His family was quite large, as he himself points out in the preface to the book X… Roman Impromptu: “If seventy cities vie for the honour of having given birth to me, it’s not because I’m ten times more famous than Homer, but <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> the name <b>I</b> bear is more common.” At the time, there were several authors and scriptwriters with the same surname, such as Jean-Pierre Veber and Serge Veber; with whom Pierre worked from time to time.|$|R
5000|$|Autumn was {{published}} on 20 October 2016, {{less than four}} months after the UK's European Union membership referendum. Talking about the work's origins, and its three projected sequels, Smith said: [...] "I've been thinking about writing a seasonal series of books for about 20 years now, and in 2014, after finishing How to Be Both, I realised it was time to start. This might <b>simply</b> be <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew now it was possible, after Hamish Hamilton made such a beautiful finished book-form for How to be Both {{in a matter of weeks}} (!), to turn a book around quite speedily compared to the usual time it takes, and this excited me about how closely to contemporaneousness a finished book might be able to be in the world, and yet how it could also be, all through, very much about stratified, cyclic time." ...|$|R

You've no right to speak to me of Mr. Granville Kelmscott. I refused your advances, not for any one else's sake, or any one else's estate, but <b>simply</b> and solely <b>because</b> <b>I</b> came to know you better than I knew you at first; and the more I knew of you the less I liked you.

6000|$|These poems {{were written}} under the {{pressure}} of the events they indicate, after a residence in Italy of so many years that the present triumph of great principles is heightened to the writer's feelings by the disastrous issue of the last movement, witnessed from [...] "Casa Guidi Windows" [...] in 1849. Yet, if the verses should appear to English readers too pungently rendered to admit of a patriotic respect to the English sense of things, I will not excuse myself on such grounds, nor on the ground of my attachment to the Italian people and my admiration of their heroic constancy and union. What I have written has <b>simply</b> been written <b>because</b> <b>I</b> love truth and justice quand même,--"more than Plato" [...] and Plato's country, more than Dante and Dante's country, more even than Shakespeare and Shakespeare's country.|$|R

60|$|Now on {{both these}} {{occasions}} I {{had been in}} the company of people who spent at least as much in a week as I did in a year. Why was I, a penniless and unknown young man, admitted there? <b>Simply</b> <b>because,</b> though <b>I</b> was an execrable pianist, and never improved until the happy invention of the pianola made a Paderewski of me, I could play a simple accompaniment at sight more congenially to a singer than most amateurs. It is true that the musical side of London society, with its streak of Bohemianism, and its necessary toleration of foreign ways and professional manners, is far less typically English than the sporting side or the political side or the Philistine side; so much so, indeed, that people may and do pass their lives in it without ever discovering what English plutocracy in the mass is really like: still, if you wander in it nocturnally for a fitful year or so as I did, with empty pockets and an utter impossibility of approaching it by daylight (owing to the deplorable decay of the morning wardrobe), you have something more actual to go on than the hallucinations of a peasant lad setting his foot manfully on the lowest rung of the social ladder. I never climbed any ladder: I have achieved eminence by sheer gravitation; and I hereby warn all peasant lads not to be duped by my pretended example into regarding their present servitude as a practicable first step to a celebrity so dazzling that its subject cannot even suppress his own bad novels.|$|R
