5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> it became part of his popular image.|$|E
25|$|Hack further {{reported}} that, {{during the}} 1940s and 1950s, Hoover attended social events with Lela Rogers, the divorced mother of dancer and actress Ginger Rogers, <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> {{many of their}} mutual friends assumed the pair would eventually marry.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Freddie Mercury, George assumed the name of Barry Bulsara (Mercury's real surname) and {{claimed to be the}} singer's cousin. He would visit Mercury's home and {{approach}} female fans; this happened <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> the Queen International Fan Club called the police to report George.|$|E

25|$|The {{state of}} North Carolina owns the North Carolina Railroad Company, {{which owns the}} land and the bridge. (North Carolina Railroad owns no rolling stock, but leases tracks to Amtrak and Norfolk Southern Railway.) A heavy steel crash beam protects the bridge from over-height trucks, but does nothing to prevent crashes or protect the trucks. The crash beam has been hit <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> it has had to be {{replaced}} at least once.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>that</b> he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E
25|$|The keys of the {{keyboard}} are connected by vertical pushrods to the escapements. When a key is pressed, the corresponding escapement is actuated, which releases a matrix from the magazine. With one exception, each key corresponds {{directly to a}} channel in the standard (90channel) magazine. The one exception is the lower-case letter e: that letter is used <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> the 90 channel magazine actually has 91 channels, with two channels (the leftmost two) both used for the letter e. Similarly, the 72channel magazine actually has 73channels, with the leftmost two being used for lower-case e. Alternate lines release matrices alternately from the two e channels in the magazine.|$|E

But he saved me all right. If it hadn't been for him I'd have got a mauling. Alphonso gets these bad streaks just about every <b>so</b> <b>often.</b> <b>That's</b> the second dog he's killed for me." ...|$|R

25|$|On 18 June 1855, the besieging British and French armies began {{what was}} {{intended}} to be the final assault that would take Sevastopol, which began with a huge bombardment. As a sapper, Gordon was in a front line trench where he was under intense fire, men fell all around him and he was forced to take cover <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> he was literally covered from head to toe with mud, blood and gore. Despite the best efforts of the Allies, the French failed to take the Malakhov fortress while the British failed to take the Redan fortress on 18 June. The casualties on the Allied side were quite high that day.|$|E
25|$|Wilmot Hudson Fysh {{was born}} in the city of Launceston in Tasmania, Australia, on 7 January 1895. His father, Frederick Wilmot Fysh, was a merchant, while his mother, Mary (née Reed), was the {{daughter}} of a famous landowner, Henry Reed. Fysh was the oldest of five siblings; Hudson, Henry, Margaret, Mary and Graham. He was also the great-nephew of Sir Philip Fysh. His childhood was marred by the failure of his parents' marriage and his father's business. Originally staying with his father, he ran away <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> eventually he was able to stay with his mother. Living in St Leonardsa suburb of Launcestonuntil 1914, he enlisted in the Light Horse upon the start of World War I.|$|E
25|$|Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} western edge of the Pennsylvania frontier. The pacifist Quakers {{generally}} had good relations with the Native Americans—but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to relocate further west. Boone received his first rifle in 1749, beginning his lifelong love of hunting. Folk tales often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone is hunting in the woods with some other boys. The scream of a panther scatters the boys, except for Boone, who calmly cocks his squirrel gun and shoots the animal through the heart just as it leaps at him. As with so many tales about Boone, the story may or may not be true, but it was told <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> it became part of the popular image of the man.|$|E

25|$|The Fridge Gate {{method is}} a {{theoretical}} application {{of using a}} single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates {{on the fact that}} there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the fridge, the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the fridge, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the fridge where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.|$|E

500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} film {{one and a}} half stars out of four, saying that [...] "after all the Internet hype about those motherfuckin' snakes on that motherfuckin' plane, the flick itself is a murky stew of shock effects {{repeated}} <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> the suspense quickly droops along with your eyelids." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker claimed that the film [...] "... may mark a new participatory style in marketing, but it still gulls an allegedly knowing audience with the pseudo-morality of yesteryear." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{wardrobe}} {{consisted of}} dresses, gowns, and suits made by luxury designers, including James Galanos, Bill Blass, and Oscar de la Renta. Her white, hand-beaded, one shoulder Galanos 1981 inaugural gown {{was estimated to}} cost $10,000, while the overall price of her inaugural wardrobe was said to cost $25,000. She favored the color red, calling it [...] "a picker-upper", and wore it accordingly. Her wardrobe included red <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> the fire-engine shade became known as [...] "Reagan red". She employed two private hairdressers, who would style her hair {{on a regular basis}} in the White House.|$|E
500|$|In the runup to the campaign, Aberhart {{promised to}} {{increase}} Albertans' purchasing power by providing monthly dividends to all {{citizens in the}} form of non-negotiable [...] "credit certificates". While he did not commit to any specific dividend amount, he cited $20 and, later, $25 per month as reasonable figures. Though he noted that these figures were given [...] "only for illustrative purposes", he repeated them <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that,</b> in the assessment of his biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller, [...] "it would have been impossible for any regular listener not to have gained the impression that Aberhart was promising him $25 a month if Social Credit should come to power." ...|$|E

500|$|A special {{subcommittee}} of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the MAUD Committee, was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and Philip Moon. While other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques, Chadwick's team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be [...] or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant Luftwaffe bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> they were replaced by cardboard.|$|E
500|$|As Voltaire himself {{described}} it, {{the purpose}} of Candide was to [...] "bring amusement to {{a small number of}} men of wit". The author achieves this goal by combining his sharp wit with a fun parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death [...] "as coolly as a weather report". The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again. In the end, Candide is primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, [...] "short, light, rapid and humorous".|$|E
500|$|Remembered {{well for}} his turns of phrase and his puns, Wanderone once wrote, [...] "If you {{happened}} to drive from Mobile to Dowell [...] with a carload of pool hustlers, {{you would get}} bit so hard and <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>that</b> you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well", a reference {{not only to the}} area's notorious mosquitos but also the predatory nature of hustlers. Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, [...] "Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg." [...] Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.|$|E
30|$|The {{overheads}} of {{the direct}} and mmap methods over the indirect method are much smaller than those measured only for memory allocation. This is because 1) memory allocation is {{only a part of}} the processes of compiling and linking files, and 2) the malloc library function usually utilizes allocated memory by recycling freed regions. Therefore, the allocation of main memory pages does not happen <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the performance differences of the proposed methods are mitigated.|$|R

"The {{war against}} the Spaniards, who, of all the nations subdued by the Romans, defended their liberty with the {{greatest}} obstinacy... the Romans in both provinces were <b>so</b> <b>often</b> beaten, <b>that</b> nothing was more dreaded by the soldiers at home than to be sent there...|$|R
50|$|It is hinted by Puppen that Gertrude {{has been}} known to make human friends every <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> but <b>that</b> they don't last. Sahara's {{friendship}} is the first that lasted this long, and the first case where's he stayed in one place. He falls in love with her.|$|R
