50|$|Weight on bit is {{provided}} by drill collars, which are thick-walled tubular pieces machined from solid bars of steel, usually plain carbon steel but sometimes of nonmagnetic nickel-copper alloy or other nonmagnetic premium alloys. Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the <b>surface</b> <b>weight</b> measured while the bit is just off {{the bottom of the}} wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20,000 pounds kg less weight than with the bit off bottom, then there should be 20,000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole). Some downhole MWD sensors can measure weight-on-bit more accurately and transmit the data to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} influence for Winsor {{during this}} time was American dance, choreographer, and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer. Rainer’s work was experimental and its intention was to put the body back into abstraction and use it along with motion to create shape. Her performances were often based on particular actions or tasks, which Winsor felt had a relationship {{to the ways in}} which she herself performed tasks in her own work. Winsor remarked, [...] "What interested me was that these abstractions had a physical presence because they were acted out with bodies ," [...] as opposed to [...] "the hands-off sensibility toward abstraction" [...] typically seen in Minimalist sculpture. Winsor uses very involved, hands-on processes to create her sculptures, including nailing, wrapping, joining, and measuring. Winsor’s work-flow has been described as being slow and obsessive. On average. Winsor produces only three sculptures a year. Winsor describes, “Maintaining integrity toward the perfection you envisioned in the beginning is a constant concern. I spend an enormous amount of time just trying to imagine if an eighth of an inch at some point is going to make a major difference in the completed construction of the piece.” Her work not only examines form and material, but also process, space, <b>surface,</b> <b>weight,</b> and density. Winsor asserts her role as an object-maker by creating works with clear material integrity.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} program for aircraft synthesis using a numerical optimizer {{was developed to}} study {{the application of the}} joined-wing configuration to transport aircraft. The structural design algorithm included the effects of secondary bending moments to investigate the possibility of tail buckling and to design joined wings resistant to buckling.

A variety of 'optimum' joined-wing and conventional aircraft designs were compared on the basis of direct operating cost, gross weight, and cruise drag. The most promising joined-wing designs were found to have a joint location at about 70 percent of the wing semispan.

30|$|A {{new class}} of {{corrosion}} inhibitors, namely, polyethyleneiminemethylene phosphonic acid (PEIMPA), was synthesized and its inhibiting action on the corrosion of C 38 steel in 1  M HCl at 30  °C was investigated by various corrosion monitoring techniques such as weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic polarization, linear polarization resistance (Rp), and surface analysis (SEM and EDX) which are used to characterize the steel <b>surface.</b> <b>Weight</b> loss measurements revealed {{that the presence of}} PEIMPA increases the inhibition efficiency by decreasing the corrosion rate. Tafel polarization study showed that the inhibitor acts as a mixed-type inhibitor. Adsorption of PEIMPA on the carbon steel surface was found to obey the Langmuir isotherm. Some thermodynamic functions of dissolution and adsorption processes were also determined and discussed. The SEM results showed the formation of protective film on the mild steel surface in the presence of PEIMPA. The results obtained from different tested techniques were in good agreement.|$|E

40|$|Investigations on PA 6 -GF 50 {{integral}} foams {{have been}} carried out using different material systems: longfiber- and shortfiber-reinforced PA 6 as well as unreinforced PA 6 as a reference material. Both chemical and physical blowing agents were applied. Breathing mold technology (decompression of the mold) was selected for the foaming process. The integral foam design, which can be conceived as a sandwich structure, helps to save material in the neutral axis area and maintains a distance between load-bearing, unfoamed skin layers. For all test series an initial mold gap of 2. 5 mm was chosen and the same amount of material was injected. In order to realize different density reductions, the mold opening stroke was varied. The experiments showed that, at a constant mass per unit area, integral polyamide 6 foams have a significantly higher bending stiffness than compact components, due to their higher area moment of inertia after foaming. At a constant <b>surface</b> <b>weight</b> the bending stiffness in these experiments could be increased by up to 600 %.

Title of the diploma thesis: The Use of Nanofibers as a Sorbent for Solid Phase Extraction The {{thesis is}} focused on the ability of {{polyamide}} 6 nanofibers to efficiently sorb chemical compounds with various physico-chemical properties and on the use of polyamide 6 nanofibers as a modern sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE). Analytes from the groups parabens, steroids and flavonoids were chosen as model analytes based on previous studies. Fenoxycarb, permethrin and hydroxypyrene were also tested because polyamid 6 demonstrated good effectivity for lipophilic compounds during the experiment.

There were made three types of polyamide 6 nanofibers with different <b>surface</b> <b>weight.</b> The effect of these various surface properties was also evaluated in the study.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{prediction}} of transonic flutter by the Euler equations on a Cartesian mesh is presented. Surface boundary conditions are applied using a perturbation of a gridless treatment {{in such a manner}} that solutions are obtained on a stationary mesh. For steady problems, the gridless method applies surface boundary conditions using a weighted average of the flow properties within a cloud of nodes {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>surface.</b> <b>Weight</b> functions are derived based on a least squares fitting of the surrounding cloud of nodes. For unsteady calculations, a perturbation of the weight functions is incorporated to account for a fluctuating surface normal direction. Additionally, a varying surface normal velocity is introduced into the boundary treatment. The nature of the method provides for efficient and accurate solution of transient problems in which surface deflections are small (i. e. flutter calculations) without the need for a deforming mesh. Problem setup also requires minimal effort due to the use of patched embedded Cartesian grids. Although deviations in the airfoil angle of attack are small, the mean angle of attack can be large, being prescribed by the far field boundary condition. Results show good agreement with available experimental data and wing flutter computations using traditional moving mesh algorithms considering a two-degree of freedom structural wing model...|$|E
