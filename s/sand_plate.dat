40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the rates of}} the main microbiological processes (primary production, aerobic and anaerobic carbon degradation) and transport phenomena in an intertidal <b>sand</b> <b>plate</b> {{with a combination of}} in situ microsensor mea-surements and incubations. The sand was coarse, organically poor (0. 6 – 1 mg of total organic carbon per gram dry weight of sediment), and highly permeable to water flow (k 5 1. 5 – 7 3 10211 m 2). Aerobic respiration rates ranged from 105 to 175 mmol m 22 d 21, sulfate reduction rates from 0. 08 to 13. 7 mmol m 22 d 21, and net primary production, 35 mmol m 22 d 21. In situ microsensor measurements showed large changes in oxygen and sulfide concentrations in the top 10 cm, depending on tides and waves. The observed dynamics and high aerobic degradation rates imply that pressure gradients drive advective influx of oxygen and organic material from the water column into the sediments. Our results show that intertidal porous sand plates have high aerobic degradation rates, despite having an organic matter content that is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of fine-grained deposits with similar decomposition rates. Sandy sediments are generally thought to harbor less mi-crobial activity than muddy sediments because of the lower organic matter content and microbial cell numbers (Jickells and Rae 1997; Llobet-Brossa et al. 1998).

40|$|The {{invention}} of technology for land reclamation in the 10 th century started a unique {{transformation in the}} delta. Sand plates were dike-ed and pumped and became polders. Examples of early harbor cities created on the dike-ring are Ooltgensplaat and Oude Tonge. These cities were founded at the main creek of a <b>sand</b> <b>plate.</b> The polders created a condition for more sediment deposition, due to the hard edges of the dikes. Outside the dike-ring sediment cumulated and formed new sand plates. These sand plates {{formed the basis of}} a new adjacent polder and a new harbor settlement. The latest polders date from 1930 's, but technically the process came to an end in 1953 with a stop of sediment transportation in the delta. The Watersnoodramp in 1953 led to the engineering of a great and expensive water defense project that would protect the inhabitants of the Southwest Delta against probable storm surges. Shortening the Dutch coast line and closing the Dutch Southwest Delta. However, the Delta Werken caused complications that were not predicted in time of planning and construction. The world known water defenses created environmental problems as blue algae in the Krammer Volkerak, lack of oxygen in the Grevelingenmeer, and the deciline of sand plates and fish migration in all the water bodies. [Programmabureau Zuidwestelijk Delta, 2009] Today, these problems triggered the discussion of re-opening the estuaries of the Dutch Southwest Delta. The graduation project provides research by design on the spatial implementation of the paradigm 'working with nature' in an open Dutch Southwest Delta. The open delta scenario, as proposed by H+N+S (Toekomstbeeld ZW Delta) and WNF (Met Open Armen), gradually restores the delta dynamics in the Krammer Volkerak. The process towards an open delta not only provides a form of the urban landscape. It also contains a new and innovative approach by integrally constituting value in the urban, cultural and natural layer. The new relation of delta cities with water, nature development combined with fresh water storage and day-recreation depict a scenario that sustains the dynamics of a natural delta landscape, social initiative and the improvement of the socio-economic condition of the delta cities Oude Tonge and Ooltgensplaat.

Enumeration by epifluorescence direct counts, oil <b>sand</b> hydrocarbon <b>plate</b> counts, and most-probable-number determinations of [14 C]hexadecane and [14 C]-naphthalene degraders indicated that only the plate count was sensitive to increased numbers of oil sand-related hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms within the oil sands deposit.

Although the biodegradation potentials and the endogenous hydrocarbon plate counts indicated an oil sand-adapted mixed sediment population, the results of these techniques did not correlate well with the concentrations of bituminous hydrocarbons in the sediments.

Analogue experiments model the convergence between two lithospheric plates, a small continent indenting a large continental plate. We show that the surface deformation in front of the indenter and above the oceanic subduction zone depends on the behaviour of the slab below the collision zone. Slab break-off following the subduction of the small continent favours the indentation process, because it results in an increasing compression in front of the indenter, and extension above the neighbouring oceanic subduction, both of them being responsible for the appearance of the indenter-like geometry of the plate boundary. When the slab does not deform significantly at depth, in contrast, the closure of the oceanic domain in front of the indenter is followed by a longer period of continental subduction, during which the tectonic regime within the wide continent remains quite homogeneous.

For low values of <b>sand</b> mass, the <b>plate</b> resonance decreases with added mass and eventually reaches a minimum without particle size dependence. After the minimum, a frequency increase is observed with additional mass that includes a particle-size effect. Analytical nondissipative continuum models for granular media capture the observed particle-size dependence qualitatively but not quantitatively. In addition, a continuum-based finite element model (FEM) of a two-layer plate is used, with the sand layer replaced by an equivalent elastic layer for evaluation of the effective properties of the layer. Given a thickness of sand layer and corresponding experimental resonance, an inverse FEM problem is solved iteratively to give the effective Young’s modulus and bending stiffness that matches the experimental frequency.

Factors involved in adherence to abiotic surfaces are likely to be used in rhizobial attachment to legume root cells. In this report, we show that S. meliloti exopolysaccharide-deficient mutants as well as exopolysaccharide overproducers exhibit reduced biofilm phenotypes that show parallels with their nodulation abilities. We also investigated two flagella-less S. meliloti mutants and found them to have reduced biofilming capabilities. To investigate whether there was a symbiotic phenotype, we tested one of the Fla(-) mutants on two different S. meliloti hosts, alfalfa and white sweetclover, and found that nodule formation was significantly delayed on the latter...|$|R
40|$|Post-blast {{residues}} {{are potential}} interferents to chemical detection of landmines. To assess the potential problem related to 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), its post-blast residue was identified and quantified. In {{the first part}} of this study laboratory-scale samples of TNT (2 g) were detonated in a small-scale explosivity device (SSED) to evaluate the explosive power and collect post-blast residue for chemical analysis. Initiator size was large relative to the TNT charge; thus, issues arose regarding choice of initiator, residue from the initiator and afterburning of TNT. The second part of this study detonated 75 g to 150 g of military-grade TNT (typical of antipersonnel mines) in 55 gallon barrels containing various witness materials (metal <b>plates,</b> <b>sand,</b> barrel walls, the atmosphere). The witness materials were analyzed for explosive residue. In a third set of tests, 75 g samples of TNT were detonated over soil [from Fort Leonard Wood or Sandia National Laboratory] in an indoor firing chamber (100 m x 4. 6 m x 2. 7 m high). Targeted in these studies were TNT and four explosive related compounds (ERC) : 2, 4 -dintrotoluene (DNT), 1, 3 -dinitrobenzene (DNB), 2 - and 4 -aminodinitrotoluene (2 ADNT and 4 -ADNT). The latter two are microbial degradation products of TNT. Post-blast residue was allowed to age i...|$|R
