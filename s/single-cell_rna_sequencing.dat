40|$|In this dissertation, we used <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{data from}} five {{mammalian}} tissues to characterize patterns of gene expression across single cells, transcriptome-wide {{and in a}} cell-type-specific manner (Part 1). Additionally, we characterized <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> methods {{as a resource for}} experimental design and data analysis (Part 2). Part 1 : Differentiation of metazoan cells requires execution of different gene expression programs but recent single cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable variation within cells of seemingly identical phenotype. This brings into question the relationship between transcriptome states and cell phenotypes. We used high quality single cell RNA sequencing for 107 single cells from five mammalian tissues, along with 30 control samples, to characterize transcriptome heterogeneity across single cells. We developed methods to filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate biological variation. We found evidence that ubiquitous expression across cells may be indicative of critical gene function and that, for a subset of genes, biological variability within each cell type may be regulated in order to perform dynamic functions. We also found evidence that single-cell variability of mouse pyramidal neurons was correlated with that in rats consistent with the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved. Part 2 : Many researchers are interested in <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> for use in identification and classification of cell types, finding rare cells, and studying single-cell expression variation; however, experimental and analytic methods for <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> are young and there is little guidance available for planning experiments and interpreting results. We characterized <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> measurements in terms of sensitivity, precision and accuracy through analysis of data generated in a collaborative control project, where known reference RNA was diluted to single-cell levels and amplified using one of three <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> protocols.

40|$|Summary: Therapies {{targeting}} epidermal {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) have variable and unpredictable responses in breast cancer. Screening triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we identify a subset responsive to EGFR inhibition by gefitinib, which displays heterogeneous expression of wild-type EGFR. Deep <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> of 3, 500 cells from an exceptional responder identified subpopulations displaying distinct biological features, where elevated EGFR expression was significantly enriched in a mesenchymal/stem-like cellular cluster. Sorted EGFRhi subpopulations exhibited enhanced stem-like features, including ALDH activity, sphere-forming efficiency, and tumorigenic and metastatic potential. EGFRhi cells gave rise to EGFRhi and EGFRlo cells in primary and metastatic tumors, demonstrating an EGFR-dependent expansion and hierarchical state transition. Similar tumorigenic EGFRhi subpopulations were identified in independent PDXs, where heterogeneous EGFR expression correlated with gefitinib sensitivity. This provides new understanding for an EGFR-dependent hierarchy in TNBC and for patient stratification for therapeutic intervention. : Savage et al. demonstrate that sensitivity to EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib, in triple-negative breast cancer is paradoxically associated with EGFR heterogeneity. Using <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> in conjunction with functional assays, they identify TNBC tumors in which EGFR expression identifies cells with tumor-initiating capacity whose proliferative expansion is sensitive to EGFR inhibition.

In patients with breast cancer, <b>single-cell</b> resolution <b>RNA</b> <b>sequencing</b> of CTC clusters and single CTCs, matched within individual blood samples, identifies the cell junction component plakoglobin as highly differentially expressed.
