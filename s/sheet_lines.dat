5000|$|The {{running rigging}} that sets or trims the junk sail (controls {{the angle of}} attack {{relative}} to {{the direction of the}} wind) is the sheet. On a traditional Chinese junk rig, the sail is controlled by sheetlets—small <b>sheet</b> <b>lines</b> running from the battens to blocks that in turn are on lines running through a euphroe, a long piece of wood with holes in it. This helps maintain uniform tension in each panel of the sail. Western ship designers Tom Colvin, Michael Kasten and Herbert [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler use the same technique, but others (such as Derek Van Loan and Phil Bolger) use a simplified design without euphroes.|$|E

40|$|After {{implementing}} CGCS 2000,the {{establishment of}} the high precise coordinate transformation grid model which is mainly used to transform <b>sheet</b> <b>lines</b> and coordinate grids of topographic map becomes important to be solved in the mapping application. The establishment method of the high precise coordinate transformation grid model of CGCS 2000 is proposed. First,the minimum curvature equation of coordinate transformation is discussed. And it possesses both the whole and local smooth characteristics,so it can be better in keeping with consecutive smooth characteristics for the coordinate transformation of map's linear feature. Second,the iterative calculation method of grid nodes and the establishment method of regional grid model using the resolution of collocation by two minimization steps are advanced. The data structure of grid model is constructed. Third,the countrywide optimized grid interval and transformation precision of high precise coordinate transformation grid model of CGCS 2000 are presented. The coordinate transformation grid models from BJS 54 and XAS 80 to the CGCS 2000 have been constructed using 48 433 points of 2000 national geodetic control network of China,and the positioning external accuracy of both models are 0. 26 m and 0. 03 m respectively...|$|E
