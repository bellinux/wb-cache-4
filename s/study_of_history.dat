25|$|Returning to {{the local}} Lycée Henry-IV, he studied history and {{philosophy}} for a year, aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher Louis Girard. Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to Paris, where he enrolled {{in one of the}} country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the Lycée Henri-IV. Here he studied under the philosopher Jean Hyppolite, an existentialist and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the dialectical theories of Hegel and Karl Marx. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach to the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact}} that it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{continued}} to study languages {{during his time}} as principal of the Agricultural and Mechanical College. Already familiar with Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, he developed a good knowledge of Sanskrit, Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, German, and French. Between 1871 and 1874, he was a frequent contributor of editorial content to local publications and newspapers, including {{a series of articles}} on tariffs and foreign policy which appeared in the Louisville Courier-Journal. In 1875, his alma mater, Hanover College, presented him with an honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree. During his later academic career, Patterson devoted more time to the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> metaphysics, and political science. In 1880, he was elected a fellow of both the British Royal Historical Society and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. In 1896, Lafayette College conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.|$|E
25|$|Bolingbroke retired baffled and {{disappointed}} from the fray to France in June, residing principally at the château of Argeville near Fontainebleau. He now wrote his Letters on the <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> <b>History</b> (printed privately {{before his death}} and published in 1752), and the True Use of Retirement. In 1738, he visited England, {{became one of the}} leading friends and advisers of Frederick, Prince of Wales, who now headed the opposition, and wrote for the occasion The Patriot King, which together with a previous essay, The Spirit of Patriotism, and The State of Parties at the Accession of George I, were entrusted to Pope and not published. Having failed, however, to obtain any share in politics, he returned to France in 1739, and subsequently sold Dawley. In 1742 and 1743, he again visited England and quarrelled with Warburton. In 1744, he settled finally at Battersea with his friend Hugh Hume, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, and was present at Pope's death in May. The discovery that the poet had printed secretly 1500 copies of The Patriot King, caused him to publish a correct version in 1749, and stirred up a further altercation with Warburton, who defended his friend against Bolingbroke's bitter aspersions, the latter, whose conduct was generally reprehended, publishing a Familiar Epistle to the most Impudent Man Living.|$|E

500|$|In his Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life (1765), Lectures on History and General Policy (1788), {{and other}} works, Priestley {{argued that the}} {{education}} of the young should anticipate their future practical needs. This principle of utility guided his unconventional curricular choices for Warrington's aspiring middle-class students. He recommended modern languages instead of classical languages and modern rather than ancient history. Priestley's lectures on history were particularly revolutionary; he narrated a providentialist and naturalist account of history, arguing that the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> furthered the comprehension of God's natural laws. Furthermore, his millennial perspective was closely tied to his optimism regarding scientific progress and the improvement of humanity. He believed that each age would improve upon the previous and that the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> allowed people to perceive and to advance this progress. Since the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> was a moral imperative for Priestley, he also promoted the education of middle-class women, which was unusual at the time. Some scholars of education have described Priestley as the most important English writer on education between the 17th-century John Locke and the 19th-century Herbert Spencer. Lectures on History was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as New College at Hackney, Brown, Princeton, Yale, and Cambridge. Priestley designed two Charts to serve as visual study aids for his [...] Lectures. These charts are in fact timelines; they have been described as the most influential timelines published in the 18th century. Both were popular for decades, and the trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the University of Edinburgh to grant him a Doctor of Law degree in 1764.|$|E

500|$|As an {{administrator}} Marlborough was also without peer; {{his attention to}} detail meant his troops rarely went short of supply – when his army arrived at its destination it was intact and in a fit state to fight. This concern {{for the welfare of}} the common soldier together with his ability to inspire trust and confidence, and his willingness to share the dangers of battle, often earned him adulation from his men – [...] "The known world could not produce a man of more humanity", observed Corporal Matthew Bishop. It was this range of abilities that makes Marlborough outstanding. Even his old adversaries recognised the Duke's qualities. In his Letters on the <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> <b>History</b> (1752), Bolingbroke declared – [...] "I take with pleasure this opportunity of doing justice to that great man... as the greatest general, and as the greatest minister that our country, or perhaps any other has produced, I honour". His success was made possible because of his enormous reserves of stamina, willpower and self-discipline; his ability to hold together the Alliance against France, made possible by his victories, can hardly be overestimated.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the war Weizsäcker {{continued}} his <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> in Göttingen and went on to study law, but he also attended lectures in physics and theology. In 1947, when his father Ernst von Weizsäcker was a defendant in the Ministries Trial for his role in the deportation of Jews from occupied France, Richard von Weizsäcker served as his assistant defence counsel. He took his first legal Staatsexamen in 1950, his second in 1953, and finally earned his doctorate (doctor juris) in 1955. In 1953 he married Marianne von Kretschmann. They had met when she was an 18-year-old schoolgirl and he was thirty. in 2010, Weizsäcker described the marriage as [...] "the best and smartest decision of my life". They had four children: Robert Klaus von Weizsäcker, a professor of economics at the Munich University of Technology, Andreas von Weizsäcker, an art professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, Beatrice von Weizsäcker, a lawyer and journalist, and Fritz Eckart von Weizsäcker, chief physician at the Schlosspark-Klinik in Berlin. In the late 1970s, his son Andreas was a student at the Odenwaldschule. When reports about sexual abuse there surfaced in 2010, it was speculated in the media that Andreas might have been one of the victims, but this was denied by the family. Andreas died of cancer in June 2008, aged 51.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of change and}} development attempts to understand how societies develop {{and how they can}} be changed. This includes studying many different aspects of society, for example demographic trends, political or technological trends, or changes in culture. Within this field, sociologists often use macrosociological methods or historical-comparative methods. In contemporary studies of social change, there are overlaps with international development or community development. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b> For instance, Marx contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while Weber argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances. In contrast to both, Durkheim argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of sociocultural evolution. Sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism. Most notably, Immanuel Wallerstein extends Marx's theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as world systems theory. Development sociology is also heavily influenced by post-colonialism. In recent years, Raewyn Connell issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the Global North. She argues that this bias blinds sociologists to the lived experiences of the Global South, specifically, so-called, [...] "Northern Theory" [...] lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism.|$|E
