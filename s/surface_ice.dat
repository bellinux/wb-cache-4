Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's <b>surface</b> <b>ice,</b> subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed <b>surface</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E

Firstly, the road <b>surface</b> <b>icing</b> almost {{occurs in the}} northwest region of Beijing and the ring roads of Beijing expressway, but less in the southeast region. Secondly, the frequency of freeze {{is closely related to}} precipitation and temperature; the road <b>Surface</b> <b>Icing</b> events caused by snowfall accounted for more than 75 %. Thirdly, the diurnal variation of the icing events is significant on both the inside and outside lanes, more than 80 % of the icing events occurred during 8 p. m. to 8 a. m., mainly after midnight. The duration of icing after midnight is mostly less than 6 hours, and the duration of the icing after 12 p. m. is shorter than that of before 12 p. m., which can even last up to 23 hours. In addition, when the icing caused by snowfall occurred, the road surface temperature and atmospheric temperature are both below 0 oC, and the former is often a bit higher than the later. The surrounding wind speed is mostly below 4 m/s...|$|R

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their <b>surface</b> <b>ice</b> begins evaporating.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{particles}} have {{a considerable}} {{influence on the}} surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and sodium ions farther from the planet, where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede. On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons' trailing hemispheres (again, except Callisto's). Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard <b>surface</b> <b>ice,</b> sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing radiolysis of water and other chemical compounds. The energetic particles break water into oxygen and hydrogen, maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include ozone and hydrogen peroxide. If organics or carbonates are present, carbon dioxide, methanol and carbonic acid can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur, likely products include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen disulfide and sulfuric acid. Oxidants produced by radiolysis, like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals, thus serving as a possible energy source for life.|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneous nitrates {{photolysis}} is {{the trigger}} for many chemical processes {{occurring in the}} polar boundary layer and is widely believed to occur in a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) at the <b>surface</b> of <b>ice.</b> The dipole forbidden character of the electronic transition relevant to boundary layer atmospheric chemistry and the small photolysis/photoproducts quantum yields in ice (and in water) may confer a significant enhancement and interfacial specificity to this important photochemical reaction at the <b>surface</b> of <b>ice.</b> Using amorphous solid water films at cryogenic temperatures as models for the disordered interstitial air/ice interface within the snowpack suppresses the diffusive uptake kinetics thereby prolonging the residence time of nitrate anions at the <b>surface</b> of <b>ice.</b> This approach allows their slow heterogeneous photolysis kinetics to be studied providing the first direct evidence that nitrates adsorbed onto the first molecular layer at the <b>surface</b> of <b>ice</b> are photolyzed more effectively than those dissolved within the bulk. Vibrational spectroscopy allows the ~ 3 -fold enhancement in photolysis rates to be correlated with the nitrates’ distorted intramolecular geometry thereby hinting at {{the role played by}} the greater chemical heterogeneity in their solvation environment at the <b>surface</b> of <b>ice</b> than in the bulk. A simple 1 D kinetic model suggests 1 -that a 3 (6) -fold enhancement in photolysis rate for nitrates adsorbed onto the <b>ice</b> <b>surface</b> could increase the photochemical NO[subscript 2] emissions from a 5 (8) nm thick photochemically active interfacial layer by 30 %(60) %, and 2 -that 25 %(40 %) of the NO[subscript 2] photochemical emissions to the snowpack interstitial air are released from the top-most molecularly thin <b>surface</b> layer on <b>ice.</b> These findings may provide a new paradigm for heterogeneous (photo) chemistry at temperatures below those required for a QLL to form at the <b>ice</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R

25|$|In early 2014, {{using data}} from the Herschel Space Observatory, it was {{discovered}} that there are several localized (not more than 60km in diameter) mid-latitude sources of water vapor on Ceres, which each give off about 1026 molecules (or 3kg) of water per second. Two potential source regions, designated Piazzi (123°E, 21°N) and Region A (231°E, 23°N), have been visualized in the near infrared as dark areas (Region A also has a bright center) by the W. M. Keck Observatory. Possible mechanisms for the vapor release are sublimation from about 0.6 km2 of exposed <b>surface</b> <b>ice,</b> or cryovolcanic eruptions resulting from radiogenic internal heat or from pressurization of a subsurface ocean due to growth of an overlying layer of ice. Surface sublimation would be expected to decline as Ceres recedes from the Sun in its eccentric orbit, whereas internally powered emissions should not be affected by orbital position. The limited data available are more consistent with cometary-style sublimation. The spacecraft Dawn is approaching Ceres at aphelion, which may constrain Dawn's ability to observe this phenomenon.|$|E

This indicates that solar heating, although very weak at Triton's great distance from the Sun, plays a crucial role. It is thought that the surface of Triton probably consists of a translucent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate, which creates a kind of [...] "solid greenhouse effect". Solar radiation passes through the thin <b>surface</b> <b>ice</b> sheet, slowly heating and vaporizing subsurface nitrogen until enough gas pressure accumulates for it to erupt through the crust. A temperature increase of just 4K above the ambient surface temperature of 37K could drive eruptions to the heights observed.

500|$|Images {{taken by}} Cassini during the flyby on July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} a distinctive, tectonically deformed region surrounding Enceladus's south pole. This area, reaching {{as far north}} as 60° south latitude, is covered in tectonic fractures and ridges. The area has few sizable impact craters, suggesting that it is the youngest surface on Enceladus and on any of the mid-sized icy satellites; modeling of the cratering rate suggests that some regions of the south polar terrain are possibly as young as 500,000 years or less. Near the center of this terrain are four fractures bounded by ridges, unofficially called [...] "tiger stripes". They appear to be the youngest features in this region and are surrounded by mint-green-colored (in false color, UV–green–near IR images), coarse-grained water ice, seen elsewhere on the surface within outcrops and fracture walls. Here the [...] "blue" [...] ice is on a flat surface, indicating that the region is young enough not to have been coated by fine-grained water ice from the E ring. Results from the visual and infrared spectrometer (VIMS) instrument suggest that the green-colored material surrounding the tiger stripes is chemically distinct {{from the rest of the}} surface of Enceladus. VIMS detected crystalline water ice in the stripes, suggesting that they are quite young (likely less than 1,000 years old) or the <b>surface</b> <b>ice</b> has been thermally altered in the recent past. VIMS also detected simple organic (carbon-containing) compounds in the tiger stripes, chemistry not found anywhere else on Enceladus thus far.|$|E
500|$|Iapetus is {{the third-largest}} of Saturn's moons. Orbiting the planet at [...] km, {{it is by}} far the most distant of Saturn's large moons, and also has the largest orbital inclination, at 15.47°. Iapetus has long been known for its unusual two-toned surface; its leading {{hemisphere}} is pitch-black and its trailing hemisphere is almost as bright as fresh snow. Cassini images showed that the dark material is confined to a large near-equatorial area on the leading hemisphere called Cassini Regio, which extends approximately from 40°N to 40°S. The pole regions of Iapetus are as bright as its trailing hemisphere. Cassini also discovered a 20km tall equatorial ridge, which spans nearly the moon's entire equator. Otherwise both dark and bright surfaces of Iapetus are old and heavily cratered. The images revealed at least four large impact basins with diameters from 380 to 550km and numerous smaller impact craters. No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus's starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, nearly invisible disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe—the Phoebe ring. Scientists believe that the disk originates from dust and ice particles kicked up by impacts on Phoebe. Because the disk particles, like Phoebe itself, orbit in the opposite direction to Iapetus, Iapetus collides with them as they drift in the direction of Saturn, darkening its leading hemisphere slightly. Once a difference in albedo, and hence in average temperature, was established between different regions of Iapetus, a thermal runaway process of water ice sublimation from warmer regions and deposition of water vapor onto colder regions ensued. Iapetus's present two-toned appearance results from the contrast between the bright, primarily ice-coated areas and regions of dark lag, the residue left behind after the loss of <b>surface</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
