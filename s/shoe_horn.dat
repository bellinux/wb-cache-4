50|$|There {{are various}} sizes of shoehorns, though the basic shape varies little {{except for the}} length of the handle. Long handled <b>shoe</b> <b>horns,</b> for example, are {{necessary}} for longer boots; they are also used to reduce bending and straining by persons lacking joint mobility (e.g., older persons), while <b>shoe</b> <b>horns</b> with sturdy handles are useful for putting on boots or heavy iron shoes.|$|R

5000|$|A {{shoehorn}} or <b>shoe</b> <b>horn</b> (sometimes {{called a}} shoespooner or shoe tongue) {{is a tool}} that lets the user put on a shoe more easily. It does so by keeping the shoe open and by providing a smooth surface for the foot and the heel to slide into the shoe, without crushing the shoe's counter (the vertical portion of the shoe that wraps {{around the back of}} the foot), in this way acting as a first class lever. Originally, shoehorns were made from animal horns,, hooves, glass and even paper. Additionally, expensive shoehorns were made from ivory, shells, silver, or bone. Today, some made from bulls' hooves are still available for purchase, although metal, plastic, and wood are most often used.|$|E
5000|$|Matt Collar of AllMusic {{gave the}} album 3 out of {{possible}} 5 stars, writing that Roads is [...] "a languid, passionate, and well-produced album, and beautifully showcases Mann's Vanderbilt University-trained vocal chops. Rather than attempt to <b>shoe</b> <b>horn</b> Mann's mature vocal aesthetic into a younger, teen- or dance-oriented sound, here {{we get a}} selection of thoughtful covers and originals that straddle the line between measured, adult contemporary radio styles {{and more of a}} classical crossover approach." [...] Collar also wrote that the covers, such as [...] "Need You Now" [...] and [...] "The Blower's Daughter", [...] "rachet up the sweeping, cinematic qualities of the songs while allowing him plenty of room to shine." [...] By the end of the review, he concluded that [...] "Ultimately, Roads will not disappoint fans who championed Mann on The Voice." ...|$|E

50|$|They usually {{sit on a}} tiny plastic {{chair with}} a small wooden block placed in front at arm’s length as a shoe-holder. The shoe-shining kit {{consists}} mostly of paste tins, sponge daubers, some shine cloths, <b>shoe</b> <b>horns</b> and <b>shoe</b> shine brushes. The white-collar workers in the financial district are the main customers for shoe shiners in Hong Kong. They stand, or sit {{if there is a}} chair provided, facing the shoe shiner with one leg up on the wooden block, waiting patiently for the polishing to be done. Shoe shiners spend approximately 10 minutes buffing each pair of shoes. One can at most, polish over 20 pairs in nice weather day. They charge HK$40 for one pair with tips occasionally. As of 2015, the shoe shiners in Hong Kong are mostly aged 60 or above. It is now considered a fading profession in Hong Kong, which has made the shoe shining industry one of the sunset industries in Hong Kong.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of potentially reversible locomotor disabilities in elderly subjects and the cost effectiveness of providing aids for daily living. DESIGN [...] Population based randomised controlled trial of subjects aged {{greater than or equal}} to 85 living independently in an inner London borough. SETTING [...] 21 Electoral wards of the London Borough of Hackney. SUBJECTS [...] 1255 Subjects aged {{greater than or equal to}} 85 living in their own home whose names were obtained from general practitioner lists and cross checked against the electoral register, 511 of whom were subsequently found to be ineligible. Of the 744 remaining, those with disability on screening were randomised and allocated to an intervention group (36) or a control group (43), in which intervention was postponed until four weeks, after the follow up assessment. Subjects with aids supplied previously were excluded from the intervention phase. INTERVENTIONS [...] Provision of raised toilet seat, teapot tipper, tap turner, <b>shoe</b> <b>horn</b> and elastic laces, and double handled saucepan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Degree of difficulty (grades 1 - 4) with specific tasks (getting on and off a toilet, pouring from a teapot into a cup, turning taps on and off, carrying a saucepan of standard weight, and putting on shoes) and time taken to perform them. RESULTS [...] 545 (73 %) Of the 744 eligible subjects assessed; 428 had no disability and 118 had difficulty with at least one task. Some had had their disability recognised before the study and already had aids, representing half of those with difficulty getting on and off the toilet but 24 % for putting on shoes and 13 % for pouring from a teapot and turning on a tap. The mean number of difficulties was similar between the groups (intervention group 1. 7, control group 1. 6). Time taken to complete the tasks corresponded with the observed grade of difficulty. All aids were associated with reduced difficulty according to observer assessment (% improvement intervention group v control group: raised toilet seat, 71 v 13 teapot tipper 100 v 33; tap turner 100 v 0; saucepan 88 v 0; <b>shoe</b> <b>horn</b> 50 v 13) and time taken to complete the tasks. A cost benefit analysis of this screening-intervention programme suggested a total cost of 32 pounds per individual benefit. CONCLUSIONS [...] Appreciable degrees of unrecognised locomotor disability are detected on screening of very elderly people living independently. Providing aids offers a feasible and cost effective means of improving function in such people...|$|E
40|$|For the {{investigation}} of the microvasculature of the bovine claw, an improved microcorrosion casting technique was developed. The new method was particularly adapted to surmount the difficulties of the examined vascular system, and rendered a complete vascular filling in all segments of the claw. Various injection media and techniques were tested and compared regarding filling degree and quality of the resulting microcorrosion cast. Completeness of vascular filling including the capillary bed was verified by histological examination of serial sections of plastic-injected specimens. Using the improved microcorrosion technique, 46 fore resp. hind limbs of adult cattle and three fore resp. hind limbs of calves aged eight to twelve weeks were cast. The arterial and venous blood supply of the fore and hind claw, particularly the vascular supply of the different segments of the claw and potential haemodynamic bottlenecks, were studied on the resulting microcorrosion specimens. Additionally, postmortal section-angiogramms of healthy and pathologically altered adult hind claws (heel horn erosion, double sole, digital dermatitis) were examined. By systematic scanning-electron-microscopic examination of the microcorrosion casts, the dermal and - if developed in the respective segment - subcutaneous microvascularisation of all segments of the claw was demonstrated for the first time. Special emphasis was laid on demonstrating the angio-architecture of the dermal papillae and lamellae, and differences between main and dew claws resp. between adult and juvenile claws. The results gained by scanning-electron-microscopy and the relation of subepidermal vessels and papillary body were verified by serial sections of all segments of the bovine claw. The angioarchitecture of the dermal papillae and lamellae of the different segments of the claw was closely related to the segment-specific formation of the papillary body. The basic pattern of the papillary vascular supply, comprising a centrally situated A. and V. papillaris which give rise to a segment-specific, subepidermal capillary net and form a peripheral capillary loop {{at the tip of the}} papilla, was confirmed for all segments of the claw. This basic vascular pattern showed segment-related modifications regarding size, form, direction and density of the vascular papillae, occurrence and density of the subepidermal capillary net and regarding length and contortion of the peripheral loop. In the dermal papillae, arteriovenous anastomoses could be demonstrated only sporadically. The marked two-dimensional laminar angioarchitecture was demonstrated in all areas of the wall segment. It consisted of centrally situated, axially orientated Aa. and Vv. lamellares, which branched in an arcadiform fashion and gave rise to a dense capillary and venular net at the base and ridge of the lamellae. At the base of the lamellae, direct and indirect arteriovenous anastomoses were demonstrated, but no regularity in their occurrence was detected. Arteriovenous anastomoses apparently do not play such an important role in the microcirculation of the pododerma as suggested in the literature. On six fore resp. hind limbs, histamine or lactate was administered before injection of the polymerising methacrylates. The influence of these vasoactive substances on the ungular vessels was studied on the resulting microcorrosion casts. In the papillae of all segments, only the central vascular loop of the dermal papillae is perfused under the influence of either histamine or lactate, whereas the circulation of the lamellae remains unaltered. But due to a dilation of the anastomosis between the dorsal branch of the arcus terminalis and the coronary vessels, the blood volume is partly shunted away from the wall segment. Comparing the results on main and dew resp. juvenile and adult claws, a relation between burdening of the claw and density and differentiation of the dermal papillary and lamellar blood vessels was detectable. Additional microcorrosion casts of five adult hind claws showing pathological alterations (heel horn erosion, double sole, white-line-disease, haemorrhages, wax-like consistency and yellow discoloration of the horn <b>shoe,</b> <b>horn</b> rings, digital dermatitis) were examined by scanning-electron-microscopy. The pathologically altered specimens featured an enlargement of the papillary surface by further partitioning of the papillary body, presumably as compensational adaptation to local ischaemia caused by improper or over-burdening of the claw. <br...|$|E
5000|$|A {{group of}} more than 20 known English <b>shoe</b> <b>horns</b> are all signed and dated, to between 1593 and 1613, and made by Robert Mindum. All also are inscribed {{with the names of}} their owners; These include both men and women, {{including}} [...] "JANE HIS WIFE" [...] in 1612. [...] The inscription on one is typical: [...] "THIS IS AMBRES BVCKELLS SHOING HORNE MADE BY ROBART MINDVM ANNO DOMINI 1598". There is also other engraved decoration on all, including heraldic medallions, geometric designs and flowers, covering most of the surfaces, in a style characteristic of later scrimshaw. Their shape is very similar to modern examples, and the longest is 11 inches long; five are turned back at the narrow end in a kind of hook. Several have holes pierced in them, presumably for a cord or leather thong used for pulling them out of the shoe or hanging them up. One owner ("Hamlet Radesdale", 1593) is described as a citizen of London who is a cooper; none of the owners seem to be recorded otherwise. Joan Evans suggested, given the nature of the inscriptions, that Robert Mindum made them as a hobby and gave them to his friends. A powder horn similarly inscribed and decorated by him also survives. [...] The British Museum also has a similar inscribed and decorated horn by another maker.|$|R
5000|$|At the Springfield Shoe Expo, Marge {{is further}} humiliated and {{objectified}} by lustful men while promoting <b>shoe</b> <b>horns.</b> At the same time, Bart helps Krusty {{to win back}} his popularity, using Milhouse and Stampy, Bart's old pet elephant, in a stunt. The stunt quickly goes out of control when Stampy stuffs Milhouse and Bart in his mouth. Homer tries to save them, but get stuffed into Stampy's mouth too. Krusty forgets the word {{that was supposed to}} make Stampy submit and lie down. The police decide to shoot at Stampy, which would endanger Homer, Bart and Milhouse. Marge appears on the scene, and after unsuccessfully trying to dissuade the police shooting (as Chief Wiggum claims that they do not negogiate with elephants), distracts the police by flashing her huge breasts to the assembled crowd. Krusty, still hated by residents of Springfield, saves the day by accidentally saying Stampy's safety word [...] "Magumbo" [...] while ogling Marge. Stampy releases Bart, Milhouse, and Homer, and Krusty is hailed as a hero and his popularity is restored with the town (though the story of how Krusty saved the kids is relegated to only a paragraph in the local paper while the story of Marge flashing the crowd at the shoe expo received 25 pages with photos). In the end, Marge has the implants removed, and Homer suggests that the family goes out for fried chicken.|$|R
50|$|Anticipation {{combines}} gameplay {{elements from}} Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit board games. The player {{is represented by}} one of four game pieces on a board: a pair of pink high-heeled <b>shoes,</b> a <b>horn,</b> an ice cream cone, and a teddy bear. The game slowly draws a picture, and {{the first person to}} buzz in may try to guess it. A die counts down from six to zero while the picture is being drawn. As soon as a player buzzes in, the die and the drawing both freeze and the player has 25 seconds to spell out the answer. Making two mistakes, or running out of time, locks the player out; the drawing and the die countdown both resume, and the other players can then buzz in.|$|R
40|$|Background: Total hip {{replacement}} (THR) {{is one of}} the most common orthopaedic procedures in the United Kingdom (UK). Historically, people following THR have been provided with hip precautions and equipment such as: raised toilet seats and furniture rises, in order to reduce the risks of dislocation post-operation. The purpose of this study was to determine current practices in the provision of these interventions in the UK for people following primary THR. Methods: A 27 -question, self-administered online survey was developed and distributed to UK physiotherapists and occupational therapists involved in the management of people following primary THR (target respondents). The survey included questions regarding the current practices in the provision of equipment and hip precautions for THR patients, and physiotherapist’s and occupational therapist’s attitudes towards these practices. The survey was disseminated through print and web-based/social media channels. Results: 170 health professionals (87 physiotherapists and 83 occupational therapists), responded to the survey. Commonly prescribed equipment in respondent’s health trusts were raised toilet seats (95 %), toilet frames and rails (88 %), furniture raises (79 %), helping hands/grabbers (77 %), perching stools (75 %) and long-handled <b>shoe</b> <b>horns</b> (75 %). Hip precautions were routinely prescribed by 97 % of respondents. Hip precautions were most frequently taught in a pre-operative group (52 % of respondents). Similarly equipment was most frequently provided pre-operatively (61 % respondents), and most commonly by occupational therapists (74 % respondents). There was variability in the advice provided on the duration of hip precautions and equipment from up to six weeks post-operatively to life-time usage. Conclusions: Current practice on hip precautions and provision of equipment is not full representative of clinician’s perceptions of best care after THR. Future research is warranted to determine whether and to whom hip precautions and equipment should be prescribed post-THR as opposed to the current ‘blanket’ provision of equipment and movement restriction provided in UK practice...|$|R

40|$|The pads of the bovine digital cushion, {{which serves}} as a shock absorber, have {{specific}} anatomical structures to cope with the substantial forces acting within the claw. To gain more information on the lipid composition and content of the pads, <b>horn</b> <b>shoes</b> from 12 slaughtered heifers and cows were removed and different samples of the pads excised with a scalpel. Pad lipids were extracted and the fatty acid composition determined by gas chromatography. Fat from perirenal and subcutaneous adipose tissues served as a comparison. Overall, this fat contained a higher quantity of extracted lipids than that of the claw pads and did not differ between heifers and cows. In contrast, lipid content in the pads was significantly higher in the cows than in the heifers. In both groups, the lipid content of the middle and abaxial pads, which are situated directly under the distal phalanx, was lower than in the pads of the other locations. The lipids in all pads contained > 77 % monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), differing sharply from the adipose tissue with values < 51 %. Among the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) a significantly higher proportion of arachidonic acid (AA) was found in the heifer pads than in those of the cows, whereas the proportion of AA was similar in the adipose tissue of all animals. The proportion of AA in the pad lipids also varied between the defined locations with the highest proportion found in locations that showed the lowest lipid content and was related to the age of the animal...|$|R
