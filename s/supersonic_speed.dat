5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, and the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need <b>supersonic</b> <b>speed</b> to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E

5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis {{were not as}} {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on.

5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at <b>supersonic</b> <b>speed,</b> the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E

Also featuring the all-moving tail, the XS-1 was later known as the X-1. It was in the X-1 that Chuck Yeager was credited with being the first person to break the sound barrier in level flight on October 14, 1947, flying at an altitude of 45,000ft (13.7km). George Welch made a plausible but officially unverified claim to have broken the sound barrier on 1 October 1947, while flying an XP-86 Sabre. He also claimed to have repeated his supersonic flight on October 14, 1947, 30 minutes before Yeager broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1. Although evidence from witnesses and instruments strongly imply that Welch achieved <b>supersonic</b> <b>speed,</b> the flights were not properly monitored and are not officially recognized.

25|$|Where {{the flow}} over the suction {{side of a}} {{transonic}} wing is accelerated to a <b>supersonic</b> <b>speed,</b> the resulting re-compression can be by either Prandtl-Meyer compression or by {{the formation of a}} normal shock. This shock is of particular interest to makers of transonic devices because it can cause separation of the boundary layer at the point where it touches the transonic profile. This can then lead to full separation and stall on the profile, higher drag, or shock-buffet, a condition where the separation and the shock interact in a resonance condition, causing resonating loads on the underlying structure.|$|E

To develop a fully supersonic version of {{the aircraft}}, an innovation incorporated was a reheat jetpipe – also known as an afterburner. Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine blades, making use of unused oxygen in the exhaust. Finally, the design included another critical element, {{the use of a}} shock cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Air Force and Navy {{were both}} seeking new {{aircraft}} when Robert McNamara was appointed Secretary of Defense in January 1961.

On 14 February 1961, McNamara formally directed the services to study {{the development of a}} single aircraft that would satisfy both requirements. Early studies indicated that the best option was to base the design on the Air Force requirement, and use a modified version for the Navy. In June 1961, Secretary McNamara ordered the go ahead of Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX), despite Air Force and Navy efforts to keep their programs separate.|$|E
