40|$|Large-scale quantum {{computation}} {{is likely to}} require massive quantum error correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the <b>stabilizer</b> formalism, which represents <b>stabilizer</b> states by {{keeping track of the}} operators that preserve them. Such states are obtained by <b>stabilizer</b> circuits (consisting of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase gates) and can be represented compactly on conventional computers using $O(n^ 2) $ bits, where $n$ is the number of qubits. As an additional application, the work by Aaronson and Gottesman suggests the use of superpositions of <b>stabilizer</b> states to represent arbitrary quantum states. To aid in such applications and improve our understanding of <b>stabilizer</b> states, we characterize and count nearest-neighbor <b>stabilizer</b> states, quantify the distribution of angles between pairs of <b>stabilizer</b> states, study succinct <b>stabilizer</b> superpositions and <b>stabilizer</b> bivectors, explore the approximation of non-stabilizer states by single <b>stabilizer</b> states and short linear combinations of <b>stabilizer</b> states, develop an improved inner-product computation for <b>stabilizer</b> states via synthesis of compact canonical <b>stabilizer</b> circuits, propose an orthogonalization procedure for <b>stabilizer</b> states, and evaluate several of these algorithms empirically.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} <b>stabilizer</b> codes over local Frobenius rings. First, we study the relative minimum distances of a <b>stabilizer</b> code and its reduction onto the residue field. We show that for various scenarios, a free <b>stabilizer</b> code over the ring does not underperform the according <b>stabilizer</b> code over the field. This {{leads us to}} conjecture that {{the same is true}} for all free <b>stabilizer</b> codes. Secondly, we focus on the isometries of <b>stabilizer</b> codes.

5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical <b>stabilizers.</b> Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis came to power, {{the design}} was given priority. Despite initial {{competition}} from the Henschel Hs 123, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, the German aviation ministry) turned to the designs of Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, the double vertical <b>stabilizers</b> were introduced to give the rear gunner a better field of fire. The main, and {{what was to be}} the most distinctive, feature of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale quantum {{computation}} {{is likely to}} require massive quantum error correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the <b>stabilizer</b> formalism, which represents <b>stabilizer</b> states by {{keeping track of the}} operators that preserve them. Such states are obtained by <b>stabilizer</b> circuits (consisting of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on conventional computers using Omega(n^ 2) bits, where n is the number of qubits. Although techniques for the efficient simulation of <b>stabilizer</b> circuits have been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of <b>stabilizer</b> states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for: (i) obtaining canonical generators for <b>stabilizer</b> states, (ii) obtaining canonical <b>stabilizer</b> circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between <b>stabilizer</b> states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n^ 3) time in general, but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC (e. g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit <b>stabilizer</b> state has exactly 4 (2 ^n - 1) nearest-neighbor <b>stabilizer</b> states, and verify this claim experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing arbitrary quantum states using <b>stabilizer</b> frames and generalize our algorithms to compute the inner product between two such frames.

5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical <b>stabilizers,</b> Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E

5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical <b>stabilizers,</b> and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{multipartite}} entanglement purification of any <b>stabilizer</b> state shared by several parties. In our protocol each party measures the <b>stabilizer</b> operators of a quantum error-correcting code {{on his or her}} qubits. The parties exchange their measurement results, detect or correct errors, and decode the desired purified state. We give sufficient conditions on the <b>stabilizer</b> codes that may be used in this procedure and find that Steane's seven-qubit code is the smallest error-correcting code sufficient to purify any <b>stabilizer</b> state. An error-detecting code that encodes two qubits in six {{can also be used to}} purify any <b>stabilizer</b> state. We further specify which classes of <b>stabilizer</b> codes can purify which classes of <b>stabilizer</b> states. Comment: 11 pages, 0 figures, comments welcome, submitting to Physical Review...|$|R

5|$|The {{stabilizing}} {{effect of}} cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on PVC {{led to an}} increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s.

5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal <b>stabilizers</b> and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
5|$|The first XFR-1 {{made its}} first flight on 25 June 1944 without its jet engine, but that was {{installed}} shortly afterward. The second prototype first flew on 20 September 1944. Test flights confirmed wind tunnel tests that revealed a lack of longitudinal stability because {{the center of gravity}} had been miscalculated. In addition, the circular rear fuselage of the FR-1 gave less stability than the slab-style fuselage of the Grumman F4F Wildcat that was used {{as a model for the}} stability calculations. A new tail with enlarged vertical and horizontal <b>stabilizers</b> was designed and retrofitted to the prototypes. The original Douglas double-slotted flaps proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing, but all three prototypes and the first 14 production aircraft were built with them before they were replaced with a single-slotted flap.|$|E

5|$|Urinary {{proteins}} {{were first}} reported in rodents in 1932, during studies by Thomas Addis into {{the cause of}} proteinuria. They are potent human allergens, and are largely responsible {{for a number of}} animal allergies, including to cats, horses and rodents. Their endogenous function within an animal is unknown, but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in chemical communication between animals, functioning as pheromone transporters and <b>stabilizers</b> in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote aggression in male mice, and one specific Mup protein found in male mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as signals between different species: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal <b>stabilizers.</b> The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone <b>stabilizers,</b> providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June 1966, XB-70A No. 2 was {{in close}} {{formation}} {{with four other}} aircraft (an F-4 Phantom, an F-5, a T-38 Talon, and an F-104 Starfighter) for a photoshoot {{at the behest of}} General Electric, manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft. After the completion of the photoshoot, the F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wing, flipped over and rolled inverted {{over the top of the}} Valkyrie, striking the vertical <b>stabilizers</b> and left wing of the bomber. The F-104 exploded, destroying the Valkyrie's rudders and damaging its left wing. With the loss of both rudders and damage to the wings, the Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California. NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker (F-104 pilot) and Carl Cross (XB-70 co-pilot) were killed. Al White (XB-70 pilot) ejected, sustaining serious injuries, including one arm crushed by the closing clamshell-like escape crew capsule moments prior to ejection.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal <b>stabilizers</b> (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets against his will, to use as <b>stabilizers</b> for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode.

40|$|The {{class of}} quantum codes called <b>stabilizer</b> codes is {{increasingly}} well-understood.
