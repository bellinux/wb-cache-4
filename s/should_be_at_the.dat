Berlin was selected as the site because Klarsfeld and her husband expected they would be punished only mildly because of the quadripartite status of the city as a French citizen.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach {{were highly}} {{influenced}} by structuralism. Authors such as Maurice Godelier and Emmanuel Terray combined Marxism with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as Marshall Sahlins and James Boon built on structuralism {{to provide their}} own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s {{for a number of}} reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as Eric Wolf argued that political economy and colonialism <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by Pierre Bourdieu led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which Sherry Ortner has referred to as 'practice theory'.|$|E

25|$|Where the {{presence}} of burrowing owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations need to start several {{months prior to the}} anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good burrowing owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to be interested in the location – if possible, this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way trapdoor design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose. If everything has been correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site {{in the course of a}} few nights at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} flag should be {{displayed in the}} open only between sunrise and sunset, except {{on the occasion of}} public meetings, processions, or funerals, when it may be displayed for the duration of such functions. When displayed on a platform, the {{national flag}} should not be used to cover the speaker’s desk, nor should it be draped over the platform. The national flag should never be defaced by placing slogans, logos, lettering or pictures of any kind on it, for example at sporting events. The flag should not be draped on cars, trains, boats or other modes of transport; it should not be carried flat, but should always be carried aloft and free, except when used to drape a coffin; on such an occasion, the green <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the coffin. The tricolour is draped across the coffins of Presidents of Ireland (including former presidents), soldiers and Garda Síochána personnel killed in the line of duty, and other notables accorded state funerals, such as Roger Casement in 1965, or Kevin Barry in 2001. Care should be taken at all times to ensure that the national flag does not touch the ground, trail in water or become entangled in trees or other obstacles.|$|E

In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings.

500|$|Rupert had a {{characteristic}} style as an admiral; he relied upon [...] "energetic personal leadership backed by {{close contact with}} his officers"; having decided how to proceed in a naval campaign, however, it could be difficult for his staff to change his mind. Recent work on Rupert's role as a commander has also highlighted the progress the prince made in formulating the way that orders {{were given to the}} British fleet. Fleet communications were limited during the period, and the traditional orders from admirals before a battle were accordingly quite rigid, limiting a captain's independence in the battle. Rupert played a key part in the conferences held by the Duke of York in 1665 to review tactics and operational methods from the first Dutch war, and put these into practice before the St James Day battle. These instructions and supplementary instructions to ships' captains, which attempted to balance an adherence to standing orders with the need to exploit emerging opportunities in a battle, proved heavily influential over the next hundred years and shaped the idea that an aggressive fighting spirit <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> core of British naval doctrine.|$|E

Some school districts closed all schools if a single child was classified as probable. On May 5 the CDC retracted its advice stating that schools that were closed based on previous CDC guidance related to this outbreak may reopen. By that time at least 726 schools nationwide serving more than 480,000 students had closed for at least some period of time. The CDC amended its advice citing, new information on disease severity and the limiting effectiveness of school closure as a control measure.

2500|$|Other admirers {{included}} Jane Austen, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Sir Walter Scott, {{who used}} numerous quotes from Crabbe's poems in his novels. During Scott's final illness, Crabbe {{was the last}} writer he asked to have read to him. [...] Lord Byron admired Crabbe's poetry, and called him [...] "nature's sternest painter, yet the best". According to critic Frank Whitehead, [...] "Crabbe, in his verse tales in particular, is an important—indeed, a major—poet whose work has been and still is seriously undervalued." [...] His early poems, which were non-narrative essays in poetical form, gained him the approval of literary men like Samuel Johnson, followed by a period of 20 years in which he wrote much, destroying most of it, and published nothing. In 1807, he published his volume Poems which started off the new realistic narrative method that characterized his poetry {{for the rest of}} his career. Whitehead states that this narrative poetry, which occupies the bulk of Crabbe's output, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of modern critical attention.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 company [...] "Čavlina and Sladoljev" [...] from Zagreb {{drafted the}} project of {{connecting}} two banks of the Sava river by the cable car. In 1928, building company [...] "Šumadija" [...] again proposed {{the construction of the}} cable car, which they called [...] "air tram" [...] but this project was planned to connect Zemun to Kalemegdan on Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was suppose to last 5 minutes. The project never realized. Engineer and CEO of the Yugoslav institute for urbanism and dwelling [...] "Juginus", Mirko Radovanac, revived the idea in the 1990s. After conducting extensive surveys (traffic analysis, interviews with the commuters, climatic, geological, urban and other researches), [...] "Juginus" [...] presented the project in 1993. They proposed that the terminuses <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Sports Center Košutnjak and Block 44 in the neighborhood of Savski Blokovi in New Belgrade, across the Sava. Stops in between would include the major public transportation roundabout in Banovo Brdo, Makiš and Ada Ciganlija, five in total. They called it the [...] "ideal route". The plan also included construction of commercial areas around the terminuses, which would cover [...] and help with the profitability of the project. Apart from being ecological and an attraction, it was estimated that it would shorten the trip for 45 minutes. City government included the project into the city's General Urban Plan, which envisioned the construction in phases, the first being a [...] long section Block 44-Ada Ciganlija. It would lay on 8 steel pillars, [...] above the ground and the trip would last for 3 minutes. The cabins were projected to receive not just the commuters, but also the bicycles, skateboards, sledges and skis, as the cableway was planned to work year-round. The complete facility would have of 27 pillars, it would be [...] long which would be travelled in 15 minutes by 2,000 commuters per hour. Despite the project has been publicly revived by the mayors Dragan Đilas (2008-13) and Siniša Mali (since 2013), as of 2017 the project still didn't start.|$|E
