40|$|There is an {{on-going}} {{debate among}} scholars from various disciplines about economic institutions {{and their impact}} on economic development. The case of the Amsterdam Chamber of Insurance is relevant to this discussion and in particular to the part that focuses on the nature and development of contract enforcement mechanisms. Marine insurance was introduced in Amsterdam in the mid-sixteenth century and soon the insurance industry developed into a prospering business. Its development was of great importance to the expansion of long-distance trade as it reduced the financial consequences of risks inherent to maritime trade. However, the new industry with its complex contracts was prone to misunderstandings, fraud and deception, creating the need for an independent, <b>specialised</b> <b>court.</b> The Chamber of Insurance was established as a generalised court, rather than a particularised court {{as was the case in}} cities that preceded Amsterdam's trade dominance. Why did the Amsterdam municipality choose to set up this court and what were the implications? A recently discovered Statute Book of the Chamber gives insight into why the Chamber was established, how it functioned within the setting of Europe's dominant trade centre and how it has affected the development of similar courts in the Netherlands. © 2013 The Author...|$|E
40|$|Constitutional judges possess broad {{powers to}} govern, in {{conjunction}} with other state officials, by virtue of an explicit act of delegation. In the terminology of delegation theory, constitutional courts are agents. These courts, when considered as functional solutions to the mixed dilemmas of contracting and commitment, appear to conform, paradigmatically as it were, to the delegation theorist’s preferred logic of institutional design. This article explores this formulation critically, in light of the themes laid out in the introduction, and in light of the deep transformations of parliamentary governance now taking place in Europe {{as a result of the}} diffusion of constitutional review. The discussion proceeds in three parts. The first examines the organisational logic of conferring constitutional review authority on a <b>specialised</b> <b>court,</b> rather than on the judiciary as a whole. By constitutional review, is meant the authority to evaluate the constitutionality of public acts, including legislation, and to annul those acts as unlawful when found to be in conflict with the constitutional law. I then turn to constitutional politics, the sources and consequences of conferring review powers on a state organ. The second part focuses on formal elements of the delegation of powers to constitutional courts. Following Majone, I argue that the agency metaphor that animates standard Principal–Agent (P–A) research on the politics of delegation is less appropriate than a metaphor of trusteeship, given that relevant ‘political property rights’ have, for all practical purposes, been transferred to constitutional judges. The third part summarises the major outcomes of constitutional politics, providing an explanation of the most important similarities and differences among my four cases. This explanation does not rely on concepts provided by delegation theory, per se...|$|E

40|$|According to the {{classical}} concept accepted in procedural doctrine of civil law countries, courts-martial, when they exist, are considered <b>specialised</b> or extraordinary <b>courts,</b> but never courts of general jurisdiction, even the criteria that distinguish <b>specialised</b> and extraordinary <b>courts</b> needs theoretical clarification. Beginning in 1992 the Russian military jurisdiction system, created in Soviet era and evolved from extraordinary to specialised justice, underwent several reforms, which reduced and even eliminated certain aspects of their specialisation. Thus the new law on courts-martial passed in 1999 {{was the culmination of}} this process: according to its surprising first Article, courts-martial are no longer considered <b>specialised</b> <b>courts,</b> but courts of general jurisdiction. However, the question arises that if courts-martial are considered courts of general jurisdiction, which is paradoxical enough, why does Russia need to preserve the system of courts-martial, if the latter have lost almost all their particularities? In other words, is there an internal rationale for the reforms of military justice in today’s Russia...|$|R
40|$|Under the TRIPS Agreement (Art. 41 para. 5) {{countries}} {{are given the}} option to create specialised intellectual property (IP) courts. On this basis, {{countries are}} free to decide what types of judicial body or bodies have the jurisdiction to hear IP disputes. Although IP disputes are sometimes primarily viewed as relating to the enforcement of intellectual property rights against counterfeiters (specifically in the copyright and trademark areas), the reality and the landscape of IP disputes are much more complex. The diversity of IP disputes {{makes it difficult to}} give a simple and unique {{answer to the question of}} whether it is advantageous or necessary to establish <b>specialised</b> IP <b>courts.</b> This diversity is also reflected in the way in which national or regional lawmakers and regulators have structured their IP dispute resolution systems. While recent studies demonstrate that there is no unique global system or even a prevailing system, a trend towards specialisation or centralisation of certain types of IP disputes seems perceivable at the global level. However, this trend does not eliminate the differences which remain, particularly regarding the scope of the jurisdictional power of <b>specialised</b> IP <b>courts.</b> There are various advantages and disadvantages in establishing a <b>specialised</b> IP <b>court.</b> Improvements in the quality of justice, time and cost efficiencies of the proceedings, as well as consistency and uniformity, are among the advantages that are generally identified. In terms of disadvantages, reference is generally made to the costs of establishing and of operating a <b>specialised</b> IP <b>court.</b> In addition, some have expressed concerns that such a court may become subject to political or economic influences and may develop ‘tunnel vision’ deriving from mainstream legal and societal movements. Given the diversity of legal systems and regimes, there is no single method for establishing an efficient IP court system that promotes innovation and social welfare. Similarly, there is no clear evidence that <b>specialised</b> IP <b>courts</b> more effectively promote innovation vis-à-vis non-specialised courts in all circumstances. However, it is clear that a sufficient level of experience and expertise among the courts and judges can significantly improve the quality of justice in IP disputes. How advantageous or necessary it is to establish <b>specialised</b> IP <b>courts</b> in a given jurisdiction depends on a number of factors which are not limited to IP issues. Rather, this determination will take into account more general factors, including economics, the legal system and societal characteristics. Thus, the creation of <b>specialised</b> IP <b>courts</b> cannot be recommended in all circumstances. A decision relating to the establishment of <b>specialised</b> IP <b>courts</b> must consequently be made on the basis of a fully informed, transparent and unbiased analysis of the situation which prevails in the relevant territory...|$|R

5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty, but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and <b>specialised.</b> Ordinary <b>courts</b> are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional <b>courts,</b> while <b>specialised</b> <b>courts</b> are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations.
