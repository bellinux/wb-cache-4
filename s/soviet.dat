5|$|According to a <b>Soviet</b> General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} <b>Soviet</b> airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, <b>Soviet</b> aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The <b>Soviet</b> deception efforts were {{so successful that}} German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total <b>Soviet</b> armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only a}} vast underestimation of <b>Soviet</b> strength, but a misperception of <b>Soviet</b> strategic intentions.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen {{visited the}} <b>Soviet</b> Union in May 1965, in which <b>Soviet</b> Premier Alexei Kosygin warned against the {{installation}} {{and stated that}} the <b>Soviet</b> Union would build a counter-station. In June, the <b>Soviet</b> Consul in Barentsburg came on an inspection to the installation, and on 2 July a <b>Soviet</b> helicopter crashed at the construction site after having, presumably unintentionally, touched a mast. <b>Soviet</b> demands to have permanent <b>Soviet</b> inspectors of the facility were rejected. The Svalbard Treaty does not include any verification procedure, and as such no signatories {{have the right to}} conduct inspections.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich {{achieved}} fame in the <b>Soviet</b> Union {{under the}} patronage of <b>Soviet</b> {{chief of staff}} Mikhail Tukhachevsky, but later had a complex and difficult relationship with the government. Nevertheless, he received accolades and state awards and served in the Supreme <b>Soviet</b> of the RSFSR (1947–1962) and the Supreme <b>Soviet</b> of the <b>Soviet</b> Union (from 1962 until his death).|$|E

5|$|A part of Belarus under Russian rule {{emerged as}} the Byelorussian <b>Soviet</b> Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR) in 1919. Soon {{thereafter}} it merged to form the Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the <b>Soviet</b> Union {{after the war ended}} in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became {{a founding member of the}} Union of <b>Soviet</b> Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.|$|E
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the <b>Soviet</b> Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the <b>Soviet</b> economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the <b>Soviet</b> Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} <b>Soviet</b> export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the <b>Soviet</b> economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a <b>Soviet</b> expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} <b>Soviet</b> Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was <b>Soviet</b> research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the <b>Soviets</b> re-organised {{enterprises}} as joint-stock {{companies in}} which the <b>Soviets</b> possessed the controlling interest. Using that control vehicle, several enterprises were required to sell products at below world prices to the <b>Soviets,</b> such as uranium mines in Czechoslovakia and East Germany, coal mines in Poland, and oil wells in Romania.|$|R
50|$|Despite having {{far fewer}} troops than the <b>Soviets,</b> the Finnish forces (12th division) {{repelled}} the Red Army because the <b>Soviets</b> were only prepared to proceed along roads. The Kollaa area had very few roads, {{all of them}} guarded by Finnish troops; and the <b>Soviets</b> {{were not able to}} proceed cross-country without skis.|$|R
25|$|A special British Joint Intelligence Subcommittee report titled German Strategy and Capacity to Resist, {{prepared}} for Winston Churchill's eyes only, predicted that Germany might collapse {{as early as}} mid-April if the <b>Soviets</b> overran its eastern defenses. Alternatively, the report warned that the Germans might hold out until November if they could prevent the <b>Soviets</b> from taking Silesia. Hence, any assistance provided to the <b>Soviets</b> on the Eastern Front could shorten the war. At the time of bombing, the <b>Soviets</b> were conducting their Lower Silesian Offensive.|$|R
5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the <b>Soviet</b> Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions {{were important to}} the expansion of <b>Soviet</b> socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous <b>Soviet</b> writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of <b>Soviet</b> ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for <b>Soviet</b> diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and <b>Soviet</b> commands considered their plans for future operations. The <b>Soviet</b> premier Joseph Stalin and some senior <b>Soviet</b> officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the <b>Soviet</b> Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the <b>Soviet</b> forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg {{was seized}} by the Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the <b>Soviet</b> Union as war reparations. In December 1945, a <b>Soviet</b> crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to Tallinn, where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the <b>Soviet</b> Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. By 1960, she had been broken up for scrap.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first choice}} makes Victor {{to join the}} <b>Soviets</b> who give him a task to locate the main {{resistance}} base and reveal its position to <b>Soviets.</b> After finding the base, Victor is once again forced to decide whether he will betray the partisans or lead the <b>Soviets</b> to the false location to join the resistance anyway. If he chooses to betray them, the <b>Soviets</b> win and Victor is executed with the other partisans as a traitor who cannot be trusted because he betrayed his close friends.|$|R
25|$|The Poles and the <b>Soviets</b> re-established {{diplomatic}} relations in 1941, following the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement; but the <b>Soviets</b> broke them off again in 1943 after the Polish government demanded an independent {{examination of the}} recently discovered Katyn burial pits. The <b>Soviets</b> then lobbied the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet Polish puppet government of Wanda Wasilewska in Moscow.|$|R
5000|$|In 1934 Tchernavin and {{his family}} moved to England where he {{continued}} his scientific work as an ichthyologist. His book I Speak for the Silent Prisoners of the <b>Soviets</b> [...] and his wife's book Escape From The <b>Soviets</b> {{were among the first to}} give testimony of life under the <b>Soviets,</b> the GPU's operations and the Gulag.|$|R
5|$|After {{the station}} opened, <b>Soviet</b> protests persisted. The issue was raised at {{official}} {{visits to the}} <b>Soviet</b> Union by Norwegian politicians in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The <b>Soviet</b> Consul in Barentsburg visited Ny-Ålesund in 1968 and attempted to make inspections of the installation. On 28 August 1968, Norway and the <b>Soviet</b> Union agreed for a one-time, two-day <b>Soviet</b> inspection of the station. The last protest against the installation was made in April 1969.|$|E
5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon after the <b>Soviet</b> invasion, the Writers' Association of <b>Soviet</b> Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the <b>Soviet</b> authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new <b>Soviet</b> regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to <b>Soviet</b> {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of <b>Soviet</b> communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of <b>Soviet</b> {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any <b>Soviet</b> incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Soviets</b> {{attacked}} with 122nd Rifle Division. The stalling of {{the offensive}} forced the <b>Soviets</b> to reinforce it in late December 1939 with the 88th Rifle Division.|$|R
50|$|In Latvia, NKVD {{units were}} the main anti-partisan force {{fighting}} against 10,000 active members of the resistance forces. The <b>Soviets</b> signed separate ceasefire agreements with the different resistance forces, which did not become active until {{after the end of}} the war; the agreement in Lithuania differed from those in Estonia and Latvia. The <b>Soviets</b> introduced conscription immediately after their occupation of Vilnius in July 1944. Only 14 percent of those eligible responded to the summons. The <b>Soviets</b> tracked down draft dodgers and killed over 400 people. During 1944 and 1945 the <b>Soviets</b> conscripted 82,000 Lithuanians.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Soviets</b> {{allied with}} the United Kingdom and United States; {{although}} the US joined the war against Germany in 1941, little direct assistance reached the <b>Soviets</b> until late 1942.|$|R
5|$|Armenian SSR, as a <b>Soviet</b> republic, was internationally {{recognized}} by the United Nations {{as part of the}} <b>Soviet</b> Union but it had Norair Sisakian as President of the 21st session of the UNESCO General Conference in 1964. The <b>Soviet</b> Union was also a member of Comecon, Warsaw Pact and the International Olympic Committee.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 <b>Soviet</b> monetary reform, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of <b>Soviet</b> roubles transported to the <b>Soviet</b> Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the <b>Soviet</b> Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 <b>Soviet</b> coup d'état attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the <b>Soviet</b> Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He was succeeded as premier by Ivan Silayev.|$|E
5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is {{difficult}} for the average <b>Soviet</b> psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to <b>Soviet</b> society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in <b>Soviet</b> consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated <b>Soviet</b> culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E
50|$|First All-Ukrainian Congress of <b>Soviets</b> (Перший Всеукраїнський з'їзд Рад) was a {{congress}} of <b>Soviets</b> (councils) of workers, peasants, Red-army-men deputies {{that took place}} in Kharkiv on December 24-25, 1917.|$|R
50|$|All-Russian Central Executive Committee {{was first}} elected at the first All-Russian Congress of <b>Soviets</b> in Petrograd, June 3-24, 1917. The first Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of <b>Soviets</b> was not a {{governing}} body and its chairman Nikolai Chkheidze was not the head of Russian state. This changed at the Second All-Russian Congress of <b>Soviets</b> during the October Revolution.|$|R
50|$|In May 1921, the Afghans and the <b>Soviets</b> {{signed a}} Treaty of Friendship, Afghanistan's first {{international}} agreement since gaining full independence in 1919. The <b>Soviets</b> provided Amanullah with {{aid in the}} form of cash, technology, and military equipment. Despite this, Amanullah grew increasingly disillusioned with the <b>Soviets,</b> especially as he witnessed the widening oppression of his fellow Muslims across the border.|$|R
5|$|As a {{case study}} of disinformation, the authors {{describe}} journalist , whose publication in France was secretly financed by <b>Soviet</b> intelligence. Its contents were biased against the Western world in favor of the <b>Soviet</b> agenda, and had considerable impact on public opinion. In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council, which operated as a front organization for <b>Soviet</b> intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U.S. Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two <b>Soviet</b> officials who had defected from their posts in <b>Soviet</b> intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of détente, he was Director of <b>Soviet</b> Affairs in the State Department, and began {{to participate in the}} summit meetings between the leaders, eventually attending {{all but one of the}} U.S. – <b>Soviet</b> summits held in the 20-year period 1972–91. Matlock was back in Moscow in 1974, serving in the number two position in the embassy for four years. The <b>Soviet</b> invasion of Afghanistan in early 1980 ended the period of reduced tensions. Matlock was assigned to Moscow again in 1981 as acting ambassador during the first part of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Reagan appointed him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later asked him to return to Washington in 1983 to work at the National Security Council, with the assignment to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1985, arms negotiations and summit meetings resumed. Matlock was appointed ambassador to the <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1987 and saw the last years of the <b>Soviet</b> Union before he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the <b>Soviet</b> Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the <b>Soviet</b> government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent <b>Soviet</b> workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the <b>Soviet</b> economy.|$|E
50|$|Second All-Ukrainian Congress of <b>Soviets</b> (Другий Всеукраїнський з'їзд Рад) was a {{congress}} of <b>soviets</b> (councils) of workers, peasants, Red-army-men deputies {{that took place}} in Katerynoslav (Dnipropetrovsk) on March 17-19, 1918.|$|R
50|$|Sixth All-Ukrainian Congress of <b>Soviets</b> (Всеукраїнський з'їзд Рад) was a {{congress}} of <b>Soviets</b> (councils) of workers, peasants, Red-army-men deputies {{that took place}} in Kharkiv on December 14 - 17, 1921.|$|R
