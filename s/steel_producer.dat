Data and methods [...] Chapter 5. Results [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion [...] References [...] Appendices. Important financial risks facing Chinese <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> include <b>steel,</b> iron ore and coking coal price risks. This thesis estimates the exposures to these financial risks for 31 publicly listed Chinese <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> between 2008 and 2015. Furthermore, this thesis investigates {{the impact of}} a regime shift from long-term to short-term pricing contracts on iron ore exposures. Iron ore prices have become increasingly volatile since this regime shift. <b>Steel</b> <b>producers</b> are expected to be exposed to iron ore prices, one of the key inputs for steelmaking. As the world’s largest group of <b>steel</b> <b>producers,</b> Chinese <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> rely heavily on iron ore imports, due to the undersupply of high quality iron ore from the Chinese domestic region. This study examines the commodity price exposures facing Chinese <b>steel</b> <b>producers.</b> In particular, it investigates their exposures to iron ore prices and how these exposures have changed since the iron ore pricing regime shift in 2010. The study finds that Chinese <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> are in general positively exposed to steel priceand negatively exposed to iron ore price, but natural hedge exists between iron ore andsteel. In addition, the impact of regime shift on iron exposures only becomes significant when longer horizon data are analysed.

The research methodology uses return on assets, beta coefficient and price/book value ratio (P/BV). The research results allow us to verify negatively two research hypotheses: H 1 – The largest <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> in the world achieve a high level of return on assets and are specific for a lower risk level than the branch one, and H 2 – Market value of the leading <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> with high return on assets is higher than the book value of these enterprises...|$|R
5|$|The {{economic}} boom in China and India {{has caused a}} massive increase in the demand for steel in recent years. Between 2000 and 2005, world steel demand increased by 6%. Since 2000, several Indian and Chinese steel firms have risen to prominence, such as Tata Steel (which bought Corus Group in 2007), Baosteel Group and Shagang Group. ArcelorMittal is however the world's largest <b>steel</b> <b>producer.</b>|$|E

Helliwell moved into non-League football in 1983 with Northern Premier League club Matlock Town, where he scored 68 goals in just over four seasons before signing for Third Division club York City on 23 October 1987 for a £10,000 fee. He made his debut a day later in a 4–2 away defeat to Sunderland, and scored his first goal on 7 November 1987 in a 1–1 home draw with Bury. He finished the 1987–88 season with 33 appearances and eight goals, while York were relegated into the Fourth Division. Helliwell finished 1988–89 as York's top scorer with 11 goals from 47 matches, and was voted as the Clubman of the Year by the club's supporters. His only hat-trick for the club came on 7 November 1989 in a 7–1 home victory over Hartlepool United in the Associate Members' Cup, and he finished 1989–90 as York's top scorer for the second successive season with 19 goals, playing in all 54 matches that season.

25|$|The {{northeast}} of China was marked out {{to become a}} major industrial centre for the new People's Republic of China. Anshan was set to become {{a key part of}} this industrial development. The steel mills had been damaged during the wars. In December 1948, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company—also known as Angang—was founded. Production in the newly repaired steel plant resumed on July 9, 1949. The plant was expanded to become the largest <b>steel</b> <b>producer</b> in China. Other industries setup alongside the steel plant including mining for coal, iron and other minerals. This industrial wealth had an environmental cost. The open-hearth furnaces of the steel mill created large amounts of dust and other pollution. Along with its growing reputation as a major <b>steel</b> <b>producer,</b> Anshan was also gaining a reputation as a dirty, smelly town.|$|E

25|$|In 1945 {{the steel}} plant was looted by soviet forces. The Republic of China {{government}} partially repaired the site {{but it was}} destroyed again during the Chinese civil war that saw the Communist forces victorious. The mills were once again repaired and Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) was founded in 1948. Form then to 2001, the company produced 290 million tons of steel, 284 million tons of pig iron and 192 million tons of rolled steel. Until relatively recently, when a new steel plant opened in Shanghai, Angang was the largest <b>steel</b> <b>producer</b> in China. Today, Angang consists of three steelworks with 13 rolling mills plus supporting plants which produce coke, refractory materials and machinery for the steel plants. The company has an annual production capacity of 10 million tons of pig iron, 10 million tons of steel and 9.5 million tons of rolled steel. A quarter of China's total iron ore reserves, about 10 billion tons, are located in Anshan ensuring that the city will remain an important <b>steel</b> <b>producer</b> well into the future.|$|E

50|$|In December 1918 the Comité des forges {{created the}} Comptoir sidérurgique de France, which {{allocated}} quotas {{to members of}} the steel cartel.During the war the government had ran the National Coal Bureau with a system under which small <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> who could not get cheap domestic coal were subsidized in buying more expensive imports.After the war the Comité des forges president François de Wendel asked that this function be transferred to a consortium organized by the Committee. The small producers were opposed to this measure, which seemed likely to confirm the advantage of the large companies.In 1923 the Comité des forges asked for either a customs barrier between the Ruhr and Germany so that the French <b>steel</b> <b>producers</b> could get cheaper coal than the Germans, or else a takeover of the German coal mines, which would be leased to the French <b>steel</b> <b>producers.</b>|$|R

25|$|U.S. Steel {{aimed to}} achieve greater economies of scale, reduce {{transportation}} and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution.

Schwab and others claimed that U.S. Steel's size would allow the company {{to be more aggressive}} and effective in pursuing distant international markets ("globalization"). U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, {{and a host of other}} products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan had captured two-thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 percent market share. However, after 1901 the business' market share dropped. Schwab resigned from U.S. Steel in 1903 to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. <b>steel</b> <b>producer.</b>|$|E
