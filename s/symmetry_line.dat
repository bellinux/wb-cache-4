However, finite element meshes with these elements exhibit the well-known "checkerboard " pathology in the solution of topology optimization problems. A feasible alternative to eliminate this long-standing problem consists of using hexagonal elements with Wachspress-type shape functions. The features of the hexagonal mesh include 2 -node connections (i. e. 2 elements are either not connected or connected by 2 nodes), and 3 edge-based <b>symmetry</b> <b>lines</b> per element. In contrast, quads can display 1 -node connection, which can lead to checkerboard; and only have 2 edge-based <b>symmetry</b> <b>lines.</b> We explore the Wachspress-type hexagonal elements and show their advantages in solving topology optimization problems.

40|$|A puzzle {{arising from}} Faraday's {{law has been}} {{considered}} and solved concerning the question which voltage will be induced in an open wire with a time-varying homogeneous magnetic field. In contrast to closed wires where the voltage {{is determined by the}} time variance of the magnetic field and the enclosed area, in an open wire we have to integrate the electric field along the wire. It is found that the longitudinal electric field with respect to the wave vector contributes with 1 / 3 and the transverse field with 2 / 3 to the induced voltage. In order to find the electric fields the sources of the magnetic fields are necessary to know. The representation of a spatially homogeneous and time-varying magnetic field implies unavoidably a certain symmetry point or <b>symmetry</b> <b>line</b> which depend on the geometry of the source. As a consequence the induced voltage of an open wire is found to be the area covered with respect to this <b>symmetry</b> <b>line</b> or point perpendicular to the magnetic field. This in turn allows to find the symmetry points of a magnetic field source by measuring the voltage of an open wire placed with different angles in the magnetic field. We present exactly solvable models of the Max-well equations for a symmetry point and for a <b>symmetry</b> <b>line,</b> respectively.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the transverse forces (the Magnus and the Lorentz forces) on vortices in superfluids put into periodic potentials at $T= 0 $. The case of weak potential and the tight-binding limit {{described by the}} Bose-Hubbard model were addressed. The analysis {{was based on the}} balance of true momentum and quasimomentum. A special attention was paid to the superfluid close to the superfluid-insulator transition. In this area of the phase diagram the theory predicts the particle-hole <b>symmetry</b> <b>line</b> where the Magnus force changes sign with respect to that expected from the sign of velocity circulation. Our analysis has shown that the magnitude of the Magnus force is a continuous function at crossing the particle-hole <b>symmetry</b> <b>line.</b> This challenges the theory connecting the magnitude of the Magnus force with topological Chern numbers and predicting a jump at crossing this line. Disagreement is explained by the role of intrinsic pinning and guided vortex motion ignored in the topological approach. It is one more evidence that in general topological arguments are not sufficient for derivation of equations of vortex motion. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|When {{a surface}} {{covered with a}} regular texture is viewed in perspective, the {{projected}} texture provides a number of cues to 3 D surface orientation. For oriented textures, one cue is perspective convergence: <b>symmetry</b> <b>lines</b> that are parallel along the surface project to lines that vary systematically in orientation. We investigated the contribution of perspective convergence to perception of 3 D slant and tested whether slant from convergence depends on oriented spectral components. Subjects judged the sign of slant about a vertical axis of rotation. Textures were composed of filled circles in three spatial arrangements: a hex grid with <b>symmetry</b> <b>lines</b> at 0 and ± 60 deg relative to the tilt direction (aligned condition), a hex grid with <b>symmetry</b> <b>lines</b> at 90 and ± 30 deg (perpendicular condition), and random arrangements with similar average spacing (isotropic condition). The two hex grid textures differed {{in the amount of}} spectral energy present in the tilt direction (horizontal) but were otherwise closely matched. Slant discrimination thresholds for monocular stimuli were higher for isotropic textures than for either of the two hex grid textures and were higher for the perpendicular texture than for the aligned texture. In a second experiment, we measured the weight given to texture relative to binocular slant information for cue conflict stimuli (± 5 deg). Weights were found to agree with individual subjects' monocular thresholds, in accordance with optimal estimation theory. We conclude that the visual system uses perspective convergence to perceive slant and that effective use of convergence requires the presence of spectral components aligned with the tilt direction. © 2006 ARVO. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a new <b>line</b> <b>symmetry</b> based {{classifier}} (LSC) {{is proposed}} {{to deal with}} pattern classification problems. In order to measure total amount of <b>line</b> <b>symmetry</b> of a particular point in a class, a new definition of <b>line</b> <b>symmetry</b> based distance is also proposed in this paper. The proposed <b>line</b> <b>symmetry</b> based classifier (LSC) utilizes this new definition of <b>line</b> <b>symmetry</b> distance for classifying an unknown test sample. LSC assigns an unknown test sample pattern to that class with respect to whose major axis it is most symmetric. The mean of all the training patterns belonging to that particular class is taken as the prototype of that class. Thus training constitutes of computing only the class prototypes and the major axes of those classes. Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search is used for reducing complexity of <b>line</b> <b>symmetry</b> distance computation. The performance of LSC is demonstrated in classifying twelve artificial and real-life data sets of varying complexities. Experimental results show that LSC achieves, in general, higher classification accuracy compared to k-NN classifier. Results indicate that the proposed novel <b>line</b> <b>symmetry</b> based classifier is well-suited for classifying data sets having symmetrical classes, irrespective of any convexity, overlap and size. Statistical analysis, ANOVA is also performed to compare the performance of these classifications techniques.

In general, finite element meshes with these elements exhibit the well-known checkerboard pathology in the iterative solution of topology opti-mization problems. Voronoi and Wachspress-type finite elements are less susceptible to such anomalies. Moreover, these elements provide more flexibility in mesh generation and are suitable for applications involving significant changes in the topology of the material domain. In particular, hexagonal Wachs-press meshes include two-node connections (i. e. two elements are either not connected or connected by two nodes), and three edge-based <b>symmetry</b> <b>lines</b> per element.
