2500|$|According to James Longuski (Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at Purdue University), the {{conspiracy}} theories are impossible {{because of their}} size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people {{who worked on the}} Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as Command Module pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon. Hundreds of thousands of people – including astronauts, <b>scientists,</b> <b>engineers,</b> <b>technicians,</b> and skilled laborers – would have had to keep the secret. Longuski argues {{that it would have been}} much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings. To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA who would have had a link to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. Penn Jillette made note of this in the [...] "Conspiracy Theories" [...] episode of his contrarian television show [...] in 2005. With the number of people involved, and noting the Watergate scandal, Jillette noted that someone would have outed the hoax by now.|$|E

50|$|On 16 July 1990, the Badr-I was {{launched}} as a secondary payload on a Long March 2E rocket from Area No. 2 at XSLC. Badr-1, a {{low earth orbit}} satellite, circled the Earth's orbit every 96 minutes, passing over Pakistan for 15 minutes {{three to four times}} a day. <b>Scientists,</b> <b>engineers,</b> <b>technicians,</b> and designers who developed the satellite watched the launch from range. They waited about 93 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting, before dr. M. Shafi Ahmad called Prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The downlink telemetry included data on temperatures inside and {{on the surface of the}} sphere. The satellite itself, a small but highly polished polyhedron, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. The satellite completed its designated life successfully. On the first orbit, the Suparco globally announced the launch of the satellite, and the Science ministry confirmed the launch of the satellite. As the satellite completed its life, a new project {{was launched}}, more ambitious, advanced, and difficult than Badr-I. However even after the Badr-II was completed, the satellite could not be able to launch until 2001.|$|E
