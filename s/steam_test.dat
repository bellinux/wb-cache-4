40|$|Besides the {{behavior}} of the hydrocarbon reservoir, the drilling and completion technology has a significant influence on the production capacity of oil and gas wells. When a well is not producing as expected, the formation may have low permeability or/and may be “damaged”. If the evaluation of the well productivity during the DST (Drill <b>Steam</b> <b>Test)</b> tests and the production of other wells in the same reservoir show that the production of the examined well should be higher we can look for the reason for the low production. If the reservoir permeability is low the well is the candidate of the stimulation by hydraulic fracturing. When the restricted flow into the wellbore caused by the improper well drilling or well completion technology then the near wellbore damage should be removed or decreased, and the completion technology should be corrected.

40|$|Experimemts using Cl/sup 36 / in a <b>steam</b> <b>test</b> loop were {{conducted}} to study the deposition behavior of chlorides on BONUS superheater fuel assembly materials. The moisture content of the steam was varied between 0 and 0. 5 wt%, and superheat was added up to 15 deg F before the steam passed over the test cartridge heater. The effects of vaiiables on the chloride deposition on the heater were studied in detail. Chloride deposition from moist steam was found to result in heavy, adherent deposits which are conducive to severe chloride stress corrosion of austenitic steels, while removal of all moisture from the incoming steam reduces the chloride deposition and minimizes the chloride stress corrosion. The heater surface condition {{was found to be}} a very important variable; deposition is increased by surface defects and pits. Neither the temperature of steam or heater nor the amount of superheat had an appreciable effect on the deposition, when no moisture existed in the steam. However, low steam velocities and spacer protoberances increase the deposition. Different clad materials (Inconel and Type 304 and 347 stainless steel) with similar surface conditions did not affect the deposition, although subsequent corrosion effects do modify the deposition behavior.

40|$|We present here some {{important}} results investigating aluminum {{as an effective}} surface dopant for increased oxidation resistance of zircaloy nuclear fuel cladding. At first, the transport behavior of aluminum into reactor grade zircaloy was studied using simple diffusion couples at temperatures greater than 770 K. The experiments revealed the formation of tens of microns thick graded Zr-Al layers. The activation energy of aluminum in zircaloy {{was found to be}} ~ 175 kJ/mol (~ 1. 8 eV), indicating the high mobility of aluminum in zircaloy. Subsequently, aluminum sputter-coated zircaloy coupons were heat-treated to achieve surface doping and form compositionally graded layers. These coupons were then tested in steam environments at 1073 and 1273 K. The microstructure of the as-fabricated and steam-corroded specimens was compared to those of pure zircaloy control specimens. Analysis of data revealed that aluminum effectively competed with zircaloy for oxygen up until 1073 K blocking oxygen penetration, with no traces of large scale spalling, indicating mechanically stable interfaces and surfaces. At the highest <b>steam</b> <b>test</b> temperatures, aluminum was observed to segregate from the Zr-Al alloy under layers and migrate to the surface forming discrete clusters. Although this is perceived as an extremely desirable phenomenon, in the current experiments, oxygen was observed to penetrate into the zirconium-rich under layers, which could be attributed to formation of surface defects such as cracks in the surface alumina layers.

40|$|The {{following}} report {{investigates the}} use of abradable seal technology in industrial steam turbine applications. Abradable seals are a highly adaptable, widely applicable and cheap method of improving seal performance. By retrofitting abradable coatings to existing labyrinth seals, improvements {{in the range of}} 0. 5 % - 1 % power output are seen with cost returns within two years [1]. The intention of this investigation was to develop fundamental understanding of the seal degradation process. A Multi Oxidation and Incursion <b>Steam</b> <b>Test</b> (MOIST) rig was designed from concept, through detailed design and finally commissioned. During commissioning the capabilities of the MOIST rig were defined. Although flowing steam operation was not achieved during this investigation, a theoretically proofed steam system is in place for future development. High temperature operation was achieved, although not reliably. Reliable, repeatable atmospheric tests were developed, representative of the start-up and shut-down operations of an industrial steam turbine. These tests produced relative velocities up to 121 ms- 1 between coatings and blades, and incursion rates up to 50 μms- 1. ST 12 T, Nimonic 80 A and Nimonic 101 blade materials were tested against a bentonite-NiCrAl abradable coating. The results suggest that the bentonite-NiCrAl abradable coating tested was highly suitable as an abradable coating for all blade materials. Additionally, high temperature tests are necessary to fully prove {{the use of}} blade materials against coating systems. Simultaneously, non-MOIST rig oxidation testing was performed in the range of 580 ˚C - 800 ˚C in static air and 580 ˚C in flowing steam for exposure times up to 5000 hrs. Bentonite-NiCrAl top coat - NiAl bond coat and either a STG- 9 T or IN 625 substrate were analysed to devise mechanistic models for the oxidation of the top coat, bond coat, substrate and all associated interfaces. It was concluded that steam oxidation is intrinsically different to air oxidation and that adapting the bond coat to include Cr would significantly improve the oxidation resistance and service life of the coating system investigated...|$|E
40|$|For future {{parabolic}} trough plants direct steam generation in the receiver pipes is a promising option {{for reducing the}} costs of solar thermal energy [1]. These new solar thermal power plants require innovative storage concepts, where the two phase heat transfer fluid poses a major challenge [2]. For the regions where the heat transfer fluid is in a single phase (water or steam), sensible heat storage using molten salt [3] or concrete [4] as storage material can be applied. However, efficient energy storage in the two-phase evaporation/condensation region requires heat storage operation within a narrow temperature range. For this two phase region, a high performance PCM storage technology was developed and demonstrated by DLR. A test module using 14 tons of PCM with 700 kWh capacity was built in 2009 and commissioned in 2010 in a direct <b>steam</b> <b>test</b> loop, set up at the power plant Litoral of Endesa in Carboneras, Spain [5]. The PCM-storage uses Sodium nitrate as phase change material with a melting temperature of 305 °C. Cycle testing has started end of 2010. Cycling tests have proven the expected discharge capacity of approx. 700 kWh for the PCM-storage module. System operation in constant pressure mode and sliding pressure mode has been conducted for the PCM-storage. While in the constant pressure mode a peak performance of the storage of more than 700 kW could be demonstrated, in the sliding pressure mode a constant power output over almost the whole charge and discharge period could be provided. The paper discusses the test results and evaluation for different operation modes for the phase change storage for discharge operation. Charging of the phase change storage is always in a once-through mode. However, for discharge, the steam can be generated either in forced or natural circulation mode or in once-through mode, leading to very different effects for the two-phase flow and filling level inside the heat exchanger pipes in the storage. The effects for forced and natural circulation discharge will be analysed and described in the paper. ...|$|E
