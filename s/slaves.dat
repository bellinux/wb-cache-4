Relatively few Brazilians owned <b>slaves</b> and most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. <b>Slaves</b> could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated <b>slaves</b> went on to acquire <b>slaves</b> and there were even cases of <b>slaves</b> who had their own <b>slaves.</b> While <b>slaves</b> were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of <b>slaves</b> {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and their female mulatto <b>slaves.</b> Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling <b>slaves</b> along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. <b>Slaves</b> were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed <b>slaves</b> were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included <b>slaves</b> who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped <b>slaves.</b> Other escaped <b>slaves</b> used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some <b>slaves</b> lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence <b>slaves</b> actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped <b>slaves</b> who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

At the time of her death, Hamilton's mother owned two <b>slaves</b> named Christian and Ajax, and she had written a will leaving them to her sons; however, due to their illegitimacy, Hamilton and his brother were held ineligible to inherit her property, and never took ownership of the <b>slaves.</b> Later, as a youth in St. Croix, Hamilton worked for a company trading in commodities that included <b>slaves.</b> During his career, Hamilton did occasionally purchase or sell <b>slaves</b> for others as their legal representative, and one of Hamilton's grandsons interpreted some of these journal entries as being purchases for himself.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the number of <b>slaves</b> in ancient Greece, {{given the lack of}} a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, on average three or four <b>slaves</b> per household. In the 5th century BC, Thucydides remarked on the desertion of 20,890 <b>slaves</b> during the war of Decelea, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 <b>slaves,</b> during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 <b>slaves.</b> The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls that the effort to enlist 15,000 male <b>slaves</b> of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.|$|E
5|$|Most {{activities}} {{were open to}} <b>slaves</b> except politics, which was reserved for citizens.

5|$|<b>Slaves</b> (nuli 奴隸) {{comprised}} roughly 1% of the population, {{a proportion}} {{far less than}} the contemporary Greco-Roman world which relied on the labor of a large slave population. <b>Slaves</b> were classified into two categories: those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned <b>slaves</b> were often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government <b>slaves</b> bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards for their services. State-owned <b>slaves</b> were sometimes prisoners of war (yet not all were made <b>slaves).</b> However, most <b>slaves</b> were tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private <b>slaves</b> who were either donated to authorities (since this would exempt the former slaveholder from labor obligations) or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into <b>slaves.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Slaves</b> in Toraja society were family property. Sometimes Torajans {{decided to}} become <b>slaves</b> when they {{incurred}} a debt, pledging to work as payment. <b>Slaves</b> could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. <b>Slaves</b> could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. <b>Slaves</b> were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime punishable by death.|$|E
5|$|State-owned <b>slaves</b> {{were put}} to work in palaces, offices, workshops, stables, and {{sometimes}} state-owned agricultural fields, while privately owned <b>slaves</b> were employed in domestic services and sometimes farming. However, {{the vast majority of}} non-independent farmers working for wealthy landowners were not hired laborers or <b>slaves,</b> but were landless peasants who paid rent as tenants. It might have been more economically feasible to maintain tenants instead of <b>slaves,</b> since slave masters were obligated to pay an annual poll tax of 240 coins for each slave they owned (the same rate merchants had to pay for their poll tax). Government <b>slaves</b> were not assigned to work in the government's monopolized industries over iron and salt (which lasted from Emperor Wu's reign until the beginning of Eastern Han). Privately owned <b>slaves</b> were usually assigned to kitchen duty while others fulfilled roles as armed bodyguards, mounted escorts, acrobats, jugglers, dancers, singers, and musicians.|$|E

The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship and sailed her in the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the <b>slaves</b> as cargo. When the ship ran low on potable water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw <b>slaves</b> overboard into the sea to drown, partly in order to ensure the survival {{of the rest of the}} ship's passengers, and in part to cash in on the insurance on the <b>slaves,</b> thus not losing money on the <b>slaves</b> who would have died from the lack of drinking water.|$|E

Private <b>slaves</b> could buy their freedom from their master, while some masters chose to free their <b>slaves.</b> Although <b>slaves</b> were subject to beatings if they did not obey their masters, it was against the law to murder a slave; kings were stripped of their kingdoms after it was found that they had murdered <b>slaves,</b> while Wang Mang even forced one of his sons to commit suicide for murdering a slave.

5|$|The {{legal status}} and rights of Roman <b>slaves</b> {{also began to}} change.

Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of <b>slaves,</b> holding owners responsible for the killing of <b>slaves,</b> forcing the sale of <b>slaves</b> when it could be shown {{that they were being}} mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal.

With Rome's heavy involvement in wars of conquest in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, tens if not hundreds of thousands of <b>slaves</b> at a time were imported into the Roman economy from various European and Mediterranean acquisitions.
