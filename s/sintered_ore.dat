However, the distribution of manganese ores is significantly uneven on earth, and their characteristics considerably vary by ore type.

A sintered iron ore with good hightemperature properties (strength and permeability) should be used as feed to the blast furnace.

The penetration test is the standard method for evaluating the reactivity of iron ore with lime. It is, however, difficult to determine the exact depth of penetration from the standard test. A new test method is proposed that allows automatic evaluation of iron ores in terms of lime assimilation with increasing temperature.

Thus, iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> processes {{are thought to}} be a potential source of PCNs, although intensive investigations on PCN emissions from sintering processes have not been carried out. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to qualify and quantify PCN emissions from nine sintering plants operating on different industrial scales. PCN concentrations ranged from 3 to 983 ng m(- 3) (0. 4 - 23. 3 pg TEQ(PCN) m(- 3)) and emission factors ranged from 14 to 1749 mu g t(- 1) (0. 5 - 41. 5 ng TEQ(PCN) t(- 1)), with a geometric mean of 84 mu g t(- 1) (2. 1 ng TEQ(PCN) t(- 1)). The estimated annual emission of PCNs from sintering processes in China was 1390 mg TEQ(PCN). These figures will assist in the development of a PCN emissions inventory. Regarding emission characteristics, PCNs mainly comprised low-chlorinated homologs. The ratios of several characteristic PCN congeners were also measured and compared with those from other sources.

Post-ignition airflow rate is a strong function of the pre-ignition airflow rate and the flow resistance of the flame front.

It has been revealed that the main reason of strength degradation is polymorphism of dicalcium silicate Ca 2 SiO 4 (or short designation С 2 S) : β-Ca 2 SiO 4 ® γ-Ca 2 SiO 4. Ways for increasing the  agglomerate  strength by physical and crystal-chemical stabilization of the high temperature modification of C 2 S have been proposed and tested. Physical stabilization of C 2 S agglomerate is increased with its structure reinforcement due to thickening of walls between large pores that is achieved by increasing height of the sintered layer through improvement of its gas permeability. The task is addressed by substituting the previously used import <b>sintering</b> <b>ore</b> with the  polydisperse ore from the Yakovlevo field, which improves the charge  pelletizing by 3 - 4 times and helps to bring the  height of the sintered layer and the strength of the domestic agglomerate up to the international best practice standards, while eliminating a need to purchase import high-vacuum   exhausters.

Increasing basicity significantly increased the thermal range of SFCA-I, from 1363 K to 1533 K (1090 °C to 1260 °C) for a mixture with B = 2. 48, to ~ 1339 K to 1535 K (1066 °C to 1262 °C) for a mixture with B = 3. 96, and to ~ 1323 K to 1593 K (1050 °C to 1320 °C) at B = 4. 94. Increasing basicity also increased the amount of SFCA-I formed, from 18 wt pct for the mixture with B = 2. 48 to 25 wt pct for the B = 4. 94 mixture. Higher basicity of the starting sinter mixture will, therefore, increase the amount of SFCA-I, considered to be more desirable of the two phases.
