The goal was to define the biomechanical changes according to eccentric <b>strengthening</b> {{for the development of}} clinical guidelines. Eighteen patients with Achilles tendinopathy were recruited at the K Rehabilitation Hospital in Seoul. The subjects were instructed to perform 5 sessions of concentric <b>strengthening.</b> The calcaneal pathway was measured using a three-dimensional (3 D) motion analyzer, and COG was measured by a force plate. Subsequently, eccentric <b>strengthening</b> was implemented, and identical variables were measured. Concentric and eccentric <b>strengthening</b> was carried out on both the involved and non-involved sides. There {{was no significant difference in}} the calcaneal pathway in patients with Achilles tendinopathy during concentric and eccentric <b>strengthening.</b> However, during eccentric <b>strengthening,</b> the calcaneal pathway significantly increased on the involved side compared to the non-involved side for all variables excluding the z-axis.
