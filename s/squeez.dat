Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging technology allow fine anatomical {{structures such as}} endocardial trabeculae to be resolved and potentially used as fiducial markers for tracking local wall deformations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the correlation between local myocardial function estimates from CT and myocardial strain from tagged MRI in the same heart. Accurate detection of regional myocardial dysfunction can be an important finding in the diagnosis of functionally significant coronary artery disease. Tagged MRI is currently a reference standard for noninvasive regional myocardial function analysis; however, it has practical drawbacks. We have developed a CT imaging protocol and automated image analysis algorithm for estimating regional cardiac function from a few heartbeats. This method tracks the motion of the left ventricular (LV) endocardial surface to produce local function maps: we call the method Stretch Quantification of Endocardial Engraved Zones (<b>SQUEEZ).</b> Myocardial infarction was created by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 2 h followed by reperfusion in canine models. Tagged and cine MRI scans were performed during the reperfusion phase and first-pass contrast enhanced CT scans were acquired. The average delay between the CT and MRI scans was < 1 h. Circumferential myocardial strain (Ecc) was calculated from the tagged MRI data. The agreement between peak systolic Ecc and <b>SQUEEZ</b> was investigated in 162 segments in the 9 hearts. Linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the correlation between the two metrics of local LV function. The results show good agreement between <b>SQUEEZ</b> and Ecc: (r = 0. 71, slope = 0. 78, p < 0. 001). Furthermore, Bland-Altman showed a small bias of - 0. 02 with 95 % confidence interval of 0. 1, and standard deviation of 0. 05 representing ~ 6. 5 % of the dynamic range of LV function. The good agreement between the estimates of local myocardial function obtained from CT <b>SQUEEZ</b> and tagged MRI provides encouragement to investigate the use of <b>SQUEEZ</b> for measuring regional cardiac function at a low clinical dose in humans...|$|E
40|$|Study design: Systematic review. Background: Orthopedic {{tests for}} syndesmosis {{injuries}} are routinely {{used during the}} physical examination. The quality of the tests have been considered low and patients are suspected to be misdiagnosed. This can lead to inproper treatment and even cronic pain or loss of function {{and stability in the}} ankle. Objective: To determine the value of clinical tests for accurate diagnosis of ankle syndesmosis injuries. Methods: A search for relevant litterature was conducted (to 18. 09. 16) of the databases AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, PEDRO and Web of Science. Studies of any design were included, except from systematic reviews. Only published articles in English og Scandinavian language were reviewed. Eligible studies included participants with ankle injuries without fracture. The studies had to compare one or more clinical tests accuracy to a referance standard of arthroscopy or MRI. Results: 5 studies met the inclusion criterias, analyzing a total of 6 special tests for the ankle syndesmosis; <b>squeez</b> test, external rotation stress test, Cotton test, fibula translation test, point test and crossed leg test. After assessment using QUADAS 2, only one study had a low risk for bias and low concerns regarding applicability. Conclusion: Most included studies demonstrated notable biases and there were big differences in methodical build up. Findings show that clinicians cannot rely on a single test to identify ankle syndesmosis injury with certainty. <b>Squeez</b> test and External rotation stress test are more confirmatory in nature and are best utilized {{at the end of the}} physical examination...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple three-class {{model in the}} Kaleckian {{tradition}} to investigate the implications of a dominant managerial class class for the dynamics of demand and distribution. Managers are hired by capitalists to supervise workers, but supervision results in surplus extraction and wage inequality. The adjustment of capacity utilization to accommodate goods market disequilibrium produces two distinct regimes {{with respect to the}} responsiveness of investment demand to profitability: a low investment–response regime, where effective demand is both wage–led and inequality–led; and a high investment–response regime, where demand is profit–led. In accordance with recent empirical evidence for the US, we then introduce distributive dynamics that hinge on inequality squeezing workers’ wage growth. We find that the low investment–responsiveness regime produces a stable demand–distribution equilibrium only if the wage squeeze effect is relatively small. On the other hand, an equilibrium in the high investment–response regime is saddle–path stable. The main distributional implication of the wage <b>squeez...</b>|$|E

40|$|The sealing {{capability}} of an elastomeric O-ring seal {{depends upon the}} contact stresses that develop between the O-ring and the surfaces with which it comes into contact. It has been suggested in the literature that leakage will occur when the pressure differential across the seal just exceeds the initial (or static) peak contact stress. The stresses that develop in compressed O-rings, in common cases of restrained and unrestrained geometries (grooved and ungrooved), are investigated using the finite element method. The analysis includes material hyperelasticity and axisymmetry. Contact stress profiles, and peak contact stresses are plotted versus squeeze, up to 32 percent. The contact width, which is {{the length of the}} O-ring that touches the retaining surfaces when viewed from the cross-section, is also determined. Expressions are derived empirically to predict the peak contact stress and the contact width. These expressions are also compared to those obtained by other researchers (who assumed plain strain conditions) and conclusions to their validity are drawn.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most modern engines utilise pistons with an offset gudgeon pin. In internal combustion engines, the offset is to the major thrust side of the piston. The piston thrust side {{is the part of}} the piston perpendicular to the gudgeon pin that carries the majority of side loading during the power stroke. Primary reason for having the gudgeon pin positioned eccentrically is to prevent the piston from slamming into the cylinder bore after the connecting rod journal passes the top dead centre. This phenomenon is referred to as piston slap, and is more pronounced in compression ignition and high performance engines due to higher combustion pressure than that of commercial spark ignition engines. The coming together of the piston and the bore results in scuffing, at best, or, catastrophic failure at worst. Clearance space between bore and piston is filled by a lubricant film. The main role of the lubricant is to separate the piston and bore by reacting to the applied load. Investigating the above problem requires a holistic approach, whereby a dynamic three degree-of-freedom piston model is coupled with a lubrication model to represent the actual system. The dynamic model determines the motion of the piston in combined axial, lateral and rotation about the gudgeon pin. The reactive forces due to lubricant films on the major and minor thrust sides of the piston play significant roles in piston dynamics and are evaluated by either quasi-static or transient solution of the lubricant contact conjunctions. The novel quasi-static analysis is carried out in the sense of its detailed approach, including many key practical features. not incorporated in other analyses, hitherto reported in literature. These features include first and foremost the development of a specific contact mechanics model for evaluation of conforming contacts for piston skirt against liner or bore. The quasi-static analysis includes many practical feature not encountered in other literature on the subject, such as detailed surface irregularities and modification features, and with thermal distortion. The analysis has been extended to thermohydrodynamics, as well as micro-hydrodynamics, all with high computational mesh densities, and robust methods of solution in space and time domains, including effective influence Newton-Raphson method and linear acceleration integration scheme. The transient tribo-elasto-multi-body dynamics problem includes physics of motion study from film thickness prediction and secondary motion evaluation of the order of micrometers and minutes of arc to large rigid body dynamics, including simultaneous solution of the contact problem at both major and minor thrust sides. Such a comprehensive solution has not hitherto been reported in literature. The thesis discusses many aspects of piston dynamics problem, through the broad spectrum of vehicle manufacture, with many pertinent practical engineering issues. In particular, it provides solutions for high performance Formula 1 racing engines. This is the first ever comprehensive analysis of piston tribodynamics for this range of engines at very high combustion pressures. This study has shown the paramount influence of profile of piston in promoting lubrication between the contiguous bodies, as evident from the pattern of lubricant flow through the contact. Deformation of the bodies increases the volume of lubricant in the contact. During the reversal in direction of piston motion, when the entraining velocity momentarily cases and reversal takes place, the load is held by an elastic <b>squeez...</b>|$|E
