5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match. Johnny Devine interfered midway through by hitting Storm with a kendo stick, {{which led to a}} pinfall attempt by Young, however Stormed kicked out at two. Later, Young went to grab a chair from Devine who had his back turned to the ring. This caused Devine to panic and hit Young in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning his <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{after losing}} and then regaining the title from rival Leilani Kai at the inaugural WrestleMania, Richter was {{scheduled}} to defend her title at Madison Square Garden on November 25 of that same year against a mysterious masked opponent known only as The Spider. During the match, The Spider broke from the pre-scripted events and pinned Richter's <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> the mat. The referee—who was in on the plan—delivered a swift three count, despite Richter kicking out after a count of one. Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack the Spider, unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a singles match in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were {{supposed}} to be the guest referees, but due to storyline purposes, Pat Patterson, an accomplice of Vince McMahon, replaced Vince, who had had his ankle broken earlier in the event, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker executed a chokeslam on him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding chair. As Austin went to cover the Undertaker, Gerald Brisco, another accomplice of Vince, came down to the ring to replace Patterson and officiated the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker attacked him. Vince then came down to the ring as another referee replacement, but when Austin forcefully pulled the Undertaker's head over his <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> perform a stunner, Shane prevented him from performing a three count. As Vince and Shane argued, Austin got up and confronted Vince, at which point Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a roll-up by The Undertaker, and then performed a fast count to give him the victory and the WWF Title.|$|E

5|$|As Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) {{defeated}} Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, {{they were}} {{given the opportunity to}} be in charge of Raw for a month; On the November 29 episode of Raw, Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal. The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match. Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge, only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoit’s <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> touch the mat. The referee began counting, which moments later led to Edge to submit to the maneuver. The following week, with Chris Jericho in charge, Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight title, concluding the match ended in a tie. On the December 13 episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff, who had resumed his position as General Manager, scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Benoit, Chris Jericho, Orton and Batista at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight title. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding a Special Guest Referee for the Elimination Chamber: Shawn Michaels. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign.|$|E

25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> cope with punctures. It could take {{two or three minutes}} to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or any other part of the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.|$|E
25|$|The poodle is an active, {{intelligent}} and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, {{the length of}} body measured from the breastbone {{to the point of}} the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.|$|E

25|$|A {{variation}} on tweening {{is used by}} a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. It {{can also be used}} to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).|$|E
25|$|The fifth match pitted Barry Windham {{defending}} the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship against Lex Luger. Luger dominated Windham {{for much of}} the earlier part of the match by performing his power moves. The action spilled to the ringside. The two returned with Windham delivering a Suplex to Luger. The two returned to the ringside where Windham attacked Luger on the guardrail. Windham tried to Punch Luger in the ringpost but Luger avoided it and Windham's hand hurt. It became trouble for Windham as he was unable to use his hurt hand. He managed to apply a Clawhold on Luger but Luger escaped the hold. Windham delivered a Superplex from the top rope and tried to pin Luger's <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> the mat. Luger pulled his shoulders up and Windham was pinned. As a result, Luger won the title.|$|E
25|$|The mantua or manteau {{was a new}} {{fashion that}} arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's Banyan, worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it {{developed}} into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline {{in contrast to the}} broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or eardrops worn since the 1630s remained popular.|$|E

25|$|Beginners {{often make}} the mistake of not {{relaxing}} the arm during the recovery and of moving the hand too high and too far away from the body, in some cases even higher than the elbow. In these cases, drag and incidental muscle effort is increased at the expense of speed. Beginners often forget to use their <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> let the hand enter as far forward as possible. Some say the hand should enter the water thumb first, reducing drag through possible turbulence, others say the middle finger is first with the hand precisely bent down, giving thrust right from the start. At the beginning of the pull, the hand acts like a wing and is moved slower than the swimmer while at the end it acts like an oar and is moved faster than the swimmer.|$|E
25|$|This {{species of}} {{capuchin}} is polygamous. The male mounts the female, holding her legs with his hind feet, and copulates {{with her for}} a few minutes. Although the time of gestation is unknown, it is probably around 160 days like the tufted capuchin. Usually one infant is born. Observations of a newborn in El Tuparro National Park showed {{the process by which}} the newborn discovered the appropriate position for riding on the mother. Newborns ride oriented sideways over the mothers' shoulders, but during the first days the baby holds on to any part of the mother such as the base of the tail, the tail, the legs, and the arms before discovering and learning that the position over the shoulders is best and most secure. After several weeks the baby makes the change from the sideways position over the <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> riding on her back.|$|E
25|$|Props {{have to take}} in {{pressure}} from the locks and loose forwards pushing from behind and the opposition pushing against them, so they are often among the strongest players in a team. Some of the more successful props have short necks and broad <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> absorb this force as well as powerful legs to drive the scrum forward. Since the game has become professional, non-specialist props or hookers cannot play in the front row. If, through sendings-off or injuries, a team {{does not have enough}} specialist front row players, the scrums become 'uncontested' (i.e. no pushing is allowed and the team putting the ball into the scrum wins it). On their own scrum, the loosehead's role is to provide the hooker with a clear view to strike the ball, while the tighthead tries to keep the scrum stable. When the opposition is putting the ball in, the tighthead attempts to disrupt the opposing hooker or loosehead, making {{it difficult for them to}} win the ball.|$|E
