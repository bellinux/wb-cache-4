40|$|A great {{obstacle}} for seismic surveys on firn-covered ice masses is {{the ability}} of firn to strongly attenuate seismic energy and divert downward ray paths away from the vertical because of the velocity gradient. The standard way to overcome these limitations is the drilling of <b>shotholes</b> about 10 - 30 m deep. However, drilling of <b>shotholes</b> is a time and energy consuming task. Another possibility is to use vibroseismic sources at the surface and increase the signal-to-noise ratio by repeated stacking. However, compared to explosive charges, vibroseismic signals are bandlimited per se. As a third variant, we investigate the usage of ordered patterns of surface charges consisting of detonation cord. Previous applications of detonation cord only explored their general comparison to bulk explosives when deployed in a linear fashion, i. e. a single line. Our approach extends these results to other geometries, like fan- or comb-shaped patterns. These have two advantages: first, over the pattern area a locally plane wave is generated, limiting the spherical and velocity-gradient induced spreading of energy during propagation; second, the ratio between seismic wave speed of the firn and the detonation cord of typically about 1 : 5 causes the wave to propagate in an angle downward. When using large offsets like a snow streamer, it is possible to direct the refected energy towards the streamer, depending on offset range and reflector depth. We compare the different source types for several surveys conducted in Antarctica in terms of frequency spectra. Our results show that ordered patterns of detonation cord serve as suitable seismic surface charges, avoiding the need to drill <b>shotholes.</b> Moreover, an example of a short profile with patterned surface charges is presented. The technique can be of advantage for surveys in remote areas, which can only be accessed by aircrafts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{a result}} of years of {{developing}} the breeding programme for creating novel sweet cherry cultivars in the Fruit Growing Institute (FGI), Plovdiv, a reach hybrid fund from first and second hybrid generation is created. Of the selected and propagated hybrids at a more advanced stage of testing are 11 hybrids along with three new cultivars of the FGI Plovdiv ('Kossara', 'Rosalina' and 'Trakiiska hrushtyalka') grafted on three rootstocks were tested for sensitivity to causers of economically important fungal diseases in sweet cherry - cherry leaf spot (Blumeriella jaapii (Rehm) Arx), <b>shothole</b> blight (Stigmina carpophila (Lev.) Ellis) and brown rot (Monilinia fructigena (G. Wint) Honey). The degree of infestation under field conditions is reported by determining the index of attack on leaves and fruit, using the formula of McKinney. As the most sensitive elites are outlined elite El. 17 - 31 (to cherry leaf spot) and elite El. 17 - 136 (to <b>shothole</b> blight). The cultivars 'Kossara' and 'Trakiiska hrushtyalka' exhibit an average resistance to the three diseases, as the values for the index of infestation are lower or {{similar to those of}} standard cultivars 'Van' and 'Bing', while 'Rosalina' demonstrated sensitivity to <b>shothole</b> blight and brown rot.

40|$|For {{many years}} {{exploration}} seismologists have endeavored {{to carry out}} wavenumber filtering by using a multiplicity of geophones per trace in order to attenuate undesired waves and to in-tensify the signal. In a similar manner, wavenum-ber filtering is carried out very often at the place of origin of seismic energy by shooting from sev-eral <b>shotholes</b> or by combining several elements of a nondynamite source in a suitable manner. The following consideration refers to receivers (geophones or hydrophones) {{as well as to}} emitters (shots and other sources of energy); for simplicity, in the following, the term “geophones ” stands for all kinds of receivers and sources of energy. When designing a suitable geophone pattern we can start from different requirements; two shall be treated here. According to the first require-ment, a linear symmetrical geophone array of finite extension is to be determined in such a man-ner that we arrive at the least-mean-square ap-proximatiqn of a rectangular filter. The desired amplitude response of such a rectangular filter is described by the following formula...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey {{conducted}} a seismic refraction survey {{along the east}} side of San Francisco Bay in Alameda County, California, during the summers of 1972 and 1973. The area included in the survey extends from 1 mile south of the Dumbarton Bridge to 5 miles north of the San Mateo Bridge (fig. 1 A and IB). The purpose of the seismic investiga-tion was to determine the velocity and nature of the material overlying the bedrock and the velocity,depth, and configuration of the bedrock surface. This information can be used by persons concerned with land gse, ecology, and earthquake hazards and contributes to the geologic knowledge of the San Francisco Bay area. A 24 -trace refraction seismograph, mounted in a four-wheel drive vehicle was used to obtain the seismic records. The reversed profile method of shooting was used to make the seismic refraction field measure-ments. In this method, the geophones are arranged in a straight line, and an explosive charge is detonated alternately in the <b>shotholes</b> at th...|$|R

40|$|During {{the third}} quarter, {{processing}} continued at Western Geophysical. The processing was closely monitored by Palantir and Blackhawk Geosciences. Early in the processing Palantir {{determined that the}} original DMO velocities from the combined data volume were inadequate for performing the azimuthally split DMO. A series of DMO velocity scans were therefore run {{on each of the}} data sets and new velocities picked using two work stations simultaneously. This ensured uniform picking throughout the two volumes. DMO on the separated volumes and final migration demonstrated results that showed significantly clearer reflections than the total (all Azimuth) volume for certain intervals. A difference in the two velocity fields showed that the E-W data volume is consistently higher in velocity than the N-S data volume. This result would correspond to dominant, open E-W fractures at depth. This report also reviews the states of data acquisition and seismic source drilling and placement. It documents the <b>shothole</b> drilling design, layout, and detector placement...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution seismic {{methods were}} used in two {{separate}} studies to map shallow sedimentary/volcanic interfaces beneath the western Snake River Plain (WSRP). The first investigation took place near Orchard, Idaho at a site known locally as Orchard Ranch. Severe attenuation of seismic energy in dry semi-consolidated sediments is characteristic {{of this part of}} the WSRP. An experimental north-south refraction line 920 -m long consisting of nine geophone spreads was completed at Orchard Ranch. Data were acquired using a Bison Instruments model 8024 fixed-gain, 8 -bit, 24 -channel portable engineering seismograph with 8 Hz geophones. The seismic source consisted of two pounds of Kinestik explosive buried in 1. 8 -m auger holes and detonated with an Atlas Staticmaster blasting cap. <b>Shotholes</b> were drilled with a hand-held auger at 0 m, 50 m, and 100 m in-line offsets at both ends of each spread. Thus, reversed data coverage was acquired for Reciprocal Method (RM) and Generalized Reciprocal Method (GRM) analyses. One well {{at each end of the}} 920 -m long profile provided vertical control for the refraction survey and allowed examination of errors in the calculated results. The Orchard Ranch well located at the south end of the line is open to 98 m depth, and the PVC-cased well at the north end is open to 41 m depth. Natural gamma ray logging in the two wells resulted in precise identification of the sediment/basalt interface which underlies the area at about 40 m depth and represents the target refractor for the study. RM analysis was applied to phantomed first-arrival data with forced depth ties between adjacent spreads. Reliance on first layer velocity determinations was eliminated by calibrating the depth conversion factors for the two end spreads with the known basalt depths. Four spreads (1 through 4) at the south end of the line were processed from south to north, and four spreads (5 through 8) at the north end were processed from north to south. The depth discrepancy created at the middle of the line by the bi-directional analysis was 4. 2 m or 13...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from February 24, 2017 - February 24, 2018 The common cherrylaurel (Prunus laurocerasus) and Portuguese cherrylaurel (P. lusitanica) are economically important landscape shrubs across the United States. To {{gain a better understanding}} of physiology and morphology in these higher level polyploids (P. lusitanica, 2 n = 8 x; P. laurocerasus, 2 n = 22 x), a variety of breeding experiments were performed. The long-term goal of these experiments was to lay the ground-work for the creation of a sterile, <b>shothole</b> disease resistant cherrylaurel, while maintaining its desirable ornamental features. In attempt to narrow the gap in ploidy level between these two species, the chromosome number of P. lusitanica was doubled using colchicine and oryzalin, and differences in cytotypes were observed. This was performed with the hope of performing interspecific hybridization and introgression of <b>shothole</b> disease resistance in to P. laurocerasus. The most effective method was found to be oryzalin at a rate of 125 μM, and induced polyploids were shorter, had thicker leaves, and larger but fewer stomata. Preliminary research was performed to germinate immature P. lusitanica seed, in vitro, to develop a putative embryo rescue medium for use in this interspecific hybridization. The most significant factor in the media for successful germination was sucrose, with 30 g·L⁻¹ of sucrose media germinating significantly more seed than 60 g·L⁻¹. Also, germination only occurred at 12 weeks after pollination, with no germination at 6 and 9 weeks regardless of cold-stratification. Existing chromosome doubled cytotypes of P. laurocerasus were compared to the standard ploidy cytotype. Differences in vegetative propagation were observed and reported in the Schipkaensis cultivar. Chromosome doubled P. laurocerasus ‘Schipkaensis’ rooted at an equivalent percentage, had equivalently long roots, and had fewer roots per cutting. Deceased number of roots produced no apparent detrimental effects in propagation success. In cytotypes of the Otto Luyken cultivar, numerous morphological and physiological were made. Chromosome double forms were generally shorter, smaller in width and conical volume, and had larger but fewer stomata. The also had increased stomatal conductance and transpiration, with decreased water-use efficiency. Size and biomass observations were used to estimate carbon fixation, and chromosome doubled Otto Luyken cultivars were estimated to fix significantly less carbon...|$|E

These records offer a largely unrecognized wealth of geoscience information in areas for which little may be otherwise known. Stored in the Basic Files archives of petroleum exploration and seismic acquisition companies, this study first convinced companies {{of the potential}} utility of this data, then recovered the hard copy and digitally scanned records (paper, fiche, microfilm) and rendered these into a digital database and GIS. The final database of 343, 989 records provides the largest source of geoscience information {{of its kind in}} northwestern Canada, and in many cases contains unique and original records on a host of subjects including surficial-, bedrock-, and hydro-geology, permafrost, and geohazards. The drillers’ log records have further been used to create geospatial models of drift, till, muskeg, massive ice and ground ice thicknesses, and continue to be applied to new avenues of research such as temporal variations of bottomfast ice extents in offshore shallow marine environments.
