25|$|Following thymus entry, {{progenitors}} proliferate {{to generate}} the ETP population. This step is following by the generation of DN2 thymocytes which migrate from the cortico-medullary junction toward the thymus capsule. DN3 thymocytes are generated at the <b>subcapsular</b> zone.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} the type of cataract, though considerable overlap occurs. People with nuclear sclerotic or brunescent cataracts often notice a reduction of vision.

25|$|Posterior <b>subcapsular</b> {{cataracts}} are cloudy at {{the back}} of the lens adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits. Because light becomes more focused toward the back of the lens, they can cause disproportionate symptoms for their size.|$|E

25|$|Some medications, such as systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids, may {{increase}} the risk of cataract development. Corticosteroids most commonly cause posterior <b>subcapsular</b> cataracts. People with schizophrenia often have risk factors for lens opacities (such as diabetes, hypertension, and poor nutrition) but antipsychotic medications are unlikely to contribute to cataract formation. Miotics and triparanol {{may increase}} the risk.|$|E

50|$|WS {{cataracts}} are {{distinctly different}} from those of normal aging. They are associated with problems in the lens posterior cortex and <b>subcapsular</b> regions. These cataracts are generally treatable with cataract surgery, which should restore normal vision.|$|E

50|$|Lymph {{is present}} {{throughout}} the body, and circulates through lymphatic vessels. These drain into and from lymph nodesafferent vessels drain into nodes, and efferent vessels from nodes. When lymph fluid enters a node, it drains into the node {{just beneath the}} capsule in a space called the <b>subcapsular</b> sinus. The <b>subcapsular</b> sinus drains into trabecular sinuses and finally into medullary sinuses. The sinus space is criss-crossed by the pseudopods of macrophages, which act to trap foreign particles and filter the lymph. The medullary sinuses converge at the hilum and lymph then leaves the lymph node via the efferent lymphatic vessel towards either a more central lymph node or ultimately for drainage into a central venous subclavian blood vessel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>subcapsular</b> sinus (lymph path, lymph sinus, {{marginal}} sinus) is {{the space}} between the capsule and the cortex which allows the free movement of lymphatic fluid and so contains few lymphocytes. It is continuous with the similar lymph sinuses that flank the trabeculae.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of orchiectomy: simple, <b>subcapsular,</b> and inguinal.
