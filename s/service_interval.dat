5|$|The CLR's {{ability to}} manage its high {{passenger}} numbers was constrained by the <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> that it could achieve between trains. This was {{directly related to the}} time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise that took a minimum of 2½minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops {{at each end of the}} line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run anti-clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd's Bush Green. For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.|$|E
25|$|The rails need to {{withstand}} enormous repulsive forces during shooting, and these forces {{will tend to}} push them apart {{and away from the}} projectile. As rail/projectile clearances increase, arcing develops, which causes rapid vaporization and extensive damage to the rail surfaces and the insulator surfaces. This limited some early research railguns to one shot per <b>service</b> <b>interval.</b>|$|E

Crystal cabins, also called “Eyes of Maokong Gondola”, have their own waiting queue and a computer managed ticketing system, instructing passengers to enter the queue at a specified time.

High speed rail service thus requires high-speed EMU trains to run on high-speed rail track at speeds of not less than 200km/h.

2500|$|On 21 December 2016 KiwiRail {{announced}} their plan {{to withdraw from}} service, over the 2-year period, the EF class electric locomotives (the only electric rolling stock working the central electrified section) without replacing them. The reasons given for the decision included {{the fact that the}} EFs are now close to their end of life (approx 30 years old) and suffer from frequent breakdowns (on average every [...] which is well below the expected breakdown-free <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> of [...] ) and that having to replace a diesel locomotive with an electric one and then again with another diesel one {{at both ends of the}} electrified section is labour- and time-consuming and adds to costs.

2500|$|The 196 OHV {{requires}} more periodic maintenance than newer-model engines. The head bolts must be re-torqued (retightening process) regularly. Factory service manuals recommend that head bolt torque be checked every [...] and to re-torque them every [...] With modern head gaskets this <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> {{can be extended}} to re-torque the bolts every , or every other year. The cause of the headbolts loosening over time {{is believed to be}} thermal expansion and contraction of the head due to the rather heavy design. The head expands and contracts by as much as 0.020" [...] in height during normal operation, this loosens the bolts over time and eventually will cause the seal between head and block to fail. This maintenance is also imperative to prevent the engine from overheating (the first sign of a blown head gasket) and warping or cracking the head. The cast-iron liners in the aluminum block version can also shift if the head bolts are not properly torqued and the engine is allowed to overheat. Good replacement heads and aluminum blocks for these engines are now difficult to find.|$|E

2500|$|The late 1960s saw a brief {{revival in}} the {{fortunes}} of the D800s. For a few months in late 1967 they moved on to the Paddington–Birmingham New Street route and then in early 1968 Paddington–Hereford. Rising traffic levels on the Paddington–Plymouth route meant the WR aspired to an hourly <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> for this route with standard 10 and 12 carriage trains. The maximum schedule was to be 4hours 15minutes for the , but the [...] "Cornish Riviera Express" [...] would be retimed for 3hours 45minutes with stops at Taunton and Exeter only. The Class 52 Westerns could only cope with these timings on seven carriage trains. The answer was to assemble pairs of D800s and reinstate the multiple working equipment on them, to allow the pair to be controlled by one driver. This was done with D819/22–24/27–29/31/32 and D866–69 and the acceleration in schedules did bring a further 7% increase in traffic levels. It was not, however, without its problems: a fault on one locomotive in a multiple-unit pair effectively disabled both and one alone could not keep to the schedules. By 1969 only two services were booked for a pair of D800s, albeit losing a further 15minutes off the schedule, and the timetable was largely recast into separate Torbay and Plymouth trains, instead of being split en route. This allowed the formations to revert to eight or nine carriages that a single Western could handle alone.|$|E
