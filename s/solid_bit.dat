Note that this adjustment makes sure that for a given QP, the PSNR of the PVC is comparable with the H. 264, although the corresponding bit rate of the PVC is much lower compared to that of the H. 264, so that the PVC exhibits better overall rate-distortion performance compared to the H. 264.

The artisans who made the dzi created amulets with “eyes” on them as a “fight fire with fire” form of protection. Artisans used agate as the base stone, and then embellished the beads lines and shapes using ancient methods that remain mysterious. Treatments may have included darkening with plant sugars and heat, bleaching and white line etching with natron, and protecting certain areas with grease, clay, wax or a similar substance. A hole was drilled before the bead was decorated as drilling caused most breakage during the production process, and holes were also useful for stringing and dipping numerous beads as a step in coloration.

We consider a double quantum dot charge qubit, whose basis states are defined by the position of an additional electron in the system of two laterally coupled quantum dots. The coupling of these two states can be controlled externally by a quantum point contact between the two dots. We discuss the decoherence through coupling to the electronic leads due to cotunneling processes. We focus on a simple Gedanken experiment, where the system is initially brought into a superposition and then the inter-dot coupling is removed nonadiabatically.

We investigate a system of two solid state qubits that are coupled via σ_z^(i) ⊗σ_z^(j) type of coupling. This kind of setup is typical for pseudospin solid-state quantum bits such as charge or flux systems. We evaluate decoherence properties and gate quality factors {{in the presence of}} a common and two uncorrelated baths coupling to σ_z, respectively. We show that at low temperatures, uncorrelated baths do degrade the gate quality more severely. In particular, we show that in the case of a common bath, optimum gate performance of a CPHASE gate can be reached at very low temperatures, because our type of coupling commutes with the coupling to the decoherence, which makes this type of coupling attractive as compared to previously studied proposals with σ_y^(i) ⊗σ_y^(j) -coupling.

40|$|Abstract. – We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} nonstationary 1 /f µ noise, produced by interacting defects, on a quantum two-level system. Adopting a simple phenomenological model for this noise we describe exactly the corresponding dephasing in various regimes. The nonstationarity and pronounced non-Gaussian features of this noise induce new anomalous dephasing scenarii. Beyond a history-dependent critical coupling strength the dephasing time exhibits a strong dependence on {{the age of the}} noise and the decay of coherence is not exponential. The question of the phase coherence of a quantum two level system (TLS) in a noisy environment has motivated numerous recent works. In particular it is of crucial interest in the context of quantum computing with <b>solid</b> state quantum <b>bits</b> [1]. In this case it is now believed that dephasing of the TLS by a low-frequency (1 /f) noise is a limiting mechanism which certainly deserves further studies. The microscopic origin of these low-frequency fluctuations depends on the considered system and is mostly not understood [2]. Hence, in previous works on this problem the 1 /f environment was modeled phenomenologically either by a set of harmonic modes (e. g. spin-Boson model) [3] or by an ensemble of independent bistable fluctuators (Dutta-Horn model) [4, 5].

Two different processing routes have been used according to previous results reported for other materials: reaction and sintering in one single step and a previous calcination step. The sintering behaviour of the samples, the obtained crystalline phases and the microstructure analysis indicate that the reaction between ZnO and Bi 2 O 3 plays a critical role during sintering. Both Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Zn 2 TiO 4 secondary phases are stabilised when adding ZnO. Actually, when WO 3 and ZnO are incorporated simultaneously to BIT materials, they interact stabilizing the Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 phase and avoiding the incorporation of W 6 + into the BIT lattice. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity of the samples with ZnO is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the samples doped only with WO 3, suggesting that WO 3 does not form a <b>solid</b> solution with <b>BIT.</b> The curve dielectric constant vs temperature also reveals the role played by the Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 phase.

Beside the trivial single interstitial and substitutional oxygen defects we also consider their complexes with vacancies and hydrogen atoms. We find that oxygen defects are mostly electrically active and introduce highly correlated orbitals that pose a challenge for density functional theory modeling. Nevertheless, we are able to identify the fingerprints of substitutional oxygen defect, the oxygen-vacancy and oxygen-vacancy-hydrogen complexes in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum. We demonstrate that first principles calculations can predict the motional averaging of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of defects that are subject to Jahn-Teller distortion.
