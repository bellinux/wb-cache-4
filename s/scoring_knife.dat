50|$|A <b>scoring</b> <b>knife</b> or {{scoring tool}} is a {{handheld}} tool used {{to cut a}} groove in a sheet of material. The cutting edge of the knife is often made of hard material such tungsten carbide.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scoring</b> <b>knife</b> {{is drawn}} across the {{material}} {{in a straight line}} (with the help of a straightedge), creating a scratch or score in the sheet. The material can then be broken or severed along the groove, resulting in a straight and smooth cut.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scoring</b> <b>knives</b> {{can be used}} to cut various materials, {{including}} glass, tile, plexiglas, {{and other}} hard materials. For softer materials like plexiglas, a razor blade {{can be used as a}} scoring tool.|$|R

25|$|When cooking shellfish, squid, or hard-skinned watery vegetables, such as {{bell pepper}} or eggplant, {{the skin is}} usually <b>scored</b> with a <b>knife</b> to prevent the {{ingredients}} from bursting during cooking, which can cause serious burns from splashing oil.|$|R
50|$|Elsenham Quality Foods {{also make}} a {{similarly}} packaged product, Poacher's Relish, made from smoked salmon, butter, spices and lemon zest. The relish is sold in plastic containers (pictured), opened by removing the label sticker on the side or <b>scoring</b> with a <b>knife,</b> and in more expensive but reusable traditional ceramic pots. Since 2008 another variation, Angler's Relish, made from smoked mackerel, salted butter, lemon juice, vinegar, spices and other ingredients was introduced in commemorative packaging to mark the 180th anniversary of John Osborn's creation. Both are also usually eaten on toast or savoury biscuits.|$|R
50|$|Before ripening, the {{mangosteen}} {{shell is}} fibrous and firm, but becomes soft {{and easy to}} pry open when the fruit ripens. To open a mangosteen, the shell can be <b>scored</b> with a <b>knife,</b> pried gently along the score with the thumbs until it cracks, and then pulled apart to reveal the fruit. Alternatively, the mangosteen can be opened without a knife by squeezing the shell from the bottom until it breaks, allowing the shell to be removed and the fruit eaten while intact with the stem. Occasionally, during peeling of ripe fruits, the purple exocarp juice may stain skin or fabric.|$|R
50|$|The {{competition}} itself consists, in {{the most}} common form, {{of a series of}} straight throws aimed at a set of standard wooden targets or in some cases foam. Similar to an archery target, competition knife throwing targets have a bulls-eye surrounded by one or more rings. A sticking <b>knife</b> <b>scores</b> points. The thrower must be standing at least a set distance away from the target, with higher distances for more challenging events. KHOIKHOI keeps a ranking of its members based on their performance during these sponsored competitions. The scores achieved at Euro-throwers events can be examined at the meetings' reports.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of glass}} knives in cutting {{sections}} for electron microscopy {{has been a}} standard procedure for several years. During this period various modifications in methods of <b>scoring</b> and breaking <b>knives</b> have been recommended, as well as types of glass {{which can be used}} (1, 2). Knives of high silica content glass were first suggested by Eaves and Flewett (1953) who reported that such knives retained a sharp edge longer and gave generally better sections than soft glass (3). At least two kinds of high silica glass are commercially available in this country, pyrex brand and vycor brand plate? Both types of glass were used to section muscle, lens capsule and epithelium, lens fibers, Limulu...|$|R
50|$|Kibbeh b'Ssinniyeh or kibbeh bil sinieh (meaning kibbeh in a pan) (كبّة بالصينيّة) is {{commonly}} {{made of a}} mixture of finely ground lamb or beef, bulghur, onion, mint and Middle Eastern spices pressed into a flat baking pan. Normally, this dish consists of two layers (top and bottom) of the meat/cracked wheat mixture baked with a ground meat/onion/pine nut mix (hushwi) in between. Then it is <b>scored</b> with a <b>knife</b> into diamond shapes about one or two inches in length, topped with lightly sauteed pine nuts (snobar) or almond slivers and butter or olive oil, then baked in the oven until done. Extra butter/olive oil is then drained off and ready to serve.|$|R
40|$|The Minimum Score Separation Problem (MSSP) is a {{combinatorial}} {{problem that}} has been introduced in JORS 55 as an open problem in the paper industry arising {{in conjunction with the}} cutting-stock problem. During the process of producing boxes, áat papers are prepared for folding by being <b>scored</b> with <b>knives.</b> The problem is to determine if and how a given production pattern of boxes can be arranged such that a certain minimum distance between the knives can be kept. While it was originally suggested to analyse the MSSP as a specific variant of a Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem, the thesis introduces the concept of twin-constrained Hamiltonian cycles and models the MSSP as the problem of finding a twin-constrained Hamiltonian path on a threshold graph (threshold graphs are a specific type of interval graphs). For a given undirected graph G(N,E) with an even node set N and edge set E, and a bijective function b on N that assigns to every node i in N a "twin node" b(i) 6 =i, we define a new graph G'(N,E') by adding the edges i,b(i) to E. The graph G is said to have a twin-constrained Hamiltonian path with respect to b if there exists a Hamiltonian path on G' in which every node has its twin node as its predecessor (or successor). We start with presenting some general Öndings for the construction of matchings, alternating paths, Hamiltonian paths and alternating cycles on threshold graphs. On this basis it is possible to develop criteria that allow for the construction of twin-constrained Hamiltonian paths on threshold graphs and lead to a heuristic that can quickly solve a large percentage of instances of the MSSP. The insights gained in this way can be generalized and lead to an (exact) polynomial time algorithm for the MSSP. Computational experiments for both the heuristic and the polynomial-time algorithm demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to the MSSP. Finally, possible extensions of the approach are presented...|$|R
60|$|For Arick {{is really}} {{what you call a}} savage, though a savage is a very {{different}} sort of a person, and very much nicer than he is made to appear in little books. He is {{the kind of person that}} everybody smiles to, or makes faces at, or gives a smack as he goes by; the sort of person that all the girls on the plantation give the best seat to and help first, and love to decorate with flowers and ribbons, and yet all the while are laughing at him; the sort of person who likes best to play with Austin, and whom Austin, perhaps (when he is allowed), likes best to play with. He is all grins and giggles and little steps out of dances, and little droll ways to attract people's attention and set them laughing. And yet, when you come to look at him closely, you will find that his body is all covered with scars! This happened when he was a child. There was war, as is the way in these wild islands, between his village and the next, much as if there were war in London between one street and another; and all the children ran about playing in the middle of the trouble, and, I dare say, took no more notice of the war than you children in London do of a general election. But sometimes, at general elections, English children may get run over by processions in the street; and it chanced that as little Arick was running about in the Bush, and very busy about his playing, he ran into the midst of the warriors on the other side. These speared him with a poisoned spear; and his own people, when they had found him, in order to cure him of the poison <b>scored</b> him with <b>knives</b> that were probably made of fish-bone.|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the Study: Artifacts of Chinese origin {{have always}} fascinated the {{historical}} archaeologist, both {{due to their}} ease of identification and representation of an otherness. Analyses of these artifacts, however, often offer {{little more than a}} short description of Chinese American history and a typology of the artifacts. The people who used these items seem to be missing, and if they are discussed at all, they are often treated as members of a homogeneous culture. Likewise, 19 th century historical documents also ignore these immigrants because they were not considered important enough to be recorded. Based on archaeological data collected from a late 19 th century Chinese laundry in Oakland, this thesis seeks to portray {{a way of life that}} has not been well documented, and demonstrate that a combination of archaeology and history can offer a much more interesting and comprehensive picture of the past than either source alone. Procedure: Historical, sociological, and archaeological sources are integrated to prepare a historic context statement for this study. Research of historical documents, e. g., newspaper articles, Sanborn fire insurance maps, U. S. census records, and other primary sources, was conducted at the Bancroft Library, Oakland Public Library and History Room, Chinese Historical Society of America, and other establishments in order to portray the social context. A review of existing archaeological and historical studies is included to describe the topics scholars have been interested in traditionally and offer their results. Results from the archaeological excavation project at 1813 Seventh Street are also presented, and artifacts from this collection are compared with that from similar archaeological sites in California. In addition, a story about a Chinese laundry worker who may have worked and lived at the address above will be constructed based on all the resources available. Findings: Based on historical research and artifact analysis, we believe the laundry employed three to five workers. There was at least one literate resident who was capable of using the very traditional Chinese ink stone and abacus. In addition to beer, they also consumed a large amount of Dr. Hostetter s bitters. Their meat preferences of porterhouse, sirloin, rib, and soup bones were consistent with group living on a small budget; the <b>knife</b> <b>scores</b> indicate removal of meat from steak bones, a standard practice of cutting the meat into smaller pieces for soup or stir-fry in Chinese cooking. The workers may have been too poor to indulge much in opium, or they may have done so at another location. Their customers came from the predominantly-white working class neighborhood, as evidenced by the buttons and textile fragments recovered archaeologically. Conclusions: Archaeology does not simply involve the study of the material remains. It is imperative to interpret the artifacts and find out the story about the people who left them behind. In the case of the Chinese laundry at 1813 Seventh Street, although archival information related directly to it is scant, combining existing documents with the archaeological resources has helped to offer a glimpse into the daily lives of these faceless workers...|$|R
