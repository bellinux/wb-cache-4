Twenty military participants completed a reconnaissance mission in a virtual environment during which multiple events occurred. Participants decided whether or not to collect information about these events. After the mission participants categorized events as having an Information Type (Population, Geography, Hostile) and a Relevance (for Current Operations, Future Operations, or Command and Control). Results suggest that across individuals neither Information Type nor Relevance predicts the probability of recording information although Geographic events were slightly more influential.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a stable measure space, which is a triple (X,,μ) consisting of a stable space of functions X on a probability space (Ω,,P), a <b>stable</b> <b>collection</b> of conditional subsets of X forming a Boolean σ-algebra with respect to the conditional set operations, and a stable σ-additive set function μ→L̅^ 0 _+, where L̅^ 0 _+ denotes the set of all measurable functions xΩ→R_+. We develop basic results of a measure theory for stable measure spaces. A suitable version of Carathéodory's extension theorem, Fubini's theorem, the Radon-Nikodým theorem and Daniell-Stone and Riesz type representation results are established. As applications, given a measurable space (E,E), we show that every kernel κΩ×E→R_+ can be extended to a stable measure. Moreover, for a sub-σ-algebra ⊆, the -conditional distribution of a random variable ξΩ→ E can be uniquely represented by a -stable probability measure. If (E,E) is a standard Borel space, every stable probability measure also uniquely corrresponds to a probability kernel. Thus stable probability measures are a generalization of probability kernels. Further, the conditional distribution of a real-valued function of ξ by means of the stable Lebesgue integral is computed. Comment: 22 pages, major revision, new applications include...|$|E

The importance of this dynamical system stems from Uspenskij's characterization of the universal ambit of G = Homeo(X). The results apply to X = C the Cantor set, the generalized Cantor sets X = 0, 1 ^kappa for non-countable cardinals kappa, and to several other spaces.

Tests with interfering oxidants, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate and NO 2, indicated no significant effects for common ambient conditions. No humidity effect was found when the relative humidity varied from 20 to 80 %. The uptake rate of the sampler is dependent on wind velocity. In general an average air velocity of approximately 0. 5 m/s is necessary to ensure a <b>stable</b> <b>collection</b> rate of ozone. This implies the necessity to measure wind speed during exposure or to place the samplers in the wind stream of a small fan.

40|$|Targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) is a reverse-genetic {{method for}} {{identifying}} point mutations in chemically mutagenized populations. For functional genomics, it is ideal {{to have a}} <b>stable</b> <b>collection</b> of heavily mutagenized lines that can be screened {{over an extended period}} of time. However, long-term storage is impractical for Drosophila, so mutant strains must be maintained by continual propagation of live cultures. Here we evaluate a strategy in which ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenized chromosomes were maintained as heterozygotes with balancer chromosomes for > 100 generations before screening. The strategy yielded a spectrum of point mutations similar to those found in previous studies of EMS-induced mutations, as well as 2. 4 % indels (insertions and deletions). Our analysis of 1887 point mutations in 148 targets showed evidence for selection against deleterious lesions and differential retention of lesions among targets on the basis of their position relative to balancer breakpoints, leading to a broad distribution of mutational densities. Despite selection and differential retention, the success of a user-funded service based on screening a large collection several years after mutagenesis indicates sufficient stability for use as a long-term reverse-genetic resource. Our study has implications for the use of balancer chromosomes to maintain mutant lines and provides the first large-scale quantitative assessment of the limitations of using breeding populations for repositories of genetic variability...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} review {{on the current}} state of {{publicly}} available datasets within the hu-man action recognition community; highlighting the revival of pose based methods and recent progress of understanding person-person interaction modeling. We categorize datasets regarding several key properties for usage as a benchmark dataset; including the number of class labels, ground truths provided, and application domain they oc-cupy. We also consider the level of abstraction of each dataset; grouping those that present actions, interactions and higher level semantic activities. The survey identifies key appearance and pose based datasets, noting a tendency for simplistic, emphasized, or scripted action classes that are often readily definable by a <b>stable</b> <b>collection</b> of sub-action gestures. There is a clear lack of datasets that provide closely related actions, those that are not implicitly identified via a series of poses and gestures, but rather a dynamic set of interactions. We therefore propose a novel dataset that represents complex conversational interactions between two individuals via 3 D pose. 8 pairwise interactions describing 7 separate conversation based scenarios were collected using two Kinect depth sensors. The intention is to provide events that are constructed from numerous primitive actions, interactions and motions, over a period of time; providing a set of subtle action classes that are more representative of the real world, and a chal-lenge to currently developed recognition methodologies. We believe this is among one of the first datasets devoted to conversational interaction classification using 3 D pose features and the attributed papers show this task is indeed possible.

40|$|Objective: Changes {{in defense}} {{mechanisms}} after treatment {{of patients with}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were measured by using an established rating scale. Method: Before and after 7 -week group behavior therapy, 17 patients with DSM-III-R OCD were assessed with the Defense Style Questionnaire, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Results: After behavior therapy the patients evidenced significant decreases in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and significant increases {{in the use of}} more adaptive defense mechanisms. There were no significant changes in three maladaptive defense mechanism categories. The improvement in adaptive defenses was independently linked to improvement both in OCD and in depression. Conclusions: Personality as defined by defense mechanisms may be more amenable to brief behavioral treatment than previously thought. The permanence of these changes must be further assessed. (Am J Psychiatry 1998; 155 : 558 – 559) P ersonality is often perceived as a <b>stable</b> <b>collection</b> of ego strengths and defenses, amenable to permanent change only after fairly extensive psychotherapeutic intervention.

However, therapists have noticed dramatic and sustained improvement in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) after relatively brief courses of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy (2 – 4). We postulated that these improvements in the symptoms of OCD would correlate with improvements in personality as measured by defense mechanisms. Specifically, the use of more adaptive defenses would increase, while maladaptive defenses would be used less frequently as symptomatic improvements progressed.

40|$|The present text is a {{theoretical}} framework that has been developed with the aim to generate knowledge of and policy recommendations {{for the promotion of}} integrated mobility services (IMS), with specific regard to institutional dimensions. Integrated mobility services are services where the passenger’s transport needs are met by a service that not only integrates a range of mobility services, both public and private, but also provides one-stop access to all services through a common interface. These types of services are currently being developed in several cities globally, and the purpose of the project is to understand and explain how institutions can enable, but also impede, their realization. Institutions are defined as a relatively <b>stable</b> <b>collection</b> of rules and practices, embedded in structures that enable action. In the project a broad theoretical approach, developed by an interdisciplinary research team, will be applied. As such, the framework includes factors at the macro, meso and micro levels, thus including extensive societal trends as well as individual's needs and behaviour. The macro level includes broader social and political factors, including both formal rules and more informal social norms and perceptions. The division between formal and informal variables recur on the meso and micro levels respectively. The meso level – which includes both public and private actors at regional and local levels – consists of both formal institutional factors such as taxation and regulations, and informal factors such as organizational culture and inherited networks between regional actors. Each actor enters the collaborative processes that signify IMS with their own ideals, interests and expectations, and it is in these processes of negotiation that the framework takes it point of departure. It is also in this context that business models will be developed, another central aspect of the realisation of IMS. Finally, the framework also includes the micro level, where an individual perspective is placed at centre stage. Individuals are affected by various formal incentives and push factors, as well as more informal aspects such as self-image and social status. Through the application of the framework in a number of case studies, empirical findings will help illuminate which institutional factors enable or constrain the development of IMS. The findings will provide the empirical and analytical foundation for suggestions on how formal and informal rules and practices can be modified to enable new IMS to contribute to sustainable mobility...|$|E
40|$|Graphs {{are often}} used in {{artificial}} intelligence as means for symbolic knowledge representation. A graph {{is nothing more than}} a collection of symbols connected to each other in some fashion. For example, in computer vision a graph with five nodes and some edges can represent a table - where nodes correspond to particular shape descriptors for legs and a top, and edges to particular spatial relations. As a framework for representation, graphs invite us to simplify and view the world as objects of pure structure whose properties are fixed in time, while the phenomena they are supposed to model are actually often changing. A node alone cannot represent a table leg, for example, because a table leg is not one structure (it can have many different shapes, colors, or it can be seen in many different settings, lighting conditions, etc.) Theories of knowledge representation have in general concentrated on the stability of symbols - on the fact that people often use properties that remain unchanged across different contexts to represent an object (in vision, these properties are called invariants). However, on closer inspection, objects are variable as well as stable. How are we to understand such problems? How is that assembling a large collection of changing components into a system results in something that is an altogether <b>stable</b> <b>collection</b> of parts?(cont.) The work here presents one approach that we came to encompass by the phrase "graph dynamics". Roughly speaking, dynamical systems are systems with states that evolve over time according to some lawful "motion". In graph dynamics, states are graphical structures, corresponding to different hypothesis for representation, and motion is the correction or repair of an antecedent structure. The adapted structure is an end product on a path of test and repair. In this way, a graph is not an exact record of the environment but a malleable construct that is gradually tightened to fit the form it is to reproduce. In particular, we explore the concept of attractors for the graph dynamical system. In dynamical systems theory, attractor states are states into which the system settles with the passage of time, and in graph dynamics they correspond to graphical states with many repairs (states that can cope with many different contingencies). In parallel with introducing the basic mathematical framework for graph dynamics, we define a game for its control, its attractor states and a method to find the attractors. From these insights, we work out two new algorithms, one for Bayesian network discovery and one for active learning, which in combination we use to undertake the object recognition problem in computer vision. To conclude, we report competitive results in standard and custom-made object recognition datasets. by Andre Figueiredo Ribeiro. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Summary Optimization-based {{decision}} support systems for planning problems in processing industries Nowadays, efficient planning of material flows {{within and between}} supply chains is of vital importance and {{has become one of}} the most challenging problems for {{decision support}} in practice. The tremendous progress in hard- and software of the past decades was an important gateway for developing computerized systems that are able to support decision making on different levels within enterprises. The history of such systems started in 1971 when the concept of Decision Support Systems (DSS) emerged. Over the years, the field of DSS has evolved into a broad variety of directions. The described research in this thesis limits to the category of model-driven or optimization-based DSS. Simultaneously with the emergence of DSS, software vendors recognized the high potentials of available data and developed Enterprise Systems to standardize planning problems. Meanwhile, information oriented systems like MRP and its successors are extended by the basic concepts of optimization based decision support. These systems are called Advanced Planning Systems (APS). The main focus of APS is to support decision making at different stages or phases in the material flow, i. e. from procurement, production, distribution to sales (horizontal-axis), on different hierarchical aggregation levels (vertical-axis) ranging from strategic (long-term) to operational (short- term) planning. This framework of building blocks decomposes planning tasks hierarchically into partial planning problems. This basic architecture of the planning processes in APS is known as the Supply Chain Planning Matrix (SCPM). Compared to, for instance, discrete parts  manufacturing, planning tasks  are much more complicated in processing industries due to a natural variation in the composition of raw materials, the impact of processing operations on properties of material flows, sequence dependent change-over times, the inevitable decline in quality of product flows and relatively low margins. These specific characteristics gave rise to focus on optimization-based decision support in the domain of processing industries. The problems to be addressed in this field call for (inter-related) decisions with respect to the required raw materials, the production quantities to be manufactured, the efficient use of available resources, and the times at which raw materials must be available. Although different APS modules can interact directly, coordination  and integration is often restricted to the exchange of data flows between different modules. Given the need for specific integrated decision support, the research presented in this thesis focusses particularly on medium to short term decision support at production stage in processing industry, including the vertical and horizontal integration and coordination with adjacent building blocks in the SCPM. Extensive reviews from literature show that the gap between research and practice of DSS is widening. As the field of DSS was initiated as an application oriented discipline, the strategy of what is referred to as “application-driven theory” was taken as the preferred approach for this thesis. “Application-driven” refers to a bottom-up approach which means that the relevance of the research should both be initiated and obtained from practice. The intended successful use of the proposed approaches should, where possible, be represented by tests of adequacy. Simultaneously, the contribution  to  “theory”  aims  to  be  a  recognizable  part  of  the  research  effort,  i. e. obtained understanding and insights from problems in practice should provide the basis for new approaches. Based on the preceding considerations we defined the following general research objective:   General research objective To support medium- to short term planning problems by optimization-based models and solution techniques such that:   i)           The applicability and added value of (prototype) systems is recognized and carried by decision makers in practice ii)          The proposed approaches contribute to knowledge, understanding and insights from a model building and – solving point of view. In order to link the general objective with the different studies in the thesis, we defined five, recurring research premises, i. e. Professional relevance and applicability  (P 1), Aggregation (P 2), Decomposition and reformulation (P 3), Vertical integration at production level (P 4), and  Horizontal coordination and integration (P 5). The overarching premise P 1 refers to the first part of the research objective. All other premises refer to the second part of the research objective, i. e. model building and/or – solving. Several planning issues are studied to give substance to the research objective and each study is connected to at least two research premises. Study 1 : Planning and scheduling in food processing industry The main question in Chapter 2 was:” How to apply aggregation, decomposition and reformulation in model-based DSS at planning and scheduling level such that the aspect of decision support is recognized and appreciated by decision makers in practice, and which level of aggregation is needed to integrate production planning (i. e. lot-sizing) and scheduling problems in a single model? The study consists of two parts. The first part of the study refers to a case study for the bottleneck packaging facilities of a large dairy company. The goal was  to develop, implement and test a pilot DSS which was able to deliver solutions recognized and carried by decision makers at lower decision levels. The latter aim implied that a straight-forward aggregation on time, product type, resources or product stage, was not preferred. The key to develop an approach for regular use was to identify and take advantage of specific problem characteristics. Clustering of numerous jobs, while retaining information at order level, could be exploited in a reformulation approach. The inclusion of (combined) generalized- and variable upper bound constraints gave very tight lower bounds and sparse search trees. An extensive test phase in daily practice showed that the main benefit of the DSS was the initial quality of the generated plans including the time needed to generate these schedules. Hence, decision makers could i) postpone their planning tasks, ii) conveniently cope with rush orders or planned maintenance and iii) easily generate alternatives or revised plans when unforeseen disturbances occur. Moreover, the graphical presentation and overview of the (future) working schedule enabled order acceptance to make use of remaining capacity. The study also showed that planning problems in practice cannot be captured exhaustively by a (simplified) model. Decision makers need the opportunity to modify automatically generated plans manually and use human judgement and experience such that the solution is tuned to the actual situation. Hence, the DSS should not be considered as an optimizer but rather as a tool for generating high quality plans to be used for further analysis. Within this context the various options of a user-friendly, graphical, and fully interactive user interface, were of major importance. Although the case study clearly demonstrates the validity of earlier case based DSS research for current days APS, the proposed approach is hardly a generic solution for a complete vertical integration between lot-sizing and scheduling. If lot-size decisions are strongly affected by the sequence of jobs, production planning and scheduling should be performed simultaneously. As the described case refers to an earlier study and today’s APS do not provide modules for integrated lot-sizing and scheduling, the second part of the study gives an overview of developments in literature regarding lot-sizing and scheduling models and assess their suitability for addressing sequence-dependent setups, non-triangular setups and product decay. The review shows a tendency in which so-called Big Bucket (BB) models are currently proposed for short term time horizons too. However, we argue that segmentation of the planning horizon is a key issue for simultaneous lot-sizing and scheduling. The advantage of BB models may become a major obstacle for i) the effectiveness of simultaneous lot-sizing and scheduling, and ii) addressing specific characteristics in food processing industry. Study   2 :   Vertical  integration  of  lot-sizing  and  scheduling  in  food  processing industry Chapter 3 focused on a complete integration of lot-sizing and scheduling decisions in a single model. The main question was:” How to integrate production planning (i. e. lot- sizing) and scheduling problems in a single model, such that common assumptions regarding the triangular setup conditions are relaxed and issues of product decay and limited shelf lives are taken into account?” The literature research in Chapter 2 revealed that the computational advantage of time oriented aggregation in BB models may become a major obstacle in addressing the identified characteristics in FPI. In addition, product decay is primarily associated with the “age” of products and consequently relates to the segmentation of the time- horizon. Therefore, two SB models are developed to demonstrate the impact of non- triangular setups and product decay on the generated solutions. Small scale examples were used to demonstrate how a small change in the balance between inventory - and changeover costs may generate significantly different solutions, especially when the triangular setup conditions do not hold. The developed models are potentially very large formulations and, as expected, hard to solve. Exploratory research was conducted with a Relax-and-Fix (R&F) heuristic. The heuristic is based on a decomposition of the time horizon. Numerical results of small to medium sized problem instances are promising. However, solving real-size problem instances is not possible yet. Study 3 : Integrated planning between procurement and production The case study in Chapter 4 focussed on the need for horizontal coordination and integration between the phases procurement and production, which is of particular importance in inter-organizational supply chains. The main question was:” How to model and solve an integrated planning problem between procurement and production, both on a mid-term and short-term planning level, in an inter-organizational supply chain? The research question was projected on an illustrative milk collection problem in practice. The aim was to develop a pilot DSS that lifted decision support for a “weaker” partner in a food supply chain to a higher level, and to illustrate the importance of horizontal integration between the phases procurement and production in an APS framework. Problem analysis revealed that the problem can be classified as an extension of the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP). The problem was decomposed into more tractable sub problems on different hierarchical levels, i. e. the daily (vehicle) routing problem was separated from a medium-term planning problem. On the higher planning level, numerous suppliers were aggregated such that total supply within a cluster met (multiple) vehicle loading capacities. The continuous supply of relatively small amounts from many suppliers had to be balanced with strict delivery conditions at processing level. A model was developed to assign a single (<b>stable)</b> <b>collection</b> rhythm to each cluster such that the total, weighted deviation of desired processing levels on various days in the planning horizon was minimized. The applied aggregation on the higher planning level turned out to be very beneficial for the required disaggregation at the lower planning level. Once supplier farms were geographically grouped into clusters and the aggregated supply within a cluster was assigned to a single collection rhythm with fixed collection days, the (initial) daily routing problem was considerably easier to solve for vehicle schedulers. The computational complexity of the problem was reduced by exploiting application-based properties algorithmically in a specific branch-and-bound scheme, i. e. a customized approach of Special Ordered Sets type 1 (SOS 1) This approach made it possible to solve the generated problems exactly for real-size problem instances. The various facilities of a user-friendly and interactive man-machine interface (i. e. an input, planning, simulation and analysing module) turned out to be essential. Decision makers could easily change the data, and the generated plans, in a separate simulation module. However, the impact of any modification was immediately visualised by several (conflicting) indicators in the output screens, both on supply and demand level. Study 4 : Mixed Integer (0 - 1) Fractional Programming in Paper Production Industry The study in Chapter 5 focussed on the impact of technical settings of production units on material flows. The main question was:” How to support decision-makers in practice if crucial properties of end products simultaneously depend on (endogenous) types of raw materials with different chemical or physical properties  and (endogenous) technical settings of processing units? The goal of the study was to revise and upgrade an existing, locally used DSS, to a tailored and flexible tool for decision support within the enterprise. The study revealed that the aimed extension towards multi-objective decision support, together with new physical insight for calculating properties of end products due to process operations, had a substantial impact on the optimization module. The proposed solution procedure takes advantage of the problem characteristics and gives rise i) to apply and extend a classical reformulation approach for continuous linear fractional programming (FP) problems to a more general class of mixed integer (binary) FP problems and ii) to exploit the special structure between the original non- linear mixed integer model and the continuous, linear reformulation by applying the concept of Special Ordered Sets type 1 (SOS 1). Although Chapter 5 focusses  in particular on the reformulation and solution approach, the DSS consists of four main building blocks, i. e. the user interface, a scenario manager, a simulation- and optimization routine. The optimization module provides a powerful tool to find feasible solutions and the best (unexpected) recipes for any available set of raw materials. Moreover, it provides an innovative way of decision support for purchasing (new) pulps on the market, for assigning available pulps to different paper grades, and for attuning available stock levels of raw materials to (changing) production targets for different paper grades. The results of the optimization routine are mainly used to obtain alternative recipes for different paper grades. Usually, these recipes are stored as base scenarios and adapted to daily practice in the simulation module. Main conclusions and future research Based on the studies in the Chapters 2 and 3 we conclude that no generically applicable models and/or solution approaches exist for simultaneous planning and scheduling in processing industries. More industry-specific solutions are needed incorporating specificities of different production environments into those models. The key to develop solvable approaches for contemporary practice may be i) to use knowledge and experience from practice and take advantage of specific  characteristics  in different problem domains during model construction, and/or ii) to identify and exploit special problem structures for solving the related models. We conclude that surprisingly little research has  been devoted to issues  of coordination and integration between “procurement” and “production”. The studies in the chapters 4 and 5 confirm that sourcing of (raw) materials flows needs more attention in processing industries, particularly in push-oriented, inter-organizational networks. The valorisation of raw materials can be improved even more if the composition of raw materials is considered too in future planning problems at production level. In the second part of this thesis we focused on extensions for the applicability of Special Ordered Sets type 1 (SOS 1), both from an algorithmic (Chapter 4) and modelling (Chapter 5) point of view. We conclude that the concept of SOS 1 can extend a classical reformulation approach for continuous fractional programming (FP) problems, to a specific class of mixed integer (0 - 1) FP problems. Moreover, we conclude that a natural ordering of the variables within the sets is not necessary to make their use worthwhile. A separate (user defined) reference row or weights associated to the variables in the sets might be omitted for an efficient use of SOS 1 in commercially available mathematical programming packages. However, this requires further research and extensive computational tests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Traditionally {{the use of}} pseudo {{relevance}} feedback (PRF) techniques for query expansion has been demonstrated very effective. Particularly the use of Relevance Models (RM) {{in the context of}} the Language Modelling framework has been established as a high-performance approach to beat. In this paper we present an alternative estimation for the RM promoting terms that being present in the relevance set are also distant from the language model of the collection. We compared this approach with RM 3 and with an adaptation to the Language Modelling framework of the Rocchio’s KLD-based term ranking function. The evaluation showed that this alternative estimation of RM reports consistently better results than RM 3, showing in average to be the most <b>stable</b> across <b>collections</b> in terms of robustness. ...|$|R

The annual growth of the sector and the continuous imbalance between milk supply and demand, has urged the sector {{to look for a}} different approach to their daily milk collection problem.
