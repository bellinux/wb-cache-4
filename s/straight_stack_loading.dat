40|$|The Intel ® Itanium ™ {{architecture}} {{provides a}} virtual register stack of unlimited size {{for use by}} software. New virtual registers are allocated on a procedure call and deallocated on return. Itanium processors implement the register stack {{by means of a}} large physical register file, a mapping from virtual to physical registers, and a Register Stack Engine (RSE) that saves and restores the contents of the physical registers to memory without explicit program intervention. The combination of these features significantly reduces the number of loads and stores required to save registers across procedure calls compared to a conventional architecture. In this paper, we show that the Itanium register <b>stack</b> reduces <b>load</b> and store traffic to the stack by at least a factor of three across select SpecInt 2000 and Oracle database benchmarks. Furthermore, we examine the effects of the register stack on data cache miss rates and program execution time.

40|$|The current {{reference}} concept, i. e. the semihydrostatic emplacement model, for {{the final}} disposal of heat-generating high- and intermediate-level waste in deep vertical boreholes in salt provides for completely embedding each individual package in crushed salt. Load diversion by embedding in crushed salt (LEISA = Lastabtragung durch EInbettung in SAlzgrus) will limit the <b>stacking</b> <b>loads</b> to the packages embedded. On behalf of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS - Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz), {{which is responsible for}} establishing the Gorleben planning, the Research Centre Jülich is engaged in studying theoretically as well as experimentally the applicability of this concept to a future repository (ILW(Q) und HTGR fuel element experimental programme). Two test stands with different geometrical dimensions were designed, manufactured, instrumented and put into operation for simulating a repository borehole. The pressure distributions were measured in the test stands and compared with those calculated, varying all decisive parameters. According to the measurements performed in this test programme, the predictions of the semihydrostatic model for a rough borehole wall surface examined in both test stands are in very good agreement with the experiments. The deviations between theory and experiment found for a smooth wall surface are presumably due to a still too unspecific determination of those crushed-salt parameters which are incorporated in the model calculations.

The primary aim of this work is to enable increased efficiency of on-chip DC-DC conversion for near-threshold operation of multicore chips.

However, {{the effectiveness of this}} implicit down-conversion is affected by the current imbalance among the cores.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to document the structural adequacy of Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) in two separate normal configurations for the 40 -year interim period in the storage tubes at the Canister Storage Building (CSB). The two configurations apply when the lower MCO is arranged with (1) just a shield plug mechanical closure or (2) with the canister cover welded over the shield plug. Multiple analyses have been conducted to show the MCO design is adequate for drop events involving a lower, passive MCO being struck by an overhead drop load MCO both in vertical position. Minimal plastic deformations are experienced for either the MCO with shield plug or the MCO with cover cap. This survivability at 35 g's demonstrates the package's worthiness for 40 years of storage.
