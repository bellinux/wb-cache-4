She added that Mercedes confiding secrets in Doctor Browning [...] "served only to bring them closer. Usually, half a lager is all it takes to induce such a closeness, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> we can call it progress".|$|E
500|$|After Battlefield Earth was {{published}} in 1982, L. Ron Hubbard suggested that a film version of the book was in the works. He gave an interview in February 1983 to the Rocky Mountain News in which he told the reporter, [...] "I've recently written three screenplays, and some interest has been expressed in Battlefield Earth, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> I'll be right back in Hollywood {{one of these days}} and probably on location in the Denver area for Battlefield Earth when they film it." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey doesn't {{deny that}} he shoots from the hip, {{in a style}} that can unhinge the fragile egos of show business. [...] "If I was in the tire business," [...] {{reasoned}} Aubrey, [...] "I wouldn't be hurt if the customer didn't buy my tires. I'd think, 'So what?' But in my business, if I don't buy the script, then the writer kicks the dog and beats his wife. So you learn {{to pay attention to}} personal relationships. But that doesn't mean you lie to people. I've been the screwer and the screwee, and I know which is better. It's better to be the screwer, and it's very difficult to do that with honesty, but it's how I prefer to be treated. I don't want power now, or authority, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> my candor can't hurt me.|$|E

500|$|Gaga covered [...] "Orange Colored Sky" [...] {{during a}} {{surprise}} appearance at The Oak Room in New York City on September 29, 2010, {{and again on}} January 5, 2011. Brian Newman served as a guest performer on trumpet for performances at the Robin Hood Gala on May 9, 2011, to benefit the Robin Hood Foundation, and at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, England on May 15, 2011. Gaga later performed it on the ABC Christmas special A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, along with a cover version of [...] "White Christmas". Gaga put emphasis on the jazz side of the song. She added a second verse, describing the original song as [...] "too short". In the verse, Gaga describes a snowman, saying that Santa Claus {{is on his way}} to meet him. The lyrics end with Gaga saying, [...] "Okay, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> it's not very white outside yet." [...] The songs on A Very Gaga Holiday were recorded during the shooting of A Very Gaga Thanksgiving at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, New York City.|$|E

2500|$|I wouldn't say we're {{overwhelming}} favourites but I {{think we}} generally start as favourites against most teams at home. Touring teams often take {{a bit of}} time to adapt to our conditions and I think we saw a bit of that in the way Sri Lanka began the most recent series. The Windies haven't played any one-day cricket for a while and we're in the middle of our season, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> we are the team to beat. But having said that, if they find their feet they're a very good side and we'll have to play very well to win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, one thing. I saw {{no women}} in their camp, nor any sign of children. This I know because I gave orders that such were to be spared and it was {{reported}} {{to me that there}} were none, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> that they had fled away." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1997, Anderson {{made her}} first {{appearance}} in Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] The Chicago Tribune noted that Anderson's [...] "clear, bright upper range was at its clarion best, the soprano singing with strength and nuanced sensitivity" [...] and hailed her acting as well: [...] "ramatically, Anderson was exceptional, drawing {{out all of the}} conflicting emotions with an intensity tempered by dignity." [...] Later in 1997, she returned to the Opera Orchestra of New York to portray her first Elvira in Verdi's Ernani. [...] In 1998, Anderson spoke in Opera News of her move away from light coloratura roles [...] "into deeper water":I wanted to put it off as long as possible. I kept saying, and it's been quoted so many times, I didn't want to do [...] "Normina." [...] I wanted to do Norma. And Leonora. I didn't want to sound like a soubrette trying to do these things. I've done things like Il Corsaro and La Battaglia di Legnano very early in my career, so Verdi's always been a presence. I did mostly Rigolettos and Traviatas, and then I added Desdemona a few years ago. ... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> Leonora would be next in line." ...|$|E

"I {{beg your}} pardon, papa," [...] said {{a very pretty}} girl, entering, without, however, the {{slightest}} trace of apology or awe in her manner, and taking a chair with the self-possession and familiarity of an habitue of the room; [...] "but I knew it was not your habit to write late, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> you were not busy.
