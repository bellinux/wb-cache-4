Some men who choose this role may do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career. For example, of the 187 participants at Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.|$|E
5|$|There was {{rivalry between}} the lords of the manor and borough. The {{lord of the}} manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry {{continued}} in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging {{the right of the}} burgesses to hold markets, believing it should be the right of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt they were fulfilling the duties of the lord: to improve waste and common land and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing some power between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E

5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is {{explained}} by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E

As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers are sleeping. The result is night terrors.|$|E

25|$|In {{a series}} of texts {{published}} in the early 1970s, C.R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this {{made it impossible to}} explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> admit the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.|$|E
25|$|Both drift {{gillnets}} and setnets {{have long been}} used by cultures around the world. There is evidence of fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, going far back in Japanese history, with many specific details available from the Edo period (1603–1868). Fisheries in the Shetland Islands, which were settled by Norsemen during the Viking age, share cultural and technological similarities with Norwegian fisheries, including gillnet fisheries for herring. Many of the Norwegian immigrant fishermen who came to fish in the great Columbia River salmon fishery {{during the second half}} of the 19th century did <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had experience in the gillnet fishery for cod in the waters surrounding the Lofoten Islands of northern Norway. Gillnets were used as part of the seasonal round by Swedish fishermen as well. Welsh and English fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in the rivers of Wales and England in coracles, using hand-made nets, for at least several centuries. These are but a few of the examples of historic gillnet fisheries around the world.|$|E

25|$|By fall 1984, The Edge of Night {{aired on}} only 106 of ABC's 213 {{affiliate}} stations. A further two dozen affiliates planned {{to drop the}} series {{in the first quarter}} of 1985, with many station managers doing <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> wanted local programming to air in the 4 o'clock hour. Although ABC intended to continue The Edge of Night, even by offering to move it to a mid-morning timeslot, Procter & Gamble could no longer afford to continue producing the show due to the constant loss of revenue from frequent pre-emptions. Thus, on October 26, 1984, ABC and Procter and Gamble made a joint announcement that the final telecast of Edge of Night (whose title had been shortened to three words) would be on December 28 of that year. At this point, the show's ratings were less than half of what they had been at the beginning of the decade; it finished the 1984-1985 television season last in the daytime ratings race with a 2.6 rating in only four months of episodes.|$|E
25|$|Jiangling was {{initially}} situated on flat lands {{and was a}} very accessible location. However, Lu Kang later ordered Zhang Xian (張咸) to oversee {{the construction of a}} large dyke to block the river flow and direct its waters to flood the flat lands, so as to create a large body of water around the city to serve as a barrier to invaders. When Yang Hu arrived, he planned to make use of this barrier by transporting supplies on boats, but he spread false news that he intended to destroy the dyke to make way for his land army to pass through. When Lu Kang heard that, he saw through Yang Hu's plot and ordered Zhang Xian to destroy the dyke. Lu Kang's officers were shocked and attempted to dissuade him from doing <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> thought he would be doing the enemy a favour, but Lu ignored them. When Yang Hu reached Dangyang (當陽), he was dismayed to hear that the dyke had been destroyed.

25|$|Many factors {{played a}} role in Britain’s {{long-term}} economic growth, such as the industrial revolution in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age. Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family. Child Labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths. Although there are many counts of {{children under the age of}} ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also transitioning to save for their own future families.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{marched into}} Prague on 15 March 1939. In mid-April, the Soviet Union, Britain and France began trading {{diplomatic}} suggestions regarding {{a political and}} military agreement to counter potential further German aggression. Poland {{did not participate in}} these talks. The tripartite discussions focused on possible guarantees to participating countries should German expansionism continue. The Soviets did not trust the British or the French to honour a collective security agreement, because they had already failed to react against the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and protect Czechoslovakia from dismemberment. The Soviet Union also suspected that Britain and France would seek to remain on the sidelines of any potential Nazi-Soviet conflict. In reality however, Stalin had been conducting secret talks with Nazi Germany already since 1936 through his emissaries, and all along a deal with Hitler remained his first diplomatic choice, wrote Robert C. Grogin (author of Natural Enemies). The Soviet Union sought nothing short of an ironclad guarantee against losing its sphere of influence, and insisted on stretching the so-called buffer zone from Finland to Romania, {{in the event of an}} attack. The Soviets demanded the right to enter these countries in the event of a security threat. When the military talks began in mid-August, negotiations quickly stalled over the topic of Soviet troop passage through Poland if the Germans attacked. British and French officials pressured Polish government to agree to the Soviet terms. However, Polish officials bluntly refused to allow Soviet troops in Poland. They believed that once the Red Army entered Poland it might never leave. The Soviets suggested that Poland's wishes be ignored, and that the tripartite agreements be concluded despite its objections. The British refused to do <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believed that such a move would push Poland into establishing stronger bilateral relations with Germany.|$|E

[...] But Myles sees her behavior as [...] "a richly legible text of female agency, affiliation, and dissent." [...] Looking at Burrough's account of the conversation between Dyer and Governor Endicott, Myles views {{the two most important}} dimensions as being agency and affiliation. The first is that Dyer's actions [...] "can be read as staging a public drama of agency," [...] a means for women, including female prophets, to act under the power and will of God. [...] While Quaker women were allowed to preach, they were not being assertive when doing <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were actually [...] "preaching against their own wills and minds." ...|$|E

They are completely mistaken about me, since I am not disposed to serve them as a hobbyhorse." [...] Lacking support in parliament, Caxias' cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house). PedroII asked members of the Liga Progressista (Progressive League)—a new party consisting of moderate Conservatives and Liberals—to form a new cabinet. Barely a month later, Caxias' only son died at age 14 of unknown causes. There was a small consolation at the end of 1862 when, on 2 December, he was made brevet marechal de exército (army marshal), the highest rank in the Brazilian army.|$|E

By the time the band went to the studio, they had only one complete song and some ideas for choruses on other songs. As with Coming Up to Breathe, the band decided not to record the album in Nashville or their hometown of Dallas. They chose Cider Mountain Studio, located on a ranch in rural Idaho, and [...] "drew inspiration and motivation from the 'beautiful' surroundings."

500|$|Cyan Worlds and Mattel (then {{the owner}} of the Myst and Riven franchise) offered the task of {{developing}} the sequel to several development companies; according to Game Developer, interested parties developed proposals including story concepts, analysis of the first two games, technology discussion, and technology demonstration. A core team from Presto Studios held discussions which analyzed Myst and Riven, then set out specific goals for the third game. According to Presto founder and producer Greg Uhler, these goals included visual variety in the Ages, a satisfying ending, and a way for players to gauge their progress during the game. The progress goal was very important for Uhler, who stated: [...] "Players who had failed to complete Myst or Riven did <b>so</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were unsure of how much remained of the game and what their goals were." [...] Initially, Presto prepared three possible storylines for the game to follow; a meeting between Cyan, Presto, and Mattel yielded a completely different plot, which explored some of the loose ends hinted at in Myst. Presto spent millions of U.S. dollars developing the game, using the studio's entire staff to complete the project. Development took two and a half years, of which nine months were spent on design and pre-production.|$|E
