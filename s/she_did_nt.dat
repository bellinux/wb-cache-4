60|$|<b>She</b> <b>done</b> it, too; and <b>she</b> <b>done</b> it {{beautiful}}. <b>She</b> <b>done</b> it {{so beautiful}} {{it was good}} to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so <b>she</b> could <b>do</b> it again.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} to prefer charges against him, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not have to}} find him lazy, careless, incompetent, untidy, ill-mannered, unholy, dishonest, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have to {{discover}} a fault of any kind in him, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not {{have to tell him}} nor his congregation why she dismisses and disgraces him and insults his meek flock, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have to explain to his family why she takes the bread out of their mouths and turns them out-of-doors homeless and ashamed in a strange land; <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have to do anything but send a letter and say: [...] "Pack!--and ask no questions!" ...|$|R
60|$|If I'm light-hearted, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it one way. If I'm {{depressed}} <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it another.|$|R
50|$|Hayden Carruth {{wrote about}} The Everyday Uncommon: “It’s {{clear to me}} that she knows what <b>she’s</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>doing</b> what <b>she</b> wants to <b>do,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it well.” The book has also {{received}} critical praise from Rhina Espaillat, R. S. Gwynn, David Mason, and Deborah Warren, among others.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia frowned a little. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not like}} Mattie's expressions, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> like Mayflowers, and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not dislike Chris Stewart, who {{had seemed to}} her merely a nice, modest, country boy. She lifted the flowers and {{buried her face in}} them.|$|R
60|$|THE MALE FIGURE [falling on his knees] Oh <b>dont,</b> sir. Dont. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> it, sir: indeed <b>she</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|The haughty {{young lady}} also blushed. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not often blush; when <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> felt angry with herself.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth cast {{down her}} eyes. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not quite {{think it was}} a fault, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not say so.|$|R
60|$|At first perhaps <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not hear, {{certainly}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not understand, for {{her attitude}} did not relax its uncompromising stiffness.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>did</b> love him, and mistook the symptoms. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{her best}} to mistake the symptoms. But if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> truly love him, would it seem so queer and {{important}} and antagonistic as it did that his hair was rather thin upon the crown of his head? ...|$|R
60|$|When this {{conversation}} first commenced, Malleville was standing near to Wallace, and {{she listened to}} it for a little time, but she found that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not understand {{a great deal of}} it, and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not think that what <b>she</b> <b>did</b> understand was very interesting. So she went away.|$|R
60|$|Hilda flushed at this, and {{answered}} with some spirit that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know, {{and that if}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> would not tell.|$|R
60|$|Of course Margaret {{said that}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not mind it, though in truth <b>she</b> <b>did</b> mind it, and {{was afraid of}} her aunt.|$|R
30|$|We {{note that}} the {{converse}} implication of (BW → <b>NT)</b> <b>does</b> not hold.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> not heed him. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not even}} look towards him. Her {{eyes were fixed}} upon Paul, and he read their message aright.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not move}} {{and there was}} no flicker of emotion on her face, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not look at him when she answered.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} his {{stand-up}} comedy act was funny {{and refuses to}} date someone whose work <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not respect ("The Ex-Girlfriend").|$|R
50|$|Wilson confronts Stacy {{over her}} kiss with House and warns she cannot toy with him. <b>She</b> admits <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not know what}} <b>she's</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|R
60|$|If {{they could}} have {{continued}} this normal barbaric life Carol {{would have been the}} most enthusiastic citizen of Gopher Prairie. She was relieved to be assured that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not want bookish conversation alone; that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not expect the town to become a Bohemia. She was content now. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not criticize.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not boast. I wish <b>she</b> <b>did!</b> That {{would be}} {{straightforward}} and simple; {{but she has}} too good taste for that--so <b>she</b> <b>does</b> worse--she tells a little, and makes that go a long way, {{as if she were}} keeping back a great deal! You don't know how furious it makes me!" ...|$|R
25|$|LeToya {{has had two}} web {{series of}} herself on YouTube. In 2006, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> H-Town Chic; and in 2012, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> Life, Love & Music.|$|R
60|$|And {{she clung}} close to Birkin. Suddenly <b>she</b> {{realised}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not know what}} he was thinking. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not know where he was ranging.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Heydinger," [...] he said, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not stop. [...] "Miss Heydinger." [...] He {{realised}} that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not want}} to answer him again....|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Jimenez {{participated in}} the Miss Taguig - Hollywood pageant. Although <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not win the title, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> win the Miss Photogenic title.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not often}} think of Milt; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not know whether}} he was ahead of her, or had again dropped behind. When <b>she</b> <b>did</b> recall him, it was with respect quite {{different}} from the titillation that dancing men had sometimes aroused, or the impression of manicured agreeableness and efficiency which Jeff Saxton carried about.|$|R
6000|$|He skipped for joy {{like little}} muttons, He danced like Esmeralda's kid. (<b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean a}} boy in buttons, Although he fancied that <b>she</b> <b>did.)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Inviolate and {{immobile}} <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not rise}} <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not stir For silver moons are naught {{to her and}} naught to her the suns that reel.|$|R
50|$|Ettinger {{has said}} that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not vote in the primary for the 2008 presidential {{election}} but that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> vote in the 2008 general election.|$|R
50|$|Ela não os comeu, mas comi-os eu. Literally: <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not eat them, but {{ate them}} I. Meaning: <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not eat them, but I did.|$|R
50|$|Lyta apologizes for ruining Franklin's experiment. Her {{intervention}} {{was in fact}} helpful, though, so he asks how <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it and requests <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it again.|$|R
5000|$|Madea only {{appears in}} the film, as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not appear in the}} stage play. (Although <b>she</b> <b>did</b> appear in a {{flashback}} in the very beginning.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "“There {{are four}} edifying {{behavioural}} characteristics for women: {{the first is}} womanly virtue (fude), the second is womanly speech (fuyan), the third is womanly manner (fuyong), and the fourth is womanly merit (fugong).What is womanly virtue? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not distinguish herself in talent and intelligence. What is womanly speech? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not sharpen her language and speech. What is womanly manner? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not seek to be outwardly beautiful or ornamented. What is womanly merit? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not outperform others in her skills and cleverness.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Simply because <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not wish}} it. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not love you. Is not that enough? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> love another man; me--me--me. Is not that enough? Heaven and earth! I would sooner {{go to the}} galleys, or break stones upon the roads, than take a woman to my bosom who was {{thinking}} of some other man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And can I {{say because}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> one startling {{thing that the}} total of her sin is greater than mine? Was I ever tempted as she was tempted? Was my youth made {{dangerous}} for me as was hers? And then <b>she</b> <b>did</b> nothing for herself; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it all for another. We may think of that now." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> not reply. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} what to say. She knew nothing of love. She had never given it a thought; but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> know that it was very nice to be loved, {{whatever}} it meant. It was nice to have people kind to one. She had known so little of kindness or affection.|$|R
