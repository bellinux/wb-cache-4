5|$|In 1983, {{classification}} for swimmers with {{cerebral palsy}} was governed by CP-ISRA. There were five cerebral palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors could compete in the 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices. Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors. That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors {{with cerebral palsy}} competed in the <b>same</b> <b>classification</b> in international competitions.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were {{estimated by the}} US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult. One {{reason for this is}} that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the <b>same</b> <b>classification</b> scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically be found in the ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine, two pegmatite, and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the legalization}} of {{contraceptives}} {{in the early twentieth}} century, Brazilian law placed contraception, abortion and immorality in the <b>same</b> <b>classification.</b> Three factors that have impacted contraceptive laws on Brazil are the influence of the Catholic Church, the legacy of Iberian culture, and the historically conservative approach to the status of women in Latin America.

25|$|Prognosis {{is usually}} {{given for the}} {{probability}} of progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS). These predictions are based on experience with breast cancer patients with similar classification. A prognosis is an estimate, as patients with the <b>same</b> <b>classification</b> will survive a different amount of time, and classifications are not always precise. Survival is usually calculated as an average number of months (or years) that 50% of patients survive, or the percentage of patients that are alive after 1, 5, 15, and 20 years. Prognosis is important for treatment decisions because patients with a good prognosis are usually offered less invasive treatments, such as lumpectomy and radiation or hormone therapy, while patients with poor prognosis are usually offered more aggressive treatment, such as more extensive mastectomy and one or more chemotherapy drugs.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{headaches}} {{are classified}} {{based on their}} cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders {{in the category of}} secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the <b>same</b> <b>classification</b> system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Aaron Thomas {{rated the}} Wii version's motion control scheme as [...] "uninteresting and {{occasionally}} frustrating". X-Play's Morgan Webb agreed, calling the controls [...] "non-intuitive" [...] and commenting that the minigames required players to [...] "wave their Wiimotes frantically while pressing several buttons {{at the same}} time". Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly mentioned that the controls were complicated for a game {{that should be a}} [...] "pure pick-up-and-play party game". Tae Kim said the events were [...] "short and fairly shallow" [...] and mostly required players to move the [...] "Wii Remote and Nunchuks in specific ways—rapidly up and down for running events, for example". Mark Bozon of IGN called Mario & Sonic a success due to the entertainment value derived from the slight variety of competitions offered in the game. However, he and several other critics felt that events within the <b>same</b> <b>classification</b> were similar; Bozon noted that diversity was lacking as [...] "five or six [...] nearly identical", and Thomas found the gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite the reviewer praising the game for its number of events. Both reviewers favored the more complex objectives found in the fantasy events of the game, which shared attributes with that of the Mario sport games and archery.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The Daily Telegraph, British doctor and science writer James Le Fanu was critical, and commented that Taylor did not {{acknowledge}} [...] "the explanatory gap" [...] between current understanding of the brain's structure and [...] "what it does, how we think, feel and emote". Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing is {{that it would have been}} a much more interesting book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain why that 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, now seems to be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who might know it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are all a little bit brainwashed by our culture and experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the <b>same</b> <b>classification</b> as the tabloid press.

500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated {{as if they were the}} same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the <b>same</b> <b>classification</b> as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person." ...|$|E
