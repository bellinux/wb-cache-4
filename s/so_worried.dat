This successful resistance against Spanish attempts at domination served to attract ever more Indians fleeing colonial rule.|$|E

25|$|Physiological effects, {{similar to}} those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobics. In adults, it may be tears as well as {{excessive}} sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations {{as a result of the}} fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about how they walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia. These visible symptoms further reinforce the anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations.|$|E
25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E

500|$|Some exiled Catholics favoured Philip II of Spain's daughter, Infanta Isabella, as Elizabeth's successor. [...] More {{moderate}} Catholics {{looked to}} James's and Elizabeth's cousin Arbella Stuart, a woman {{thought to have}} Catholic sympathies.

500|$|Neighbors in Evergreen Park later {{described}} the Kaczynskis as [...] "civic-minded folks", one {{stating that the}} parents [...] "sacrificed everything they had for their children". Both Ted and David were intelligent, but Ted stood out in particular. One neighbor said she had [...] "never known anyone who had a brain like ," [...] while another commented that Ted was [...] "strictly a loner" [...] who [...] "didn't play... an old man before his time." [...] Wanda recalled Ted as a shy child who would become unresponsive if pressured into a social situation.

Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point." [...] <b>So</b> <b>worried</b> that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that [...] "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in [...] "looking forward" [...] to the Bomb's prospects.|$|E

500|$|Though Burton was {{unfamiliar}} with Johnny Depp's then-popular performance in 21 Jump Street, {{he had always}} been Burton's first choice. At the time of his casting, Depp was wanting {{to break out of the}} teen idol status which his performance in 21 Jump Street had afforded him. When he was sent the script, Depp [...] "wept like a newborn" [...] and immediately found personal and emotional connections with the story. In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue. Fox studio executives were <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about Edward's image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until release of the film. Burton approached Ryder for the role of Kim Boggs based on their positive working experience in Beetlejuice. Drew Barrymore previously auditioned for the role. Crispin Glover auditioned for the role of Jim before Anthony Michael Hall was cast.|$|E
500|$|Partially {{due to her}} {{experiences}} filming Mermaids, Cher turned down leading roles in such films as The War of the Roses and Thelma & Louise. According to Berman, [...] "After the success of Moonstruck, she was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about her next career move that she was overly cautious." [...] In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was not healthy enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10million in fees. The skits were parodied on Saturday Night Live and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told Ladies' Home Journal, [...] "Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't occur to me that people would focus on that and strip me of all my other things." ...|$|E

[...] However, events come to a head when they received a charity patient in episode [...] "Duty of Care" [...] chaperoned by Abra's father, Cecil. [...] Having previously told Kyla his father was dead, Abra attempted to hide his identity from her, but she was furious to discover the truth. He placated her briefly, but was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> when his father collapsed with ill-health that he ruined a social services meeting to decide whether her son may be returned from foster care. [...] They rowed bitterly, and soon thereafter Abra's father died. [...] He decided to take over the running of the charity in his father's place, and once more departed from Holby, again leaving Kyla behind. When asked whether the two characters would ever get back together, following Abra's second abandoment, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." ...|$|E
500|$|Designer Robert Fletcher {{was brought}} in to {{redesign}} existing costumes and create new ones. Fletcher decided on a scheme of [...] "corrupt colors", using materials with colors slightly off from the pure color. [...] "They're not colors you see today, so in a subtle way their indicate another time." [...] Meyer did not like the Starfleet uniforms from either the television series or The Motion Picture and wanted them changed, but for budgetary reasons they could not be discarded entirely. Dye tests of the fabric showed that the old uniforms took three colors well: blue-gray, gold, and dark red. Fletcher decided to use the dark red due to the strong contrast it provided with the background. The resulting naval-inspired designs would be used in Star Trek films until [...] (1996). The first versions of the uniforms had stiff black collars, but Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck, using a form of vertical quilting called trapunto. The method creates a bas-relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with soft thread shot via air pressure through a hollow needle. By the time of The Wrath of Khans production, the machines and needles needed to produce trapunto were rare, and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department. The crew was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about losing or breaking the needle that one of the department's workers took it home with him as a security measure, leading Fletcher to think it had been stolen.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Goldsmith, who had in February 1762 {{published}} The Mystery Revealed, {{may also}} have been responsible for the satirical illustration, English Credulity or the Invisible Ghost (1762).

500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Siberia, Trotsky studied philosophy. He {{became aware}} of the {{differences}} within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known as [...] "economists" [...] argued that the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot in life and were not <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> about changing the government. They believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker's struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper Iskra, or in English, The Spark, which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the Iskra position and began writing for the paper.|$|E
