40|$|Wire harness {{design is}} an {{increasingly}} complex task. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) and optimization techniques {{can be used}} to support designers in handling this complexity. The wire harness design process can be divided in three main parts, namely electrical design, configuration design and geometrical routing. This paper describes the latest progress {{in the development of a}} KBE application aiming at the automation of the routing phase. Discrete optimization techniques are used to design shortest path harnesses, while complying with different type of constraints. Some preliminary results have been presented in a previous paper, where only geometrical constraints were addressed. However, wire harness design is affected also by other types of rules and constraints, which need to be accounted to obtain more realistic design results from the optimization process. This paper describes some new developments in the routing application to account for the presence of critical zones inside the aircraft. As study case, the presence of heat sources inside the airframe is considered, which either force the harness to be routed elsewhere, or require the use <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> protections, with obvious consequences on weight and manufacturing. First, some mathematic transformation techniques are used to model the presence of heat sources inside the routing environment. Then the A* algorithm is used for compute the 3 D routing, aiming at minimum wire harness weight. The main architecture of the routing application is presented and its functionality is demonstrated with <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> harness routing inside a wing. The results show that the proposed KBE application can automate the routing <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> harness while taking into account different rules and constraints. The modeling approach for a heat source can be generalized and extended to address other criticality such as abrasion, electromagnetic interference, corrosion, etc. The achieved level of automation relieves designers from the repetitive work associated with the frequent changes affecting the design environment.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} practical possibilities of the strand stirrer (S-EMS) {{for the improvement of}} inner quality and central segregation in high carbon billets. An optimal S-EMS setting was proposed for the billet caster producing billets 150 x 150 mm. Design/methodology/approach: Impact of different S-EMS settings on central segregation and inner quality of as-cast billets was investigated. A set of longitudinal and transverse samples were analysed including evaluation of baumann prints and central segregation by means <b>of</b> LECO method. <b>Samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> for segregation survey in rolled products were picked up as well. Findings: It was observed that application of the strand stirrer (S-EMS) is capable to suppress central segregation. However, its impact is visible just to a certain stirring level. Subsequent increasing of stirring intensity does not cause further improvement of segregation in the analyzed central part. On the contrary, stronger white band {{can be seen in the}} solidification line. Moreover, concentration gradient between the central part and surrounding ring of negative central segregation is lowered. These two effects can play a significant role in the evaluation of segregation level in rolled wires. Research limitations/implications: Analysis of central segregation in a lower size than used 6 mm. Practical implications: Optimal S-EMS setting seems to be 300 A/ 14 Hz.

Materials and methods: A modified three-point bending test was performed on the <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 75 <b>wires</b> <b>of</b> conventional stainless steel, multistranded stainless steel, superelastic NiTi, thermal NiTi and multistranded coaxial NiTi (15 each). The load exerted by each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> was measured at the deflections of 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 mm during loading and subsequent unloading process at 37 °C temperature. Results: Force-deflection diagrams were determined from the passive position to an activation of 2 mm and then during deactivation forces on deactivation (unloading) at a deflection of 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 mm were compared by post hoc Tukey′s analysis of variance. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in deactivation forces were observed among wires. The multistranded stainless steel wire had the lowest mean deactivation force (0. 82 N), while the conventional stainless steel group had the highest mean value (3. 56 N). Conclusion: The multistranded coaxial NiTi wires exhibited lighter and more continuous forces hence should be the first choice <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> during the initial stages of treatment followed by thermal NiTi and superelastic NiTi.

The main objective of the research is to formulate a casting slip {{that could be used}} for its whiteness and thinness as well as maintain a level of strength. I began by experimenting with different formulations of casting slip. By testing combinations of different percentages of raw clay components, certain qualities can be amplified. An investigation <b>of</b> various papers, <b>wire,</b> and wax for surface development began in hopes of finding additional creative opportunities. Tea bag paper, as well as rice paper is utilized to construct armatures onto which the casting slip is applied. By brushing casting slip on the surface of the paper I am able to ascertain how much slip would crack and fall off prior to firing, which would also indicate whether the work would survive a kiln firing. Firing <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> at various temperatures tests the wires durability and level of heat resistance. These casting slips are based on porcelain clay bodies, which are white upon being kiln-fired.

A casting slip was formulated, which fired to a cool white; the surface of the clay also has a slight sheen. The tea bag paper as of yet is still the best choice for my process of construction.

40|$|Introduction: In orthodontics, contact {{dermatitis}} caused by nickel allergy {{should be of}} concern {{with the number of}} nickel-containing appliances and wires used. Stainless steel archwires are commonly used throughout orthodontic treatment. With the release of nickel from these wires, some manufacturers have turned to nickel-free stainless steel alternatives. The goal of this research was to compare nickel-free stainless steel with traditional stainless steel archwires with regard to mechanical properties and microstructure. Materials and Methods: Nickel-free stainless steel and regular stainless steel archwires from four companies were included. Five random <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> each <b>wire,</b> vertically mounted in fast-set acrylic, were indented three times to determine their Vickers microhardness. Force deflection properties were investigated with the three point bending test in which fifteen random <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> each <b>wire</b> were tested. Wire samples were horizontally mounted in fast-set acrylic, acid-etched for variable amounts of time, and then analyzed with a metallurgical microscope to assess microstructure. All quantitative data were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a 0. 05 significance level with a Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD (honest significant difference) test post hoc analysis, when necessary. Results: Vickers microhardness number, activation stiffness, elastic recovery, and activation bending force values were calculated for each sample. Activation modulus showed no significant differences between Dentaurum wires. All wires were statistically different when considering percent recovery. Scheu and Dentaurum stainless steel wires were statistically similar to the respective nickel-free alternatives when investigating activation stiffness. Scheu Chromium bending force values were always greater than Scheu Menzanium. Acme Monaco 2 ̆ 7 s nickel-free alternative had force values greater than Acme stainless steel. Force values for Dentaurum wires through 1. 0 mm of deflection showed no significant differences. Nickel-free alternatives and stainless steel wires manufactured by Scheu, Acme-Monaco, and Pozzi/Leone showed no statistical significant difference with regards to microhardness values. Microstructure analysis revealed differences between grain structure and sizes between all wires. Conclusions: Dentaurum Remanium and Noninium archwires appear to have the most similarities with regards to the mechanical and microstructure properties investigated in this study. With regards to the mechanical properties tested, nickel-free stainless steel may be a viable alternative to traditional stainless steel archwires...|$|R

The phase velocity for the 20 -gauge MIL-W- 81381 / 7 wire had a baseline value of 3023 78 m/s.

40|$|Presented {{thesis is}} focused on the wire media applied for {{enhancement}} of the dipole radiation. Wire medium is a metamaterial that has seen a lot of interest due to the hyperbolic frequency dispersion and the strong spatial dispersion that does not vanish even in the quasi-static limit. A combination of these exotic properties observes in no one natural material and even in chemically synthesizable materials it is hardly possible to engineer. Meanwhile, creating new devices demands artificial materials with more and more unusual properties. Previously, it was proved theoretically and experimentally, that the evanescent spatial spectrum of the dipole source radiation efficiently converts into propagating waves if the dipole is placed inside the infinite wire medium. Thus, it is possible to extract efficiently the radiation from the separate inefficient sources or areas of distributed poorly radiating sources. However, the finite size for any physical object including any <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wire</b> medium hinders the implementation of this enhancement for practical applications due to almost total internal reflection. This effect also hinders the use <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> media for broadband transfer of power. The implementation of the broadband enhancement of radiation and broadband power transfer becomes not so easy, it requires a modification <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> medium <b>samples</b> and imply many scientific questions, which I tried to answer in this thesis. Among these questions, three are the main ones, corresponding to three different types of the finite-size wire-medium samples dedicated for the broadband enhancement of radiation and power transfer that we aim to achieve beyond any capacitive, inductive or galvanic coupling of the radiating dipoles with the wires. The first one is a wire medium-based hyperlens, which answers the question about the possibility to surpass drastically the blackbody limit for thermal radiation in a wide frequency range. I show how the divergence <b>of</b> metal <b>wires</b> and other design parameters of the hyperlens modifies the radiation of a dipole into free space offering its huge broadband enhancement. The second type <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> media are <b>samples</b> with parallel alignment <b>of</b> the <b>wires.</b> They are not suitable for the broadband enhancement of the embedded dipoles but answer the question is it possible to transfer the power over a wide frequency band across a wire-medium sample. It is possible if the interfaces of a wire-medium slab slightly submerge into two media or are inserted into two hollow waveguides. The third topic refers to a new type <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> metamaterial – irregular wire media – arrays with small but random tilt <b>of</b> the <b>wires.</b> This metamaterial allows a broadband enhancement of radiation, and, in contrast to a hyperlens, answers the question is it possible to achieve this effect without the enlargement of the radiating aperture...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{galvanic}} coupling of conventional and metal injection molded (MIM) brackets with commonly used orthodontic archwires. Materials and Methods: Six {{of each type}} of bracket were suspended in lactic acid along with a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> orthodontic <b>wire</b> (three nickel-titanium and three copper-nickel-titanium) for 28 days at 37 °C. The potential differences between the wires and brackets were recorded per second throughout {{the duration of the}} experiment. Results: The MIM brackets exhibited potential differences similar to those seen for the conventional brackets. The greatest potential difference was found for MIM brackets with nickel-titanium wires (512 mV), whereas MIM brackets with copper-nickel-titanium wires had the smallest difference (115 mV). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) -energy-dispersive spectroscopic analysis of the tie-wing area of each bracket type indicated similar elemental composition in both brackets, but in slightly different percentages by weight. The MIM bracket exhibited extensive internal porosity, whereas the conventional bracket was more solid internally.

Neutron diffraction patterns <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> <b>samples</b> were measured at room temperature in J-PARC "TAKUMI". To obtain residual strains of materials, we estimated lattice constant a by multi-peak analysis in the <b>wire.</b> Powder <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> each <b>wire</b> was measured, where the powder {{was considered to be}} strain-free.

One-dimensional steady-state heat conduction along the hot wire and the test fibre is analytically solved. From the solutions, the relationships among the average temperature rise <b>of</b> the hot <b>wire,</b> the heat generation rate, the temperature at the attached end of the fibre, and heat flux from the hot wire to the fibre are accurately obtained. Based on the relationships, the thermal conductivity of the single test fibre can easily be estimated when the average temper-ature rise and the heat generation rate are measured for the same system as above. We have obtained analytical solutions for various measurement conditions and clarified quantitatively the applicability and accuracy of this method. It is found that the thermal conductivity can be measured within an error of 1 % in the range up to 1000 W mÿ 1 Kÿ 1 for a fibre of 10 ^ 30 mm in diameter. Furthermore, preliminary experiments have been carried out with <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> platinum <b>wire</b> (100. 8 mm diameter) and copper wire (41. 7 mm diameter), and confirmed the validity of the present method. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{measuring}} {{the distribution of}} a nominally Gaussian beam, it is generally necessary to sample the beam {{at a number of}} discrete positions. In the real world, these samples will be somewhat noisy. We present the results of simulations, showing the effects of noise in signal amplitude and noise in sample position on the calculated beam s, as a function <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> spacing. This has implications for the <b>wire</b> spacing <b>of</b> multiwire profile monitors and for the <b>sampling</b> rate <b>of</b> flying <b>wires</b> and wall current monitors. I. INTRODUCTION Many situations occur where one wishes to measure the profile of a beam which is nearly Gaussian and to derive a good estimate of the beam s. In generating design specifications for beam profile monitors and flying wires at the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), it was necessary to find a quantitative relationship connecting the various sources of noise and the resultant errors in estimation of beam s. Since we could not locate any direct treatments of this in [...] ...|$|R

First, the decrease <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> diameter causes a slow loss <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> tension along the whole wire web. Second, plastic deformation leads to a fast decrease <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> tension within the first few centimeters <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> web.
