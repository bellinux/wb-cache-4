40|$|Many {{people around}} the world suffer from {{neurological}} injuries of various sorts that cause serious difficulties in their lives, due to the loss of important sensory and motor functions. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) provides a possible solution to these difficulties by means of a feedback connection allowing the target organ (or organs) to be controlled by electrical stimulation. The control signals can be provided using recorded data extracted from the nerves (electroneurogram, ENG). The most common and safe approaches for interfacing with nerves is called cuff electrodes which deliver the required feedback path for the implantable system with minimum risk. The amount of recorded information can be improved by increasing the number of electrodes within a single cuff known as multi-electrode cuffs (MECs) configuration. This strategy can increase the signal to noise ratio for the recorded signals which have typically very low amplitude (less than 5 μV). Consequently multiple high gain amplifiers are used in order to amplify the signals and supply a multi-channel recorded data stream for signal processing or monitoring applications. The signal processing unit within the implantable system or outside the body is employed for classification and sorting the action potential signals (APs) depending on their conduction velocities. This method is called velocity selective recording (VSR). Basically, the idea of this approach is that the conduction velocity of AP can be determined by timing the appearance of the signal at two or more points along the nerve and then dividing the distance between the points by the delay. The purpose of this thesis to investigate an alternative approach using artificial network for APs detection and extraction in neural recording applications to increase the velocity selectivity based on VSR using MECs. The prototype systems impose four major requirements which are high velocity selectivity, small size, low power consumption and high reliability. The proposed method has been developed for applications which require online AP classification. A novel time delay neural network (TDNN) approach is used to decompose the recorded data into several matched velocity bands to allow for individual velocity selectivity at each band to be increased. Increasing the velocity selectivity leads to more accurate recording from the target fibre (or fibres) within the nerve bundle which can be used for applications that require AP classification such as bladder control and the adjustment of foot drop. The TDNN method was developed to obtain more information from an individual cuff without increasing the number of electrodes or the sampling rate. Moreover, the optimization of the hardware implementation for the proposed signal processing method permits savings in power consumption and silicon area. Finally, a nerve <b>signal</b> <b>synthesiser</b> and noise generator for the evaluation of the VSRmethod is described. This system generates multiple artificial AP signals with a time offset between the channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) to simulate the MEC and hence reduce the cost and the number of the animals required for experimental tests...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to femtosecond combs {{as a tool for}} optical frequency metrology and {{as an integral part of}} an optical clock. After an overview of optical frequency measurement techniques, the design of two frequency combs based on mode-locked femtosecond lasers as they were at the beginning of my project is described. The first comb is based on an Er:fibre laser operating at a central wavelength of 1550 nm with a repetition rate of 100 MHz. The second is a Ti:sapphire-laser-based comb operating at a central wavelength of 810 nm with a repetition rate of 87 MHz. Improvements to the original design of the Ti:sapphire comb are detailed in the next chapter. A novel f-to- 2 f self-referencing scheme based on a pair of Wollaston prisms and employing a PPKTP crystal for SHG results in up to 20 dB enhancement of the signal to noise ratio in the carrier-envelope offset frequency beat signal f 0 and in up to 15 dB lower phase noise in the f 0 beat signal compared to a Michelson interferometer based system. Next, the factors influencing the stability and accuracy of the microwave reference signal and the performance of two synthesisers used for the stabilisation of the frequency combs were investigated. It is shown that stability of the maser reference signal is reduced by the distribution system by factor of 1. 5. A fractional frequency change of 4. 1 (0. 7) × 10 − 16 (K/h) − 1 was measured for the better of the two synthesisers (an IFR 2023 A) indicating that for accurate frequency measurements the <b>synthesiser</b> <b>signal</b> should be monitored to enable systematic frequency corrections to be made. Finally, an absolute frequency measurement of the electric quadrupole clock transition in a frequency standard based on a single 171 Yb+ trapped ion is described. The result f = 688 358 979 309 310 ± 9 Hz agrees with an independent measurement made by the PTB group within the uncertainty of the measurements...|$|R
