5|$|June 28: Roosevelt {{creates the}} Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD) under Vannevar Bush with {{the signing of}} Executive Order 8807. OSRD absorbs NDRC and the Uranium Committee. James B. Conant succeeds Bush {{as the head of}} NDRC.|$|E
5|$|Stimson {{himself was}} chairman. The other members were: James F. Byrnes, former US Senator and {{soon to be}} Secretary of State, as President Truman's {{personal}} representative; Ralph A. Bard, Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush, Director of the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> {{and president of the}} Carnegie Institution; Karl T. Compton, Chief of the Office of Field Service in the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> and president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology; James B. Conant, Chairman of the National Defense Research Committee and president of Harvard University; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and president of the New York Life Insurance Company. Harrison chaired the committee when Stimson was absent, but Byrnes, as the President's personal representative, was probably its most influential member.|$|E

These experiments involved a range of research topics, sometimes endangering the health of the COs.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Hanford site {{represented}} {{two-thirds of}} the nation's high-level radioactive waste by volume. Hanford is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States and {{is the focus of}} the nation's largest environmental cleanup. Besides the cleanup project, Hanford also hosts a commercial nuclear power plant, the Columbia Generating Station, and various centers for <b>scientific</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> such as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the LIGO Hanford Observatory.|$|E
5|$|The Uranium Committee was a {{committee}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) that succeeded the Advisory Committee on Uranium and later evolved into the S-1 Section of the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD), when that organization absorbed the NDRC in June 1941, and the S-1 Executive Committee in June 1942. It {{laid the groundwork for}} the Manhattan Project by initiating and coordinating the early research efforts in the United States, and liaising with the Tube Alloys Project in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Canada was an {{alternative}} source of heavy water. Cominco {{had been involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the NRC inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July by a letter from Hugh Taylor, a British-born scientist working at Princeton University, on behalf of the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD). Taylor offered a NDRC contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 per pound.|$|E
5|$|Morgan was {{sometimes}} {{sought to investigate}} public problems on behalf of federal or state governments. She examined the food quality at San Quentin Prison in 1939, and in the 1940s she was the founding chair of the California Nutrition War Committee and served on the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development.</b> In 1960, Morgan {{was a member of}} a committee that looked at the toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture. She co-authored a textbook, Experimental Food Study, with Irene Sanborn Hall, and she wrote detailed histories of the Alpha Nu and Iota Sigma Pi honor societies.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8807, {{creating}} the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD), with Bush as its director personally responsible to the president. The new organisation subsumed the NDRC, now chaired by James B. Conant. The Uranium Committee became the Uranium Section of the OSRD, which was soon renamed the S-1 Section for security reasons. To the S-1 Section, Bush added Samuel K. Allison, Breit, Edward U. Condon, Lloyd P. Smith and Henry D. Smyth; Gunn was dropped {{in line with}} an NDRC policy not to have Army or Navy personnel in the sections. Briggs remained the chairman, with Pegram as the vice chairman.|$|E

5|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium was the {{beginning}} of the US government's effort to develop an atomic bomb, but it did not vigorously pursue the development of a weapon. It was superseded by the National Defense Research Committee in 1940, and then the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> in 1941. The Frischâ€“Peierls memorandum and the British Maud Reports eventually prompted Roosevelt to authorize a full-scale development effort in January 1942. The work of fission research was taken over by the United States Army Corps of Engineers's Manhattan District in June 1942, which directed an all-out bomb development program known as the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|The MAUD Committee reports {{urged the}} {{co-operation}} with the United States should be {{continued in the}} research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once {{he returned to the}} United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|The S-1 Section of the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development,</b> as the Advisory Committee on Uranium was now known, met on 18 December 1941, {{with the}} U.S. now engaged in World War II, making its work urgent. Most {{of the effort}} {{sponsored}} by the Committee had been directed at producing enriched uranium, but Committee member Arthur Compton determined that a feasible alternative was plutonium, which could be mass-produced in nuclear reactors {{by the end of}} 1944. He decided to concentrate the plutonium work at the University of Chicago. Fermi reluctantly moved, and his team became part of the new Metallurgical Laboratory there.|$|E

5|$|This concern {{led to an}} {{independent}} review of the project by the Committee on Civil <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development,</b> which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered {{for the simple reason}} that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.|$|E
5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Smyth was {{involved}} in helping the United States build the atomic bomb. From 1941â€“43 {{he was a member}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)'s Uranium Committee charged with producing fissile material for the bomb. Smyth proposed the electromagnetic methods that were used to enrich the first large U-235 samples for the project. He also oversaw a nuclear fission-related project for the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD). During 1943â€“45 he was a consultant to the Manhattan Project, which built and tested the weapon, and associate director of the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, which contributed to the Manhattan Project. At the Metallurgical Laboratory he headed research on heavy water. He remained chairman of Princeton's physics department throughout the war, and the attendant obligations forced him to participate less actively in the project's later stages.|$|E

50|$|Nodaxâ„¢ PHA {{differs from}} other classes of PHA {{as it is}} tough and ductile, {{cost-competitive}} with petro-plastic, and only starts to biodegrade once integrated into the waste stream. Nodaxâ„¢ PHA can be custom formulated or used to create hybridized biopolymers. Nodaxâ„¢ has a versatile branched structure which resembles linear-low-density polyethylene. Inclusion of Danimer's Nodaxâ„¢ PHA adds functionality to biopolymer formulations with PLA, offered in Danimer <b>Scientific's</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> facilities.|$|R

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft, {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission, briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the London liaison office of the American Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD), raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The S-1 Executive Committee {{superseded}} the Uranium Committee on 19 June 1942, dropping Gunn {{from its}} {{membership in the}} process. It considered Lewis' report, and passed on its recommendation to Vannevar Bush, {{the director of the}} Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD), of which the S-1 Executive Committee was a part. The relationship between the OSRD and the NRL was not good; Bowen criticised it for diverting funds from the NRL. Bush was mindful of a 17 March 1942 directive from the president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, albeit on his advice, that the navy was to be excluded from the Manhattan Project. He preferred to work with the more congenial Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, over whom he had more influence.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from a summer visit to Los Altos, California, Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and polonium, but no details of an assignment. When Rona responded {{that she would be}} interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues, a man identifying himself as Brian O'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project. They proposed buying her method of polonium extraction and gave specific instructions for the type of assistants she might use â€” someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics. Her non-citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of <b>Scientific</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OSRD), to which she gave her methods without compensation. Before the Manhattan Project, polonium had been used only in small samples, but the project proposed to use both polonium and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb. Plutonium plants, based on her specifications for what was needed to process element, were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but Rona was given no details.|$|E
