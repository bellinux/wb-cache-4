25|$|The Open <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI) model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) is a {{conceptual}} model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The {{model is a}} product of the Open <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> project at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of that path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal connection on that layer.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{protocols}} carried by IP, such as ICMP {{which is used}} to transmit diagnostic information, and IGMP {{which is used to}} manage IP Multicast data, are layered on top of IP but perform internetworking functions. This illustrates the differences in the architecture of the TCP/IP stack of the Internet and the OSI model. The TCP/IP model's internet layer corresponds to layer three of the Open <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI) model, where it {{is referred to as the}} network layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} TCP/IP was fueled further in June 1989, when AT agreed {{to place the}} TCP/IP code {{developed}} for UNIX into the public domain. Various vendors, including IBM, included this code in their own TCP/IP stacks. Many companies sold TCP/IP stacks for Windows until Microsoft released a native TCP/IP stack in Windows 95. This event was a little late {{in the evolution of}} the Internet, but it cemented TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols, which began to lose ground. These protocols included IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, Open <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI), and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).|$|E

2500|$|Even {{when the}} layers are examined, the {{assorted}} architectural documents—there {{is no single}} architectural model such as ISO 7498, the Open <b>Systems</b> <b>Interconnection</b> (OSI) model—have fewer and less rigidly defined layers than the OSI model, and thus provide an easier fit for real-world protocols. One frequently referenced document, RFC 1958, does not contain a stack of layers. The lack of emphasis on layering is a major difference between the IETF and OSI approaches. It only refers {{to the existence of}} the internetworking layer and generally to upper layers; this document was intended as a 1996 snapshot of the architecture: [...] "The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan. While this process of evolution {{is one of the main}} reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture." ...|$|E

The Mainland NEA circle covers NEA mainland five countries. The East Sea NEA circle encompasses East Sea four countries. The Large NEA circle incorporates two previous ones. Uncertain conditions, which affect potential PSI, are analyzed in the paper. Based on these conditions three-country and NEA-wide region scenarios for PSI are shaped.
