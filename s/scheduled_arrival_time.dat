40|$|The En Route Descent Advisor (EDA) {{is one of}} the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS) {{decision}} support tools under development at the NASA Ames Research Center.

Using a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates a Matlab Trajectory Synthesizer (TS) simulation, the sensitivities of the EDA predicted trajectory to these data error sources were obtained. The key metric is the meter fix crossing time error since this metric directly measures the performance of EDA. This performance analysis involved a minimum of 200 Monte Carlo trials per error parameter. In addition to the single aircraft performance analysis, the impact of aircraft prediction errors on conflict detection between closely-spaced aircraft was also explored. These Monte Carlo performance analyses determined how robust the EDA advisories are to input parameter uncertainties.

40|$|Skewing {{the clock}} is a well known {{methodology}} that allows to get the timing closure on challenging designs. Due to sub-micron problems today clock skew can be view as a manageable resource rather than a constraint. The methodology presented here is a well known optimisation technique reported in literature as &quot;useful skew&quot;. The three fundamental characteristics of the presented technique are: quickness, minimum impact on the clock tree and the ability work in post Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) and in pre-CTS. The quickness is granted thanks to a linear time complexity algorithm. The minimum impact on the clock tree is granted thanks {{to the fact that}} the algorithm works only where it can be useful, saving area on the design and avoiding excessive clock unbalancing.

40|$|A {{concept for}} aiding air traffic {{controllers}} in efficiently spacing traffic and meeting <b>scheduled</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> at a metering fix was developed and tested in a real time simulation. The automation aid, {{referred to as the}} ground based 4 -D descent advisor (DA), is based on accurate models of aircraft performance and weather conditions. The DA generates suggested clearances, including both top-of-descent-point and speed-profile data, for one or more aircraft in order to achieve specific time or distance separation objectives. The DA algorithm is used by the air traffic controller to resolve conflicts and issue advisories to arrival aircraft. A joint simulation was conducted using a piloted simulator and an advanced concept air traffic control simulation to study the acceptability and accuracy of the DA automation aid from both the pilot's and the air traffic controller's perspectives. The results of the piloted simulation are examined. In the piloted simulation, airline crews executed controller issued descent advisories along standard curved path arrival routes, and were able to achieve an <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> precision of + or - 20 sec at the metering fix. An analysis of errors generated in turns resulted in further enhancements of the algorithm to improve the predictive accuracy.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fundamental design {{and development of}} a new decision-support tool for time-based arrival metering, referred to as the En Route Descent Advisor (EDA). This automation is being developed at NASA Ames Research Center as a component of the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS). EDA computes advisories for the air-traffic controller to help deliver aircraft to an arrival-metering fix in conformance with a scheduled time-of-arrival constraint, while preventing separation conflicts with other aircraft along the arrival trajectory. The CTAS Traffic Management Advisor (TMA), fielded at numerous facilities in the United States under the FAA Free Flight Phase 1 initiative, computes the <b>scheduled</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>times</b> at the metering fix that EDA targets for optimal throughput into the terminal airspace. By computing strategic maneuver advisories based on speed, altitude, and heading to meet <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> {{with a high degree of}} precision, EDA has the potential to significantly extend the capacity, efficiency, and workload benefits already attributed to TMA operations.

40|$|The raison d’etre {{for the air}} {{transportation}} system is the movement of passengers and cargo. Consumer information and regulatory consumer protection for airline services provide measures of the performance using percentage of on-time flights {{and the percentage of}} cancelled flights. Researchers have shown that these “flight-based ” metrics are a poor proxy for measuring passenger trip time performance that includes passenger trip delays accrued by cancelled flights and missed connections. This paper describes a Passenger On-Time Performance metric and an analysis of the performance of the U. S. {{air transportation}} system in 2005 using a “passenger-based” metric. This metric represents the percentage of passengers that arrive within 45 minutes of the <b>schedule</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> and includes delays accrued by passengers due to cancelled flights as well as delayed flights. The analysis shows that in 2005, on the routes between major U. S. airports passengers arrived on-time 90 % of the time. This performance was not uniform across airports or routes. The percentage of passenger on-time arrivals at destination airports ranged from 82 % (EWR) to 94 % (SLC), and from 66 % (EWR toPHL) to 98 % (SLC to TPA) by routes between major U. S. airports.

40|$|The {{operational}} performance of public transport networks {{is an important}} aspect of urban planning and development. Despite the network focus of services and delays which are often focused spatially, little research has examined the spatial pattern of {{operational performance}} of urban public transport. This paper explores the operational performance of on-road public transport using spatial and historical analysis at a network wide level. Operational performance is investigated through analysis of stop level Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data and utilizes visualization techniques in geographical information systems (GISs) to explore spatial and temporal patterns of change. The network in question is the Melbourne tram (streetcar) network, which has a large historical dataset of AVL data since 2001 providing information on <b>scheduled</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>times,</b> actual <b>arrival</b> <b>times,</b> times of departure, and more. Statistical analysis is undertaken to determine average travel times and the standard deviation of travel times. The statistical analysis is then imported into a GIS package for further analysis; the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) methodology is used to explore spatial variations in data. Outputs include observation of travel times across the network, a reliability analysis investigating actual vs. scheduled travel times and coefficients of variation, and trend analyses to observe the change in tram travel time and change in coefficient of variation. Through this analysis, various changes in travel time and reliability were observed between 2001 and 2010. Vast areas saw improvements in travel time and reliability, while some areas were identified to have deteriorated performance. This paper identifies that the spatial representation of large datasets is of great value in an ongoing monitoring of the network and a powerful reporting tool on a network level basis. Moreover, the results identify transit issues for the Melbourne tram network planners for further investigation...|$|R
