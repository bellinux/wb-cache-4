40|$|The {{presence}} and association of fungi with <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> such as coral and sponges {{has been well}} established, yet information {{on the extent of}} diversity of the associated fungi is still in its infancy. Culture – aswell asmetagenomic – and transcriptomic-based analyses have shown that fungal presence in association with these animals can be dynamic and can include “core ” residents as well as shifts in fungal communities. Evidence for detrimental and beneficial interactions between fungi and their marine hosts is accumulating and current challenges include the elucidation of the chemical and cellular crosstalk between fungi and their associates within the holobionts. The ecological function of fungi in association with <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> is complex and is founded on a combination of factors such as fungal origin, host health, environmental conditions and the presence of other resident or invasive microorganisms in the host. Based on evidence from the much more studied terrestrial systems, the evaluation of marine animal– fungal symbioses under varying environmental conditions may well prove to be critical in predicting ecosystem response to global change, including effects on the health of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R
40|$|A central {{problem for}} ecology is to {{understand}} why some biological invasions succeed while others fail. Species interactions frequently are cited anecdotally for establishment failure, but biotic resistance is not well supported by quantitative experimental studies in animal communities. In a 33 -month experiment on Hawai’i Island, exclusion of native and alien forest birds resulted in a 25 - to 80 -fold increase in the density of a single non-indigenous spider species (Theridiidae: Achaearanea cf. riparia). Caged plots held large aggregations of juveniles and more large-bodied individuals, suggesting potential reproductive individuals {{are more susceptible to}} bird predation.

40|$|Thermal {{exposure}} of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> inhabiting estuarine intertidal regions {{is a serious}} concern {{with respect to their}} physiological processes. Organisms living in this region can be exposed to high temperature (> 40 °C) during the low tide, which may affect the survival of these organisms. The Hong Kong oyster, Crassostrea hongkongensis, distributed along the coast waters of the South China Sea, is one of the dominant <b>sessile</b> inhabitants of <b>marine</b> intertidal region which undergoes large seasonal temperature fluctuations (up to 10 – 20 °C during diurnal cycles) every year. To cope with acute thermal stress, it has developed several adaptation mechanisms, e. g., the firmly shut of the shells. However, the genetic basis of these mechanisms remain largely unclear. To better understand how acute thermal exposure affects the biology of the oyster, two cDNA libraries obtained from the gill of oysters exposed to 37 °C thermal stress and ambient temperature were sequenced using the Digital Gene Expression (DGE) tag profiling strategy. In total, 5. 9 and 6. 2 million reads were obtained from thermal stress and control libraries, respectively, with approximately 74. 25 and 75. 02 % of the reads mapping to the Crassostrea hongkongensis reference sequence. A total of 605 differentially expressed transcripts could be detected in the thermal stress group as compared to the control group, of which 378 are up-regulated and 227 are down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that these Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were enriched with a broad spectrum of biological processes and pathways, including those associated with chaperones, antioxidants, immunity, apoptosis and cytoskeletal reorganization. Among these significantly enriched pathways, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum was the most affected metabolic pathway, which {{plays an important role in}} the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) processes.

40|$|Abstract—Ascidians (Phylum Chordata) are <b>sessile,</b> filter feeding <b>marine</b> <b>animals.</b> We have {{developed}} a large-scale oligo DNA microarray of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, and have obtained the expression patterns for 10, 415 genes of C. intestinalis expressed during its life cycle. These were categorized into 49 clusters, which were then grouped into 5 super-clusters. Using these DNA arrays, we identified genes that were up- or down-regulated in ascidians following exposure to organotin compounds, which are recognized marine contaminants. Organotin compounds induced up- or down-regulation of many ascidian genes, most of which belonged to a specific gene cluster or super-cluster, such as the “juvenile-specific gene cluster ” or “embryonic and adult gene super-cluster “ in our classification system. This result suggested that organotin compounds might affect embryogenesis and metamorphosis in ascidians. To verify this possibility, we investigated the inhibitory effects of organotin compounds on embryogenesis and metamorphosis in ascidians and found that low concentrations of organotin compounds completely inhibite...|$|R

Our list adds many Pleistocene records to the 1980 checklist of Sakagami et al. : although only a handful of additional Pleistocene records of bryozoans have been published since 1980, many deposits previously considered to be of Pliocene age have now been more accurately dated as Pleistocene. These include the Setana, Hamada, Hirose, Daishaka, Shibikawa, Sawane, Haizume, and Omma Formations. Our list contains 358 taxa, including 97 new to science described from Pleistocene Japan. Previous studies have been concentrated in four regions of Japan: 1) Boso Peninsula, central Honshu, Pacific side; 2) SW Hokkaido and N Honshu in the vicinity of Tsugaru Strait; 3) Noto Peninsula and Niigata, central Honshu, Sea of Japan; and 4) Kikai-jima Island in the Nansei Archipelago south of Kyushu. We present the number of total taxa and new taxa reported per region and formation, and compare the similarities among regions.

40|$|Biofouling is {{the natural}} {{association}} of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> and plants encrusting submerged hard substrata and steady structures, the biotic composition and succession of which depends on geographic place, type of substratum, physico-chemical characteristics of the seawater and seasonal climatic conditions. In the lagoon of Venice, the climax of this biocoenosis is reached in summer-autumn and is represented by colonial ascidians of the Botryllinae family as dominant species. Macrofouling growing on artificial objects constantly immersed in the seawater causes severe economic damages, which result in continuous maintenance of the structures and high costs due to hydrodynamic loss of the boats also involving a sensitive increase in fuel consumption and atmospheric pollution. Therefore, the study of antifouling compounds from 1970 s {{with the introduction of}} organotin compounds as principal biocides is fundamental for the future of naval engineering with which it parallelly evolved. However, the severe disadvantages for environmental impact of organotins involved a strict international regulation of their employment with the purpose of reaching their total elimination within 2008. As a consequence, from 1990 s, the research of alternative biocides, to be applied as antifoulings in paints for covering immersed objects, remarkably increased aiming to produce new chemical formulations effective on the biofouling and also compatible with the preservation of marine ecosystem. The purpose of our research was to evaluate the effects of some new antifouling paints in commerce, containing Cu 2 O, CuSCN, Sea-Nine 211, Diuron, TCMS pyridine, Zinc pyrithione, Zineb and Endosulfan as principal or booster biocides, on the ecological succession of hard substratum macrofouling employing wooden and steel panels immersed for one year in two stations of the southern Venice lagoon, different for bathymetric and hydrodynamic characteristics. Some biodiversity indexes (species richness, biocoenosis structure, covering-abundance index, similarity index) were used to describe the evolution of biocoenosis. Results, compared with control and TBT-treated panels, enabled us to highlight the disturbing activity of the antifouling paints, that results in the selection of resistant and dominant species, often different to those of the natural climax. We have established an order of biocidal efficacy of the assayed antifouling paints: TCMS pyridine, Diuron, Irgarol 1051 < Cu 2 O, CuSCN, Zn pyrithione, Zineb, Endosulfan, Sea-Nine 211 < TBT. None of the paints assayed is more powerful than that containing TBT and the biocidal efficacy depends on the type of matrix (hard or self-polishing) and the presence of biocidal boosters able to enlarge the toxic effect. In consideration that the wide use of these antifouling paints is accompanied by a continuous leaching of their active substances in the environment, our data evidence the dangerousness of these xenobiotics towards the coastal marine biocoenoses, in particular to fragile ecosystems like the lagoon of Venice and suggest the necessity of a revival of a more careful toxicological study of the paints already in commerce and a research of new antifouling systems which don't use chemical biocides.

40|$|The {{orientation}} and position of hard substrata {{used to test}} ecological hypotheses about <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> plants and <b>animals</b> have often been based on logistical convenience. Much of {{our understanding of the}} ecology of epibiota is based on artificial habitats (particularly the undersides of floating pontoons), despite epibiotic organisms being an important and conspicuous component of natural hard substrata (e. g. vertical surfaces of rocky reefs). We assessed the model that pontoons act as inherently different habitats from rocky reefs, independent of the size, shape, age and composition of the substratum, by comparing the development of epibiota on settlement panels in the 2 habitats. Panels orientated the same way on pontoons and rocky reefs were found to support different epibiotic assemblages, and panels orientated differently (vertical vs horizontal undersides) also supported different assemblages. Position (reef vs pontoon) affected a broader range of taxa than did orientation, although effects of each were generally inconsistent among sites. Covers of spirorbid polychaetes, encrusting bryozoans, mussels, colonial ascidians and red filamentous algae were affected greatly by position. Tubiculous polychaetes, barnacles and species of brown and green filamentous algae were influenced by orientation. This study provides experimental evidence that pontoons are fundamentally different habitats from natural rocky reefs. The results highlight the need for caution in the use and interpretation of studies using artificial habitats when testing hypotheses about naturally occurring assemblages. T. M. Glasby, S. D.

40|$|While the facilitation–competition {{paradigm}} {{under the}} stress-gradient hypothesis has received recent attention, its rigorous testing {{is yet to}} be explored. Most of the studies have considered a switch in the net interactions from competition to facilitation with increasing environmental stress as primary evidence supporting the hypothesis, though few studies examined changes in interaction along a full range of a stress gradient. Here, we have conceptualized possible variations in the patterns of change in interaction strength along such gradient. Based on this, we empirically evaluated the temporal shift in the interaction between two <b>marine</b> <b>sessile</b> <b>animals,</b> goose barnacles (Capitulum mitella) and mussels (Septifer virgatus), under multiple stress factors. The net effect of goose barnacles on mussel survivorship was positively related to the total stress gradient encompassing two stress factors, physical disturbance and thermal stress, while no negative value occurred even under mild conditions. When the two stress factors were treated separately, however, the net effect demonstrated apparently different patterns: monotonic increase with physical disturbance versus a quasi-asymptotic pattern (no change over a wide range) with thermal stress. These variable situations have not previously been recognized in this discipline, and the present study emphasizes the importance of an integrative and mechanistic approach to testing and deciphering the facilitation–competition paradigm...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the origin}} of the <b>animal</b> kingdom, <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> have lived in {{association}} with viruses, prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, often as symbionts.

The number of demonstrated cases of inter-kingdom HGT is currently small, such that it is not yet widely appreciated as a significant player in <b>animal</b> evolution. <b>Sessile</b> <b>marine</b> invertebrates that vertically inherit bacterial symbionts, that have no dedicated germ line, or that bud or excise pluripotent somatic cells during their life history may be particularly receptive to HGT from their symbionts.

40|$|Bryozoans and brachiopods are <b>sessile,</b> mostly <b>marine</b> <b>animals,</b> {{that use}} an elegant crown of tentacles for filter-feeding. They {{are related to}} molluscs, {{segmented}} worms and other animals in a outstandingly diverse group of invertebrates named Spiralia. Most spiralians show a conserved pattern of embryonic development—spiral cleavage—but bryozoans and brachiopods deviate from their relatives. To better understand the developmental diversity and evolution of spiralian development, I examine bryozoan and brachiopod embryogenesis and larval morphology in comparison to other spiralians. Some bryozoans develop through a unique stereotypic cleavage with biradial symmetry, and lack spiral cleavage. Here I describe the first detailed cell lineage of the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea by tracing the fate of embryonic blastomeres from the egg until the larval stage. I further investigate the molecular patterning of the larvae by analysing the expression of conserved developmental genes. Our data reveals several similarities between the fate map and gene expression of M. membranacea and the typical spiral-cleaving embryos, despite {{the loss of the}} spiral symmetry. The cell lineage resemblance might be a direct modification of the spiral cleavage pattern, or alternatively, be an evolutionary convergence that reflects a conserved underlying molecular patterning of the embryos. Adult brachiopods do not have a segmented body, but their larvae have body boundaries that resemble annelid segments. To test whether genes involved in the patterning of segment boundaries also pattern brachiopod larval boundaries, I characterize the expression of the segment polarity genes engrailed, wnt 1 and hedgehog during the development of the brachiopods T. transversa and N. anomala. I found that engrailed is the only gene consistently demarcating the embryonic head/trunk boundary in the larvae of both species. Surprisingly, the gene expression profile at this brachiopod boundary is more similar to a boundary in the vertebrate brain than to segment boundaries. Our data suggests that the ancestral expression of engrailed was nonsegmental in the trunk ectoderm, and might have been independently recruited to the segment boundaries of annelids and arthropods. This work provides basic embryological information, combining cell lineage tracing with morphological and molecular data for two understudied spiralian taxa, bryozoans and brachiopods. These comparative data bring insights to the evolution of two major morphological traits, spiral cleavage and segmentation, and to the evolution of the great diversity of spiralian larval forms. </p...|$|R

This extreme variability complicates standard PCR-based techniques for molecular characterization studies, and consequently only a few complete ascidian mitochondrial genome sequences are available. Using the standard PCR and Sanger sequencing approach, we produced the mitochondrial genome of Ascidiella aspersa only after a great effort. In contrast, we produced five additional mitogenomes (Botrylloides aff. leachii, Halocynthia spinosa, Polycarpa mytiligera, Pyura gangelion, and Rhodosoma turcicum) with a novel strategy, consisting in sequencing the pooled total DNA samples of these five species using one Illumina HiSeq 2000 flow cell lane. Each mitogenome was efficiently assembled in a single contig using de novo transcriptome assembly, as de novo genome assembly generally performed poorly for this task. Each of the new six mitogenomes presents a different and novel gene order, showing that no syntenic block has been conserved at the ordinal level (in Stolidobranchia and in Phlebobranchia). Phylogenetic analyses support the paraphyly of both Ascidiacea and Phlebobranchia, with Thaliacea nested inside Phlebobranchia, although the deepest nodes of the Phlebobranchia-Thaliacea clade are not well resolved. The strategy described here thus provides a cost-effective approach to obtain complete mitogenomes characterized by a highly plastic gene order and a fast nucleotide/amino-acid substitution rate...|$|R
