It had begun just before 3. 15 in the afternoon, on an overcast late autumn Sunday, and by the time that three successive positions of the planet upon the solar disk had been recorded, the Sun had set. Only two men saw the event. One was Jeremiah Horrocks, a 20 -year-old Cambridge graduate living in the small Lancashire village of Much Hoole, some seven miles from Preston. The other was his friend and astronomical corre-spondent William Crabtree, a 29 -year-old cloth merchant of Salford, nearly 30 miles away. Horrocks himself had calculated the likelihood of the transit only a month previously, and while efforts had been made to alert Samuel Foster, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London, along with Horrocks’s brother Jonas, living at the family home in Toxteth, Liverpool, only Horrocks and Crabtree were successful in catching the setting Sun’s last fleet-ing blaze of glory as it passed through a sliver of clear sky between a thick <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and the Lancashire horizon.

40|$|Viewed from space, the {{subtropical}} stratocumulus decks {{appear as}} bright <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> {{anchored to the}} west coasts of continents sweeping toward the deeper tropics.

These characteristics – large areal coverage, low altitude, and high reflectivity – make the subtropical stratocumulus decks conspicuous in the global energy budget (e. g., Ra-manathan et al., 1989). Because of their connection to the energy budget, stratocumulus decks have been the target of many observational campaigns; 20 th Century investigations focused mainly on stratocumulus in the northern hemisphere. The last decade witnessed increased interest in, and relatively sustained observations of, the southeast Pacific stratocumulus deck (n. b., EPIC (Bretherton et al., 2004) and VOCALS-REx (Wood et al., 2011)). Compared to the southeast Pacific, the southeast Atlantic stratocumulus deck has remained obscure. While its existence has long been recognized (e. g., Schubert et al., 1979), including its large extent and seasonality (Hanson, 1991; Klein and Hartmann, 1993), there are limited in situ observations, few satellite-based studies, and a handful of modeling studies.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the distance to dark star-forming clouds is a key parameter to derive the properties <b>of</b> the <b>cloud</b> itself, and <b>of</b> its stellar content. This parameter is still loosely constrained even in nearby star-forming regions. We want to determine the distances to the clouds in the Chamaeleon-Musca complex and to explore the connection between these clouds and the large scale cloud structures in the galaxy. We use the newly estimated distances obtained from the parallaxes measured by the Gaia satellite and included in the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution catalog. When known members of a region are included in this catalog we use their parallaxes to infer {{the distance to the}} cloud. Otherwise, we analyze the dependence of the color excess on the distance of the stars and look for a turn-on of this excess, which is a proxy of the position of the front-edge <b>of</b> the star-forming <b>cloud.</b> We are able to measure the distance to the three Chamaeleon clouds. The distance to Chamaeleon I is 179 pc, 20 pc further away than previously assumed. The Chamaeleon II cloud is located at the distance of 181 pc, which agrees with previous estimates. We are able to measure {{for the first time a}} distance to the Chamaeleon III <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> 199 pc. Finally, the distance <b>of</b> the Musca <b>cloud</b> is smaller than 603 pc. These estimates do not allow us to distinguish between the possibility that the Chamaeleon <b>clouds</b> are part <b>of</b> a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> parallel to the galactic plane, or perpendicular to it.

40|$|How Arctic clouds {{respond and}} {{feedback}} to sea ice loss {{is key to}} understanding of the rapid climate change seen in the polar region. As more open water becomes available in the Arctic Ocean, cold air outbreaks (aka. off-ice flow from polar lows) produce a vast <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> roll <b>clouds</b> in the planetary boundary layer (PBl). The cold air temperature and wind velocity are the critical parameters to determine and understand the PBl structure formed under these roll clouds.

Here we explore a new method with the Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) instrument to measure cloud height and motion over the Arctic Ocean. Employing a stereoscopic-technique, MISR is able to measure cloud top height accurately and distinguish between clouds and snowy/icy surfaces with the measured height.
