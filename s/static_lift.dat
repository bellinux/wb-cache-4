25|$|Worldwide Aeros {{was awarded}} a patent of their control of static {{heaviness}} system (COSH) internal buoyancy management system in May 2015. The COSH system internally ballasts the non-flammable helium into the aircraft’s helium pressure envelopes (HPEs), helping the vehicle manage buoyant lift. The HPE units contain and control the compressed helium and allow the overall helium volume envelope to be reduced or increased, enabling the air vehicle to become heavy or buoyant in a controlled manner. The compression of helium into the HPE’s creates a negative pressure within the Aeroscraft Aeroshell, permitting air-expansion chambers to fill with readily-available environmental ballast (air), which acts in concert with reduced Helium <b>static</b> <b>lift</b> to make the Aeroscraft heavier, when desired, to compensate for adjustments in payload.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Functional {{capacity}} {{tests are}} standardized instruments to evaluate patients' capacities to execute work-related activities. Functional capacity test results {{are associated with}} biopsychosocial factors, making it unclear what is being measured in capacity testing. An overview of these factors was missing. The objective of this review {{was to investigate the}} level of evidence for factors that are associated with functional capacity test results in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed identifying relevant studies from an electronic journal databases search. Candidate studies employed a cross-sectional or RCT design and were published between 1980 and October 2010. The quality of these studies was determined and level of evidence was reported for factors that were associated with capacity results in at least 3 studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. The level of evidence was reported for lifting low, lifting high, carrying, and <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> capacity. Lifting low test results were associated with self-reported disability and specific self-efficacy but not with pain duration. There was conflicting evidence for associations of lifting low with pain intensity, fear of movement/(re) injury, depression, gender and age. Lifting high was associated with gender and specific self-efficacy, but not with pain intensity or age. There is conflicting evidence for the association of lifting high with the factors self-reported disability, pain duration and depression. Carrying was associated with self-reported disability and not with pain intensity and there is conflicting evidence for associations with specific self-efficacy, gender and age. <b>Static</b> <b>lifting</b> was associated with fear of movement/(re) injury. CONCLUSIONS: Much heterogeneity was observed in investigated capacity tests and candidate associated factors. There was some evidence for biological and psychological factors that are or are not associated with capacity results but there is also much conflicting evidence. High level evidence for social factors was absent. PMID: 21516301; doi: 10. 1007 /s 10926 - 011 - 9306 -...|$|R

40|$|Study design : Electromyographic and biomechanical {{methods were}} {{utilized}} to investigate correlations between indexes of localized muscle fatigue {{and changes in}} the kinematics and kinetics of motion during a cyclic lifting task. Summary of background data : Recent advances in time-frequency analysis procedures for electromyographicic signal processing provide a new way of studying localized muscle fatigue during dynamic contractions. These methods provide a means to investigate fatigue-related functional impairments in patients with low back pain. Objectives : To study the relationship between localized muscle fatigue and the biomechanics of lifting and lowering a weighted box. Fatigue-related changes in the electromyographicic signal of trunk and limb muscles were evaluated and compared to kinematic and kinetic measures in order to determine whether lifting strategy is modified with fatigue. Methods : A total of 14 healthy male subjects (26 +/- 5 years) cyclically lifted and lowered a 13 kg box (12 lifts/min) for 4. 5 minutes. A 5 -second <b>static</b> maximum <b>lifting</b> task was included immediately before and after the cyclic lifting task to measure changes in <b>lifting</b> strength and <b>static</b> electromyographicic fatigue indexes. Electromyographic signals from 14 muscle sites (including paravertebral and limb muscles) were measured. Changes in the electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency, a fatigue index, were computed using time-frequency analysis methods. This index was compared with more standardized measures of fatigue, such as those based on electromyographicic median frequency acquired during a static trunk extension test, subjective fatigue measures, and maximal <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> strength. Biomechanical measures were gathered using a motion analysis system to study kinematic and kinetic changes during the lifting task. Results : During the cyclic lifting task, the electromyographic Instantaneous Median Frequency significantly decreased over time in the paravertebral muscles, but not in the limb muscles. Paravertebral electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency changes were consistent with self-reports of fatigue as well as decreases in trunk extension strength. The magnitude of muscle-specific changes in electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency was not significantly correlated with electromyographicic median frequency changes from the static trunk extension task. The load of the box relative to the maximal <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> strength significantly affected the electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency changes of paravertebral back muscles. Significant changes with fatigue during the task were found in the angular displacements at the knee, hip, trunk, and elbow. These biomechanical changes were associated with increased peak torque and forces at the L 4 -L 5 vertebral segment. Conclusions : Our results demonstrate correlation between localized muscle fatigue and biomechanical adaptations that occur during a cyclic lifting task. This new technique may provide researchers and clinicians with a means to investigate fatigue-related effects of repetitive work tasks or assessment procedures that might be useful in improving education, lifting ergonomy, and back school programs. Although both the dynamic and static tasks resulted in spectral shifts in the electromyographicic data, the fact that these methods led to different muscle-specific findings indicates that they should not be considered as equivalent assessment procedures. </br...|$|R
40|$|Slipforming is a {{construction}} method {{that has been}} used in several decades for production of concrete structures. It is a wide range of different structures that are slipformed, but typical are vertical structures such as towers, bridge columns and offshore platforms. Slipforming are not only used for straight vertical concrete structures, but also on structures where the geometry of the structure and the wall thickness is changed. Slipforming is normally a continuous working operation (24 hours a day), which require a well-planned supply of materials. Problems that occur during this process needs to be solved instantly. Slipforming is a rather complicated operation compared to other construction techniques. The requirements to the materials, personnel and the execution of the work are therefore accordingly higher. Slipforming of concrete structures has in most cases been carried out successfully with no or only minor supplementary work. However, in some cases, surface damages have occurred during slipforming. Typical surface damages are lifting cracks and vertical lined damages caused by lumps formed on the slipform panel. These problems have during recent years caused discussion and partly also scepticism to slipforming as a reliable construction technique. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended in Publication 77 that some concrete structures should not be slipformed depending on the environmental impact at the location, geometric degree of difficulties of the concrete structure and the type of concrete. Also in other countries there are scepticism to slipforming as {{a construction}} technique. The prime objective of the research program is to improve the understanding of the slipform technique as a construction method in order to ensure high quality concrete structures. The objective is to identify the parameters affecting the net lifting stress (friction) that occur during lifting of the slipform panel. Focus is given to the importance of the concrete properties that will influence the forces that occur between the slipform panel and the concrete. Also any connection between the friction level and the surface damages is investigated. Based on the result {{it should be possible to}} define requirements for materials, mix composition and method of execution to ensure that the specified quality in the structure is obtained. The lifting stress can be divided in <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress and sliding lifting stress, where the <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress represents the friction that has to be overcome in order to start sliding and the sliding lifting stress is the minimum friction that occurs during sliding. The difference between the <b>static</b> and sliding <b>lifting</b> stress is caused by the decreasing effective pressure during lifting at the sliding zone and the adhesion that occurs because of no movement of the slipform panel between two <b>lifts.</b> Both <b>static</b> and sliding <b>lifting</b> stress are closely related, but the <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress can be extremely large compared to the sliding lifting stress. The friction law can be used to describe the correlation between the net lifting stress and the effective pressure. This correlation is almost linear and applicable for both the net <b>static</b> and sliding <b>lifting</b> stress. The effective pressure, which represents the pressure between the solid particles and the slipform panel, is the difference between the normal pressure (concrete pressure against the slipform panel) and the pore water pressure. It is primarily the pressure in the pore water that is responsible for most of the variation in the effective pressure during the plastic phase and the transition period, which means that it is mainly the variation in the pore water pressure that controls the level of the lifting stress. The pore water pressure is decreasing slightly in early phase because of the settlement in the concrete. During the elastic phase, the pore water pressure start to decrease faster as an effect of the chemical shrinkage that occurs because of the cement reaction. The pore water pressure development can be characterised by the decrease rate of the pore water pressure and the minimum pore water pressure. The minimum pore water pressure is defined as the pore water pressure at the time of maximum lifting stress. The minimum pore water pressure occurs just before the pressure is increasing at the sliding zone close to the slipform panel. It is primarily the level of the minimum pore water pressure that will decide the maximum level of the <b>static</b> and sliding <b>lifting</b> stress. The pore water pressure decrease rate and the minimum pore water pressure depends on the particle concentration and particle size distribution for the finer particles and also the air content in the concrete. Higher particle concentration and finer particle size distribution will both result in a faster pore water pressure decrease rate and a lower minimum pore water pressure. A higher air content will reduce the effect from the chemical shrinkage because the existing air volume will act as a pressure release volume, resulting in a lower pore water pressure decrease rate and a higher minimum pore water pressure. Also the compaction method will have an impact on the decrease rate of the pore water pressure and the minimum pore water pressure, because the air content will be reduced with prolonged vibration time. Prolonged vibration will in general result in a higher lifting stress, depending on the response on the concrete during vibration. When lightweight aggregate is used in the concrete, the entrapped air in the lightweight aggregate will increase the pore water pressure and result in a lower lifting stress. Porous lightweight aggregate will have larger impact on the pore water pressure than denser lightweight aggregate. Pressure gradients that occur between two concrete layers will affect the decrease rate of the pore water pressure. Water will “flow” from layers with younger concrete without any negative pressure to concrete layers with lower pore water pressure. This will reduce the decrease rate in the concrete layer that receives the water. In later stage the same concrete that supplied the concrete layer below with water will receive water from the concrete layer above. The pressure gradient at the joint (between two concrete layers) will be more even as a result of the water communications between the concrete layers. Evaporation of water from a fresh concrete surface will result in a faster decrease rate and a lower minimum pore water pressure because of the drying process will form menisci near the surface. The water communication is in general good in the concrete in this phase. The time at which the minimum pore water pressure occurs will also have an impact on the minimum pressure level. A shorter period of time from the minimum pore water pressure occur to the time of initial set will result in a relatively higher minimum pore water pressure and a lower lifting stress. The minimum pore water pressure has occurred earlier when water has evaporated from an exposed concrete surface. Also when very rough slipform panel is used, the incipient vacuum between the slipform panel and the concrete is punctured early (collapse of the capillary system at the sliding zone) because of the rough panel surface and will result in a relative low lifting stress. Both the lifting frequency and the lifting height has a considerable effect on the <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress. Lower lifting height or decreased lifting frequency will both result in a lower pore water pressure and a higher <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress. This is probably because the interface zone is disturbed each time the slipform panel is lifted. Less disturbance of the interface will result in a lower minimum pore water pressure. The lifting stress is decreasing during lifting as an effect of the decreasing effective pressure at the sliding zone and the reduced adhesion. The effective pressure at the sliding zone is probably at minimum and the adhesion is completely broken when the lifting stress is stabilized on a minimum level. The sliding lifting stress is also affected of the lifting frequency and the lifting height if not the minimum level is reached during the lift. Surface damages caused by high lifting stress are not demonstrated in the vertical slipform rig. However, similar concrete mix design {{that has been used}} in a field project, where surface damages occurred, has been tested in the vertical slipform rig. The concrete mix in this field project was replaced with a new concrete mix, where no or only minor surface damages occurred after the replacement. Both concrete mixes is tested in the vertical slipform rig and the result show a considerable higher <b>static</b> and sliding <b>lifting</b> stress for the concrete mix that was used when surface damages occurred. This indicates that there are a connection between high lifting stress and risk for surface damages. This means also that concrete mixes that obtains high lifting stress in the vertical slipform rig is more exposed to surface damages than concrete mixes that has obtained lower lifting stress. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Lower back {{problems}} {{are a common}} cause of sick leave of employees in Dutch care homes and hospitals. In the Netherlands over 40 % of reported sick leave is due to {{back problems}}, mainly caused by carrying out heavy work. The goal of the iLift project {{was to develop a}} game for nursing personnel to train them in lifting and transfer techniques. The main focus was not on testing for the effectiveness of the game itself, but rather on the design of the game as an autogenous trigger and its place in a behavioral change support system. In this article, the design and development of such a health behavior change support system is addressed, describing cycles of design and evaluation. Methods: (a) To define the problem space, use context and user context, focus group interviews were conducted with Occupational Therapists (n = 4), Nurses (n = 10) and Caregivers (n = 12) and a thematic analysis was performed. We interviewed experts (n = 5) on the subject of lifting and transferring techniques. (b) A design science research approach resulted in a playable prototype. An expert panel conducted analysis of video-recorded playing activities. (c) Field experiment: We performed a dynamic analysis in order to investigate the feasibility of the prototype through biometric data from player sessions (n = 620) by healthcare professionals (n = 37). Results: (a) Occupational Therapists, Nurses and Caregivers did not recognise a lack of knowledge with training in lifting and transferring techniques. All groups considered their workload, time pressure and a culturally determined habit to place the patient's well being above their own as the main reason not to apply appropriate lifting and transferring techniques. This led to a shift in focus from a serious game teaching lifting and transferring techniques to a health behavior change support system containing a game with the intention to influence behavior. (b) Building and testing (subcomponents of) the prototype resulted in design choices regarding players perspective, auditory and visual feedback, overall playability and perceived immersiveness. This design process also addressed the behavior shaping capacities of the game and its place within the health behavior change support system. An expert panel on lifting and transferring techniques validated the provoked in-game activities as being authentic. (c) Regression analysis showed an increase of the game score and dashboard score when more sessions were played, indicating an in-game training effect. A post-hoc test revealed that from an average of 10 playing sessions or more, the dashboard score and the game score align, which indicates behavioral change towards executing appropriate <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> and transferring techniques. Conclusions: Data gathered in the final field test shows an in-game training effect, causing players to exhibit correct techniques for <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> and transferring techniques but also revealed the necessity for future social system development and especially regarding intervention acceptance. Social system factors showed a strong impact on the games persuasive capacities and its autogenous intent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The largest MIVC was for the semi-squat lift and was the least was for the arm lift (p< 0. 001). The MIVC of the stoop lift was larger than that of the arm lift (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The largest MIVC for the semi-squat lift suggests that this style is useful for lifting objects from the floor. The differences in biomechanical and muscle pattern activity changes could explain these results. It seems that activation of the quadriceps muscles in the semi-squat lift was a main factor for producing more MIVC, so when this style is recommended for lifting, attention to the power of the quadriceps is important...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of ablation on the aerodynamic {{characteristics of a}} blunted slender cone was investigated. Plastic models were launched in free flight at ablating conditions. The results were compared with results of similar tests using metal nonablating models. Ablation was found to decrease the dynamic stability and the drag, but {{had little effect on}} <b>static</b> stability and <b>lift.</b> The plastic models appeared to experience ablation-induced roll...|$|R
40|$|The forces {{acting on}} an airship {{moving in a}} certain field of flow and the {{resulting}} path of motion {{are the result of}} numerous aerodynamic factors. These factors are principally skin friction drag, form drag, induced drag, aerodynamic transverse force distribution, lateral and longitudinal inertial and <b>static</b> force distribution, <b>lift,</b> and moments arising from all above factors. With the exception of aerodynamic transverse force distribution, lift, and induced drag, these factors are either small or may be determined by methods now available...|$|R
