Because of its vertically integrated and domestic manufacturing model, American Apparel's gross margins are actually significantly higher than other basic apparel brands. By utilizing a vertically integrated business model (based on speed-to market), Charney was able to focus merchandise for year round styles, minimizing risk and providing consistent operating results. According to the company, its blended margins are roughly 70% (while GAP averages about 30% and luxury brands like Prada are between 65 and 70%). American Apparel controlled {{a significant portion of the}} value chain to ensure quality, speed to market, and a consistent brand positioning.

5000|$|Michell {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} Trinity in 1890, but {{returned}} to Melbourne later the same year, and was appointed lecturer in mathematics at Melbourne University. He held this position for over 30 years. His academic work occupied {{so much of his}} time that it was difficult to do original research. The first of his papers, [...] "On the theory of free streamlines", which appeared in Transactions of the Royal Society in 1890, had drawn attention to his ability as a mathematician, and during the following 12 years about 15 papers were contributed to English mathematical journals. It was recognized that these were important contributions to the knowledge of hydrodynamics and elasticity, and in June 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), London. The number of his students at the University steadily increased, but there was no corresponding <b>staff</b> <b>increase</b> for a long while. Michell continued his research work but none of it was published. In 1923 he became professor of mathematics and, obtaining some increase of staff, established practice-classes and tutorials, thus considerably improving the efficiency of his department. Michell resigned the chair at the end of 1928 and was given the title of honorary research professor. He died after a short illness on 3 February 1940 at Camberwell. Michell did not marry. Michell published The Elements of Mathematical Analysis (1937), a substantial work in two volumes written in collaboration with Maurice Belz.|$|E

This paper sheds some complementary empirical light to this question by assessing links between innovation and training. It uses an original set of panel data about training inside firms matched with the « Changements Organisationnels et Informatisation » survey. Results confirm past papers: there is no clear evidence that firms which adopt technological change increase training more than non innovative firms. At the very most, this effect is weak and only at short term. On the other hand, firms which adopt quality norms or delegate more responsibility to lower level <b>staff</b> <b>increase</b> training but this effect is only significant in the long-term. That confirms the idea that organizational change is more skill-biased than technological change. Classification JEL : J 24, O 30. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High rate of {{turnover}} is one {{of major}} problems relevant to human resource management in private sector universities in Pakistan. It is on one hand, depriving the universities from talented and qualified labour force, {{and on the other}} hand, affecting the education standard of these universities. The present study was carried out to explore the inter­ relationship among the job satisfaction and turnover intentions and factors affecting them. Primary data was used for this purpose. The data was collected from a sample 150 employees of private sector universities of Peshawar. In the results, Job satisfaction and promotion opportunities appeared as significant factor affecting turnover intentions. It is recommended for the private sector universities on the basis of results of the study to give competitive salaries to the <b>staff,</b> <b>increase</b> promotion opportunities, improve leave policy, financial rewards, and make the system transparent and justified.

40|$|High {{rates of}} teacher {{turnover}} strain school districts ’ limited financial resources and are disruptive to program continuity and staff cohesion. Studies indicate {{that as many}} as 20 percent of teachers nationwide leave the profession after three years and close to 30 percent leave after five years. This report examines the reasons why teachers transfer or leave the profession at such high rates and where they go when they move or leave. The characteristics of teachers who move or leave and the types of schools they are most likely to leave are reviewed. Findings on the impact of working conditions and financial compensation on turnover rates, as well as policy recommendations for reducing teacher turnover, are also included. Finally, teacher retention in Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS), the district’s beginning teacher induction program, and financial incentives offered to M-DCPS teachers are summarized. High rates of teacher turnover limit schools ’ ability to create productive learning environments and are disruptive to program continuity and staff cohesion.

40|$|Quality {{design and}} {{appropriate}} space organization in preschool settings can support preschool children's educational activities. Although {{the relationship between}} the well-being and development of children and physical settings has been emphasized by many early childhood researchers, there is still a need for theoretical design guidelines that are geared towards the improvement of this issue. This research focuses on High/Scope education and aims to shape a theoretical guideline that raises teachers' awareness about the potential of learning spaces and guides them {{to improve the quality of}} the physical spaces. To create a theoretical framework, reliable sources are investigated in the light of High/Scope education and the requirements of pre-school children educational spaces. Physical space characteristics, the preschool child's requirements and High/Scope methodology identified design inputs, design considerations and recommendations that shape the final guideline for spatial arrangement in a High/Scope setting are integrated. Discussions and suggestions in this research benefit both designers and High/ Scope teaching staff. Results help High/Scope teaching <b>staff</b> <b>increase</b> the quality of a space in an educational setting without having an architectural background.

40|$|Corporate {{growth is}} understandably {{one of the}} hottest topics among {{researchers}} in management and managers themselves. Nonetheless, research in the sector of professional service firms, especially engineering consulting firms, has not yet led to a deeper understanding of how growth in this particular sector is achieved. This descriptive empirical study tries to provide some answers by reviewing the endeavours of the largest engineering consulting firms in Europe (top 100) within the timeframe 1990 - 1998. The findings suggest that the firms surveyed grew on average about 120 % in terms of <b>staff</b> <b>increase</b> and about 170 % in terms of revenue increase. This growth was largely achieved organically: growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) also contributed quite strongly whereas engaging in joint ventures played only a minor role. The same pattern emerged when analyzing the success of the different modes of growth, with organic growth being the most successful, followed by growth through M&As and joint ventures. Further, it could be shown that the firms' growth was strongly influenced by a focus on firm size, followed by a focus on market share and on profit, while focus on the firm's value was less significant.
