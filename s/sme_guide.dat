40|$|This paper {{provides}} an interpretive account of contextual {{factors that affect}} the progression of e-commerce in six Small and Medium Enterprises(SMEs) in a developing country context of Botswana. The methodology followed multiple in-depth case studies, using semi-structured face-to-face interviews, website analysis, observation and document analysis. Results show that contextual factors peculiar to each SME provide better explanations on how SMEs progress in e-commerce adoption. At {{the high level of}} adoption, managerial innovativeness {{and the nature of the}} external e-commerce market has contributed to success in two SMEs, whereas the local business environment in combination with some organisational factors can explain the low-level and non-adoption in the other four SMEs. Future implications indicate that managers need to pay particular detail to the unique and idiosyncratic nature of <b>SMEs</b> in <b>guiding</b> decisions for e-commerce adoption in their firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Enterprise 2. 0 {{relates to the}} use of Web 2. 0 {{technologies}} such as blogs, social networks or wikis, in enterprises and it has been at the centre of several debates among the business community. Controversy aside, many enterprises have already openly adopted and supported the implementation of Web 2. 0 technologies. This growing interest in the Social Web as a business resource has captured the attention of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This paper focuses on the adoption of Enterprise 2. 0 ´s practices inside SMEs and uses the Portuguese case as an illustration of the current scenario. It examines the implementation of Web 2. 0 tools inside Portuguese elite <b>SMEs</b> and provides <b>guiding</b> principles for the general proficiency of SME 2. 0...|$|R
40|$|Small- and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) typically face resource and capability constraints that inhibit their innovation activities. One way SMEs can overcome these constraints is by complementing internal resources and capabilities with external knowledge, {{referred to as}} open innovation. With the proliferation of the Internet, SMEs have added social media to their traditional marketing activities. However, they rarely embrace the analytical capabilities of social media for innovation. Hence, we propose the semantic learning-based innovation framework (SLBIF) to <b>guide</b> <b>SMEs</b> in using the analytical capabilities of social media to innovate their products or services. Our framework includes three consecutive stages innovators should follow —idea selection, idea refinement, and idea diffusion—and which explain how to analyze customer preferences through semantic analysis of customer posts and identify lead users and opinion leaders using user-directed social network analysis...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea for}} The New Fly Fisher was first {{conceived}} by Colin McKeown in 1999. During the 1990s when Colin {{was attempting to}} learn how to fly fish, he was frustrated with the poor quality of information provided by popular television fishing shows. Most series were focused on promoting products and show hosts. He felt many were nothing but glorified “infomercials”. At the time, Colin was an officer in the Royal Canadian Navy and was getting ready to retire. Creating a quality fly fishing show that taught people about fly fishing, biology, destinations and much more seemed like a great concept. Of importance, Colin wanted to create a series that was of top quality in every aspect of production. To achieve this Colin attended several college courses that taught him about television production and producing. In May 2000, Colin pitched the concept of his fly fishing series to the VP of Programming at the Outdoor Life Network in Canada. It was accepted in late June and principal photography of the first 13 episodes commenced in July. First broadcast was slated for March 2001. Throughout the past fifteen years the concept has remained essentially the same. To provide viewers with a television series that teaches by bringing on every episode subject matter experts that taught the hosts methods of fly fishing for differing species in locations throughout North America. Whether the <b>SME’s</b> are <b>guides,</b> authors or fly fishing celebrities - all help the series hosts learn. Hence the series name, The New Fly Fisher. The New Fly Fisher Inc. is owned by JenCor Entertainment Inc. the principle production company created by Colin McKeown.|$|R
40|$|E-commerce {{has been}} one of the most recent {{technologies}} that have been in existence in Abuja city, Nigeria. It promises a radical shift in which buyers and sellers trade with one another. However, the Adoption of e-commerce has left businesses in Abuja city with a choice to either adopt or not to adopt. In regards to the study undertaken, businesses that have adopted e-commerce have decided to continue in this form because e-commerce has been a part of their business growth while businesses that have not adopted e-commerce have decided that in order to boost their business growth, it will be necessary to adopt e-commerce, as it has not been very useful. To meet this need, this research makes a comparison between adopters and non-adopters in order to develop an effective decision model that will <b>guide</b> <b>SMEs</b> on the adoption of e-commerce using TPB, TRA and TAM.

40|$|M. Tech. Business Information SystemsBusiness {{innovation}} {{driven by}} technology is {{widely seen as}} a key driver to transform enterprises and in particular, the development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Any organization eager to improve competitiveness, retain sustainability and cost effectively will require new and better technologies with great capabilities. However not all organizations are ready to adopt these innovative technologies, largely because new and rapidly changing technologies come with new and unique challenges. The emergence of cloud computing paradigm {{in recent years is}} rapidly gaining momentum {{as an alternative to the}} traditional approach to provide or consume Information Technology (IT) services and resources. It is a significant trend with the potential to increase agility and lower costs of IT. Although, embracing this paradigm promises several benefits to an organization, an effective adoption and implementation of cloud computing in an organization requires these organizations to understand different factors. Current literature have shown that there are inadequate guidelines to <b>guide</b> <b>SMEs</b> in developing economies to determine a company's degree of readiness to adopt technological innovations such as cloud computing to transform the operations of the organisation.

40|$|The Saudi {{ministry}} of health reported that government health care spending doubled from 2008 to 2011. To address increased demand, the government encouraged small to medium enterprise (SME) growth. However, SME leaders could not leverage technology as a growth enabler because they lacked strategies to address operating inefficiencies associated with technology. Only 50 % of hospitals fully implemented information technology. The purpose of this phenomenological {{study was to explore}} lived experiences of SME leaders on strategies needed to accelerate technology implementation. This exploration drew on a conceptual framework developed from Wainwright and Waringâ??s framework addressing issues of technology adoption. Data were collected from semistructured interviews of 20 SME leaders in Saudi Arabia. A modified van Kaam method was used to analyze participantsâ?? interview transcripts in search of common themes. The main themes were strategies to address human resources, clinical teams, funding, and organizational and leadership alignment to accelerate the diffusion of technology. Findings indicated that insurance companies influence SME operations, growth, and survival. Analysis of findings revealed the need for change in management, training, implementation follow up, and staff retention to accelerate technology implementation. Application of findings has the potential to promote positive social change in <b>guiding</b> <b>SME</b> leaders to be change agents and enabling them to create a reliable, sustainable health care delivery system...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} cloud {{technology}} involving low subscription overheads cost has provided {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) with the opportunity to adopt new cloud-based corporate-wide systems (i. e., cloud ERP). This technology, operating through subscription-based services, has now provided SMEs with a complete range of IT applications that were once restricted to large organisations. As anecdotal evidences suggest, SMEs are increasingly adopting cloud-based ERP software. The selection of an ERP is a complex process involving multiple stages and stakeholders, suggesting the importance of closer examination of cloud ERP adoption in SMEs. Yet, prior studies have predominantly treated technology adoption as a single activity and largely ignored the issue of ERP adoption in SMEs. Understanding of the process nature of the adoption and the factors that are important in each stage of the adoption potentially may result in <b>guiding</b> <b>SMEs</b> to make well-informed decisions throughout the ERP selection process. Thus, our study proposes that the adoption of cloud ERP should be examined as a multi-stage process. Using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and Ettlie’s adoption stages, as well as employing data gathered from 162 owners of SMEs, our findings show that the factors that influence the intention to adopt cloud ERP vary significantly across adoptive stages...|$|R
40|$|SMEs are {{critical}} to economic development within the South African economy by contributing considerably to the national GDP and private sector employment. However {{they are unable to}} overcome the primary obstacle of access to funding, which translates into an inability to attain the necessary physical, human and consulting resources. Private equity and the venture capital sector has been critical in providing this necessary funding to support SME creation and growth in developed countries, but has been under-represented in South Africa. This is set to change by an amendment to Regulation 28 which allows pension funds to legally allocate a portion of the fund to private equity investments. SMEs currently lack an understanding of the business value curve utilized by financiers to gauge the risk-reward characteristics of an investment. SME strategies need to convey how the business model will isolate imitators as well as bridge misfits between their current resources and future requirements in order to deliver on the strategic intent. This paper utilizes a Systems Engineering approach through functional analysis to develop a framework that <b>guides</b> <b>SMEs</b> through detailed processes in order to develop a strategy aligned with investor requirements. The framework addresses the shortcomings of current strategic frameworks by taking into account the specific characteristics of SMEs and not being biased towards a specific industry or sector...|$|R

40|$|Small and Medium size Enterprises (SME) are {{considered}} as a backbone of many developing and developed economies of the world; they are the driving force to any major economy across the globe. Through Cloud Computing firms outsource their entire information technology (IT) process while concentrating more on their core business. It allows businesses to cut down heavy cost incurred over IT infrastructure without losing focus on customer needs. However, Cloud industry to an extent has struggled to grow among SMEs due to the reluctance and concerns expressed by them. Throughout {{the course of this}} study several interviews were conducted and the literature was reviewed to understand how cloud providers offer services and what challenges SMEs are facing. The study identified issues like cloud knowledge, interoperability, security and contractual concerns to be hindering SMEs adoption of cloud services. From the interviews common practices followed by cloud vendors and what concerns SMEs have were identified as a basis for a cloud framework which will bridge gaps between cloud vendors and SMEs. A stepwise framework for cloud adoption is formulated which identifies and provides recommendation to four most predominant challenges which are hurting cloud industry and taking SMEs away from cloud computing, as well as <b>guide</b> <b>SMEs</b> aiding in successful cloud adoption.

40|$|Purpose – Lean {{business}} ideology {{has been}} one of the recent dominant research areas in operations management. However, there is a dearth of research focusing on Lean in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by systematically reviewing the literature in relation to the implementation of Lean in SMEs. Design/methodology/approach – Tranfield et al. ’s (2003) systematic review methodology was employed covering three stages: planning, conducting and reporting/dissemination. Findings – A descriptive analysis of the papers reviewed is provided. From the thematic analysis of the literature four main themes are identified: the scope/type of Lean being adopted by SMEs, how Lean is used in SMEs, the impact of Lean implementation on SMEs and the critical success factors for Lean implementation in SMEs. Key inhibitors and enablers related to firm size when implementing Lean are also identified in the concluding discussion. Research limitations/implications – Nine recommendations for future research are developed associated with Lean implementation in SMEs. Practical implications – The authors suggest SMEs to integrate organisational factors such as employee empowerment and the development of a supportive strategy into their Lean implementation plans. A preliminary “Staircase Road Map” to <b>guide</b> <b>SMEs</b> in implementing Lean is also developed. Originality/value – This paper goes beyond previous literature reviews of Lean by systematically and critically evaluating key themes of Lean implementation within an SME environment.

It develops a framework or methodology for selection. It also highlights the areas pertaining to the unique needs of, first, the SME sector and, second, the MTO sector, to be considered while selecting a solution. A work book is developed to provide a structured ERP software selection process for SMEs using a comprehensive literature review plus practical experience. This research is potentially aimed at being useful to other <b>SMEs</b> as a <b>guide</b> for a structured selection process. Design/methodology/approach – A combination of comprehensive literature review and experience of managing the selection process for an ERP system in an SME was employed for the study. Findings – Over the past few years, the number of large companies buying new ERP systems has reached saturation point. This has led to the ERP developers seeking instead other potential markets among SMEs. The MTO scenario within the SME sector is one which is very capricious in terms of demand forecasting, lead times, routings, etc. When selecting a system, an organisation in such a segment needs a tailored methodology and a list of key target areas to consider. Practical implications – The paper represents a very useful source of practical information for the SME sector to consider when selecting an ERP system. Originality/value – The paper provides valuable insight into the details of ERP selection, focusing on the peculiarities of the SME MTO sector...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{marketing}} of software products and services in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Due {{to the nature of}} software products' intangibility and the high failure rate of small high tech organisations, the study incorporates the concept of Relationship Marketing (RM) and Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC). These concepts are especially pertinent to organisations within highly competitive and innovative markets as they attempt to build market share by delivering fast, high quality and innovative solutions. The methodology combines qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative methods include two case studies of SMEs in the Welsh software industry and in-depth interviews with their customers and employees. The researcher was also able to employ participant observation of the marketing activities and development of relationships within the SMEs. Content analysis and text mining analysis was conducted on the in-depth interviews to establish customer perceptions of the dyadic relationships and customers' general expectations of software organisations. Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) was subsequently employed as a quantitative method to investigate the trade-offs organisations make when making software purchase decisions. The findings indicate that development of long-term relationships with customers is valuable within the software industry, and such long lasting relationship has to have roots in important attributes especially `Software Quality', 'Understanding of customer requirements' and `Professionalism' of the software supplier. The importance of service quality as well as product quality is evident in the ACA findings and the constructs are presented in a model, which can be used by high tech <b>SMEs</b> as a <b>guide</b> to managing customer expectations and improving their Relationship Marketing activities. Important facets of high tech marketing are also included in the model as critical success factors for SMEs in the software industry. These factors include forming alliances, and developing Integrated Marketing Communications as a tool supporting RM...|$|R

Having these contextual matters in mind, {{the authors of this}} thesis identify the beneficial aspects that are related to Diasporas' inclusion into the process of internationali-zation. In broad outline, this thesis is about the competitive advantage achieved by a firm which employs foreigners to work with the process of business expansion to foreigners' countries of origin. This competitive advantage is proved to manifest itself through the knowledge and competences embedded in those employed foreigners. The purpose of this thesis is to answer 'in what ways can Swedish SMEs benefit from Di-asporas' inclusion into the process of internationalization?' and thus fill the theoretical gap in the existent studies. In order to address the purpose of the research, a theoretical model which merges the research field of internationalization and Diaspora studies, considered {{the conditions}} of new economy, was constructed. With the help of this model, the role of Diasporas in the process of internationalization has been explored and explained. For the empirical study, the qualitative method was applied and semi-structured interviews were conducted in five different Swedish <b>SMEs.</b> The interview <b>guide,</b> which was based on the theoretical model and on the main research objectives, was used when conducting in-terviews with a number of management positions fulfilling participants, as well as Diaspora. The results of an empirical study showed that Diasporas can be efficiently used for compa-ny's expansion strategies and significantly benefit due to several reasons. First of all, fo-reigners, or Diasporas, can be considered as holding relevant knowledge base in regards to their home countries, such as language, culture, personal contacts, etc. At the same time, while staying in Sweden, they get to familiarize with the Swedish culture, social structures, and business opportunities, and establish diversified contacts. With regards to international business expansion, this knowledge of two-fold nature is proved to be highly valuable...|$|R

Furthermore, the lack of adequate understanding and tools for the management of intellectual property (IP) was identified as a major inhibitor of open-innovation practices, to which actors should pay specific attention. In this article, we present results and recommendations from a field study focused on two groups of actors: i) companies involved in collaborative innovation and ii) intermediary agents enabling innovation and technology transfer. Our first goal was to shed some light on factors that facilitate open innovation through improved university-enterprise collaborations and, more importantly, that attempt to overcome the irritants related to IP management. Our second goal was to analyze the roles of diverse intermediaries in the fostering of successful collaborations between universities and SMEs. Our study yielded three findings: i) SMEs do not care about understanding and improving their capabilities about IP and are not equipped with adequate tools and best practices for managing IP and for managing the overall collaborative mechanisms in general; ii) this gap in preparation for open innovation is persistent, since even the intermediaries, whose role is to <b>guide</b> <b>SMEs</b> in university-enterprise collaborations, suffer themselves from the lack of appropriate IP transfer and sharing tools, and do not perceive the need to offer better support in this regard; and iii) overall, current IP-transfer and collaboration-management tools are not sophisticated enough to provide appropriate support for the implementation of open innovation, by which we mean more open and collaborative innovation in the context of university-enterprise collaborations...|$|R
40|$|M. Phil. The {{issue of}} Customer Relationship Management (CRM) within organisations has gained {{importance}} {{over the last}} five years, and the trend is set to continue with new CRM software vendors entering the market regularly. For a business, it is cheaper to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, therefore increased customer loyalty and interaction is important. The value that electronic CRM (eCRM) allows is that it increases customer interaction, by eliminating physical intervention and subsequent errors. The Internet has allowed this interaction to become more sophisticated, with service information instantly available to both the customer and the business. The number of channels for interaction has also increased. Specifically, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) need low cost eCRM solutions that adapt to their business models and IT structures. The South African SME is limited by certain budgeting, resource and time constraints, and the owner of the SME cannot always devote time in search of a suitable eCRM solution for his business. The multitudes of vendors, offering various levels of functionality with increased focus on the SME sector, allow the SME many choices. However, companies selecting eCRM software vendors often lack an objective basis {{due to a lack of}} alternative information sources. Vendors making unsubstantiated and incorrect claims about the functionality of their software, further complicate the problem. From an SME point of view, the functionality and cost criteria of the eCRM solution is the most important. However, the minimum functionality criteria that vendors’ software packages must adhere to, in order to be considered an eCRM suite are: Customer Analysis; Marketing Automation; Sales Automation; Customer Service and Support; and Web-centricity. The research problem lies therein that South African SME owners or managers are unsure which functionalities are available, and which to deem important when considering eCRM solutions for their businesses. The objective of this study is to formulate a matrix of functionality that eCRM solutions must adhere to in order to be successfully implemented by the SME. This matrix is not prescriptive, but will <b>guide</b> <b>SME</b> management by identifying criteria and functionality that the solution needs to contain. The aim is to help SMEs select the right software, not to select the software for them...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation (M Techy(Information Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 The {{importance}} of e-commerce for SMEs {{has been well}} established. However, it remains an area of strategic concern amongst organisations across all industries. Furthermore, there is distinct lack of strategic planning {{in the majority of}} SMEs. Performance measurement has been identified as an important mechanism for making strategic decisions and {{it has been suggested that}} organisations align their strategic planning with their performance measurement systems. However, a large percentage of SMEs have no formal performance measurement systems in place. This has therefore been identified as a potential growth area for SMEs on which the success of the informal sectors depends. Despite the {{importance of}} SMEs throughout all economies, to-date limited research has been conducted on SMEs and e-commerce performance measurement. The aim of the present study was to investigate the manner in which the lack of e-commerce performance measurement is influencing the effective management of SMEs in the Western Cape province of South Africa. To achieve this aim, an electronic survey, investigating various aspects of e-commerce performance measurement, was compiled and sent via electronic mail to SMEs of various industries in the Western Cape. A total of 31 SMEs responded. Results indicated that the majority (67. 7 %) of SMEs in the Western Cape were not currently measuring their e-commerce performance. It was, however, considered highly important to a large percentage of the respondents and 65 % of the respondents indicated that they do plan to measure e-commerce performance in the future; however, they need to overcome a number of obstacles to do so. These obstacles were identified and a list of e-commerce performance measurement critical success factors was compiled to <b>guide</b> <b>SMEs</b> in future strategic planning. The present research has proved that SMEs in the Western Cape Province of South Africa are no different from the rest of the world in that they are lagging behind their larger counterparts in terms of e-commerce performance measurement and therefore are lagging behind in terms of strategic concern and the ultimate growth of the organisation is therefore at risk. E-commerce performance measurement is thus an important area that SMEs need to align with their organisations‟ strategy...|$|R
40|$|Small Medium Enterprise (SME) {{construction}} organisations {{are facing}} very demanding and competitive {{environment in the}} construction industry. The demanding and competitiveness of the construction industry required SMEs to be continuously vigilant to current situation and plan to the future. Many of these organisations {{failed to respond to}} ever changes environment and some of them were forced to fold their business. These pressures began to force SMEs construction organisation to shift the current short term planning to more strategically planning method such as strategic planning. SME construction organisations should engage in strategic planning activities to enhance their chances of survival and success due to this concept forces organisation to learn and adapt to current environment. Despite high fatality and have only 60 percent of survival rate, many SME construction organisations are reluctant to embrace strategic planning. Therefore, the aim {{of the study was to}} develop strategic planning model for <b>guiding</b> <b>SMEs</b> in their future planning. Additionally, the objectives of this research were to identify and investigate the influencing factors and barriers that hinder strategic planning application in SME construction organisations. In satisfying this aim and objective, the research was undertaken in two distinct phases. In phase one, an exploratory study that utilised semi-structured interviews to examine ‘why’ and ‘how’ strategic planning is used in practice by SME construction contractors was undertaken. A total of 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with owners and managers. It was revealed that most firms adopted a myopic and informal approach to strategic planning, with the main barriers to its implementation were plan in owner’s mind, unrealistic, busy, and un-forecast industry. In phase two, the findings from the interviews, in conjunction with the literature, were used to develop series of questions, which were subsequently tested using questionnaire survey. The questionnaire survey gathered quantitative data from a total of 133 SMEs regarding strategic planning practices and the factors that influenced its application. A number of non-parametric statistical techniques were used to analyse the data, which included relative index and factor analysis. The influence factors were identified and ranked by using relative index method (RI). The analysis revealed that five (5) variables that were considered the primary influence factors to strategic planning were people, market, technology, project, and financial. In addition, four (4) barriers including managerial, organisational, planning, and industry issues can be obstacle to the effectiveness of the implementation process of strategic planning. Subsequently, the research developed a generic strategic planning model for SMEs and was validated externally by construction industry practitioners. The proposed model provides basic fundamental for the SMEs in the construction industry to engage strategic planning process to enhance their organisation performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} {{presented in}} this paper addresses entrepreneurs and managers of SMEs in the construction sector that are willing to refine their current business model. It is a well-known phenomenon that, on the one hand, everybody is aware about the need to adapt business practices continuously according to external drivers and circumstances. But, on the other hand, small firms have restricted personnel resources or restricted access to knowledge on business model transformation. This situation impedes plans to change or adapt the business model. However, to remain competitive in many cases there is no other opportunity – companies have to come across external constraints and adapt their business models accordingly. Some of most important constraints the European construction industry struggles with are factors such as the identification of their respective unique selling point, the correct strategic orientation to face competition in general and, most of all, price pressure on the European market or the development of service portfolios that satisfy today’s customers. The readiness of a business model concerning the mentioned indicators but also others will be tested with the new assessment tool. In the future, it is envisaged that the assessment, implemented as a self-assessment tool, will be part of a holistic approach that <b>guides</b> <b>SMEs</b> through the challenging journey of business model reconfiguration and adaption. The work {{presented in this}} paper will focus on the initial stage of such a change process regarding the concept, the content with underlying success and performance indicators and procedure of the self-assessment. Beside the technical support of managers that strive to influence their company future, the assessment will be the initial ignition for managers to start change projects in their companies. The idea is to help entrepreneurs in their strategic decision-making process and to enable them to control their complex and continuously progressing company environment. The main scope of the technical work for defining the assessment was the transformation of generic industry performance indicators into an assessment framework that encompasses the needs of SMEs in the construction industry. A literature review on business strategy frameworks and business model literature of the past years but also papers and journals that focus on business models in the construction sector revealed typical indicators. The assessment comprises for example the market-based view or resource-based-view but also typical key success factors that are relevant in the construction sector. These are for instance aspects like project management capabilities, implementation of risk-management mechanisms or mastering of the value network in the construction sector. They were analysed according to their relevance, demarcated to each other and taken as a basis for the assessment. The set of indicators is thematically aligned to the Osterwalder Business Model Canvas which means that nine aspects of a business model are distinguished and elaborated in the assessment: Value proposition, Customer segments, Customer relationships, Channels, Key activities, Key partners, Key resources, Cost structure and Revenue stream. For each of the indicators questions and respective multiple-choice answers were formulated to identify the degree of performance achieved by companies conducting the assessment. Some explanatory text per question will additionally help clients passing the assessment. The result analysis that shows per business model building block the achieved number of credits compared to the maximum credits gives first orientation concerning the robustness and viability of the current business model. The identified main lever are constituting the most relevant starting points for a detailed analysis and refinement of a company’s business model and gives SMEs in the construction sector valuable input to adapt their business models according to future needs in a dynamic market environment...|$|R
