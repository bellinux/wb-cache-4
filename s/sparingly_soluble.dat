The initial lipolysis rate in biorelevant media, using pancreatic lipase and a self-microemulsifying formulation (SMEDDS) containing digestible lipids as substrate, was determined. The impact of incorporating two <b>sparingly</b> water <b>soluble</b> model drugs, probucol and halofantrine, into the SMEDDS was studied. It was found that both model drugs reduced the initial rate of lipolysis compared with the vehicle, probucol having a larger effect than halofantrine.

Once formed the subsequent diffusion of these species to the latex particles (and their incorporation within these particles) is relatively fast, contrary to the assumptions of the previous diffusion controlled theories. The experimental results imply that the entering free radicals contain only two or three monomer units. Thermodynamic considerations show that such species should be both water soluble and surface active.

Whereas the pH of a saturated morphine hydrate solution is 8.5, the salts are acidic. Since they derive from a strong acid but weak base, they are both at about pH = 5; as a consequence, the morphine salts are mixed with small amounts of NaOH to make them suitable for injection.|$|E
25|$|Fullerenes are <b>sparingly</b> <b>soluble</b> in {{aromatic}} solvents such as toluene {{and carbon}} disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 {{have a deep}} purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue light transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.|$|E

25|$|Organic {{molecules}} often show {{a dramatic}} increase in solubility with temperature, partly because of the polarity changes described above, and also because the solubility of <b>sparingly</b> <b>soluble</b> materials tends to increase with temperature as they have a high enthalpy of solution. Thus materials generally considered “insoluble” can become soluble in superheated water. E.g., the solubility of PAHs is increased by 5 orders of magnitude from 25°C to 225°C and naphthalene, for example, forms a 10% wt solution in water at 270°C, and the solubility of the pesticide chloranthonil with temperature is shown in the table below.|$|E
25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of different}} species in imidazolium ionic liquids depends mainly on polarity and hydrogen bonding ability. Saturated aliphatic compounds are generally only <b>sparingly</b> <b>soluble</b> in ionic liquids, whereas olefins show somewhat greater solubility, and aldehydes can be completely miscible. This can be exploited in biphasic catalysis, such as hydrogenation and hydrocarbonylation processes, allowing for relatively easy separation of products and/or unreacted substrate(s). Gas solubility follows the same trend, with carbon dioxide gas showing exceptional solubility in many ionic liquids. Carbon monoxide is less soluble in ionic liquids than in many popular organic solvents, and hydrogen {{is only slightly}} soluble (similar to the solubility in water) and may vary relatively little between the more common ionic liquids. Different analytical techniques have yielded somewhat different absolute solubility values.|$|E
25|$|The lipid {{nature of}} the cell {{membrane}} was first correctly intuited by Quincke, who noted that a cell generally forms a spherical shape in water and, when broken in half, forms two smaller spheres. The only other known material to exhibit this behavior was oil. He also noted that a thin film of oil behaves as a semipermeable membrane, precisely as predicted. Based on these observations, Quincke asserted that the cell membrane comprised a fluid layer of fat less than 100nm thick. This theory was further extended by evidence {{from the study of}} anesthetics. Hans Meyer and Ernest Overton independently noticed that the chemicals which act as general anesthetics are also those soluble in both water and oil. They interpreted this as meaning that to pass the cell membrane a molecule must be at least <b>sparingly</b> <b>soluble</b> in oil, their “lipoid theory of narcosis.” Based on this evidence and further experiments, they concluded that the cell membrane might be made of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Interestingly, one of the early criticisms of this theory was that it included no mechanism for energy-dependent selective transport. This “flaw” would remain unanswered for nearly half a century until the discovery that specialized molecules called integral membrane proteins can act as ion transportation pumps.|$|E

In particular, we verified that the formation of non spherical MDs is related to the presence of entanglements among polymer chains to select the optimal solution to be sprayed. Meanwhile, the addition of TrA, a <b>sparingly</b> water <b>soluble</b> corticosteroid, did not substantially affect the particle morphology in terms of size, size distribution and circularity at all the tested drug loadings.

A Lewis cell was used to determine model parameters and results from resolutions carried out in the Lewis cell were compared to model predictions to validate the model. It was found that n-octane is a biocompatible immiscible solvent suitable for use as the organic phase. Good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data was found when the enzyme inactivation rate was fitted. Simulations showed that mass transfer limitations have to be avoided in order to maximize the yield of enantiomerically pure epoxide.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{scientific}} literature, {{the use of}} a surfactant is recommended for both designing quality control tests for water insoluble or <b>sparingly</b> water <b>soluble</b> drugs and for predicting the bioavailability of drugs from various types of for-mulations. Since the number of poorly soluble drugs is increasing, the selection of adequate dissolution test for these be-comes more and more important. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop predictive and discriminatory test methods based on surfactants that are recommended in the literature. Particular respect was given to the use of sodium lauryl sul-fate and Tween 80, the two most commonly used surfactants for this purpose. Tamoxifen was used as a model drug. Dis-solution experiments were performed using various concentrations of the two surfactants in buffer media typically used to prepare biorelevant test media. Results were then compared with those deriving from the same test formulations in biorelevant and simplified “biorelevant ” media. Results from this study indicate that the concentration of surfactant has a huge impact on both the rate and extent of drug release from the formulation and also on the discriminatory power of the test. However, they also indicate that a well designed and validated test medium containing SLS or Tween 80 can be useful in terms of establishing a discriminatory test medium that possibly could also be used to assure batch to batch bioequivalence. Therefore, the approach described in the present paper might be very helpful for developing predictive and discriminatory methods in early formulation development for poorly soluble drugs and which could also be adopted for QC...|$|R

Preliminary to the kinetic and equilibrium data quantitative treatment, the molar absorption coefficient of TAM in polymeric micelle aqueous solution has been determined. By these studies the solubization sites of TAM into the polymeric micelles have been determined and the solubilization mechanism has been elucidated through a nonconventional approach by considering the TAM partitioned between three pseudophases, i. e., the aqueous pseudophase, the hydrophilic corona, and the hydrophobic core. The simultaneous solution of the rate laws associated with {{each step of the}} proposed mechanism allowed the calculation of the rate constants associated with the involved processes, the values of which are independent of both the copolymer concentration and nature, {{with the exception of the}} rate of the TAM transfer from the corona to the core. This has been attributed to the steric barrier, represented by the corona, which hampers the solubilization into the core. The binding constant values of the TAM to the hydrophilic corona of the polymeric micelles, calculated through the quantitative analysis of the equilibrium data, depend on the thickness of the hydrophilic headgroup, while those of the hydrophobic core are almost independent of the copolymer type.

40|$|Porphyrins are organic {{molecules}} {{that act as}} photosensitizers in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) of tumors and diseased tissues. The current thesis aims to expand the range of applications of the porphyrins by combining PDT properties with chemotherapeutic capability. This combination is achieved by the covalent conjugation of porphyrins with cyclodextrins (CDs) which are water soluble cyclic oligomers of glucose able to encapsulate a variety of molecules and already approved drug carriers. Novel conjugates of CD derivatives with porphyrins were synthesized, that can combine (a) presence of a photoactive porphyrin and (b) presence of a host cavity for drug transport and delivery (c) aqueous solubility. Three new, water-soluble conjugates were thus synthesized and identified by detailed analysis of their NMR and MS spectra. UV/Vis and emission spectra revealed that the conjugates display typical porphyrin-like behavior (strong molar absorption and intense red fluorescence in aqueous solution). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiments showed that P-CDs tend to form aggregates in aqueous solution, the aggregate size dispersion depending on the conjugate. The P-CDs were tested for cell penetration properties using the cancer cell lines DU 145 and MCF 7. The cells incubated with the P-CDs were imaged in a Confocal Microscope and showed that the new conjugates are indeed cell penetrating, dispersing in the cytosol and localizing in the membranes {{but not in the}} cell nucleus. These P-CDs were also used to carry successfully the insoluble anticancer drug Tamoxifen inside the cells. Phototoxicity experiments of P-CDs with the above cell lines showed that the conjugates are, like the starting porphyrins, phototoxic, while presenting rather low dark toxicity. Moreover, by conjugating δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ΑLA), the precursor of protoporphyrin IX, with an amino-CD derivative, an ALA-CD ester was produced (~ 2. 5 molecules ALA per CD) and characterized with NMR, IR and MS spectra. ALA-CD acts as a pro-drug for PDT, as shown with biological experiments on cells and Confocal Microscopy, as it is converted in situ to protoporphyrin IX. Simultaneously, ALA-CD can transport in the cells a water insoluble molecular guest. Finally, the <b>sparingly</b> water <b>soluble</b> antibiotic Rifaximin was coupled with a cell penetrating amino-CD producing a water soluble product that was shown to be efficiently transferred inside the cells. ...|$|R

However, it is restricted by the <b>sparingly</b> water <b>soluble</b> nitric oxide, which accounts for 90 - 95 % of nitrogen oxides. It is desirable and cost-effective to remove nitric oxide from flue gas by existing wet scrubbers for reduced capital costs and foot prints. In this research, absorption of nitric oxide from simulated flue gas using three different absorbents was first conducted in a bubble column system at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Through performance comparison, ammoniacal cobalt(II) solutions were chosen as the optimum absorbent for nitric oxide absorption. Then the effects of fresh absorbent composition, pH value and temperature on nitric oxide absorption were investigated. Experimental results showed that the best initial NO removal efficiency of 96. 45 % was measured at the inlet flow rate of 500 mL·min- 1; the room temperature of 292. 2 K; the pH value of 10. 50; and the concentrations of cobalt(II) solution, NO and O 2 of 0. 06 mol·L- 1, 500 ppmv and 5. 0 %, respectively. For in-depth understanding of NO absorption into ammoniacal cobalt(II) complexes, equilibrium constants of reactions between nitric oxide and penta- and haxa-amminecobalt(II) solutions, respectively were determined using a bubble column reactor, in which the operation was performed continuously with respect to gas phase and batch-wise with respect to liquid phase. The experiments were conducted at temperatures from 298. 2 to 310. 2 K and pH from 9. 06 to 9. 37, all under atmospheric pressure. All experimental data fitted well to the following equations: K_NO^ 5 = 1. 90 × 10 ^ 7 exp(3598. 5 /T) and K_NO^ 6 = 3. 56 × 10 ^ 11 exp(1476. 4 /T), which give the enthalpy of reactions between NO and penta- and hexa-amminecobalt (II) nitrates as ∆H^ 5 =- 29. 92 kJ·mol^(- 1) and ∆H^ 6 =- 12. 27 kJ·mol^(- 1). In kinetic study, a number of experiments were conducted in a home-made double-stirred reactor at temperatures of 298. 2 and 303. 2 K and pH from 8. 50 to 9. 87 under atmospheric pressure. The reaction rate constants were calculated with the use of enhancement factor derived for gas absorption accompanied by parallel chemical reactions. The reaction between NO and pentaaminecobalt(II) was first order with respect to NO and pentaamminecobalt(II) ion, respectively. Similarly, the reaction between NO and hexaaminecobalt(II) was also first order with respect to NO and hexaamminecobalt(II) ion, respectively. The forward reaction rate constants of these two reactions were 6. 43 × 10 ^ 6 and 1. 00 × 10 ^ 7 L·mol- 1 ·s- 1, respectively at 298. 2 K, and increased to 7. 57 × 106 and 1. 12 × 107 L∙mol- 1 ∙s- 1, respectively at 303. 2 K. Furthermore, regeneration of used absorbent was attempted but fails. None of the additives tested herein including potassium iodide (KI), sodium persulphate (Na 2 S 5 O 8) and activated carbon (AC) showed capability of regeneration at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In addition, the effect of oxygen was investigated. With ammoniacal cobalt(II) compounds a positive effect of oxygen on NO absorption was observed. Calculated NO amount absorbed into the aqueous solution showed that with the oxygen the absorption reaction could be considered as irreversible. This fact was probably the reason for the failure of regeneration of the tested reagents. Last but not least, volumetric liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient, kLa, in some popular industrial absorbers including bubble column (BC), conventional stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and gas-inducing agitated tank (GIAT) were determined by modeling removal of oxygen from water. The experimental results could be well interpreted by mathematical models with 90 % of deviations less than ± 10 %. 1 yea...|$|R
