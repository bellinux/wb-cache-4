This has made possible to create a distributed mobile computing application and has also brought several new challenges in distributed algorithm design. Checkpointing is a well explored fault tolerance technique for the wired and cellular mobile networks. However, it is not directly applicable to MANET due to its dynamic topology, limited availability of stable <b>storage,</b> <b>partitioning</b> and the absence of fixed infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, coordinated and non-blocking checkpointing algorithm to provide fault tolerance in cluster based MANET, where only minimum number of mobile hosts in the cluster should take checkpoints.

40|$|International audienceEfficient memory {{allocation}} {{is crucial for}} data-intensive applications as a smaller memory footprint ensures better cache performance and allows one to run a larger problem size given a fixed amount of main memory. In this paper, we describe a new automatic storage optimization technique to minimize the dimensionality and storage requirements of arrays used in sequences of loop nests with a predetermined schedule. We formulate the problem of intra-array storage optimization as one of finding the right <b>storage</b> <b>partitioning</b> hyperplanes: each storage partition corresponds to a single storage location. Our heuristic is driven by a dual objective function that minimizes both, the dimensionality of the mapping and the extents along those dimensions. The technique is dimension optimal for most codes encountered in practice. The storage requirements of the mappings obtained also are asymptotically better than those obtained by any existing schedule-dependent technique. Storage reduction factors and other results we report from an implementation of our technique demonstrate its effectiveness on several real-world examples drawn from the domains of image processing, stencil computations, high-performance computing, and the class of tiled codes in general...|$|E

The molecular mechanism of seed <b>storage</b> <b>partitioning</b> remains to be clarified. In this paper, Medicago truncatula (the model legume) and Medicago orbicularis were {{used to compare the}} molecular basis underlying the partitioning of seed storage compounds. Seeds of M. orbicularis and M. truncatula were sampled at 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26 days after anthesis and at the time of maturation. M. orbicularis had a similar dry weight (4 mg per seed) to M. truncatula, but only accumulated around a third of seed storage protein and oil. The less seed protein and oil content was due to the lower expression of master transcription factors LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 -Like (L 1 L) and ABA INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI 3), in M. orbicularis. M. orbicualris had similar expression of AGPase (a major enzyme controlling starch synthesis) to M. truncatula, suggesting that M. orbicularis did not switch carbon flow to the starch pathway.

40|$|The {{polyhedral}} model {{provides an}} expressive intermediate representation that is convenient {{for the analysis}} and subsequent transformation of affine loop nests. Several heuristics exist for achieving complex program transformations in this model. However, there is also considerable scope to utilize this model to tackle the problem of automatic memory footprint optimization. In this paper, we present a new automatic storage optimization technique {{which can be used}} to achieve both intra-array as well as inter-array storage reuse with a pre-determined schedule for the computation. Our approach works by finding statement-wise <b>storage</b> <b>partitioning</b> hyper planes that partition a unified global array space so that values with overlapping live ranges are not mapped to the same partition. Our heuristic is driven by a fourfold objective function which not only minimizes the dimensionality and storage requirements of arrays required for each high-level statement, but also maximizes inter statement storage reuse. The storage mappings obtained using our heuristic can be asymptotically better than those obtained by any existing technique.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosphy (PhD) Legumes are {{increasingly}} recognised as playing {{a critical role}} in addressing the food crisis and meeting growing demands for bioenergy in a framework of sustainable cropping. M. truncatula is a widely used model to study legume biology particularly for legume-specific developmental questions such as nodulation. Accordingly, rich genetic sequencing information and extensive databases with bioinformatic analyses are made available by the legume community. This facilitates the use of M. truncatula as a model to study legume seed biology. A global picture of proteomics and transcriptomics of M. truncatula seed filling has been explored. However, there is still limited information available for M. truncatula as a legume model for studying seed biology and seed filling. This study in the thesis characterised M. truncatula embryo development from embryo sac to protein and oil body formation using histological, biochemical and molecular methods. A multicellular hypophysis, suspensor development and a clear procambial connection between shoot and root apical meristems are featured. TEM images clearly show a specific oil body arrangement aligning the protein bodies and plasma membrane. Gene expression during early seed development and the accumulation of storage protein and oil was profiled, with a focus on transcription factors. Embryogenesis establishes the embryonic pattern that acts as the centre for growth after germination and develops the cotyledons that are a repository for protein bodies and oil bodies in legumes. Early embryogenesis with a series of complex development events is completed in 6 - 8 days and is tightly regulated by a network of transcription factors. Early embryogenesis is characterised by three distinctive expression patterns, with MtSERF 1 and MtWOX 9 expression associated with embryo growth, connecting the early and late embryo development. Medicago orbicularis was chosen to compare the accumulation of seed storage products with M. truncatula because of its lower seed protein and oil. Further biochemical and histology studies clearly showed a contrasting seed nutritional spectrum in terms of protein, oil, starch and cell wall between M. truncatula and M. orbicularis, which provides a pair of close species to investigate genetic mechanisms of seed storage accumulation. The major regulators of seed maturation and seed filling are LEC 1 /L 1 l, LEC 2, FUS 3 and ABI 3 in Arabidopsis while in Medicago only L 1 L and ABI 3 are shown to be possible equivalent regulators. The expression of selected pathway genes further confirmed the transcriptional regulation. Reduced oil content in M. orbicularis is also associated with increased seed coat mucilage and cotyledon cell wall material, and gene expression of associated biosynthetic pathways. The storage compounds can potentially be influenced by modifying carbon flow (e. g. the mucilage biosynthesis pathway), or modifying regulatory genes (e. g. L 1 L). Apart from the biosynthesis of protein and oil, the process of packing protein and oil is also important for the final storage in the cotyledons. A highly efficient plant transformation system is essential for gene functional analysis and creating transgenic lines. Accordingly, an improved transformation procedure was developed using a new hormonal combination of ABA+GA (an unusual synergism) imposed from the beginning of tissue culture. In essence, the study in this thesis completed a detailed examination of morphological, cellular and molecular aspects of embryogenesis in M. truncatula, providing a legume perspective to complement studies in Arabidopsis embryogenesis. By comparing the cellular, biochemical and molecular basis of seed storage between M. truncatula and M. orbicularis, these species were found to be a promising pair for investigating mechanisms of regulating partitioning of legume seed storage compounds. The improvement of transformation efficiency further facilitates the genetic modification of specific genes of interest in M. truncatula in this context. Therefore, this thesis lays a foundation for further studies in legume seed biology and the regulation of seed filling and <b>storage</b> <b>partitioning...</b>|$|E

To mitigate the booting-time attack, MobiHydra obfuscates {{the time required}} for a wrong password (i.e., an arbitrary password except the true and the decoy password) during booting such that the adversary {{is not able to}} identify the existence of PDE by simply entering a wrong password. To support fast mode switching, MobiHydra introduces a special partition called shelter volume on the external storage, which is used as a temporary <b>storage</b> <b>partition</b> which can temporarily store the sensitive data being created in the public mode, without the need of entering the PDE mode for storing hidden sensitive data. The data stored in the shelter volume will be immediately synchronized to the hidden volume when the hidden mode is entered, and are then eliminated from the shelter volume. To avoid deniability compromise, the sensitive data stored in the shelter volume will be encrypted by a random key which is encrypted by the public key and stored in the shelter volume. In addition, some dummy files are maintained in the shelter volume and updated periodically to obfuscate the writes of hidden sensitive data to the shelter volume. MobiHydra, however, cannot eliminate the assumption of requiring a physical or an emulated FAT 32 SD card.|$|R

This approach involves two phases: resource monitoring and resource scheduling. Resource monitoring (even discovery) phase {{is supported by}} the SNMP-based Balanced Load Monitoring Agents for Resource Scheduling (SBLOMARS). This resource monitoring and discovery approach is different from current distributed monitoring systems in three main areas. Firstly, it reaches a high level of generality by the integration of SNMP technology and thus, it is offering an alternative solution to handle heterogeneous operating platforms. Secondly, it solves the flexibility problem by the implementation of complex dynamic software structures, which are used to monitor from simple personal computers to robust multi-processor systems or clusters with even multiple hard disks and <b>storage</b> <b>partitions.</b> Finally, the scalability problem is covered by the distribution of the monitoring system into a set of submonitoring instances which are specific per each kind of computational resource to monitor (processor, memory, software, network and storage).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} set of autonomous, ice-ocean {{measurements were}} collected across the Canada Basin {{to study the}} summer evolution of the ice-ocean boundary layer (IOBL) and ocean mixed layer (OML). Evaluation of local heat and freshwater balances and associated turbulent forcing reveals that melt ponds (MPs) strongly influence the summer IOBL-OML evolution. Areal expansion of MPs in mid-June start the upper ocean evolution resulting in significant increases to ocean absorbed radiative flux (19 W m− 2 in this study). Buoyancy provided by MP drainage shoals and freshens the IOBL resulting in a 39 MJ m− 2 increase in heat storage in just 19 days (52 % of the summer total). Following MP drainage, a near-surface fresh layer deepens through shear-forced mixing to form the summer mixed layer (sML). In late summer, basal melt increases due to stronger turbulent mixing in the thin sML {{and the expansion of}} open water areas due in part to wind-forced divergence of the sea ice. Thermal heterogeneities in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) upper ocean led to large ocean-to-ice heat fluxes (100 – 200 W m− 2) and enhanced basal ice melt (3 – 6 cm d− 1), well away from the ice edge.
