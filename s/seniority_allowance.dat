50|$|He {{ran from}} {{home when he}} was 14 years old to join Bakırköy Cavalry Junior Officer School. He joined the Balkan War and was wounded on the Bulgarian front. As a result he was awarded with honours and <b>seniority</b> <b>allowance.</b> Later he joined Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa {{organized}} by Eşref Kuşçubaşı and participated in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq during World War I. He was again wounded and retired to his village. For a while he took up banditry in the mountains. He then founded Kuvâ-yi Seyyâre which was the only organized military force in Anatolia during 1919-1920, period between the Armistice of Mudros and the Treaty of Sèvres. He coordinated his military operations with Ali Fuat Paşa in Ankara and harassed the invading Greek armies with his fast cavalry. He was instrumental in putting down various rebellions against {{the authority of the}} Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Eventually he had a disagreement with the İsmet İnönü government in Ankara, refusing to join his forces with the regular army established under the command of İnönü Paşa. Newly-reconstituted Turkish Army had to put down the situation whilst also fighting the Greeks at First Battle of İnönü. His alleged subsequent surrender to and cooperation (disputed by historians in Turkey until his restoration of honour) with the Greek army resulted in his citizenship getting revoked on the grounds of treason and his being announced a persona non grata by the TBMM, amongst many others. From Greece, he went to Jordan and settled there.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} is to discover the problems tackled concerning performance management in banking sector. To check present practices working in banking industry. Identify problems and deficiencies which hindering HR practices and suggest improvements for better implementation of HR policies in HBL. The tactic applied for conducting current research is qualitative research. I have adopted case study method for the performance evaluation of employees of Habib Bank Limited of Pakistan. Interviews consisting open ended questions was asked from almost 10 - 15 employees. During interviews the points which I realize should be highlighted are: From the salary packages the top management is satisfied but in case of operational officers are not. Training is given to every new recruiter but in case of working employees training will be given if needed, there is no continuous process of giving training yearly or quarterly. Centralized decision making, Problems or issues are discussed among employees but final decision is taken but top management. Working hours are lengthy. Promotions are based on performance instead of <b>seniority.</b> Rewards, bonuses, <b>allowances</b> are given to employees which increases their motivation level. Performance evaluation has {{a vital role in}} the success of organization and employees too. If the performance evaluation of employees is not accurate or biasness is including in it, it will be the cause of demotivation of employees. Performance evaluation should not be confidential, employees should be informed about his mistakes and positive points so that he/she improves his mistakes and it encourages by knowing his positive points...|$|R
