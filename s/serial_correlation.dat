40|$|When {{performing}} {{statistical analysis}} of single-subject fMRI data, <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> {{need to be taken}} into account to allow for valid inference. Otherwise, the variability in the parameter estimates might be under-estimated resulting in increased false-positive rates. <b>Serial</b> <b>correlations</b> in fMRI data are commonly characterized in terms of a first-order autoregressive (AR) process and then removed via pre-whitening. The required noise model for the pre-whitening depends on a number of parameters, particularly the repetition time (TR). Here we investigate how the sub-second temporal resolution provided by simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging changes the noise structure in fMRI time series. We fit a higher-order AR model and then estimate the optimal AR model order for a sequence with a TR of less than 600  ms providing whole brain coverage. We show that physiological noise modelling successfully reduces the required AR model order, but remaining <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> necessitate an advanced noise model. We conclude that commonly used noise models, such as the AR(1) model, are inadequate for modelling <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> in fMRI using sub-second TRs. Rather, physiological noise modelling in combination with advanced pre-whitening schemes enable valid inference in single-subject analysis using fast fMRI sequences...|$|R

2500|$|Although <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> {{does not}} affect the {{consistency}} of [...] the estimated regression coefficients, it does affect our ability to conduct valid statistical tests. First, the F-statistic to test for overall significance of the regression may be inflated under positive <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> because the mean squared error (MSE) will tend to underestimate the population error variance. Second, positive <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> typically causes the ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors for the regression coefficients to underestimate the true standard errors. As a consequence, if positive <b>serial</b> <b>correlation</b> is present in the regression, standard linear regression analysis will typically lead us to compute artificially small standard errors for the regression coefficient. These small standard errors will cause the estimated t-statistic to be inflated, suggesting significance where perhaps there is none. The inflated t-statistic, may in turn, lead us to incorrectly reject null hypotheses, about population values of the parameters of the regression model more often than we would if the standard errors were correctly estimated.|$|E

Although neuronal noise obviously plays a role, the neural mechanism for the generation of randomness at the slow time scale of the percept durations (multiple seconds) is unresolved. Here significant nonzero <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> are reported in series of visual percept durations (to the author’s knowledge {{for the first time}} accounting for duration impurities caused by reaction time, drift, and incomplete percepts). <b>Serial</b> <b>correlations</b> for perceptual rivalry using structure-from-motion ambiguity were smaller than for binocular rivalry using orthogonal gratings.

40|$|Implications {{of market}} {{frictions}} {{in the context}} of <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> in indexes on the Central and Eastern European (CEE) stock markets have been analysed. Market frictions, such as non-trading effects, bid/ask spreads, other transaction costs, etc., may be detected by direct measurement, or by indirect identification. Direct measurement of frictions is difficult as intraday trading data are unavailable in the case of most of the emerging CEE stock markets. Indirect identification may be conducted by detecting some empirical phenomena. One of them is evidence of <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> in indexes, the so-called the Fisher effect. We explore the problem of <b>serial</b> <b>correlations</b> in indexes on the eight CEE stock markets using data samples from each CEE market separately, as well as a "common trading window" approach, which is widely applied in the case of databases with multivariate time series. The evidence is that nonsynchronous trading effect II between markets may substantially disrupt the analysis of index returns on a domestic market. Using a synchronized database, one may erroneously conclude that the Fisher effect does not exist, although it is present. (original abstract...|$|R

[...] Since d is approximately equal to 2(1−r), where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals, d=2 indicates no autocorrelation. The value of d always lies between 0 and 4. If the Durbin–Watson statistic is substantially less than 2, there is evidence of positive <b>serial</b> <b>correlation.</b> As a rough rule of thumb, if Durbin–Watson is less than 1.0, there may be cause for alarm. Small values of d indicate successive error terms are, on average, close in value to one another, or positively correlated. If d>2, successive error terms are, on average, much different in value from one another, i.e., negatively correlated. In regressions, this can imply an underestimation of the level of statistical significance.|$|E
