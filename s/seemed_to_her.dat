25|$|Initially, Aspasia {{was very}} {{reluctant}} to accept the romantic advances of the prince. Renowned for his many female conquests, Alexander <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> untrustworthy, also because their social differences impeded any serious relationship. However, the perseverance of the Greek prince, who travelled to Spetses {{in the summer of}} 1915 with the only purpose to see Aspasia, finally overcame her misgivings.|$|E
500|$|Pankhurst {{made their}} Russell Square home into a centre for grieving sisters, {{attracting}} activists of many types. She took pleasure in decorating the house – especially with furnishings from Asia – and clothing {{the family in}} tasteful apparel. Her daughter Sylvia later wrote: [...] "Beauty and appropriateness in her dress and household appointments <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at all times an indispensable setting to public work." [...] The Pankhursts hosted a variety of guests including US abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, Indian MP Dadabhai Naoroji, socialist activists Herbert Burrows and Annie Besant, and French anarchist Louise Michel.|$|E
500|$|Producer Barry Rosen said, [...] "We {{were very}} lucky that [...] were so human-grounded, {{so we could}} really play off of them {{and the way they}} looked at things that [...] went through. They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, getting in trouble, jealousies and so on." [...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> like a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|E

500|$|Joe Moran, {{writing in}} the Financial Times, {{describes}} {{the genesis of the}} book as a [...] "defining moment". It was when, [...] "stranded by a blizzard" [...] in a hotel in Ross-on-Wye whose restaurant served meals so dismal that they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to be [...] "produced with a kind of bleak triumph which amounted almost to a hatred of humanity and humanity’s needs", David felt her famous [...] "agonised craving for the sun". Furious at the joyless food, she started to draft the [...] "sensuous descriptions" [...] of Mediterranean food that led to A Book of Mediterranean Food.|$|E
500|$|Barney's attitudes during World War II {{have been}} controversial. [...] In 1937, Una, Lady Troubridge had complained that Barney [...] "talked {{a lot of}} half-baked {{nonsense}} about the tyranny of fascism". Barney herself was one-quarter Jewish, and since she spent the war in Italy with Romaine Brooks, risked deportation to a concentration camp—a fate she avoided only by wiring her sister Laura for a notarized document attesting to her confirmation. [...] Nevertheless, having no other {{source of information about}} the war, she believed Axis propaganda that portrayed the Allies as the aggressors, so that pro-Fascism <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to be a logical consequence of her pacifism. [...] An unpublished memoir she wrote during the war years is pro-Fascist and anti-Semitic, quoting speeches by Hitler, apparently with approval.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg is {{the highest}} among the ásynjur or Aesir, and that [...] "she has a {{dwelling}} called Fensalir {{and it is very}} splendid." [...] In chapter 49, High says that when Loki witnessed that Baldr had gained invincibility due to the oath all things took not to harm him, Loki went to Fensalir appearing as a woman. In his disguise, Loki there asked Frigg why Baldr was not harmed by the objects. Frigg revealed that it is due to the oath they have taken. The disguised Loki asks if nothing can hurt Baldr, and Frigg reveals that only mistletoe can, for it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> too young to demand an oath from. After this, Loki immediately disappears, and subsequently engineers the death of Baldr with a mistletoe projectile.|$|E
5000|$|They {{may also}} {{misunderstand}} {{what is meant}} by vague instructions on how to dress. Carol Vellucci, director of the Career Center at the University of Baltimore, told The Baltimore Sun that many students <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> think that [...] "dressing up" [...] means wearing outfits they would typically wear to a nightclub or bar. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be something that especially younger students aren't quite getting," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head, but made him no answer. As for herself {{she had not}} begun to form a plan. Her own {{condition}} did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be nearly so dreadful as that of all these young children.|$|R
50|$|Adding to the confusion, the Gospel of Philip <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Jesus' mother's sister ("her sister") and Jesus' {{own sister}} ("his sister").|$|R
500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met {{only once a}} week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning {{that went on in}} traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in her journal, [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E
2500|$|This Thielvar {{had a son}} called Hafthi. And Hafthi's {{wife was}} called Whitestar. Those two {{were the first to}} settle on Gotland. The first night they slept {{together}} she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that they slid out of her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus: ...|$|E
2500|$|Helm {{inherited}} from her mother a love for reading and a deep religious faith. At an early age she commenced to write poetry and prose under the pen-name [...] "Lucile." [...] Although often prostrated by illness and always very delicate, she advanced rapidly at school. She studied drawing and painting, was fond of horseback riding and of shooting-parties, but she refused to dance or engage in games that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> inconsistent with a Christian life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Vervain is very {{religious}} in her way, {{and she is}} truth itself. Are you {{sure that it is}} not concern for what <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> your terrible position, that has made her show so much anxiety on your account?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I cast no glance {{upon the}} hearth, but {{put on my}} hat and coat and went to Mary. As I walked there rose behind me a cloud of misty disappointment, while before me {{there was nothing but}} dark uncertainty. What would Mary have to say to me? And how should I explain what would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be a cowardly evasion of her plainly {{expressed}} request? ...|$|R
2500|$|Moulton's {{imagination}} was fostered {{during her}} childhood. Her parents {{clung to the}} strictest Calvinistic principles. Games, dances, romances, were forbidden; and, as playmates were few, the child lived {{in a world of}} fancy. [...] "I was lonely," [...] she said, [...] "and I sought companions. What was there to do but to create them?" [...] Indeed, before she was eight years old, her active mind was creating a world of its own in a little unwritten play, which it pleased her fancy to call a Spanish drama, and with which she spent all summer, filling it with personages. The rigid Calvinism of the family had undoubtedly a very stimulating effect on the emotions of the sensitive child, and to its far-reaching influence may be ascribed the tinge of melancholy found in many of her pages. As a child, Moulton also exhibited a great vitality, especially when she was not burdened with the terrors of [...] "damnation". Running {{in the face of a}} great wind was one of her joys, and she realized the reverse of such emotion in listening to the sound of the wind through an outer keyhole, which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> the calling of trumpets, the crying of lost souls.|$|E
2500|$|She had {{understood}} {{that she had}} to pray and give her life for sinners like Pranzini. But Carmel prayed especially for priests and this had surprised her since their souls <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to be [...] "as pure as crystal". A month spent with many priests taught her that they are [...] "weak and feeble men". [...] She wrote later: [...] "I met many saintly priests that month, but I also found that in spite of being above angels by their supreme dignity, they were none the less men and still subject to human weakness. If the holy priests, 'the salt of the earth', as Jesus calls them in the Gospel, have to be prayed for, what about the lukewarm? Again, as Jesus says, 'If the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?' I understood my vocation in Italy." [...] For the first time too she had associated with young men. [...] "In her brotherless existence, masculinity had been represented only by her father, her Uncle Guérin and various priests. Now she had her first and only experiences. Céline declared at the beatification proceedings that one of the young men in the pilgrimage group [...] "developed a tender affection for her". Thérèse confessed to her sister, [...] "It is high time for Jesus to remove me from the poisonous breath of the world...I feel that my heart is easily caught by tenderness, and where others fall, I would fall too. We are no stronger than the others." [...] Soon after that, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse. On 9 April 1888 she became a Carmelite postulant.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> mind, Bertha; {{that is what}} puzzles me. A girl who has made up <b>her</b> mind <b>to</b> accept a man, and who finds out {{something}} that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> so bad that she rejects him, would naturally be distressed and upset. You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> treat {{it as if it}} were a matter of no importance." ...|$|R

60|$|He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> rather {{less than}} at first; and, on her part, {{there was a}} change. She <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have lost <b>her</b> first eager and frank curiosity about him, and did not always smile now when she met him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to do," [...] he said. [...] "It beats me altogether. The truth is, Sir Patrick, I was fairly forced, at Craig Fernie, into deceiving Blanche--in what might <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> a very unfeeling, and a very unpardonable way." ...|$|R
