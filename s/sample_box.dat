The framework used to analyse the samples in this study is the nine-move structure for advertisements introduced by Kathpalia (1992). The main outcome {{of this study is to}} find out the communicative purpose of formula milk pamphlets and <b>sample</b> <b>boxes</b> and the rhetorical structure that is used to create these samples. The study finds the information desired by parents, in order to make an informed decision to help advertisers decide how to best use the limited space available. Those moves that have a frequency of 75 % or above are prominent moves. The results of the findings show that the communicative purpose of the formula milk pamphlets and <b>sample</b> <b>boxes</b> are to inform and persuade potential customers to buy the product. The prominent moves of this study is Appraising the Product, Identifying the Company, Urging Action, Attracting Action, Justifying the Product, and giving Related Information that helped realize the communicative purposes.

The findings also show that the top three information that parents need in order to make an informed decision on the formula milk for their child is the ingredients used to make the product, where it is produced, and what needs of their child it meets.

40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} {{class of}} mobile manipulation problems are “move-to-grasp ” problems where a mobile robot must navigate to {{and pick up}} an object. One of the distinguishing features of this class of tasks is its coarse-to-fine structure. Near {{the beginning of the}} task, the robot can only sense the target object coarsely or indirectly and make gross motion toward the object. However, after the robot has located and approached the object, the robot must finely control its grasping contacts using precise visual and haptic feedback. In this paper, it is proposed that move-to-grasp problems are naturally solved by a sequence of controllers that iteratively refines what ultimately becomes the final solution. This paper introduces the notion of a refining sequence of controllers and characterizes this type of solution. The approach is demonstrated in a move-to-grasp task where Robonaut, the NASA/JSC dexterous humanoid, is mounted on a mobile base and navigates to and picks up a geological <b>sample</b> <b>box.</b> In a series of experiments, it is shown that a refining sequence of controllers decreases variance in robot configuration relative to the <b>sample</b> <b>box</b> until a successful grasp has been achieved.

30|$|There are two {{straightforward}} {{questions that}} the simulation results {{can be used to}} answer. The first is how much of each ion species is Titan losing to Saturn’s magnetosphere? The second is does the orientation of the sun with respect to the plasma flow direction effect those loss rates? To address these question we constructed a 5 Rt <b>sampling</b> <b>box</b> centered on Titan. Ions that crossed the sampling faces where collected over the time of each run and recorded. The loss rates were then calculated. Each simulation was run until the loss rates became stable. All of the cases took longer than 2700 s of simulation time (not run time) for the loss rates to stabilize. Rates collected before that time overestimated the loss of L+ and M+. All of the species except the HNI+ (74 amu) first hit the <b>sampling</b> <b>box</b> within 500 seconds, with L+, M+, H 1 + and H 2 + all hitting in less than 100 s. The MHC+ first hit the box around 250 s while the HHC+ took almost 500 s. The HNI+ took more than twice as long, over 1300 s to reach the box.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and thermal efficiency of Paulownia coreana (low–density wood) and high–density fiber board were measured via a comparative analysis of {{heat transfer}}, and {{the suitability of}} the wood as a finishing material was evaluated. A comparative analysis of heat transfer is calculated by verifying the heat transfer and change in temperature of the water bottle {{both inside and outside}} of the <b>sample</b> <b>box.</b> The total transferred heat is then divided by conduction, convection, and radiation. The results show 18. 05 W of heat was transferred to water bottle in the low–density Paulownia coreana UYEKI, and 12. 5 W in the high–density fiberboard. The total heat from the heating source was 30 W. This indicates that a heat loss of low density wood was smaller than that of high density fiberboard. A difference was found in the amount of heat transferred, with a majority due to radiation: 0. 02 W of conduction, 1. 5 W of convection, and 3. 98 W of radiation.

The results of this study and of the former GHz response study revealed numerous complementary areas for improvement.

40|$|A small bandgap {{matched to}} low energy photons and a Dirac {{electron}} transport system are two definitive characteristics of bilayer graphene (BGR) that has gained it considerable interest in realizing a broadly tunable sensor for application {{in the microwave}} (GHz) to terahertz (THz) regimes. For these reasons, graphene field effect transistors (GR-FETs) {{have the potential to}} exceed the detection limit of most existing semiconductor quantum point contacts (QPCs). This is due to the unique phase coherent length of open quantum-dot structures formed in bilayer graphene when exposed to GHz/THz radiation. Existing GR-FETs have been fabricated by micromechanical exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG-SG 2) contacted with submicron-scale metal electrodes (Ti/Au or Pd/Au).

30|$|Figure  1 (a) {{shows the}} layout of the sample chip. In the {{resonator}} design, we omit the second groundplane to reduce the direct geometric coupling between the two resonators. The rf SQUID is galvanically connected to both center strips of the resonators over a length of 200 μm. The sample is fabricated as follows. First, a 100 nm thick niobium layer is sputter deposited onto a 250 μm thick, thermally oxidized silicon wafer. The resonators and the SQUID loop are patterned using optical lithography and reactive ion etching. The Josephson junction of the SQUID is fabricated in a Nb/AlO_x/Nb trilayer process with SiO_ 2 as insulating layer between top and bottom electrode [32]. 1 The resonators have a characteristic impedance of Z_ 0 = 64 Ω and the resonance frequencies ω_A/ 2 π= 6.482 GHz and ω_B/ 2 π= 6.461 GHz. 2 The SQUID loop has dimensions of 200 μm× 100 μm and a screening parameter β = 0.934 to maximize the coupling according to Equation (4) while keeping the SQUID monostable. The sample is mounted inside a gold plated copper box, which is attached to the base temperature stage of a dilution refrigerator operating at 26 mK.

The tests in this field exercise utilized recently developed robots of varying scales and capabilities and humans in pressurized space suits. Two examples of operations performed in the field are presented: a surface operations scenario involving suited crew supported by a number of mobile robots and setup operations for accessing a crater. The surface operations scenario simulated the end of a crew sortie and involved the following agents: 1) Suit subjects from Johnson Space Center s (JSC) advanced spacesuit laboratory 2) JSC's unpressurized crewed rover testbed, SCOUT 3) The Jet Propulsion Laboratory s (JPL) rough terrain, payload carrying robot, ATHLETE 4) JSC's Astronaut assist robot, Robonaut 5) Ames Research Center's (ARC) inspection robot, K- 10.

There were 14 MMOD impacts reported on the crew module windows (Figure 1). The largest impact feature, a 6. 6 mm x 5. 8 mm crater on window # 4, was caused by a particle with an estimated diameter of 0. 22 mm (Figure 2). This impact was among the largest ever recorded on a crew module window. The window was removed and replaced. Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) analysis of dental mold samples from the impact site to determine particle origin was inconclusive, possibly due to contamination picked up on the ferry flight from Edwards Air Force Base to KSC. The radiators {{on the inside of the}} payload bay doors sustained 19 impacts (Figure 3) with one of the impacts causing a face sheet perforation. The 0. 61 mm diameter hole was produced by a particle with an estimated diameter of 0. 4 mm, which approaches the 0. 5 -mm critical particle diameter of the wing leading edge reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panel high-temperature regions (Zone 3, Figure 4) that was established during Return to Flight testing of the RCC panels. An inspection of the payload bay door exterior insulation (FRSI) revealed a 5. 8 mm x 4. 5 mm defect that was caused by an MMOD particle with unknown composition, as the sample obtained was contaminated. Figure 5 provides a summary of the exterior surface survey that was conducted following the STS- 114 mission. Two windows were removed and replaced due to hypervelocity impact.
