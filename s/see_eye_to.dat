5|$|Jack Black and Kyle Gass {{initially}} met in Los Angeles in 1985, both {{members of}} the theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang. Black admits the duo did not <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> eye due to animosity between the two as Gass was the main musician for the Actor's Gang and felt threatened by Black. The Actor's Gang travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland for Edinburgh Fringe in 1989. They were performing Tim Robbins' and Adam Simon's play Carnage. After arriving home from the trip, the two became close friends and Black would regularly visit Gass's Cochran Avenue studio apartment in the deal that Gass would teach Black guitar in return for food, mainly from fast-food chain Jack in the Box.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> eye with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, {{there was always the}} factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E

Phillips often did not <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> eye with missionaries in Pinyin and wished to build a permanent hospital. In 1908, Phillips received permission to build the hospital that she had requested. Phillips opened St. Agatha's Hospital on 5 February 1909 and it was dedicated on 1 May.|$|E
25|$|Nariakira did not <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> {{eye with}} his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father’s chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were {{wary of the}} Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho also saw many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had {{a great interest in}} Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with the shogunate.|$|E

500|$|Tracey Frahey of AllMusic {{described}} the band's sound as [...] "an {{extension of the}} alt-metal-fused-with-art rock style popularized by Tool {{in the early to}} mid-'90s. While similar to Tool in intensity and melancholy, A Perfect Circle is less dark and more melodic, with a theatrical, ambient quality that incorporates occasional strings and unusual instrumentation. While Keenan referred to the band first album, Mer de Noms, as more of a hard rock album, for subsequent albums, out of fear of redundancy, he often pushed for a more mellow, atmospheric sound, something he and Howerdel did not always <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> eye on, creating a sound noted to be similar to merging heavy rock music with Disintegration-era The Cure music. In general, common genre classifications applied to labeling the band's music include alternative rock, [...] alternative metal, hard rock, art rock, art metal, progressive rock and progressive metal. The band has also been lumped in with the nu metal genre, a label that is cited [...] due to the band's rise to fame coinciding with the genre's movement towards more melodic heavy material similar to A Perfect Circle's sound, and its use was contested by many publications.|$|E
500|$|On May 3, 2013, just a {{month before}} the film's premiere, {{producers}} announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life. At the time of his departure, Pacino's character had already been fully voiced and animated. Chris Renaud, co-director of the film, commented on Pacino's departure: [...] "So we don't want an unhappy actor, and we want something that is well-realized on all sides. If you don't <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> eye, sometimes it's easier to (part company) and move on from there." [...] Benjamin Bratt, who had already been considered before Pacino, stepped in to voice Eduardo. Chris Meledandri, producer of the film, admitted that he was not [...] "aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years that has brought an actor in at such a late stage". Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. Initially, during his five-day recording, he tried to imitate Pacino's voice, but found it impossible, saying [...] "no one can out-Al Pacino Al Pacino". He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration, and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character. His work was commended by Variety, saying: [...] "You'd never guess he wasn't the filmmakers' first choice." ...|$|E

500|$|The second track, [...] "Somebody More Like You" [...] {{was written}} by guitarist Sean Watkins. The {{break-up}} song, written from Watkins' perspective, was described as [...] "scathing", and like [...] "Aimee Mann-style modern pop", with lyrics like [...] "I hope you meet someone your height so you can <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> eye/With someone as small as you". Watkins said the song wasn't written for anyone in particular, but said [...] "I had this clever line and decided to build a song around it." [...] "Jealous of the Moon", the third track, was co-written by Chris Thile and Gary Louris of Jayhawks fame. This song was released as a promotional single in the United States. The fourth track and first instrumental on Why Should the Fire Die?, [...] "Scotch & Chocolate", earned Nickel Creek a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Instrumental. However, the song lost to the trio's former record producer Alison Krauss with her band Union Station for [...] "Unionhouse Branch", from the band's twelfth album, Lonely Runs Both Ways. As with the first three songs on the album, critics responded favorably to [...] "Scotch & Chocolate". Rolling Stone considered the song to be [...] "Celtic-infused", Slant Magazine named it the best song on the album, and Stylus Magazine [...] called it a [...] "brisk, lively instrumental".

500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E
