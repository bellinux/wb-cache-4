50|$|Skin disease {{caused by}} sarcoptic mites is variably called scabies, {{or in some}} {{countries}} mange. (The adjectives 'mangy' and 'scabby' are used similarly to 'lousy', as both a description of animals probably infested with mites or lice, respectively, and as a general expression of disgust. When wild animals such as foxes and coyotes are sometimes found heavily infested with sarcoptic mites, the description 'mangy' is apt.) Sarcoptes scabiei {{is an example of}} a mite that burrows within the living layers of the epidermis of its host. It infests many species of mammals. (Infestations of humans may be zoonotic, that is: transmitted from a wild or domestic animal, for example to a farmer or veterinarian handling an infested pig. Such an infestation is called a zoonosis. However, the subspecies or strain of S. scabiei adapted to humans is transmitted directly between humans, so it is not zoonotic.) Other sarcoptic mites of importance to livestock are in the genus Knemidokoptes (or Cnemidocoptes) which infest birds. Knemidokoptes gallinae, the depluming itch mite of poultry tends to infest the head and upper body, whilst K. mutans the <b>scaly-leg</b> <b>mite,</b> infests the feet.|$|E
