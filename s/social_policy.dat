40|$|The federal {{arrangement}} post Constitution comes indicating greater accountability {{of federal}} units and municipalities {{in the implementation}} of <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> {{at the same time as}} it gave greater autonomy in tax collection. From the 2000 s, the new rules of <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> in education, health and social assitance has required a greater effort of budgetary resources of the states, the Federal District and municipalities, without the creation or injection of additional tax revenue. In <b>social</b> <b>policies,</b> important legislative changes mark the first decade of this century in Brazil with direct implications on federal arrangement and therefore the co-financing of <b>social</b> <b>policies.</b> The main objective of this article is to analyze the amount of funds invested by the federal government, states, Federal District and municipalities in budget functions: social assistance, health and education, from 2002 to 2012, highlighting the co-financing these <b>social</b> <b>policies.</b> As well as to identify some obstacles created by the fiscal adjustment underway in the country to expand the co-financing of <b>social</b> <b>policies.</b> </p...|$|R

The following is the argumentative strategy that has been chosen: firstly, we will account for the links between <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> and the capitalist regime of accumulation; secondly, we will explain the proposed theoretical links between World Image and policies of emotions; thirdly, we will offer some arguments which show the analytical richness of linking <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> and policies of emotions through the concept of World Image; fourthly, as an example, we will frame the massiveness of <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> as a World Image that transmits emotionalities linked to the reproduction of the regime of accumulation. Lastly, as a conclusion, we ask and warn about some components of <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> which make them stand as tools for coloniality...|$|R

His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.|$|E

He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the debate}} on the relationship between trade liberalization and the harmonization of <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> in the context of European integration. It is divided into two parts. The first shows that harmonization of <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> was not imposed in the 1960 s and 1970 s as a pre-condition for trade liberalization inside the Community mainly due to favourable economic conditions. The second part examines the demand for and the actual measures in favour of harmonizing <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> which have increasingly occurred in the Community since the mid- 1970 s. It is contended that this new regime corresponds to greater heterogeneity and slower growth inside the Community. Renewed efforts to liberalize intra-EC trade in the mid- 1980 s also played a significant part in the shift towards harmonization. EC; Regional Integration; <b>Social</b> <b>Policies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} of present {{research was to}} analyze environmental scores in companies when adopting external <b>social</b> <b>policies.</b> We confirmed that location acts as a differentiating factor. We also analyzed the human rights, community and product responsibility policies interaction with Environmental Scores. Our first hypothesis stated that <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> contribute to orientate companies toward environmental aspects and improving environmental scores. The results supported the assumption that better environmental scores are influenced positively by the promotion of <b>social</b> <b>policies.</b> We can conclude that the promotion of <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> positively affects the environmental orientation of the firm. We can argue that company’s capacity to operate guaranteeing the freedom association and excluding child, forced or compulsory labor, {{to be a good}} citizen protecting public health and to produce quality goods and services is a measure of being more sensible to promote environmental aspects among their structures and processes. The differences between firms that promote external <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> and those that don’t are evident. Finally, we have determined how location moderates the relative impact of each policy in the environmental performance...|$|R

5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.|$|E
