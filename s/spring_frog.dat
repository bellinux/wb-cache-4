40|$|We {{compared}} physiological {{characteristics and}} responses to experimental freezing and thawing in winter and spring samples of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica, indigenous to Interior Alaska, USA. Whereas winter frogs can survive freezing at temperatures at least as low as − 16 °C, the lower limit of tolerance for <b>spring</b> <b>frogs</b> was between − 2. 5 °C and − 5 °C. <b>Spring</b> <b>frogs</b> had comparatively low levels of the urea in blood plasma, liver, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, {{as well as a}} smaller hepatic reserve of glycogen, which is converted to glucose after freezing begins. Consequently, following freezing (− 2. 5 °C, 48 [*]h) tissue concentrations of these cryoprotective osmolytes were 44 – 88 % lower than those measured in winter <b>frogs.</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>frogs</b> formed much more ice and incurred extensive cryohemolysis and lactate accrual, indicating that they had suffered marked cell damage and hypoxic stress during freezing. Multiple, interactive stresses, in addition to diminished cryoprotectant levels, contribute to the reduced capacity for freeze tolerance in posthibernal frogs...|$|R

40|$|The Iieural {{effects of}} calcium {{deficiency}} and the antagonism of these effects by various drugs {{have been under}} investigation in this laboratory. During the course of these studies Abood et al. (1962) reported that ATP 4 and other organic PhosPhates are lost from nerves immisersed in Ca-free Ringer solution. At about the same time, Ebashi and Lipmann (1962) reported an up to 1400 -fold concentration of Ca by isolateol menu-brane fragments from skeletal muscle imi the presence of ATP.

50|$|Adult wood frogs spend {{summer months}} in moist woodlands, forested swamps, ravines, or bogs. During the fall, they leave summer {{habitats}} and migrate to neighboring uplands to overwinter. Some may remain in moist areas to overwinter. Hibernacula {{tend to be}} in the upper organic layers of the soil, under leaf litter. By overwintering in uplands adjacent to breeding pools, adults ensure a short migration to thawed pools in early <b>spring.</b> Wood <b>frogs</b> are mostly diurnal and are rarely seen at night, except maybe in breeding choruses. They are one of the first amphibians to emerge for breeding right when the snow melts, along with spring peepers.|$|R

50|$|The Horned Frogs' formal spring {{practice}} {{ran from}} February 28 through April 10. In their April 9 <b>spring</b> game, the <b>Frogs</b> were without quarterback Trevone Boykin, who underwent minor {{surgery on his}} non-throwing wrist prior to the final week of spring practice. The focus of spring ball was squarely on the defense, where Coach Patterson must replace 5 starters, including 2 linebackers. Offensive coordinators Meacham and Cumbie, meanwhile, focused on improving the year-old up-tempo offense and identifying a backup quarterback.|$|R
50|$|Freezing-point {{depression}} {{is used by}} some organisms that live in extreme cold. Such creatures have evolved means through which they can produce high concentration of various compounds such as sorbitol and glycerol. This elevated concentration of solute decreases the freezing point of the water inside them, preventing the organism from freezing solid even as the water around them freezes, or as the air around them becomes very cold. Examples of organisms that produce antifreeze compounds include some species of arctic-living fish such as the rainbow smelt, which produces glycerol and other molecules to survive in frozen-over estuaries during the winter months. In other animals, such as the <b>spring</b> peeper <b>frog</b> (Pseudacris crucifer), the molality is increased temporarily {{as a reaction to}} cold temperatures. In the case of the peeper frog, freezing temperatures trigger a large scale breakdown of glycogen in the frog's liver and subsequent release of massive amounts of glucose into the blood.|$|R
5000|$|The mating [...] "ceremonies" [...] {{begin in}} <b>spring,</b> when adult <b>frogs</b> congregate on sandy and/or rocky bars to mate. Previously {{believed}} to mate from March to May, recent experiments {{have shown the}} time to be closer to April to late June. High stream velocities, however, may dislodge R. boylii egg masses from oviposition substrates. Thus, R. boylii avoids rapid waters to protect the egg masses from being swept away. This technique is why the species has a long breeding season. If the conditions do not meet their standards, they refuse to mate and wait until the water velocities go back down to ideal.|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteria}} in the large intestines of 10 northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were enumerated and partially characterized. Four nonhibernating frogs were collected in the summer, four hibernating frogs were collected in the winter, and two frogs just emerged from hibernation were collected in the <b>spring.</b> All <b>frogs</b> had about 10 (10) bacteria per g (wet weight) of intestinal contents and about 10 (9) bacteria per g (wet weight) of mucosal scraping, although the counts from the winter frogs were slightly less than those from {{the other two groups}} of frogs. Another group of 14 summer frogs, after treatment to induce hibernation, showed a drop in bacterial counts accompanied by a change in the composition of the flora. In most frogs, Bacteroides was the dominant organism. Other bacteria repeatedly isolated at high dilutions were strict anaerobes, including butyrigenic and acetogenic helically coiled bacteria; fusobacteria; and acetogenic, small, gram-positive bacilli. These data indicate that the intestinal flora of frogs {{is similar to that of}} mammals and birds and that this flora can be maintained at temperatures close to freezing...|$|R

5000|$|The natural {{habitats}} of R. arboreus are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, freshwater marshes, and irrigated land. These small tree frogs spend their adult lives in trees and forests, and in breeding season gather around water sources to mate. They {{lay their eggs}} within a batch of sponge-like foam which is suspended from a tree branch, usually hanging over a pond, marsh, or slow-flowing stream. The tadpoles emerge from the eggs, wiggle {{their way out of}} the foam, and drop down into the water below. These batches of foam can often be seen hanging over ponds in the Japanese countryside in late <b>spring.</b> Sometimes the <b>frogs</b> mistakenly lay their eggs over inappropriate bodies of water, such as swimming pools, wells, or even buckets containing rainwater.|$|R
40|$|One night {{recently}} I stayed overnight at the fi eld centre where I work. The G. W. Finlayson Field Centre is a {{day centre}} operated by the Peel District School Board. It is located just south of Orangeville on a beautiful piece of land with all the features that a good outdoor environmental education centre should have. As I {{was sitting at the}} computer catching up on paperwork I stopped to listen to the frogs chorusing in the ponds and swamps. There were so many of them. I tried to identify the different types of frogs from their voices. It took me some time as their songs blended together, becoming louder and then softer again. There were wood <b>frogs,</b> chorus <b>frogs,</b> <b>spring</b> peepers, green <b>frogs</b> and I think an occasional bullfrog. Students on wetland hikes are amazed that each type of frog has its own song. They are all frogs, but each has its own unique characteristics and needs, just like the students who visit the centre. The students who visit the Peel fi eld centres come from varied cultural and religious backgrounds. The Peel District School Board website is available in 17 different languages. The board also has a Faith Forward program with a community liaison coordinator that publishes a Holy Days and Holidays Calendar each year. This calendar helps to familiarize employees of the board with 12 different religions, customs and holidays. It is a tool to help welcome all students to the board and its facilities. As an outdoor educator I {{think it is important to}} recognize, adapt and support the diversity of the students who visit our facilities.

5000|$|The Pacific tree frog begins mating {{in early}} winter to early <b>spring.</b> Since these <b>frogs</b> are so {{widespread}} geographically, their breeding season {{is thought to}} be determined by local conditions. When it is time, the males migrate to the water. They then make a call at the same time, calling [...] "ooh-yeeh" [...] or ribbiting loudly. This lures the females to the water and they mate. The females lay their eggs in clumps of 10-90, and usually put them on and under vegetation and leaf litter in the pond. Females usually lay their eggs in shallow, calm water that has little action around it. If they survive, embryos will hatch into tadpoles within one to three weeks. The tadpoles feed on periphyton, filamentous algae, diatoms, and pollen in or {{on the surface of the}} water. They feed using suction, and a beak-like structure that helps scrape vegetation off surfaces.|$|R
