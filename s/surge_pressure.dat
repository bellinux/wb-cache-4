With full consideration of the important factors such as wave velocity, gas influx rate, pressure, temperature, and well depth, a new <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> model has been proposed based on the mass conservation equations and the momentum conservation equations during MPD operations.

40|$|The {{importance}} of ECD prediction was recognized {{at an early}} stage of the drilling history. Narrow pressure windows make the ECD prediction even more important. The variation in ECD with respect to surge and swab pressures is more or less dependent on the tripping velocity of the pipe string. When tripping into a hole the pipe movement causes positive pressures know as surge pressures, while the swab pressures are negative pressures which normally occur during tripping out of the hole. However swab pressures can occur when the string is decelerated during tripping into the hole, likewise surge pressures can occur when tripping out of the hole. According to Burkhardt, there are mainly three effects which can lead to surge pressures; pressure generated by breaking of gelled mud, pressure generated by inertia of mud column and pressure generated from viscous drag of mud column [9]. Clearly the viscous drag of the mud column is the most important contribution to the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure,</b> and also the most complicated one. Burkhardt developed a complicated method which involved finding the viscous drag component of the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> by utilizing a friction factor in the fanning equation. This method was found to complicated for Matlab implementation since it needed several values read from graphs. However approximated Burkhardt equations for laminar and turbulent flow were found useful. The <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> could also be found by approximating equations to the computed Bingham pressure loss model for variation in Vp. These equations were in turn corrected with a correction factor for each mud parameter and geometry, by variation of mud parameter, giving a set of New Formulas valid for a range of mud parameters. The two models were implemented in a Matlab script together with the Bingham pressure loss model meant to compute the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> with real-time parameters for a case study. Since the models only evaluated the viscous drag of the mud column, they were considered as steady-state models. The steady-state model did not give good results compared to the measured <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> for the case study. However steady-state models were found useful when identifying the peak <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> at peak velocity. Addition of pressure effects from inertia of mud column and pressure generated by gelled mud gave good results compared to the measured pressure for the case study. However the two models used requires further field validation before they are accepted as a good surge and swab predictors. It is also recommended that compressibility and tubular elasticity are included to achieve full transformation to a dynamic surge model. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In a {{piped water}} {{distribution}} system, {{one of the}} hazards in water mains is frequent damage including rupture of the pipe line. The major cause of water hammer is rapid generation of <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> mainly due to sudden closure of valve. The occurrence of water hammer is however depends in various flow conditions and characteristics. In a steady state, the pipe flow may be laminar or turbulent. The factors such as pressure, viscosity, frictional stress plays a vital role for occurrence of water hammer. On the other hand, the pipe characteristics namely, material, thickness, length and diameters are all important in this connection. The gradual or rapid closure of valve is also considerable in water hammer study. A one-dimensional propagation of water surge in a pipe material has been studied theoretically with a simple conservation of energy model. The numerical solution for different times of valve closing, pipe materials, lengths, diameter has been worked out. It has been observed that the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> depends intensely with time, pipe material and diameter; however, not much dependent on length.

40|$|Shell has {{developed}} a novel mono-diameter well concept {{for oil and gas}} wells as opposed to the traditional telescopic well design. A Mono- diameter well contains multiple casing sections with the same internal diameter. This is achieved by expansion of the casing sections concerned using an expansion cone. Since the well is drilled in stages and casings are inserted to support the open hole, an overlap section between two consecutive (expandable) casings exists which has to be expanded. When the cone enters the overlap section, the expansion force increases dramatically due to the expansion of two casings, cured cement and formation layers. When the cone finalizes the expansion of the overlap section it pops out, the expansion force vanishes and the cone accelerates upwards and it generates an empty volume to be filled by the well fluid (mud). As a result of this, fluid starts to flow through the drill pipe, around the cone and the fluid volume below the cone starts to decompress. This induces a <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> wave traveling upwards and a swab pressure wave in the expanded casing traveling downwards. If the pressure difference between outside and inside of the expanded casing exceeds the collapse rating of the casing, the casing will collapse which leads to the loss of the concerned well section. Repair of such a failure costs time and money, therefore this swab pressure must be well predicted to enable the installation process to be designed such that this collapse can be avoided. A model of fully coupled fluid-structure interaction between cone and the well fluid is built for calculating the swab pressure propagating downward and <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> propagating upward resulted from transient process occurring after cone pops out. This model has shown an effective tool for predicting the swabbing pressure in field deployments performed lately in Gulf of Mexico and according to its output the suitable cone is selected {{in order to avoid the}} casing collapse.

The system showed high Reynolds number indicating turbulent flow and the Mach number in pipe IV as high as 3. 6 indicating supersonic flow. The consequence of the pressure drop is column separation or cavitations. If the bubbles collapse, re-surge pressures occur leading to possible leakages and rupture of the pipes.

The Core spacecraft's propulsion system is a blowdown monopropellant system with an initial hydrazine load of 545 kg in a single composite overwrapped propellant tank. At launch, the propulsion system contained propellant in the tank and manifold tubes upstream of the latch valves, with low-pressure helium gas in the manifold tubes downstream of the latch valves.
