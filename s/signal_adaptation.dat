This mechanism goes beyond entrainment since it works for any initial frequencies and the learned frequency stays encoded in the system even if the driving signal disappears. Interestingly, this mechanism can easily be applied to a large class of oscillators from harmonic oscillators to relaxation types and strange attractors. Several practical applications of this mechanism are then presented, ranging from adaptive control of compliant robots to frequency analysis of signals and construction of limit cycles of arbitrary shape.

Looking {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{sensorimotor}} behaviours, which entails rep-resentation of the visually perceived target and transformation of this representation in a motor signal, which moves the eye to center the target object in the field of view. Looking facilitates memory formation, bringing objects into the portion of the reti-nal space with a higher resolution. It also helps to align the internal representations of space with the physical environment. In this chapter, we present a neural-dynamic architecture, which integrates several processes, involved in looking, such as target selection, generation of motor <b>signal,</b> <b>adaptation</b> of gaze shift’s amplitude, memory formation, scene exploration, and the coordinate transformations.

40|$|Mobilization of {{neutrophils}} {{from the}} bone marrow determines neutrophil blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil mobilization from {{the bone marrow}} depends on the retention-promoting che- mokine CXCL 12 and its receptor CXCR 4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL 2 and its receptor CXCR 2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in neu- trophil retention and egression ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to neutrophil egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retention signal pre- dominated, egression time strictly depended on {{the time it took}} Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice lacking the Rac inhibitor ArhGAP 15. Neutrophils in these mice showed prolonged Rac adaptation and cell-autonomous retention in the bone marrow.

Steady-state lateral inhibition coefficients, derived from the very low-frequency response, average 0. 04 at three interommatidial spacings. The gain vs. frequency of a singly illuminated ommatidium is described closely from 0. 004 to 0. 4 cps by the linear transfer function s 0. 25; this function also accounts approximately for the measured phase leads, the small <b>signal</b> <b>adaptation</b> following small step inputs, and for Pinter's (1966) earlier low-frequency generator potential data.

The poss-ible involvement of a GTP-binding protein (G-protein) in this IP 3 signal transduction pathway was investigated by studying the effects on such permeabilized amoebae of added GTP and non-hydrolysable GTP analogues. While GDP pro-duced only very minor effects, stimulation of the amoebae (in the absence of added cyclic AMP) with GTP or the non-hydrolysable GTP ana-logues GTPyS (guanosine S'-O-(3 -thio-triphos-phate)) and Gpp(NH) p (5 -guanylylimido-diphosphate) induced transient formation of IP 3 in an oscillatory manner, with peaks similar in magnitude and timing to those elicited by cyclic AMP.

Several studies have now shown that spectral properties of bird song differ between {{urban and rural}} environments. Previously this has been attributed to competition for acoustic space as a result of low-frequency noise present in cities. However, the physical structure of urban areas may have a contributory effect. Here we investigate the sound degradation properties of woodland and city environments using both urban and rural great tit song. We show that although urban surroundings caused significantly less degradation to both songs, the transmission efficiency of rural song compared to urban song was significantly lower in the city. While differences between the two songs in woodland were generally minimal, some measures of the transmission efficiency of rural song were significantly lower than those of urban song, suggesting additional benefits to singing rural songs in this setting. In an attempt to create artificial urban song, we mimicked the increase in minimum frequency found several times previously in urban song. However, this did not replicate the same transmission properties as true urban song, suggesting changes in other song characteristics, such as temporal adjustments, are needed to further increase transmission of an avian signal in the city.

Within populations, larger males were redder and blacker, and better-condition males were blacker. Among populations, red colour was positively correlated with the amount of orange-red light present, suggesting that males are likely optimizing signal conspicuousness by producing proportionally larger and redder patches in broad spectrum environments with more orange-red light.
