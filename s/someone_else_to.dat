5|$|At the Lisbon Conference, {{the members}} of NATO agreed to appoint a Secretary General who would direct the organisation's staff and serve as Vice-Chairman of the Atlantic Council. The {{position}} was initially offered to Sir Oliver Franks, but he declined. As such, the allies scrambled to find <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> take the position. Two weeks later, the countries agreed to ask Ismay to become Secretary General {{at the suggestion of}} Churchill and Anthony Eden.|$|E
5|$|Following Governor Madison's death, Secretary of State Charles Stewart Todd {{offered to}} step down if Slaughter {{preferred}} to appoint <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> the post. The letter was not an explicit resignation, as Todd emphatically declared his intention to work with Slaughter should the governor choose to retain him. Slaughter did replace Todd with former Senator John Pope, however, apparently as a political favor. This move proved disastrous for Slaughter's political career. Todd was very popular {{by virtue of being}} the son-in-law of twice-governor Shelby. By contrast, Pope was extremely unpopular for his vote in the U.S. Senate against declaring war in the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Seth MacFarlane voices {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane {{chose to}} voice these characters himself, believing {{it would be easier}} to portray the voices he had already envisioned than for <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his own voice while portraying Brian.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{was cast}} as {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire.

Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. The voice of Quagmire was inspired by fast-speaking radio advertising spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one-time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E

5|$|Seth MacFarlane voices {{three of}} the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Stewie Griffin. Since MacFarlane had a strong vision for these characters, he chose to voice them himself, believing {{it would be easier}} than for <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> attempt it.

MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time-only characters, most prominently those of the Griffins' neighbor Glenn Quagmire, news anchor Tom Tucker, and Lois' father, Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E
5|$|Free-labor proponents in the East {{also wanted}} to create a similar {{organization}} in the western states. In the 1840s members of the Salem Free Produce Association approached Coffin to see if he would be interested in managing the proposed Western Free Produce Association. At first he declined, saying he lacked the money required to fund the venture, and {{that he did not want}} to move into the city. In 1845 a group of abolitionist businessmen opened a wholesale mercantile business in Cincinnati and the Free Produce Association raised $3,000 to help stock the new warehouse with goods. Different groups continued to pressure Coffin to accept a position as the new business's director, claiming there were no other western abolitionists qualified to manage the enterprise. Reluctantly, he finally agreed to oversee the warehouse for five years, in which time he could train <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> run it, and in 1847 Levi and Catharine Coffin moved to Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Mac {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When Caroline meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. Mac and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where Mac tells Guy {{he is going to}} die {{in a couple of weeks}} and makes Guy promise he will not tell Caroline. However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying it would be better for her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

The society recruited 11 extra full-time staff in January 1968 for the campaign, and appointed Admiral of the Fleet Sir Caspar John as its figurehead. The campaign was handled on a day-to-day basis by Mark Wolfson, the Head of Youth Services for the Society.|$|E

25|$|The {{instrumental}} case {{is present}} in the Hungarian language, where it serves several purposes. The main purpose {{is the same as the}} above, i.e. the means with which an action occurs. It has a role in the -(t)at- causative form of verbs, that is, the form of a verb that shows the subject caused <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> action the verb. In this sense, the instrumental case is used to mark the person that was caused to execute the action expressed by the verb. It is also used to quantify or qualify words such as 'better' or 'ago', such as sokkal jobban 'much better' (literally 'with-much better'); hét évvel ezelőtt 'seven years ago' (literally 'seven with-years before this').|$|E
25|$|UDDTs are {{sometimes}} considered too expensive compared to pit latrines, but this criticism {{does not include}} the cost of emptying pits and the potential value of fertilizers that can be recycled via UDDTs should the users wish to do so (noting that most UDDT installations worldwide currently do not reuse excreta in agriculture). Rather than looking only at construction costs, long-term operational costs and benefits should also be considered, especially since the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may be a significant expense. When a period of for example 10 years is considered, UDDTs may well be the more economical alternative, since the emptying of feces vaults is simple and safer, thus less expensive, even if users decide to enter into a contract with <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do this.|$|E

It concurs with Kurth's theory that Hill may have faked his death, suggesting that he arranged for <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> be killed in his place. The journalist Jerry Buck noted in an article preceding the film's debut on NBC that the face of the shooting victim had been battered and that there were anomalies in the autopsy report, notably that Hill had a different eye color from that recorded for the dead person. Buck also wrote that Hill was in financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service in 1972 and facing a murder case against him. Sightings of Hill had also been reported in Mexico and New York City.|$|E
