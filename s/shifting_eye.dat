2500|$|A {{separate}} {{body of research}} has implicated the posterior superior temporal sulcus {{in the perception of}} intentionality in human action; this area is also involved in perceiving biological motion, including body, eye, mouth, and point-light display motion. One study found increased pSTS activation while watching a human lift his hand versus having his hand pushed up by a piston (intentional versus unintentional action). [...] Several studies have found increased pSTS activation when subjects perceive a human action that is incongruent with the action expected from the actor's context and inferred intention. Examples would be: a human performing a reach-to-grasp motion on empty space next to an object, versus grasping the object; a human <b>shifting</b> <b>eye</b> gaze toward empty space next to a checkerboard target versus shifting gaze toward the target; an unladen human turning on a light with his knee, versus turning on a light with his knee while carrying a pile of books; and a walking human pausing as he passes behind a bookshelf, versus walking at a constant speed. [...] In these studies, actions in the [...] "congruent" [...] case have a straightforward goal, and are easy to explain in terms of the actor's intention. The incongruent actions, on the other hand, require further explanation (why would someone twist empty space next to a gear?), and then apparently would demand more processing in the STS. [...] Note that this region is distinct from the temporo-parietal area activated during false belief tasks. [...] Also note that pSTS activation in most of the above studies was largely right-lateralized, following the general trend in neuroimaging studies of social cognition and perception. Also right-lateralized are the TPJ activation during false belief tasks, the STS response to biological motion, and the FFA response to faces.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: On close inspection, most saccadic trajectories are not straight, but curve slightly, i. e. {{they are}} not {{single-axis}} ocular rotations. We asked whether saccade curvatures are systematically influenced by static ocular counterroll (OCR). METHODS: OCR was elicited by static whole-body roll position. Eight healthy human subjects performed horizontal and vertical saccades (amplitude: 10 degrees; eccentricity: 0 degrees and 10 degrees; head-fixed coordinate system) in upright and ear-down whole-body roll positions (45 degrees right, 45 degrees left). Three-dimensional eye movements were recorded with modified dual search coils at 1000 Hz. RESULTS: Saccade curvature was systematically modulated by OCR depending on saccade direction. In the horizontal-vertical plane, primarily vertical saccades were modulated with downward saccades curving towards the upper ear and upward saccades curving towards the lower ear. Modulation of saccade curvature in the torsional direction only correlated significantly with OCR in abducting saccades. CONCLUSIONS: No universal mechanism like visual-motor coordinate transformation or kinematical characteristics of the saccadic burst generator alone could explain the complex modulation pattern of saccade curvature. OCR-induced changes of the ocular motor plant, including transient force imbalances between agonist eye muscles (vertical rectus and oblique muscles) and <b>shifting</b> <b>eye</b> muscle pulleys, are suitable to explain the found direction-dependent modulation pattern...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWithin a {{duration}} of 20 ms humans can compare the orientations of two test lines {{so as to}} encode and place in memory their mean orientation and orientation difference while ignoring noise lines {{in the space between}} the test lines. Furthermore, performance is not impaired by randomly varying the location of each test line from trial-to-trial. We conclude that the two test lines are not compared by <b>shifting</b> <b>eye</b> fixation or attention from one to the other, nor by attending to two spatial locations. This evidence is consistent with the proposal that the human visual system contains second-stage long-distance comparators, any one of which responds to simultaneous stimulation of two conventional first-stage spatial filters located some distance apart and is insensitive to stimuli that fall between these two first-stage filters. We suggest that our observers performed discriminations by attending to the outputs of the proposed second-stage long-distance comparators rather than by attending to two spatial locations. In addition to their mean orientation and orientation difference, humans can simultaneously encode and place in memory the separation and mean location of the two test lines while ignoring stimuli in the space between the lines. We suggest that, following each of the eye's exploratory saccades, the proposed second-stage long-distance comparators, in effect, take a snapshot of an object's retinal image that ignores the object's surface texture while encoding the shape of its boundary...|$|E

40|$|Children {{with autism}} have deficits in social {{interactions}} and {{verbal and nonverbal}} communication and engagement in rigid and repetitive activities and/or interests (ASA, 2008). A joint attention (JA) repertoire {{has been identified as}} a behavioral cusp for later social development and thus, JA deficits serve as an early indicator for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (Vismara 2 ̆ 6 Lyons, 2007; Whalen 2 ̆ 6 Schbreibman, 2003). A JA repertoire consists of both responses to- and initiations for-bids for coordinated attention. Previous research has shown teaching strategies such as pivotal response and discrete trial training for joint attention skills to be effective (Vismara 2 ̆ 6 Lyons, 2007; Whalen 2 ̆ 6 Schreibman, 2003). The purpose of the current study was to evaluate a mixture of pivotal response and discrete trial training as an intervention method for training joint attention behaviors with children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in a home setting. In addition, this study evaluated the effects of interspersing targets during training and incorporated generalization probes to assess JA initiations in the form of <b>shifting</b> <b>eye</b> gaze and pointing. Lastly this study examined a parent training procedure to determine if it would promote maintenance after skill acquisition. Results show that all targets were acquired when taught simultaneously. The results show that 2 of the 3 participants made JA initiations during probes throughout intervention. Lastly, the results indicated that parent training did not help maintain JA responding for participant one...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccurate saccadic and vergence eye {{movements}} towards selected visual {{targets are}} fundamental {{to perceive the}} 3 -D environment. Despite this importance, <b>shifts</b> in <b>eye</b> gaze are not always perfect given that they are frequently followed by small corrective eye movements. The oculomotor system receives distinct information from various visual cues that may cause incongruity in the planning of a gaze shift. To test this idea, we analyzed eye movements in humans performing a saccade task in a 3 -D setting. We show that saccades and vergence movements towards peripheral targets are guided by monocular (perceptual) cues. Approximately 200 ms {{after the start of}} fixation at the perceived target, a fixational saccade corrected the eye positions to the physical target location. Our findings suggest that <b>shifts</b> in <b>eye</b> gaze occur in two phases; a large eye movement toward the perceived target location followed by a corrective saccade that directs the eyes to the physical target location...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether results of athletes' eye movements while they observe fencing attacks reflect their actual information pickup by comparing these results with others gained with {{temporal and spatial}} occlusion and cuing techniques. Fifteen top-ranking expert fencers, 15 advanced fencers, and 32 sport students predicted the target region of 405 fencing attacks on a computer monitor. Results of eye movement recordings showed a stronger foveal fixation on the opponent's trunk and weapon in the two fencer groups. Top-ranking expert fencers fixated particularly on the upper trunk. This matched their performance decrements in the spatial occlusion condition. However, when the upper trunk was occluded, participants also <b>shifted</b> <b>eye</b> movements to neighboring body regions. Adding cues to the video material had no positive effects on prediction performance. We conclude that gaze behavior does not necessarily represent information pickup, but that studies applying the spatial occlusion paradigm should also register eye movements to avoid underestimating the information contributed by occluded regions. © 2010 The Psychonomic Society, Inc...|$|R
