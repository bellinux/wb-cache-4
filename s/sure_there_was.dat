5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E
25|$|The Emperor's {{opinion was}} that the gap in opinion could most likely be bridged. An initial set of demands was drafted during the Council meeting. Over the next few days, the demands were reinforced, {{possibly}} {{with the help of}} the German Foreign Office to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a war, and made more iron-clad and difficult for Serbia to accept.|$|E
25|$|DreamWorks began {{production}} in 2001, which was actually {{before the first}} film was even completed. DreamWorks made <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something new to see in Shrek 2 by putting more human characters in the film than there were in its predecessor and improving their appearance, {{with the use of}} a few systems that dealt with hair and fur to improve its appearance and movement. The set up for all the characters was done in the first three years of production. Puss in Boots required a whole new set of tools in the film to handle his fur, belt and feather plume in his hat. The character also required an upgrade in the fur shader for his introduction in the film.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Treasury {{was nearly}} out {{of gold in}} 1895, at {{the depths of the}} Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal {{government}} to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.|$|E
500|$|The Cenacle was run {{under the}} {{supervision}} of [...] Dom C. Shiarella, the treasurer of the First National Bank in New Kensington and the cashier of the Building Fund Campaign. He was in charge of collecting all of the pledges made [...] toward the Building Fund. This work kept him in the bank for one or two hours longer than the other employees every evening. This went on for almost five years. [...] Mr. Shiarella was also in charge of making <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> enough money in the church's bank account for the payroll that was taken out every other Friday. The needed funds were always collected in time and there was never a week when the account bounced.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning did {{not enjoy}} the green theme in the episode, reasoning that it [...] "just seemed {{to get in the}} way of everything else happening in 'Sun Tea'." [...] He was not thrilled with Jack and Tracy's storyline, noting it was missing heart and emotion, and overall it felt [...] "flat". Canning felt that Al Gore's cameo was [...] "fun but wholly unnecessary." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave [...] "Sun Tea" [...] a mixed review, noting [...] "I don't know how funny it was, though. I mean, <b>sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still a ton of great lines tonight... but not all of them hit the mark like they usually do." [...] Nonetheless, Sassone concluded [...] "...any 30 Rock episode with Dr. Spaceman and a couple of digs at NBC's Green Week is still a pretty good one." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said this episode of 30 Rock was [...] "even more of a comedy drag race than usual." ...|$|E

500|$|Bennet cut {{her hair}} for the season, {{in order to}} further her character's {{transformation}} to the Daisy Johnson / Quake of the comics, while not cutting her hair as short as her comic counterpart. Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She feels very empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs I saw in the comics. In the style lines, I wanted to pay {{a little bit of a}} tribute to [...] tactical ability from last season, but we also incorporated the Quake symbol into her gauntlets and on the back of her suit." [...] Legacy Effects created the gauntlets and utility belt, [...] "out of flexible materials painted to look like metal" [...] so as not to injure anyone during stunts.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{waterboarding}} {{seemed to}} be very extended in the Spanish detention centers in the 1500s. Books from the time explain how to treat persons in custody, and used this [...] "light" [...] form of torture. After a specific way of beating, body, legs and arms, it was detailed how to pour 4 cuartillos (approx. 2.5 liters) of water over mouth and nose, with a covering cloth, making <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some cloth introduced in the mouth so water could also get in.|$|E

2500|$|In 1908, [...] the Port Blakely Mill Company {{decided to}} run its steamer Monticello 2 in {{competition}} with the Navy Yard Route's steamers, including Inland Flyer. [...] On July 9, 1909, at {{the wreck of the}} Yosemite, Inland Flyer stood by with other vessels to assist, helping make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no loss of life when the big excursion sidewheeler went on the rocks near Bremerton. [...] In 1910 the Navy Yard Route sold Inland Flyer to Capt. F.G. Reeve, who was doing business as the Port Washington Route. [...] He renamed the vessel Mohawk.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} rumours circulating {{that the special}} would be Jenna Coleman's last on the show. Coleman and Steven Moffat remained quiet on the issue and insisted that people watch the episode to see whether she would be continuing into the ninth series. During the episode's climax, Clara decides to continue travelling with the Doctor, and Moffat revealed following the episode's airing that Coleman would appear {{in all of the}} ninth series. Coleman was apparently due to leave the show, but wasn't really <b>sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a lot of [...] "to-ing and fro-ing" [...] according to Moffat about whether she was going to leave, but ultimately she decided to stay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{threat of}} a RICO {{indictment}} unnerved many at Drexel. [...] A RICO indictment would have required the firm {{to put up a}} performance bond of as much as $1 billion in lieu of having its assets frozen. [...] This provision was put in the law because organized crime had a habit of absconding with the funds of indicted companies, and the writers of RICO wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something to seize or forfeit {{in the event of a}} guilty verdict. [...] Unfortunately, most of Drexel's capital was borrowed money, as is common with most Wall Street firms (in Drexel's case, 96 percent—by far the most of any firm). [...] This debt would have to take second place to this performance bond. [...] Additionally, if the bond ever had to be paid, Drexel's stockholders would have been all but wiped out. [...] Due to this, banks will not extend credit to a firm under a RICO indictment.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the 2004 election, the {{character}} was fully developed. In creating the character, which is designed to be repellant but entertaining, Colbert conferred with Stewart and Karlin. In expressing his hope that his character not be [...] "an asshole," [...] Stewart remarked, [...] "You're not an asshole. You're an idiot. There's a difference." [...] Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, [...] "There is an essential innocence to his character." [...] Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format. Despite this, The Colbert Report was designed {{as an extension of the}} satiric goals of The Daily Show, combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor. To make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no overlap in subject matter with The Daily Show, Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts. For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each Daily Show in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show.|$|E
2500|$|At times, {{production}} designer David Willson has {{to build}} entire sets, or props for sets, from scratch instead of finding an available alternative. For [...] "Witness", David Willson found an abandoned warehouse {{to use for}} the scene where Clark is thrown into a furnace by the three kryptonite-powered thieves. In the warehouse, Willson built a , [...] blast furnace. In [...] "Visitor", David Willson and his production crew built a [...] "practical, functioning" [...] tower for {{the scene in the}} woods where Cyrus attempts to call for his alien transport. Willson's inspiration came while working on Love Field, starring Denzel Washington and Michelle Pfeiffer. While working on the project, Willson met a man named Bowler Simpson, who had built a [...] memorial, to his deceased daughter, out of old license plates and STOP signs. Willson used this image when constructing Cyrus's tower. Even though the tower was physically built, Entity FX still stepped in to create 2-D light beams located on the tower. Willson also likes to add elements to his sets that correlate thematically with the episode, like in [...] "Red", where Clark is exposed to red kryptonite. Here, Willson emphasized the [...] "red theme"; working with director Jeff Woolnough, Willson tried to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something red [...] "popping-out" [...] to catch the audiences' attention in each scene. This would include red objects in the foreground and background, as well as red lenses added to the cameras. Going along with the theme of colors in the show, Metropolis was given a [...] "glass and steel and blue wash of color" [...] for the look of the city. The crew found a new building in Vancouver, which was not yet occupied, and turned it into LuthorCorp plaza. By coincidence, the building sat neighboring the Marine Building, which Gough and Millar had always seen as becoming the Daily Planet building for the series, as the Marine Building held an [...] "art deco structure from the 1930s" [...] they felt embodied what their version of the Daily Planet would look like.|$|E
