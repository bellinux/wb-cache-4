5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and <b>so</b> <b>be</b> enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E
5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing who I am and what I want out of life, then <b>so</b> <b>be</b> it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E

60|$|Last January, {{when we were}} {{beginning}} to inquire about a home for this summer, I remembered that Abbott Thayer had said, three years before, that the New Hampshire highlands was a good place. He was right--it was a good place. Any place that is good for an artist in paint is good for an artist in morals and ink. Brush <b>is</b> here, too; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Col. T. W. Higginson; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Raphael Pumpelly; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Mr. Secretary Hitchcock; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Henderson; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Learned; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Summer; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Franklin MacVeigh; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Joseph L. Smith; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Henry Copley Greene, when I am not occupying his house, which I am doing this season. Paint, literature, science, statesmanship, history, professorship, law, morals,--these are all represented here, yet crime is substantially unknown.|$|R

The New Year's call was also purely American, but that is now as extinct as the dodo, though I believe the other American festivities are still known in the rural districts." ...|$|R

25|$|In the 1990s, Emirates {{launched}} its {{first set of}} commercials with the slogan <b>So</b> <b>be</b> good to yourself, Fly Emirates. In 1999, they launched a very rare A330-200 launch commercial with different pictures showing their aircraft with the original logo and the current logo (which was launched a few months before).|$|E
25|$|Also of {{interest}} amongst the finds is a jar with a painted {{scene at the}} top where two warriors fight surrounded by areas of cross-hatching (with a fruit tree).

25|$|The {{process of}} {{force-feeding}} can make animals sick by stressing the liver. If the stress is prolonged, excess protein may build up and clump together as amyloids, consumption {{of which has}} been found to induce amyloidosis in laboratory mice. It has been hypothesized this may be a route of transmission in humans too and <b>so</b> <b>be</b> a risk for people with inflammatory complaints such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Reciprocity. It {{reflects}} both {{a desire}} to limit the scope of free-riding that may arise because of the MFN rule, and {{a desire to}} obtain better access to foreign markets. A related point is that for a nation to negotiate, it is necessary that the gain from doing <b>so</b> <b>be</b> greater than the gain available from unilateral liberalization; reciprocal concessions intend to ensure that such gains will materialise.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{was named}} the 'bogan capital of Australia' with Taswegians earning four spots in the final. This {{prompted}} a response from Luke Martin, CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, who affirmed that Tasmanians are friendly, down to earth and want people to share their stories and if that makes them bogans, <b>so</b> <b>be</b> it. On the island of Tasmania, half the population has literacy and/or numeracy difficulties, and {{the unemployment rate is}} higher than it is in mainland Australia.|$|E

Besides, for further encouragement, read Jeremiah 3, 33:25,26, 51:5, Ezekiel 36:25, Hosea 14:1-4; and stay thyself, and wonder at the riches of the grace of God.|$|R

25|$|Relatively new to Laredoans, this {{mountain}} bike trail is approximately 4 miles of single-track dirt trails, widening occasionally to double-track. Some technical parts make this trail challenging, {{but not impossible}} for beginners who can briefly walk their bikes before getting on their way again. Thorned shrubs and cacti encompass bikers, <b>so</b> <b>be</b> careful! The trail is well-marked and improvements continue {{to be seen as}} the months go by. The trail is located off Shiloh Road at the end of Livingston Road.|$|E
25|$|One {{argument}} against {{this is that}} the native life would be more adapted to the conditions there. However, we have experience on Earth that species moved from one continent to another may be able to outcompete the native life adapted to that continent; rabbits introduced to Australia are able to outcompete the marsupials already there. The same may be true for micro-organisms introduced to other planets. Additionally, evolutionary processes on Earth might have explored biological pathways not explored by life on other planets and <b>so</b> <b>be</b> able to out compete it. The same is also possible the other way around for back contamination.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April 2004, {{the unusually}} large rate of {{increase}} in atmospheric pressure led to an airlock and failure of hydraulic pressure on eight of the Class 357 trains which caused their computer's software to lower their pantographs and <b>so</b> <b>be</b> unable to collect power from the overhead lines, causing service disruption. However, after their teething problems were sorted out, they have since been the most reliable fleet of EMUs in the United Kingdom, winning Best Modern Era EMU at the Golden Spanners Awards from 2005 to 2007, for an average annual miles per casualty (MPC) figure of 43,180 in 2005, 37,391 in 2006, and 45,459 in 2007 (defined {{as the number of}} miles a train runs before a defect develops causing 5 minutes or longer delay).|$|E

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but <b>so</b> <b>be</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Whilst on {{the surface}} the new Potsdamer Platz appears so far to have {{lived up to its}} {{expectations}} as a futuristic centre of commerce at the heart of Europe's youngest capital city, there has been much debate as to just how successful it really is. Certainly its long term success and viability have become much harder to judge since the recent worldwide economic downturn, a situation compounded by the actions of its two principal owner-occupiers. Daimler and Sony caused a major surprise on 2 October 2007 when both announced that they were putting their respective complexes at Potsdamer Platz on the market. Whilst neither intended to move out, both felt it preferable to rent the space from new owners rather than continue to be the owners themselves (and <b>so</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the buildings' upkeep and maintenance). Daimler had recently come through a painful separation from their former American subsidiary Chrysler and needed a quick injection of cash in order to refocus on automotive production. Ironically, the announcement came on the ninth anniversary of their complex's official opening, a fact not lost on many people. Sony meanwhile, put their decision down to a need to review their global strategy {{in the face of a}} fast-changing worldwide economic climate. The implications for Potsdamer Platz were ominous, with suggestions that overall confidence in the project was faltering, and more pessimistic claims that the development had largely failed in its original intentions.|$|E
