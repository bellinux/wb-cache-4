60|$|My sister {{went for}} the <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> {{came back with the}} <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man trifled with his glass,--took it up, looked at it through the light, put it down,--prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly {{clearing}} the table for the pie and pudding.|$|E

6000|$|... "It’s {{just as if}} he {{was going}} on a picnic," [...] said old Ned, as the boy stood unwillingly on the deck, with a <b>stone</b> <b>bottle</b> in one hand and some {{biscuits}} wrapped up in an old newspaper in the other.|$|E
60|$|The gentleman {{with the}} uncombed head {{appeared}} quite satisfied with this mute announcement of their business, and, producing a flat <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> which might hold {{about a couple}} of quarts, from beneath his bedstead, filled out three glasses of gin, which Job Trotter and Sam disposed of in a most workmanlike manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou hast done well, good fellow, and I will {{remember}} thee.--And now, my masters," [...] he said, {{advancing to the}} brace of clerks or secretaries, who had in the meanwhile sate quietly down beside the <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> and made up acquaintance over a glass of its contents--"Let me remind you, that the night wears late." ...|$|E

60|$|Having {{delivered}} {{himself of}} this speech with many flourishes of manner, he drew from beneath his coat a flat <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> {{and holding the}} cork between his teeth, qualified his mug of water with a plentiful infusion of the liquor it contained. He politely drained the bumper to her health, and the ladies, and setting it down empty, smacked his lips with infinite relish.|$|E

60|$|To set {{the mind}} of his {{mistress}} at rest, {{he took a sip}} (amounting in quantity to a pint or thereabouts) from the <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> and then smacked his lips, winked his eye, and nodded his head. No doubt with the same amiable desire, he immediately resumed his knife and fork, as a practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his appetite.|$|E
60|$|As {{quickly as}} he could he took some bread, some cheese, about half a jar of mince-meat he tied up in a handkerchief, with the slice of bread and butter, some brandy from a <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> a meat bone with very little on it, and a pork pie, which he found on an upper shelf. Then he got a file from among Joe's tools, {{and ran for the}} marshes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wery nigh, mum.' And indeed, after {{scraping}} the dish all round with his knife and carrying the choice brown morsels to his mouth, and after taking such a scientific pull at the <b>stone</b> <b>bottle</b> that, by degrees almost imperceptible to the sight, his head went {{further and further}} back until he lay nearly at his full length upon the ground, this gentleman declared himself quite disengaged, and came forth from his retreat.|$|E

At first he placed light subjects against a background, as in Still Life with Four <b>Stone</b> <b>Bottles,</b> Flask and White Cup (1884) Then he realized the effectiveness of using [...] "pure colors, such as in Still Life with Lemons on a plate (1887) {{and even more so}} in Still Life: Drawing Board, Pipe, Onions and Sealing-Wax (1889)." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 1 May, {{violence}} again erupted between hooligans {{of the two}} clubs {{when they}} met in a Division Two play-off match. Five people were arrested as trouble erupted after Cardiff lost the match, when hooligans from both clubs confronted each othert outside Ninian Park. Three police officers needed hospital treatment following disturbances while {{a number of others}} suffered minor injuries. Officers using batons struggled to keep the two sets of fans apart as missiles, including <b>stones,</b> <b>bottles</b> and fence posts, were thrown from the Cardiff side.|$|R
50|$|Anti-gay rioters {{fought with}} about 5,000 armed police, {{throwing}} Molotov cocktails, bricks, <b>stones,</b> glass <b>bottles</b> and firecrackers; the police used {{tear gas and}} rubber bullets. There were no fatalities.|$|R
60|$|With {{many such}} speeches, and much {{expression}} of good-will, the hospitable hermit invited Martin and his companion {{to sit down}} at his rude table, on which he quickly spread several plates of ripe and dried fruits, a few cakes, and a jar of excellent honey, with a <b>stone</b> <b>bottle</b> of cool water. When they were busily engaged with these viands, he began to make inquiries as to where his visitors had come from.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘No; I’m blessed if it is,’ {{interposed}} the jolly-looking fellow, who, having {{finished his}} dinner, was drinking {{out of the}} same glass as his wife, in truly conjugal harmony, some hot gin-and-water. The faithful partner of his cares had brought a plentiful supply of the anti-temperance fluid in a large flat <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> which looked like a half-gallon jar that had been successfully tapped for the dropsy. ‘You’re a rum chap, you are, Mr. Walker—will you dip your beak into this, sir?’ ...|$|E
60|$|Gradually {{the spell}} of {{pleasure}} relaxed; his own thoughts returned, like stinging insects, in a cloud; and {{the talk of the}} night before, like a shower of buffets, fell upon his memory. He looked east and west for any comforter; and presently he was aware of a cross-road coming steeply down hill, and a horseman cautiously descending. A human voice or presence, like a spring in the desert, was now welcome in itself, and Otto drew bridle to await the coming of this stranger. He proved to be a very red-faced, thick-lipped countryman, with a pair of fat saddle-bags and a <b>stone</b> <b>bottle</b> at his waist; who, as soon as the Prince hailed him, jovially, if somewhat thickly, answered. At the same time he gave a beery yaw in the saddle. It was clear his bottle was no longer full.|$|E
50|$|After {{an attack}} on Joseph's Tomb and its {{subsequent}} takeover by Arabs, hundreds of residents of Bethlehem and the Aida refugee camp, led by the Palestinian Authority-appointed governor of Bethlehem, Muhammad Rashad al-Jabari, attacked Rachel's Tomb. They set the scaffolding that had been erected around it on fire and tried to break in. The IDF dispersed the mob with gunfire and stun grenades, and dozens were wounded. In the following years, the Israeli-controlled site became a flashpoint between young Palestinians who hurled <b>stones,</b> <b>bottles</b> and firebombs and IDF troops, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.|$|R
60|$|Our duck-shooting {{was carried}} on under {{difficulties}} during those days. We searched for ammunition {{at all the}} houses for some leagues around, and at one house we found and purchased a quantity of exceedingly coarse gunpowder, with grain almost the size of canary-seed. They told us it was cannon-powder, {{and to make it}} fit for use in our fowling- pieces we ground it fine with glass and <b>stone</b> <b>bottles</b> for rollers on a tin plate. Shot we could not find, so had to make it for ourselves by cutting up plates of lead into small square bits with a knife and hammer.|$|R

60|$|There was a {{piece of}} flat rock on the floor of this recess, which Zackey used as his anvil, and in front of which he kneeled. At his side was a candle, stuck against the wall, where it poured a flood of light on objects in its {{immediate}} neighbourhood, and threw the boy's magnified shadow over the floor and against the opposite wall of the level. Above his head was a small shelf, which he had ingeniously fixed in a narrow part of the cell, and on this lay a few candles, a <b>stone</b> <b>bottle</b> of water, a blasting fuse, and part of his lunch, which he had been unable to consume, wrapped in a piece of paper. A small wooden box on the floor, and a couple of pick-hilts, leaning against the wall, completed the furniture of this subterranean grotto.|$|E
60|$|While {{they were}} thus engaged, {{the lady of}} the caravan alighted on the earth, and with her hands clasped behind her, and her large bonnet {{trembling}} excessively, walked up and down in a measured tread and very stately manner, surveying the caravan from time to time with an air of calm delight, and deriving particular gratification from the red panels and the brass knocker. When she had taken this gentle exercise for some time, she sat down upon the steps and called 'George'; whereupon a man in a carter's frock, who had been so shrouded in a hedge up to this time as to see everything that passed without being seen himself, parted the twigs that concealed him, and appeared in a sitting attitude, supporting on his legs a baking-dish and a half-gallon <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> and bearing in his right hand a knife, and in his left a fork.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{dark and}} stormy night when the good Antony arrived at the creek (sagely {{denominated}} Haerlem river) which separates the island of Manna-hata from the mainland. The wind was high, the elements were in an uproar, and no Charon could be found to ferry the adventurous sounder of brass across the water. For a short time he vapored like an impatient ghost upon the brink, and then, bethinking himself of the urgency of his errand, took a hearty embrace of his <b>stone</b> <b>bottle,</b> swore most valorously that he would swim across {{in spite of the}} devil (spyt den duyvel), and daringly plunged into the stream. Luckless Antony! scarce had he buffeted half-way over when he was observed to struggle violently, as if battling with the spirit of the waters. Instinctively he put his trumpet to his mouth, and giving a vehement blast sank for ever to the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|The UPV {{launched}} a bombing campaign to destabilise the Northern Ireland government, whose reforms they opposed. There were bombings on 30 March, 4 April, 20 April, 24 and 26 April. It also {{took part in}} most of the counter-demonstrations organised by Paisley in response to the Catholic civil rights marches of the late 1960s. One example of their activity was the Battle of the Bogside, where the UPV along with the RUC and many other loyalists were involved in throwing <b>stones,</b> <b>bottles,</b> and bricks at Catholic residents. The motto of the UPV was [...] "For God and Ulster". Many of its members also belonged to the Ulster Volunteer Force.|$|R
50|$|Siddiqui {{told the}} New York Times that in Kandahar, detainees were packed into wire cages {{and forced to}} use a bucket as a toilet in front of other detainees. He also said {{soldiers}} threw <b>stones</b> and <b>bottles</b> at detainees.|$|R
25|$|On 13 June, the {{motorcade}} of King Abdullah II was attacked with <b>stones</b> and <b>bottles</b> by protesters {{in the city}} of Tafileh, although this was later denied, a royal official stating that they were enthusiastically greeted. Some indication is that this was actually an outbreak of violence between the Darak (Jordanian Gendarmerie) and local unemployed protesters. It is alleged that the local mayor caused the Darak to force back the protesters not wanting his city to look bad, the protesters replied with <b>stones</b> and empty <b>bottles.</b> The King is alleged to have been 12km away.|$|R
