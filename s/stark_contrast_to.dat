5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E
5|$|The Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the French colonies that later pledged allegiance to the pro-German Vichy government. The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{contemporary}} issues surface {{multiple times}} in Gibbes' writing: child neglect, lack of female education, acquisitiveness, gambling, and personal vanity. Many of her heroines, particularly Sophia 'Goldborne' - a somewhat onomastic name - are <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> the materialistic, indulgent {{culture of the}} time, as discussed above; {{and yet at the}} same time, appear to relish female materialism.

5000|$|The band's {{follow-up}} album, Bows + Arrows, {{was released}} on the Record Collection label in 2004 and was listed by many critics {{as one of the}} year's best albums. The album spawned singles for the songs [...] "The Rat" [...] and [...] "Little House of Savages." [...] Critical success of the album led the band to perform on the popular Fox series The O.C. Bows + Arrows was noted for containing a more immediate and focused sound than its predecessor; both [...] "The Rat" [...] and [...] "Little House of Savages" [...] were seen as <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> much of the band's past outputs.|$|R
5|$|This is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{the stance}} taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose {{approach}} {{and response to}} India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
500|$|Design firm Sarofsky {{once again}} {{worked on the}} film's main-on-end title {{sequence}}, having done the same for Winter Soldier. The sequence used [...] "muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey" [...] colors, which were <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> the sequences for Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the later created by Method Design) which were [...] "a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors" [...] and [...] "vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted {{one of the challenges}} for Civil Wars sequence was [...] "to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence" [...] given the number of characters in the film.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability is {{currently}} the term dominating environmental policy. Its extensive political diffusion is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> however, <b>to</b> {{the extent to which}} there is agreement over its meaning. Its ability to motivate is not in question, but a certain scepticism surrounds its ideological content. Since ideological terms have no objective basis, it is therefore important for the purposes of environmental policy to establish whether such scepticism is justified...|$|R

5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Empire's {{successful}} navigation {{of these}} crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil {{emerged as a}} hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as {{freedom of the press}} and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
2500|$|... 1997 – The first {{installment}} of the Fallout series, a video game series set in an alternate earth post-apocalyptic world, is released by Black Isle Studios/Interplay.

50|$|Utah {{has a large}} lead in {{the overall}} series and has {{dominated}} the rivalry both prior to 1972 (41-8-4) and after 1992 (16-7). In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> from 1972 <b>to</b> 1992 BYU dominated the series {{with a record of}} 19-2 versus Utah. Since 1993, largest point spread is 44 points, which occurred in 2011 when Utah won 54-10 in Provo.|$|R
50|$|These high {{expectations}} quickly evaporated. The Athletics stumbled {{out of the}} gate (winning just two of their first dozen games); while their play nominally improved over {{the first half of the}} season, they failed to build upon the momentum of their division-winning 2000 campaign. The rival Seattle Mariners, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> raced <b>to</b> a historic 52-14 start. As expected, the offense performed well; Oakland was instead hamstrung by unexpectedly terrible starting pitching. At the season's midpoint, the A's boasted a sub-.500 record (39-42); they trailed the division-leading Mariners by some 21 games.|$|R
5|$|The other 10% {{of cases}} are {{primarily}} caused by primary hyperplasia, or {{an increase of}} the number of cells. Parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases, occurring most frequently in individuals around 50 years of age (in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> OFC as a result of primary hyperparathyroidism) and showing no gender preference. Approximately 95% of hyperparatyhroidism caused by genetic factors is attributed to MEN type 1. This mutation also tends to affect younger individuals.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows {{a photograph of a}} trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
40|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of the Roman Emperor Nero (37 - 68 A. D.) several impostors showed up in the Eastern Roman Empire. They were {{received}} with happiness and jubilation by the general population [...] a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> compared <b>to</b> the impression he has left, and the reputation he holds nowadays. This thesis explores Nero's propagandic policies during his lifetime. Which groups did he target in his propaganda? Who did he wish to please, and which groups accepted these attempts? What was the measure of his popularity? And what is the cause of the bad reputation Nero now has...|$|R
2500|$|Wilfred Edward Salter Owen, MC (18 March 1893– 4 November 1918) was an English {{poet and}} soldier, {{one of the}} leading poets of the First World War. His war poetry on the horrors of {{trenches}} and gas warfare was heavily influenced by his mentor Siegfried Sassoon, and stood in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> both <b>to</b> the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke. Among his best-known works– most of which were published posthumously– are [...] "Dulce et Decorum est", [...] "Insensibility", [...] "Anthem for Doomed Youth", [...] "Futility", [...] "Exposure" [...] and [...] "Strange Meeting".|$|R

Bernard {{subsequently}} meets up with his wife, Nathalie, who has already spent a week there, {{and they are all}} welcomed by Popeye and the eccentric emcees, Bobo and Bourseault.The film follows the humorous couplings and uncouplings of the group, and especially Popeye's attempt to seduce record numbers of women and, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> Jean-Claude's failure <b>to</b> seduce even one.|$|R
5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through {{the building of a}} new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal {{with the realities of}} postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
30|$|The {{destination}} {{patterns of}} Georgian women stand in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> both <b>to</b> those {{of men and}} to those of their Moldovan female counterparts. In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the other groups, which expressed strong clustering around several single destinations until the most recent years, Georgian women always emigrated to larger numbers of receiving countries. In the CIS, the Russian Federation received the greatest single proportion of Georgian women fairly consistently until 2000, but even from 1991 to 2000, other countries such as Turkey and Greece received significant shares of new emigrants (Figures  7 and 8). Since around 2003, both the EU and “other” region have attracted the greatest shares of female migrants, the largest numbers of whom were destined for Greece, Turkey, and Italy. As with Moldovan women, the destination countries to which Georgian women have increasingly emigrated are those with growing care markets.|$|R
50|$|The slavery {{that has}} been proven to be {{happening}} in Yemen today is a huge human rights issue, and until the government steps in to prevent it, or the wider global community is made more aware of it, {{it will be very}} difficult to bring it to a complete stop. Every human being, as per article four of the Universal Declaration Human Rights, has a right to not be held in slavery or servitude, which is a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> as <b>to</b> what many people held in slavery, and possibly slave owners are not aware of. As well as wider global publicity on the issue, greater education on human rights within Yemen may also assist with the complete abolition of slavery.|$|R

Barry was scripted {{to be much more}} down-to-earth in comparison: working-class instead of middle-classed; openly gay instead of 'in the closet'; loud and brash instead of shy and retiring, and in addition the age difference between the two was substantial — Colin being roughly fifteen years Barry's senior.|$|R
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship {{for the first}} time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
50|$|That area's {{redevelopment}} in the 1930s {{with the}} construction of the elevated freight railroad, the High Line, by the New York Central Railroad necessitated the church's removal. Similar to the story of nearby St. Michael, the church's demolition and removal for redevelopment in the interests of a railroad were allegedly paid for by that developing railroad, which in this case was the New York Central. The architecture of the new church (see Buildings section) both seemingly ignores and stands in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> almost antagonistically <b>to</b> that of the High Line, perhaps reflecting this early relationship.|$|R

50|$|The {{fill light}} also shines on the subject, {{but from a}} side angle {{relative}} to the key and is often placed at a lower position than the key (about {{at the level of}} the subject's face). It balances the key by illuminating shaded surfaces, and lessening or eliminating chiaroscuro effects, such as the shadow cast by a person's nose upon the rest of the face. It is usually softer and less bright than the key light (up to half), and more to a flood. Not using a fill at all can result in <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> (due <b>to</b> shadows) across the subject's surface, depending upon the key light's harshness. Sometimes, as in low-key lighting, this is a deliberate effect, but shots intended to look more natural and less stylistic require a fill.|$|R
