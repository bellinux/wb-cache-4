For the last week I have not been at all well, and indeed was obliged yesterday to go to bed after breakfast instead of after tea, where I contrived to abstract myself out of a good deal of pain into Lord Byron's Life by Moore. To-day this abstraction is not necessary; I am much better; and, indeed, little remains of the indisposition but the vulgar fractions of a cough and cold. I dare say (and Occyta[8] agrees with me) cold was at the bottom of it all, for I was so very wise as to lie down upon the grass last Monday, when the sun was shining deceitfully, though the snow was staring at me from the hedges, with an expression anything but dog-daysical! ...|$|E

This was confirmed {{at the end of the}} final auditions episode on 5 May, during which the judges decided which acts were through to the live semi-finals. After 44 acts had been put through, O'Shaughnessy was left as the only act who had not yet been told his fate.

O'Shaughnessy defended himself by saying that, [...] "Songwriting is my thing and I wasn't allowed to express my own music on the other show The Voice of Ireland, but I was on this show Britain's Got Talent, it was a better opportunity for me.", but Cowell told him, [...] "All you're doing is taking the place of somebody else, who isn't in your position on two shows. I'll be absolutely blunt with you, we were going to give you a yes, but I can't... you understand that?" [...] O'Shaughnessy said that he fully understood Cowell's decision, but insisted that he would try to get off The Voice of Ireland and out of his contract with Universal in order to come back to Britain's Got Talent. It was announced later that day that O'Shaughnessy had been released from his contract and was back on Britain's Got Talent.|$|E
5000|$|Emperor Taizong asked Du, [...] "How are Di's abilities?"

I personally saw that myself. Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "What did you advise Emperor Yang?" [...] Du responded, [...] "I told him to go." [...] Emperor Taizong said, [...] "Part of your responsibility in serving the emperor was to be honest without hiding anything. You praise Di, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not make the same insistent advice?" [...] Du responded, [...] "At that time, I was not in an important post. I also knew that such advice would not be accepted, and it would not be of benefit for me to die." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Confucius said that a son who always obeyed his father was not actually a filially pious son. Therefore a father needs to have a son who would give adverse advice, and a state needs to have officials who would give adverse advice. If you believe that Emperor Yang was a tyrant, why continue to serve him? If you accepted his salary, you had the responsibility to give good advice to him." ... He then smiled and said to Du, [...] "When you, Lord, were serving under Sui, you were at a low post and maybe you had justification not to speak up. You were highly honored in Wang Shichong's administration. Why did you not speak up then?" [...] Du responded, [...] "I did. It was just that he did not listen to me." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "If Wang was virtuous and did what was good, then he would not have been destroyed. If he was a tyrant and resisted adverse advice, how could you have avoided disaster?" [...] Du could not respond. Emperor Taizong then said, [...] "Now you are highly honored. Are you willing to speak up?" [...] Du responded, [...] "I am willing to die. Further, when Baili Xi was at Yu, Yu was destroyed, but when he was at Qin, Qin became a major power. That is whom I secretly compare myself to." [...] Emperor Taizong laughed.|$|E
40|$|Hydrology I {{is taught}} every {{semester}} at Utah Valley University {{and is a}} required course for majors in both Environmental Management and Geology. Prior to Fall 2010, the mean passing rate in the course was 29 % (SD = 4 %) with a mean enrollment of N = 19 (SD = 6). In all cases, {{students who did not}} pass either formally withdrew or simply stopped coming to class and completing assignments. In Fall 2010, when the enrollment peaked at N = 28, the course was reorganized with the intention of reducing the attrition rate. The root cause of attrition was identified as the fear and frustration that students experienced while attempting to solve problem sets on their own. In-class lectures and out-of-class problem sets were replaced with out-ofclass reading assignments and in-class group problem-solving with coaching by the instructor. Some of the in-class problems were calculations with one correct answer, while others were essentially role-playing scenarios in which multiple approaches were possible and expected. The Fall 2010 class earned a record passing rate of 71 %, followed by passing rates of 89 % and 86 % in Spring 2011 and Fall 2011, respectively. At the end of each course, students were surveyed with the question: ‚ÄúDid you ever consider dropping this course? If <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> consider dropping the course and why did you decide not to drop the course?‚Äù The vast majority of respondents (93 %) have stated that they never considered dropping the course and the most frequent (25 %) explanation has been some version of ‚ÄúThe course was interesting‚Äù followed by versions of ‚ÄúI need the course for my career plans‚Äù (12. 5 %), ‚ÄúThe course is required for the degree‚Äù (12. 5 %), and ‚ÄúI enjoy a challenge / I am not a quitter‚Äù (12. 5 %). A sample explanation has been ‚ÄúNo, I find the subject very interesting. The class was involving and it used applications in real world settings. I learned a lot about hydrology and ways to benefit the less fortunate. ‚Äù The tentative conclusion is that students will focus on the interesting aspects of a subject if their frustration level can be effectively managed. Another consequence of the course reorganization is that, beginning in Spring 2011, the mean enrollment has dropped to N = 10 (SD = 2) as students are no longer enrolling in the course repeatedly until they pass...|$|E

40|$|Philosophy {{is often}} caricatured {{as one of}} the most {{disconnected}} and anemic academic enterprises. Yet in philosophers‚Äô own accounts of what drew them to the problems they have sought to address they answer, typically, in two broad, passionate, ways: wonder or anxiety. As such, philosophy, and philosophers‚Äô self-understanding of themselves and their enterprise, can serve as a way to address some of the important topics raised by Rosfort and Stanghellini. Even for philosophers, the emotional experience of moods and affects is employed in narrativity, or at least, employed when one is called to give an account of oneself. One could envisage a party conversation along these lines: <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> become a philosopher? Well, I wanted to go to university but wasn‚Äôt interested in science or in the humanities and I‚Äôve always been dreadful at languages. (Laugh) But you must like something about it as you wouldn‚Äôt have become a professor? You know how it is... you drift into things. I did well as an undergraduate, my tutor suggested I should do a PhD. Found an excellent supervisor, and got a few papers published and then a teaching post.... You must be very committed to the subject. Ummm‚ÄîI guess so. I thought about joining the civil service after my PhD, but always managed to find work and the hours are much more flexible at universities! Well I think it is amazing: to think and teach about such important things. Do you? There is something slightly baffling here that may simply be part of the inherent irony and self-deprecation of some academics. The philosopher's interlocutor is asking about what philosophy means to the philosopher: why he has given his life to it. As such, she is alluding to a deeper, philosophical question that, after decades of falling out of favor, is returning to the attention of philosophers: namely, how has philosophy given your life meaning? The philosopher responds with possible irony, banality, or superficiality and invokes luck rather than meaning in his narrative. He serves as Nietzsche's feared nihilist. The account offered also seems to fail to meet normative standards, and depending on how the philosopher carries it off, this gap between expectation and reality in the conversation may generate humor. However, the greater likelihood is that the conversation engenders perplexity and disappointment in the interviewer. Rather like the characters in Evelyn Waugh's early novels, the philosopher is buffeted passively by life and luck and eschews agency or meaning. In Waugh's skilled hands this becomes tragic comedy; for the philosopher and his interlocutor we have disconnection and sadness. The crucial reason for this is that we need to use terms referring to moods, affects, meaning, and emotion when we offer an account of ourselves and when we try to understand ourselves. Otherwise, something is missing and the reason a person gives for their actions either look like poor reasons or not reasons at all (Bortolotti and Broome 2008). Further, agency, rationality, and self-knowledge may themselves be dependent upon reason-giving. In invoking moods and affects in one's narrative the practical understanding (or ‚Äòaffordances‚Äô) of the world one inhabits are laid open in clear view. Hence Aristotle's account of wonder as the stimulus for philosophy. Aristotle says: ‚ÄòFor it is owing to their wonder that men both now begin and at first began to philosophize; they wondered originally at the obvious difficulties, then advanced little by little and stated difficulties about the greater matters‚Äô (1984, 1554). Conversely, given the experience of transcendence, of ambiguity, of finitude rather than wondrous awe, the philosopher may be motivated by anxiety (Kant's awakening from his dogmatic slumbers, Heidegger's battles with ‚ÄòCrisis‚Äô and the flight of the gods). Either manner [...] ...|$|E
