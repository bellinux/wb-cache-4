2500|$|The [...] "Lowry Technique". A {{combination}} of Valsalva and Toynbee: pinching the nose {{to close the}} nostrils, and blow and swallow at the same time. The nose can be closed without using a hand, using the compressor naris muscles; it {{can be described as}} [...] "wrinkling the nose as if there was a bad smell". A hand cannot be got to the nose if using a full facemask. Many eyes-and-nose diving masks have two small pockets in their underside, or are like goggles with the <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> extended downwards over the nose, to let two fingers reach the nose and pinch it.|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{second album}} Live Through This, {{captured}} a less abrasive sound, {{while maintaining the}} group's original punk roots. [...] "I want this record to be shocking {{to the people who}} don't think we have a <b>soft</b> <b>edge,</b> and at the same time, [...] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge," [...] Love told VH1 in 1994. The group's third album, Celebrity Skin, incorporated power pop into their hard rock sound, and was heavily inspired by California bands; Love was also influenced by Fleetwood Mac and My Bloody Valentine while writing the album. The group's 2010 release, Nobody's Daughter, featured a more folk rock-oriented sound, utilizing acoustic guitar and softer melodies.|$|E
2500|$|Live Through This {{marked a}} {{departure}} from the band's noise rock roots toward a more radio-friendly rock format. Love had sought a more mellow sound for Live Through This, stating: [...] "I want this record to be shocking to the people who don't think we have a <b>soft</b> <b>edge,</b> and at the same time, [...] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge." [...] The resulting music was starkly less aggressive than the band's former work, blending more structured melodies and smoother arrangements with heavy guitar riffs. [...] "During the tour for Pretty on the Inside, we had been going more pop, less journal-entry noise stuff," [...] recalled Erlandson. [...] "The whole industry was going, like, [...] "Look, you can be melodic and punky and be successful!" [...] We never said [...] "Let's do this, let's copy this formula." [...] It was natural." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{received}} her assurance with profound joy. Quietly and steadily there rose {{up behind the}} whole aspect of life that <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> of fire which gave its red tint to the atmosphere and crowded the scene with shadows so deep and dark that one could fancy pushing farther into their density and still farther, exploring indefinitely. Whether there was any correspondence between the two prospects now opening before them they shared {{the same sense of}} the impending future, vast, mysterious, infinitely stored with undeveloped shapes which each would unwrap for the other to behold; but for the present the prospect of the future was enough to fill them with silent adoration. At any rate, their further attempts to communicate articulately were interrupted by a knock on the door, and the entrance of a maid who, with a due sense of mystery, announced that a lady wished to see Miss Hilbery, but refused to allow her name to be given.|$|E
60|$|With {{great care}} he rubbed {{the edge of}} the shell back and forth upon the flat stone until the <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> was quite fine and sharp. He worked much as a barber does who hones a razor, and with every {{evidence}} of similar practice; but his proficiency was the result of years of painstaking effort. Unaided he had worked out a method of his own for putting an edge upon the shell--he even tested it with the ball of his thumb--and when it met with his approval he grasped a wisp of hair which fell across his eyes, grasped it between the thumb and first finger of his left hand and sawed upon it with the sharpened shell until it was severed. All around his head he went until his black shock was rudely bobbed with a ragged bang in front. For the appearance of it he cared nothing; but in the matter of safety and comfort it meant everything. A lock of hair falling in one's eyes at the wrong moment might mean all {{the difference between life and}} death, while straggly strands, hanging down one's back were most uncomfortable, especially when wet with dew or rain or perspiration.|$|E
60|$|But {{though he}} has been followed, he has great doubt as to his own course. To {{hesitate}} is to be lost, so he goes on, on rapidly, looking as he clears every fence for the spot at which he is to clear the next; but he {{is by no means}} certain of his course. Though he has admirers at his heels who credit him implicitly, his mind is racked by an agony of ignorance. He has got badly away, and the hounds are running well, {{and it is going to}} be a good thing; and he will not see it. He has not been in for anything good this year, and now this is his luck! His eye travels round over the horizon as he is gallopping, and though he sees men here and there, he can catch no sign of a hound; nor can he catch the form of any man who would probably be with them. But he perseveres, choosing his points as he goes, till the tail of his followers becomes thinner and thinner. He comes out upon a road, and makes the pace as good as he can along the <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> of it. He sniffs at the wind, knowing that the fox, going at such a pace as this, must run with it. He tells himself from outward signs where he is, and uses his dead knowledge to direct him. He scorns to ask a question as he passes countrymen in his course, but he would give five guineas to know exactly where the hounds are at that moment. He has been at it now forty minutes, and is in despair. His gallant nag rolls a little under him, and he knows that he has been going too fast. And for what; for what? What good has it all done him? What good will it do him, though he should kill the beast? He curses between his teeth, and everything is vanity and vexation of spirit.|$|E

50|$|A hard edge is {{used when}} there is an abrupt change in brightness, such as a field with a horizon to a bright sky. A <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> is a wider, {{smoother}} change from light to dark. This is used when the light and dark portions are not distinctly separated, such as a mountain and sky. A <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> filter is less noticeable than a hard edge. It also has the benefit of making the sky more intense, darkening the sky the closer on the top. Below is a picture of what a hard edge and <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> filter would look like.|$|E

50|$|The {{transition}} area, or edge, {{is available}} in different variations (soft, hard, attenuator). The most common is a <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> and provides a smooth transition from the ND side and the clear side.

5000|$|She began {{experimenting with}} pastels in 1980 and {{produced}} a remarkable series in 1982 inspired by the nearby Nevada landscape while staying {{with her husband in}} Beverly Hills as he recovered from heart surgery.

50|$|Also notable is that {{generated}} shadows, even if aliasing free, have hard edges, {{which is not}} always desirable. In order to emulate real world soft shadows, several solutions have been developed, either by doing several lookups on the shadow map, generating geometry meant to emulate the <b>soft</b> <b>edge</b> or creating non standard depth shadow maps. Notable examples of these are Percentage Closer Filtering, Smoothies, and Variance Shadow maps.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} is less accurate than shadow volumes, but the shadow map {{can be a}} faster alternative {{depending on how much}} fill time is required for either technique in a particular application and therefore may be more suitable to real time applications.

40|$|The Mixed Raster Content (MRC) {{document}} compression standard (ITU T. 44) specifies a multi-layer multi-resolution {{representation of}} a compound document.

This paper presents an algorithm that builds an edge sharpening map and iteratively parameterizes the orig-inal edge “softness ” at the encoder. The generated map and the “softness ” parameters are, then, used to reconstruct the original <b>soft</b> <b>edges</b> at the decoder. Experimental results are presented, showing that the method can yield 1. 5 dB gains in PSNR, in the compression ranges of interest.
