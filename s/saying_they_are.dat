Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees.

25|$|The {{equivalent}} of North Africa located on an icy continent near the south pole. Ice People {{of both sexes}} have extensive body hair, {{on the order of}} primates. Their language is represented by Hebrew, as in Ortah. Ice People introduce themselves by describing their genealogy into the remote past ending by <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> related to a god. Magic that works well in Derlavai will not work well in the Land of the Ice People; the Algarvians learned this to their disadvantage when they tried murdering Kaunians there. The Ice People are the only people known to worship gods, instead of spirits.|$|E

50|$|Planted in 1901 by Stationmaster Wilson's wife, the lilacs {{have become}} a {{signature}} of the depot. Some say the lilacs were planted there because Wilson’s wife was congratulating him on the job of station agent, some <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there to cover {{the smell of the}} outhouses outside of the train station, some <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given as a gift, others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> planted to remind her of her native Britain.

25|$|A 2007 cable {{reports a}} meeting between several {{agricultural}} biotechnology companies (Dow Chemical Company, DuPont, Monsanto) where they raise concerns to the French governments stance on agricultural biotechnology. The concerns included the destruction of test fields by activists, whether French police will enforce vandalism laws, whether French farmers {{will have to be}} on a public list <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> growing GMOs, and whether France will follow EU approval guidelines. Also the cable discussed an approval dispute about a genetically modified potato variety from BASF which the French government showed signs of approving, but later ruled against. No United States government representatives were involved.|$|E
25|$|Honduran leaders {{refused to}} {{reinstate}} Zelaya before the elections, and {{international support for}} the elections remained scant {{leading up to the}} polls. Many Hondurans sought to move past the crisis with the elections, which had been scheduled previous to Zelaya's ouster. While Zelaya had urged abstention from the vote, initial returns indicated a larger than usual turnout, around 60%, a figure which was subsequently revised downward to 49%. Zelaya also disputed those figures at the time. Some Honduran activists have ended daily protests demanding the reinstatement of Zelaya since he was ousted in a coup, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> moving on since Congress had voted to keep Manuel Zelaya out of office.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2012–13 season, he suffered a metatarsal bone injury that caused him to miss several games on the club's qualifying road to another Champions League. He returned {{just in time to}} play in Dinamo's first Champions League game against FC Porto. Kovačić played in all six Dinamo Zagreb's matches in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League Group Stage, against Porto, Paris Saint-Germain, and Dynamo Kyiv. He continued to impress with his mature performances at a young age {{during the first half of}} the season. In October 2012, he was nominated for Golden Boy, an award given by sports journalists to a young player from Europe perceived to have been the most impressive during a season. During the season's winter break, Dinamo's board threw away the speculations about Kovačić leaving the club in the near future by <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> building a new team around him and another rising star, Alen Halilović. On 30 January 2013, however, the media, surprisingly, revealed that Kovačić was sold to Inter Milan of Serie A.|$|E
500|$|A work {{instruction}} introduced in 1996 requires government {{staff in the}} Arbeitsämter– local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs– to mark companies owned by Scientologists with the letter [...] "S". Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff, prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff. Government officials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses; some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Scientologists {{in order to avoid}} the associated stigma.|$|E
500|$|The studio {{introduced}} a viral marketing website {{operated by the}} Institute for Human Continuity, where filmgoers could register for a lottery number {{to be part of}} a small population which would be rescued from the global destruction. David Morrison of NASA, who received over 1,000 inquiries from people who thought the website was genuine, condemned it. [...] "I've even had cases of teenagers writing to me <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> contemplating suicide because they don't want to see the world end", Morrison said. [...] "I think when you lie on the internet and scare children to make a buck, that is ethically wrong." [...] Another marketing website promoted Farewell Atlantis, the fictional novel about the events of 2012.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend Atticus, Cicero is {{discussing}} Caesar's clementia: [...] "You will <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> frightened. I dare <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> but I'll be bound they're more frightened of Pompey than of Caesar. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> delighted with his artful clemency and fear the other's wrath."

500|$|The album's {{first two}} songs are a one-two {{introduction}} to the rapper and what he is up to. There is a gloomy interior monologue about success, the lack of it, and Cudi's inner conflicts, where he welcomes listeners by <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in his dreams. [...] "Soundtrack 2 My Life" [...] is a more courageous theme song where he proclaims, [...] "This is the soundtrack to my life". In it he states that his family {{did not see the}} sadness in him and that he has not been right since his father's death. The third track, {{which is part of the}} second half of the introduction, has an outer-space style, which is due in part to the Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark group sample, and showcases the rapper's readiness to experiment.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack is {{put into}} the bear cage, and notices a handcuffed Juliet being led to his old prison. She visits him later and asks Jack to treat Ben's back, which has become {{infected}} following the surgery, but Jack refuses. She also explains that she is {{in trouble with the}} Others for killing Pickett. Later, Isabel (Diana Scarwid), the Others' [...] "sheriff," [...] arrives at the cage and discusses Jack's tattoo with him, as she can read the Chinese. Isabel brings him to a room where Juliet is being held and asks him whether Juliet told him to kill Ben or not. Jack lies and says she did not and is brought back to his cage. Once back, he is visited by Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) and the previously kidnapped members of the tail-section. Cindy starts to ask Jack questions, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> here to [...] "watch", but he angrily sends her away. Alex visits Jack later and tells him that the Others are planning to execute Juliet. Alex helps him escape from his cage, and they go to Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), who writes a note, sparing Juliet, in return for Jack's continuing to be Ben's doctor. The two then go to a trial the Others are holding for Juliet, and Alex gives Isabel Ben's note, which says Juliet is not to be executed, but is to be marked instead (with a branded symbol at the base of her spine). When Juliet later asks Jack why he helped her, he replies that it is because Ben said he would let both of them off the island and he wants to make that happen by working together. At the end of the episode, Jack and the Others travel back to the main island on a boat. Just before leaving, Isabel translates Jack's tattoo, [...] "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us". Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean." ...|$|E

[...] The One praised the game's controls, saying that [...] "the game's impressive user-friendliness is undoubtably one of its strong points," [...] adding that [...] "Lure of the Temptress is every bit as professional and polished as anything the Americans and French have been able to offer us recently" [...] but [...] "Lure is, if anything, a little too serious and sombre" [...] and that [...] "LucasFilm's games boast the more interesting characters and interaction sequences." [...] Amiga Power praised its graphics, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> [...] "very pretty drawn, with the dark, moody look you'd expect from a town being oppressed by an evil Temptress," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best graphic adventures ever" [...] that's [...] "up there with Monkey Island 1 and Beneath a Steel Sky," [...] and adding that the [...] "only drawback is that it's shorter than your average adventure." [...] Mega Zone praised the game, stating that it is a [...] "Sierra/Lucasfilmish with really, really good playability.
