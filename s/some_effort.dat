5|$|The {{number of}} Kadazan-Dusun {{speakers}} {{is thought to}} have dropped significantly throughout Sabah, especially in larger towns or cities like Kota Kinabalu.

5|$|Ultimately though, it was Heisuke Yanagawa's 10th Army which, on November 19, {{abruptly}} {{crossed the}} operation restriction line and began advancing on Nanking. In {{response to this}} flagrant act of insubordination, Matsui, it is claimed, made <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> to restrain Yanagawa, but he also insisted to the high command that marching on Nanking was the right course of action. On December 1 the Army General Staff finally came around and approved an operation against Nanking, though by then many of Japan's units in the field were already well on their way.|$|E

5|$|Maintaining the {{services}} of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company did, at times, take <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> {{on the part of}} the residents. For example, in Ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain {{the services}} of the company; they had informed the farmers that their ships would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. (After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
5|$|Odan's {{presence}} becomes dominating over Riker, and Dr. Crusher {{finds herself}} initially confused when Odan continues {{to try to}} engage with her to continue their relationship. Dr. Crusher is puzzled and full of emotion as she later confides to Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and wonders about the true depth of her feelings for Odan. With <b>some</b> <b>effort,</b> Odan in Riker's body manages to convince the delegates from the warring planets to work with him. However, Riker's body begins to deteriorate due to the incompatibility of different biologies. The ship transporting the new host has encountered engine malfunctions. Dr. Crusher does everything she can to extend Riker's and Odan's chances while the Enterprise races to meet the Trill ship, and has a deeply emotional moment with Captain Picard.|$|E
5|$|The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I is {{not merely}} a {{compilation}} of laws but an integrated legal treatise, the first such in the history of England, written in the Latin language about 1115. It records the legal customs of medieval England. It was part {{of a small group of}} similar writings devoted to legal procedures that were written for royal administrators. Besides the Leges, other works of this type produced at this time were the Quadripartitus, parts of the Leges Edwardi Regis, the Instituta Cnuti, and the Consiliatio Cnuti. It is possible the Leges Willhelmi was also written during this time period. It is the longest of the legal tracts from its time, and made <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> to be comprehensive.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{histories}} of the Bastille were published immediately after July 1789, usually with dramatic titles promising the uncovering of secrets from the prison. By the 1830s and 1840s, popular histories written by Pierre Joigneaux and by the trio of Auguste Maquet, Auguste Arnould and Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol presented {{the years of the}} Bastille between 1358 and 1789 as a single, long period of royal tyranny and oppression, epitomised by the fortress; their works featured imaginative 19th-century reconstructions of the medieval torture of prisoners. As living memories of the Revolution faded, the destruction of the Bastille meant that later historians had to rely primarily on memoires and documentary materials in analysing the fortress and the 5,279 prisoners who had come through the Bastille between 1659 and 1789. The Bastille's archives, recording the operation of the prison, had been scattered in the confusion after the seizure; with <b>some</b> <b>effort,</b> the Paris Assembly gathered around 600,000 of them in the following weeks, which form the basis of the modern archive. After being safely stored and ignored for many years, these archives were rediscovered by the French historian François Ravaisson, who catalogued and used them for research between 1866 and 1904.|$|E
5|$|In 1638, the Santa Margherita Lines {{began to}} be built {{encircling}} the land fronts of Birgu and Sengela. Works were suspended in 1645 {{due to a lack}} of funds, and they remained unfinished for many years. Following the fall of Candia to the Ottomans in 1669, a second line of fortifications, the Cottonera Lines, {{began to be}} built encircling both Birgu and Senglea, as well as the unfinished Santa Margherita Lines. They were begun in 1670, but works stopped in 1680 again {{due to a lack of}} funds. By this time, the bastioned enceinte had been built, although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed. Eventually, <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, although some of the planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724.|$|E
25|$|There was {{subsequently}} <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> towards {{unity of the}} two factions, with Thomas J. Morgan put forward for Mayor of Chicago in 1891 as the joint nominee of the official SLP and the Rosenberg organization. Unity discussions came to nothing in 1892, however.|$|E

25|$|One {{key part}} of the {{agreement}} was that the UK would develop their own warheads for the missiles, as the UK military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{addition}} of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts were written on vellum.

With <b>some</b> <b>effort,</b> many Icelanders can also understand the original manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|Environmental law has {{developed}} {{in response to}} emerging awareness of and concern over issues impacting the entire world.

25|$|The Washington Artillery was {{organized}} at Washington, Hempstead County, Arkansas, on June 14, 1862, by Captain Chambers Brady Etter.
