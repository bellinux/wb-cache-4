40|$|Auction-rate {{securities}} (ARS) are long-term variable-rate instruments {{with their}} interest rates reset at periodic and frequent auctions. They are often marketed to issuers {{as an alternative}} variable-rate financing vehicle and to investors {{as an alternative to}} money market funds. Investors have historically been able to liquidate ARS positions at face value at frequent auctions, leading many to consider them cash-like. After hundreds of auction failures in February 2008, however, the Wall Street Journal declared that the ARS market had “virtually collapsed. ” Recent media coverage has pointed to broker-dealers withdrawing support from this market. Many articles have discussed credit rating downgrades of monoline insurers. We believe the auction-rate market encompasses securities and issuers of varying characteristics and that an understanding of recent events requires detailed analyses of these characteristics.

An attacker able to gain control over one component by exploiting a vulnerability its software, only needs to control this component to control {{the system as a}} whole. An Intrusion Tolerant System (ITS) offers diversity and redundancy to the provided service, meaning the attacker needs to control several different components to control the system. This thesis studies the components in an ITS and its anatomy. The implementation of an ITS is described. Both existing systems and the system developed in conjunction with this thesis, is compared and evaluated. The investigated, existing systems are: a heterogeneous server load balancing system, a system developed by SRI/LAAS, a system developed by Min and Choi and lastly SITAR developed by Wang et al. Pitfalls in design of ITS-systems are pointed out. The most serious errors committed are violation of the required diversity among the components and an opening of new attack vectors by offering non-critical services. It seems hard to eliminate a «Single Point of Failure» since one and only one component sends the final reply back to the client. One can tolerate a «Single Point of Failure» in one component, but this requires hardening and protection of this component.

With the rapid development of new technological enhancements, {{there has been a}} shift in the way organizations and employees carry out their business. It is this rapid change from the traditional way of doing office work and/or business that has necessitated the adoption of new practices such as BYOD. To this effect then, corporates are faced with new security and privacy challenges in today’s mobile environment one among many being Identification, Authentication, Authorization and Access Control of the users. The research aimed to delve into the factors such as Mobile Device Security Models and Architectures, and current solutions that are being implemented when adopting BYOD whilst considering their strengths and weakness. This analysis of strengths and weakness is what showed that the current solutions are mainly device, data and/or application-centric and have not taken into consideration that illegitimate access to corporate systems can be made via the use of legitimate device and application by unauthorized users. The proposed device identity and user authentication management system is a strong hybrid of the device identity and user authentication solutions that sought to have an augmented solution there by having <b>security</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> in the BYOD environment. The solution used the combination of the unique Media Access Control address and the device owners’ personal phone numbers which were concatenated for identification and authentication of the user device and its respective owner whereas an access control register was used for access authorization thereafter. The test results were discussed elaborately for clarity and to give merit for the need of this research work. The prototype tests were based on functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} {{companies}} and organizations in Norway {{with a number}} of employees between 5 and 9 and Internet access increased from 66 % to 86 % during a five year period from 2001 to 2006. This increased use of the Internet puts small companies in a vulnerable position considering information security. They are known to be remarkably less willing to pay for information security compared to companies with more employees and more revenue. There {{is no such thing as}} two identical organizations. Every single one has it's own assets, weaknesses, employees and fundamental strategies. This makes each company's requirement for ICT-systems and information security identical as well. One solution might be good for one company but not for others. The differences in organizational structure and mentality is important variables in the process of building a good and secure infrastructure for the organizations. The Australian Computer Crime Surveys presents four readiness to protect factors, they consist of: Technology, policies, training and standards. These factors are used as a template for this thesis. If companies focus on these four aspects of information security, and succeed in combining them in an optimal manner they are said to have <b>security</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> There is no use in investing great amounts of money on technology if these are not used in a justifiable manner. There might be several reasons for improper use of the technologies, among them; lack of knowledge, laziness and carelessness. The companies continuous inability to calculate their own risks of adverse events and their total losses experienced due to computer crime makes it difficult to perform investment analysis on information security. Smaller companies do often have very limited amount of money to spend in general, and therefore also on information security. The investment analysis model chosen therefore take the maximum amount of spend able money into account. The accuracy of the model presented relies in the companies ability to present trustworthy data, and use both willingness to pay calculations and cost/benefit-investments analysis methods, resulting in a more thorough presentation of an ALE/ROI method used in a proof of concept using estimated data based on surveys, professionals experiences and prices used by a Norwegian ICT-operations company. </p...|$|E

This paper explores {{the performance of the}} Java <b>Security</b> Manager <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> identifies the permissions with the worst performance and gives advice on how to use the <b>Security</b> Manager <b>in</b> a more efficient way. Our performance test shows that the CPU execution time penalty varies between 5 % and 100 % per resource access statement. This extreme range {{is due to the fact}} that some resource accesses are costly (such as file and socket access) and therefore hide the performance penalty for the access control check almost completely. The time penalty is much more noticeable with access to main memory resources (such as Java objects). In order to achieve reasonable response times, it is of utmost importance to tune garbage collection because the Java Security Manager creates short-lived objects during its permission check. Also, the order of permissions in the policy file can be important. ª 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Scheme H 1 achieves anonymity while H 2 is non-anonymous. The constructions are obtained by extending the IBE scheme recently proposed by Jutla and Roy (Asiacrypt 2013). Security {{is based on}} the standard decisional Symmetric eXternal Diffie-Hellman (SXDH) assumption. In terms of provable security properties, previous direct constructions of constant-size ciphertext HIBE had {{one or more of the}} following drawbacks: <b>security</b> <b>in</b> the weaker model of selective-identity attacks; exponential <b>security</b> degradation <b>in</b> the <b>depth</b> of the HIBE; and use of non-standard assumptions. The security arguments for H 1 and H 2 avoid all of these drawbacks. These drawbacks can also be avoided by obtaining HIBE schemes by specialising schemes for hierarchical inner product encryption; the downside is that the resulting efficiencies are inferior to those of the schemes reported here. Currently, there is no known anonymous HIBE scheme having the security properties of H 1 and comparable efficiency. An independent work by Chen and Wee describes a non-anonymous HIBE scheme with security claims and efficiency similar to that of H 2; we note though that in comparison to H 2, the Chen-Wee HIBE scheme has larger ciphertexts and less efficient encryption and decryption algorithms. Based on the current state-of-the-art, H 1 and H 2 are the schemes of choice for efficient implementation of (anonymous) HIBE constructions...|$|R

40|$|Measurement {{is a vital}} {{tool for}} {{organizations}} attempting to increase, evaluate, or simply maintain their overall security posture over time. Organizations rely on defense <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> which is a layering of multiple defenses, in order to strengthen overall security. Measuring organizations' total security requires evaluating individual security controls such as firewalls, antivirus, or intrusion detection systems alone {{as well as their}} joint effectiveness when deployed together <b>in</b> defense <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> Currently, organizations must rely on best practices rooted in ad hoc expert opinion, reports on individual product performance, and marketing hype to make their choices. When attempting to measure the total security provided by a defense <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> architecture, dependencies between security controls compound the already difficult task of measuring a single security control accurately. We take two complementary approaches to address this challenge of measuring the total security provided by defense <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> deployments. <b>In</b> our first approach, we use direct measurement where for some set of attacks, we compute a total detection rate for a set of <b>security</b> controls deployed <b>in</b> defense <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> <b>In</b> order to compare security controls operating on different types of data, we link together all data generated from each particular attack and track the specific attacks detected by each security control. We implement our approach for both the drive-by download and web application attack vectors across four separate layers each. We created an extensible automated framework for web application data generation using public sources of English text. For our second approach, we measure the total adversary cost that is the total effort, resources, and time required to evade <b>security</b> controls deployed <b>in</b> defense <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> Dependencies between <b>security</b> controls prevent us from simply summing the adversary cost to evade individual <b>security</b> controls <b>in</b> order to compute a total adversary cost. We create a methodology that accounts for these dependencies especially focusing on multiplicative relationships where the adversary cost of evading two security controls together is {{more than the sum of}} the adversary costs to evade each individually. Using the insight gained into the multiplicative dependency, we design a method for creating sets of multiplicative security controls. Additionally, we create a prototype to demonstrate our methodology for empirically measuring total adversary cost using attack tree visualizations and a database design capable of representing dependent relationships between security controls...|$|R

However, it has been claimed that changes in vergence induced by modulations of the {{binocular}} disparity of a random-dot display do not create a sensation of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> The present experiment tests the hypothesis that modulation of binocular disparity in a random-dot display does not create a sensation of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> because, <b>in</b> such a display, looming of the image that normally accompanies motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> is absent. The image of a radial pattern remains self-similar when it moves <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> so the absence of looming in such an image should not inhibit the effects of modulation of disparity.

When binocularly acting <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> the WS group that did not exhibit stereopsis were significantly poorer than the TD group and the WS group that exhibited stereopsis. When assessing the relationship between stereoacuity and action <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> stereoacuity negatively correlated with binocular action <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> for the WS group with stereopsis, but not the TD group. Therefore, no deficits <b>in</b> monocular <b>depth</b> perception <b>in</b> WS were evidenced, yet significant deficits are exhibited <b>in</b> binocular <b>depth</b> perception and action. Importantly action <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> under binocular viewing may be a useful gross screening measure for stereodeficits in WS. Remediation of <b>depth</b> perception deficits <b>in</b> WS could train further understanding of monocular cues to compensate for poor stereopsis...|$|R
