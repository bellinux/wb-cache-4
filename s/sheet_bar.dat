In {{addition}} to semi-finished parts, cold forming may be used on metal stock, <b>sheet,</b> <b>bar,</b> and rod stock. Cold sizing can be performed on various metals, both ferrous and non-ferrous, and even materials like polymers and plastics. Sizing is related to other squeezing operations like swaging, coining, hobbing, staking and riveting, thread rolling, and extruding.|$|E

This texture is usually rough and lacks lustre; it may have spots of oxidation or contamination with mill oil. Most mill finish surfaces are machined or treated with polishing, industrial etching, or some other surface finishing process before they are considered complete.|$|E

50|$|A bench shear, {{also known}} as a lever shear, is a bench mounted shear with a {{compound}} mechanism to increase the mechanical advantage. It is usually used for cutting rough shapes out of medium-sized pieces of sheet metal, but cannot do delicate work. For the small shear, it mostly designed for a wide field of applications. Light weight and easy efficient operation, yet very sturdy in construction. The cutting blades fitted are carefully and accurately ground to give easy, clean quick cuts, and free of burrs. These special features help the operators save a great deal of their energy. But some shearing machines can cut <b>sheet</b> <b>bar</b> and flat bar up to 10mm. It is electrically welded together to make it a sturdy stable unit capable to withstand highest stresses due to heavy duty usage. The footplates are reinforced with bracing angles so that they give firm stability to the shear. The machine is provided with section knives with sliding blades which can be adjusted by hand to make 90 cuts on angles and T-sections of different sizes as well as with openings for cutting round and square bars.|$|E

50|$|Aluminium, zinc, zirconium, and thorium promote {{precipitation}} hardening: manganese improves corrosion resistance; and tin improves castability. Aluminium is {{the most}} common alloying element. The numerals correspond to the rounded-off percentage of the two main alloy elements, proceeding alphabetically as compositions become standard. Temper designation is much the same {{as in the case of}} aluminium. Using -F, -O, -H1, -T4, -T5, and -T6.Sand permanent-mold, and die casting are all well developed for magnesium alloys, die casting being the most popular. Although magnesium is about twice as expensive as aluminium, its hot-chamber die-casting process is easier, more economical, and 40% to 50% faster than cold-chamber process required for aluminium. Forming behavior is poor at room temperature, but most conventional processes can be performed when the material is heated to temperatures of 450 - 700 F. As these temperatures are easily attained and generally do not require a protective atmosphere, many formed and drawn magnesium products are manufactured. The machinability of magnesium alloys is the best of any commercial metal, and in many applications, the savings in machining costs more than compensate for the increased cost of the material. It is necessary, however, to keep the tools sharp and to provide ample space for the chips. Magnesium alloys can be spot-welded nearly as easily as aluminium, but scratch brushing or chemical cleaning is necessary before the weld is formed. Fusion welding is carried out most easily by processes using an inert shielding atmosphere of argon or helium gas. Considerable misinformation exists regarding the fire hazard in processing magnesium alloys. It is true that magnesium alloys are highly combustible when in a finely divided form, such as powder or fine chips, and this hazard should never be ignored. Above 800 F, a non-combustible, oxygen-free atmosphere is required to suppress burning. Casting operations often require additional precautions because of the reactivity of magnesium with sand and water in <b>sheet,</b> <b>bar,</b> extruded or cast form; however, magnesium alloys present no real fire hazard.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{points out}} the {{importance}} of chemical heterogeneity on the destabilization of austenitic structure {{and the formation of}} deformation induced martensite (DIM) in AISI 300 grade austenitic stainless steels (ASSs) of different level of austenite stability (316 L, 304, 301 LN). Color etching reveals that the structure of wrought Cr–Ni type steels is never fully chemically homogeneous. Confrontation of distribution and morphology of DIM formed in the volume of material after static and cyclic straining under well controlled different conditions with the characteristic local variations in chemical composition of diverse wrought semi-product forms (plates, <b>sheets,</b> <b>bars)</b> proved prominent and very important role of chemical banding in the destabilization of originally fully austenitic structure. This fact should be considered especially when interpreting the results of hydrogen embrittlement tensile testing of Cr–Ni ASSs with lowered Ni content.

Almost fully recrystallized microstructure can be achieved using synergy of both cold and hot deformation...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{thermomechanical}} processing on {{the mechanical}} properties of Nb- 1 wt. percent Zr- 0. 1 wt. percent C, a candidate alloy {{for use in}} advanced space power systems, were investigated. <b>Sheet</b> <b>bars</b> were cold rolled into 1 -mm thick sheets following single, double, or triple extrusion operations at 1900 K. All the creep and tensile specimens were given a two-step heat treatment 1 hr at 1755 K + 2 hr 1475 K prior to testing. Tensile properties were determined at 300 {{as well as at}} 1350 K.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study was}} carried out to evaluate the effects of processing on the microstructure of Nb- 1 wt. pct. Zr- 0. 1 wt. pct. C alloy sheet. The samples were fabricated by cold rolling different <b>sheet</b> <b>bars</b> that were single-, double- or triple-extruded at 1900 K. Heat treatment consisted on one- or two-step annealing of different samples at temperatures ranging from 1350 to 1850 K. The assessment {{of the effects of}} processing on microstructure involved characterization of the precipitates including the type, crystal structure, chemistry and distribution within the material as well as an examination of the grain structure. A combination of various analytical and metallographic techniques were used on both the sheet samples and the residue extracted from them. The results show that the relatively coarse orthorhombic Nb 2 C carbides in the as-rolled samples transformed to rather fine cubic monocarbides of Nb and Zr with varying Zr/Nb ratios upon subsequent heat treatment. The relative amount of the cubic carbides and the Zr/Nb ratio increased with increasing number of extrusions prior to cold rolling. Furthermore, the size and the aspect ratio of the grains appear to be strong functions of the processing history of the material. These and other results obtained will be presented with the emphasis on a possible relationship between processing and microstructure...|$|R
