An experiment was conducted during the during the 2009 and 2010 major crop growing seasons in Kumasi, Ghana, to compare the effect of four different tillage practices on Asontem cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp) performance. The treatments consisted of <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> only, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing, disc harrowing only and no tillage. There was significant difference in Asontem cowpea growth, dry matter yield and yield components between tillage practices. <b>Disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing gave the best results producing the highest percentage seedling emergence, tallest plant, biggest stem girth and greatest number of leaves. Furthermore, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing resulted in the longest root length, highest dry matter yield, highest number of pods per plant, highest number of seeds per pod and highest 1000 seed-weight. The no tillage plots produced the shortest plant, smallest stem girth and smallest number of leaves. In addition, the no tillage plots gave the shortest root length, lowest dry matter yield, smallest number of pods per plant, smallest number of seeds per pod and smallest 1000 seed-weight. Therefore, considering the soil and weather conditions of the experiment the best tillage practice for Asontem cowpea growth and yield is <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted for two consecutive seasons (1990 / 1991 and 1991 / 1992) {{at the farm}} of Tamboul testing and training center (Gezira State, Sudan), where the soil is heavy cracking clay, to investigate the effect of both rear wheel track width settings and the working depth on the tractive performance of a two-wheel drive tractor working with both mounted <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> and trailed offset disc harrow. Three track width settings namely 140, 160, 180 cm and two working depths, shallow and deep were used to evaluate their effects on the engine fuel consumption, rear wheel slip, available drawbar power and the tractive power efficiency, using a mounted <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> or trailed offset disc harrow. It was found that generally wider track widths and shallow depths improved the tractor field performance. Significant decrease (at 1 % level) in fuel consumption was observed when <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> was used. Combining track width of 160 cm or 180 cm and working at shallow depths gave a reduction of 28 % fuel consumption when the <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> was used. The disc harrow showed no significant differences (at 5 % level) between such combinations. The wider track width settings (160 and 180 cm) {{were found to have}} a highl...|$|R

40|$|An {{appropriate}} tillage {{method is}} necessary to create an optimum seed bed condition for optimum crop growth and yield. Two-year field experiment was conducted in 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of different tillage methods on the physical properties of sandy loam soil, growth and yield of water melon (Citrullus vulgaris) in a semi-arid environment. The Tillage treatments were <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> plus <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH), double <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DDP), double <b>disc</b> harrowing (DDH), <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DP) and <b>disc</b> harrowing (DH) as minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) and direct drilling method (control). The watermelon seeds were Planted manually placing three (3) seeds per hole at an interval of 1. 5 m along the rows and 50 cm between the rows at an average depth of 5 cm. The treatments were laid in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Results showed that <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> + <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH) {{was found to be}} more appropriate and profitable tillage method in improving soil physical properties and growth and yield of water melon in a sandy loam soil. Watermelon yield, fruit weight (FW), fruit length (FL), fruit diameter (FD) and leaf area index (LAI) were significantly influenced (P= 0. 05), but influence of tillage treatments were not significant on the number of fruit per plant (NFPP). A numerical value of 31. 0 t/ha, 26. 0, 5. 4 kg, 29. 0 cm, and 33. 8 cm were recorded for maximum crop yield, NFPP, FW, FD and FL respectively in DP+DH-treated plots. For zero tillage (ZT) treatment, maximum of crop yield and NFPP were 26. 5 t/ha and 20. 0 respectively. Thus for enhanced growth and yield of watermelon, DP/DH would be more preferable. The orthodox method of zero tillage is out rightly discourage...|$|R

40|$|In {{grassland}} reserves, managed disturbance {{is often}} {{necessary to maintain}} plant species diversity. We carried out experiments to determine the impact of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> on grassland species richness and composition in a nature reserve in semi-arid eastern Australia. Vegetation response was influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn. Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In the fire experiment, species richness and composition recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on species richness and composition. Even <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> caused only a small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of the treatment, and {{the high degree of}} natural movement and cracking in these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community. However, the ability of the Astrebla- and Dichanthium-dominated grasslands to recover quickly after disturbance, given favourable seasonal conditions, suggests that they are well adapted to natural disturbances (e. g. droughts, fire, flooding and native grazing) ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard <b>plough,</b> 3 furrow <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved <b>single</b> furrow mouldboard <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for mouldboard and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughs,</b> while draught force of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> and <b>disc</b> harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of <b>disc</b> <b>plough</b> was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased. Comparing the costs of complete tillage systems it was observed that minimum tillage decreases the operational cost per hectare by 30 % compared to a conventional system based on ploughing. Direct drilling is the cheapest way to establish a crop, but if herbicide has to be applied the cost per hectare {{is similar to that of}} minimum tillage. The costs of different sizes (102, 162, 224 kW tractors) of alternative tillage systems are similar. Namely the cost of mouldboard plough is £ 80. 33 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 48 /- 1. 93 /ha, the cost of shallow mouldboard plough is £ 68. 85 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 02 /- 1. 64 /ha, the cost of stubble cultivator is £ 42. 05 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 02 /- 1. 27 /ha, the cost of direct drill is £ 20. 76 /ha with a range of £ + 0. 89 /- 0. 75 /ha and the cost of direct drill with herbicide application is £ 43. 15 /ha with a range of £ + 0. 41 /- 0. 53 /ha...|$|R
