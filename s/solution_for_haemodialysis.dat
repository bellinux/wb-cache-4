30|$|The high {{thrombosis}} rate of AVF and PBGs and {{the high}} recurrence rates after thrombolysis and angioplasty have led to consideration of performing haemodialysis with percutaneously inserted venous catheters. Nowadays, venous catheters are often taken into consideration as a long-term <b>solution</b> <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> because of the improvement in biomaterials available for catheters. Percutaneous venous catheters present {{the advantage of being}} placed on an outpatient basis; moreover, they do not require any maturation period, and they prevent repeated punctures of the AVF. The disavantages are represented by the fact that venous catheters are cosmetically less acceptable, and the achievable peak of flow rates are lower than with AVFs and PBGs.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 10 years {{the type of}} {{vascular}} access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> procedures have changed markedly in our centre: more elbow AV fistulae and more central venous catheters are now used.

Methods: Forty-four haemodialysis and 11 CAPD centres were enrolled in this study in 2001. Sixty patients, 30 from each modality, were evaluated. Micro-costing {{was used to determine}} costs. Results: The number of haemodialyses conducted ranged from 402 to 23 000 procedures per year, while for CAPD, output ranged from 70 to 2300 patient months/year. Cost ranged from RM 79. 61 to RM 475. 79 per haemodialysis treatment, with a mean cost of RM 169 per HD (USD 1 = RM 3. 80). The cost of CAPD treatment ranged from RM 1400 to RM 3200 per patient month, with a mean of RM 2186. Both modalities incurred similar outpatient costs.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesDialysis-dependent {{patients}} {{often have}} central venous drainage complications. In patients with functioning arm arteriovenous fistula, this {{may result in}} venous hypertension, arm oedema and vascular access failure. Percutaneous angioplasty and stent implantation might be inadequate to resolve these issues. In these cases, new access can potentially be created with anastomosis to the subclavian vein, iliac vein or vena cava or by making a veno-venous graft to bypass the thrombosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the utility of unusual bypasses in vascular access in patients with the central vein thrombosis. MaterialsA total of 49 patients were treated. The mean number of previous vascular access surgery procedures was 7. 6 (3 – 17). We performed 19 axillo–iliac, 14 axillo–axillary bypasses and 16 conduits from the arm fistula to the jugular (nine conduits) or subclavian (seven conduits) vein <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> purposes. ResultsAll fistulas except one were used <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> One patient died before the first use of the fistula.

40|$|Background Autologous {{arteriovenous}} fistulae (AVF) are {{the optimal}} form of vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> AVFs typically require 6 to 8  weeks to “mature” {{from the time}} of surgery before they can be cannulated. Patients with end-stage renal disease needing urgent vascular access therefore traditionally require insertion of a tunnelled central venous catheter (TCVC). TCVCs are associated with high infection rates and central venous stenosis. Early cannulation synthetic arteriovenous grafts (ecAVG) provide a novel alternative to TCVCs, permitting rapid access to the bloodstream and immediate needling <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> Published rates of infection in small series are low. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare whether TCVC[*]±[*]AVF or ecAVG[*]±[*]AVF provide a better strategy for managing patients requiring immediate vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> Methods/design This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the strategy of TCVC[*]±[*]AVF to ecAVG[*]±[*]AVF. Patients requiring urgent vascular access will receive a study information sheet and written consent will be obtained. Patients will be randomised to receive either: (i) TCVC (and native AVF if this is anatomically possible) or (ii) ecAVG (± AVF). 118 patients will be recruited. The primary outcome is systemic bacteraemia at 6  months. Secondary outcomes include culture-proven bacteraemia rates at 1  year and 2  years; primary and secondary patency rates at 3, 6, 12 and 24  months; stenoses; re-intervention rates; re-admission rate; mortality and quality of life. Additionally, treatment delays, impact on service provision and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated. Discussion This is the first randomised controlled trial comparing TCVC to ecAVG for patients requiring urgent vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> The complications of TCVC are considered an unfortunate necessity in patients requiring urgent haemodialysis who do not have autologous vascular access. If this study demonstrates that ecAVGs provide a safe and practical alternative to TCVC, this could instigate a paradigm shift in nephrology thinking and access planning. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aim To review {{recent studies}} which {{identify}} {{the factors that}} contribute to stress, burnout and job satisfaction for nurses who are working in haemodialysis units. Background Regardless of where nurses work, stress, job burnout and dissatisfaction are known to cause high rates of nurse resignations and for many of those to leave the profession entirely. Understanding {{factors that contribute to}} job satisfaction, stress and burnout could increase haemodialysis nurse retention and improve health outcomes <b>for</b> people receiving <b>haemodialysis.</b> Evaluation Studies of job stress, burnout and satisfaction for nurses working in haemodialysis units published in English from January 2000 to December 2009 were identified. Specific inclusion criteria were developed resulting in eleven articles selected for this review. Key issues Specifically <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> nurses’ job stress and burnout was found to originate from two factors related to either patient care or organisations. Patient care factors included unrealistic patient expectations, progressive decline of a patient’s health, and violence and verbal abuse from patients. Organisational factors included shortage of time to complete tasks, lack of resources and unsupportive work environments. Increased job satisfaction <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> nurses was due to having job security, freedom to use one’s judgement and the quality of nurse/physician interactions. Conclusion Job stress and burnout are problematic <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> nurses.

30|$|The AV fistula is {{considered}} the best long-term vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> because it provides adequate blood flow, is long-lasting and has a lower complication rate than other types of access. A nephrologist or surgeon creates an AV fistula. As a result, the vein grows larger and stronger, making repeated needle insertions <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> treatments easier. AV fistulas also present some disvantages, including the incomplete maturation of the vein, and a 1 – 4 -month period may be required before the AV fistula can be used. Fistula dysfunction {{is the most common}} reason for a second intervention and recurrent hospitalisation. The rate of AVF complications increases with age and the erythropoietin dose as well as among patients with a history of a previous failed shunt [56].

Radial artery and cephalic vein diameter less than 1. 6  mm was associated with early fistula failure. The intraoperative fistula blood flow did not correlate with the outcome of the operation probably due to vessel spasm from manipulation. However, blood flow velocities measured non-invasively 1 day after the operation were significantly lower in fistulae that failed early compared with those that were adequate <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> Most of the increase in fistula diameter and blood flow occur within the first 2 weeks of surgery...|$|R

The former patient received a second endothelialised graft. In two further patients revision of the outflow was performed. In two patients a functioning graft was excised, in one case because of bleeding of a venous aneurysm and in one case because of suspected infection.
