5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{the street}} {{began to be}} popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for {{residential}} purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading {{up and down the street}} in a pretentious manner.|$|E

25|$|In metaphysical terms, the Copenhagen {{interpretation}} views {{quantum mechanics}} as providing knowledge of phenomena, {{but not as}} pointing to 'really existing objects', which it regarded as residues of ordinary intuition. This makes it an epistemic theory. This may be contrasted with Einstein's view, that physics <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> 'really existing objects', making itself an ontic theory.|$|E
25|$|In {{statistical}} mechanics, scale invariance is {{a feature}} of phase transitions. The key observation is that near a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> an explicitly scale-invariant theory to describe the phenomena. Such theories are scale-invariant statistical field theories, and are formally very similar to scale-invariant quantum field theories.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{microscopic}} physics {{of these two}} systems is completely different, their critical exponents {{turn out to be}} the same. Moreover, one can calculate these exponents using the same statistical field theory. The key observation is that at a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a scale-invariant statistical field theory to describe the phenomena. In a sense, universality is the observation that there are relatively few such scale-invariant theories.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty. A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E
25|$|Irish Terriers {{are good}} with people. They have a highly {{developed}} sense of loyalty {{and it is}} important that they have a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one if you are not prepared to walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used – instead use distraction and reward the behaviour you want. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a person who has experience with terriers.|$|E

500|$|A short {{distance}} from the foundering ship, Baalham's boat encountered the partly filled port quarter boat. The loads were equalized, and the two vessels, with 45 persons in all, agreed to proceed under Baalham's overall command. After briefly considering—and rejecting—a suggestion that they <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> other survivors, the two unprovisioned boats began rowing {{in the direction of}} the Newfoundland coast. Without an adequate compass, Baalham navigated by the run of the sea and occasional glimpses of the stars. [...] Many of these survivors were freezing through extensive immersion in the cold water, about nevertheless, they rowed through the night and the next day. Twice they sighted ships in the distance, but were not seen. Early on the morning of September 29 they were close to the shoreline of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, and shortly afterwards the two boats landed at Broad Cove, about [...] south of St John's.|$|E

But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events." [...] In a February 2006 column published at National Review Online and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, [...] "One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed."

2500|$|The {{founding}} of Aguascalientes as a town {{came from the}} order that King Felipe II gave the judge of the court of Nueva Galicia, Don Geronimo de Orozco, in which he stated that he <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a rich man to settle in the territory {{with the purpose of}} expelling the Chichimecas and of assuring safe passage. Geronimo de Orozco, following that order, looked for someone who would accept the king's order and found a man named Juan de Montoro in the city of Santa Maria de los Lagos. He accepted the assignment and, accompanied by eleven other people, headed to the territory and thus founded the town of Aguas Calientes on October 22 of 1575. [...] It has been noted that it was called San Marcos originally, changing its name on August 18, 1611, to the Villa of Our Lady of the Assumption of Aguas Calientes. And finally, from June 2, 1875, it was called the Villa of Our Lady of the Assumption of Aguas Calientes; later changing to the city of Aguascalientes, which remains its name today.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 July 2013, the Mars 2020 Science Definition Team {{reiterated that}} the rover <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> signs of past life, collect samples for {{possible}} future return to Earth, and demonstrate technology for future human exploration of Mars. [...] The Science Definition Team proposed the rover collect and package {{as many as}} 31 samples of rock cores and soil for a later mission to bring back for more definitive analysis in laboratories on Earth, but in 2015 the concept was changed to collect even more samples and distribute the tubes in small piles {{across the surface of}} Mars. However, returning the samples to Earth would likely require two additional missions: one rover to land on Mars, take the samples collected by Mars 2020, and launch them into Mars orbit; and another to collect the sample canister in Mars orbit and return it to Earth. Neither of those missions is under development by NASA, but {{it has been suggested that}} the proposed Mars 2022 orbiter may play a role in such future mission.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Tyler, though, puts {{forward a}} number of {{coherent}} objections to this line of enquiry. Firstly, as he points out, these metaphors, while present in certain Islamic sources {{in other parts of}} the Muslim world, are not always prominent in the Andalucian and North African Islamic sources. Secondly, in any case, John is using them in different ways from the Islamic sources. Thirdly, and crucially, there seems to have been little cultural interplay between Islamic culture and Christian culture in Spain by the late sixteenth century, with sources existing in different languages, not being translated, and of course all Muslims already having been forced to leave Spain. Rather, Tyler concludes, there [...] "are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to suggest we <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> Christian sources rather than Muslim sources". As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, it might make more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence.|$|E
