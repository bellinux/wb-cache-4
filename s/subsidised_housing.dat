25|$|Ukraine {{produces}} {{the fourth largest}} number of post-secondary graduates in Europe, while being ranked seventh in population. Higher education is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some universities. For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the government subsidy {{is not sufficient to}} cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide <b>subsidised</b> <b>housing</b> for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students. Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the bachelor's degree (4years) and the master's degree (5–6thyear), in accordance with the Bologna process. Historically, Specialist degree (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.|$|E
25|$|On 28 December 1833, {{the civil}} parish of Santa Maria de Belém, {{including}} the parish of Ajuda, was institutionalised with its {{seat in the}} Jerónimos Monastery. Rapid industrialization began in this period and continued throughout the 19th century; an 1881 inquiry established that 25 factories produced goods in the Alcântara-Belém region, employing 1215 men, 812 women and 432 minors. The growth attracted many new residents and <b>subsidised</b> <b>housing</b> was constructed to support the manufacturing industry. Belém subsequently had more autonomy: a separate municipality of Belém actually existed between 11 September 1852 and 18 June 1885, presided over by its first President, the historian Alexandre Herculano. The municipality included the parishes of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, Santa Maria de Belém, part of São Pedro de Alcântara, Santa Isabel and São Sebastião da Pedreira, as well as Nossa Senhora do Amparo de Benfica, São Lourenço de Carnide and Menino Jesus de Odivelas. The royal family of King Louis of Portugal and Queen Maria Pia of Savoy began to reside in the Ajuda National Palace.|$|E

2500|$|King Louis-Philippe {{was overthrown}} in the February Revolution of 1848. [...] On 10 December 1848, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, {{the nephew of}} Napoléon Bonaparte, [...] won the first direct presidential {{elections}} ever held in France with an overwhelming 74.2 {{percent of the votes}} cast. [...] He was elected largely because of his famous name, but also because of his promise to try to end poverty and improve the lives of ordinary people. [...] Though he had been born in Paris, he had lived very little in the city; [...] from the age of seven, he had lived in exile in Switzerland, England, and the United States, and for six years in prison in France for attempting to overthrow King Louis-Philippe. [...] He had been especially impressed by London, with its wide streets, squares and large public parks. In 1852 he gave a public speech declaring: [...] "Paris is the heart of France. Let us apply our efforts to embellishing this great city. [...] Let us open new streets, make the working class quarters, which lack air and light, [...] more healthy, and let the beneficial sunlight reach everywhere within our walls". [...] As soon as he was President, he supported the building of the first <b>subsidised</b> <b>housing</b> project for workers in Paris, [...] the Cité-Napoléon, on the rue Rochechouart. He proposed the completion of the rue de Rivoli from the Louvre to the Hôtel de Ville, completing the project begun by his uncle Napoléon Bonaparte, and he began a project which would transform the Bois de Boulogne (Boulogne Forest) into a large new public park, [...] modelled after Hyde Park in London but much larger, {{on the west side of}} the city. [...] He wanted both these projects to be completed before the end of his term in 1852, but became frustrated by the slow progress made by his prefect of the Seine, Berger. [...] The prefect was unable to move the work forward on the rue de Rivoli quickly enough, and the original design for the Bois de Boulogne turned out to be a disaster; [...] the architect, Jacques Ignace Hittorff, who had designed the Place de la Concorde for Louis-Philippe, [...] followed Louis-Napoléon's instructions to imitate Hyde Park and designed two lakes connected by a stream for the new park, but forgot to take into account the difference of elevation between the two lakes. [...] If they had been built, the one lake would have immediately emptied itself into the other.|$|E

RA is a type of demand subsidy and is paid directly to low income households to improve their capacity to pay for housing in the private rental market and for some types of community housing. Increasing reliance on demand subsidies for housing in Australia mirrors the experience of many advanced industrialised countries that rely increasingly on this type of assistance rather than supply subsidy programs that <b>subsidise</b> <b>housing</b> providers and in which subsidies are attached to specific dwellings, such as public housing units.

40|$|This {{special issue}} {{collects}} {{a selection of}} papers that focus on different aspects related to the analysis and evaluation of complex and large scale infrastructure projects. Infrastructure includes highly heterogeneous assets whose main tasks are to provide public services and/or public goods to industry and households. The most common infrastructure assets are (Rietveld and Bruinsma, 1996; Grimsey, 2002) : highways and roads, rails, bridges and tunnels, parking facilities, mass-transit and airport facilities, seaports, education buildings, electricity, gas and water supply facilities and distribution systems, waste treatment facilities, broadcast and wireless towers, telecommunication, cable networks, satellite networks, courthouses, hospitals, schools, correction facilities, stadiums, and <b>subsidised</b> <b>houses.</b> Both scholars and policy-makers recognise that infrastructure investment is an important lever to stimulate economic development and growth. Indeed, infrastructure projects boost employment by creating new jobs and a highly dispersed construction and manufacturing economic activity, generating a considerable multiplier effect in a country economy. Further, infrastructure investments may help to gain business productivity (i. e., saving costs and/or increasing production amount) and remove barriers that hamper or impede development (Ahmed and Donovan, 1992).

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the concepts of}} housing affordability and policies for increasing housing affordability. Most current measures of housing affordability used in Australia {{are based on the}} acquisition costs of housing. They define housing costs in nominal rather than in real terms and include mortgage repayments that are properly regarded as savings. Moreover, they do not account for household choice over type of house or household composition. The first part of this article proposes that measures of housing affordability should be based on real housing user costs or rents. Turning to policy issues, this article argues that housing affordability is essentially a household income problem made worse by government restrictions on housing supply. High housing costs do not reflect housing market failures. To reduce housing costs, the government should allow more housing in established and Greenfield areas. The government may also improve <b>housing</b> affordability by <b>subsidising</b> <b>housing</b> for low-income households. However, subsidies to urban infrastructure nearly always raise the price of land rather than reduce the price of housing. Also, the Australian government's proposed national housing and rental affordability funds are poorly defined and likely to be ineffective.
