Furthermore to verify the linearity of various <b>sobuzoxane</b> concentrations for quantitative evaluation, test of the stability of <b>sobuzoxane</b> in a working solution, and examine <b>sobuzoxane</b> in acid/base stress tests. UHPLC-UV method with gradient elution was developed for the analysis of <b>sobuzoxane,</b> ICRF- 154, and dexrazoxane. Analyte separation was achieved using a Zorbax-Aq rapid resolution HT chromatograpjic column (3 mm x 100 mm; 1, 8 µm). Methanol and 2 mmol/l ammonium formate acidified to pH 4 with formic acid were used as the mobile phase at following gradient 0 min - 4, 5 min 20 % methanol, 4, 5 min - 8 min 80 % methanol, 8 min - 11 min 20 % methanol. Analytes were recorded using a UV detector set at a wavelength of 254 nm. Linearity of the method for <b>sobuzoxane</b> was verified in the range (50 µg/ml - 400 µg/ml) using linear regression. The developed method was used to test stability of <b>sobuzoxane</b> in a working solution during analysis and under acid/base stress conditions. The original goal of analyzing one working [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Bisdioxopiperazines {{have been}} {{synthesized}} {{for the treatment}} of tumors with a significant antiproliferative effect. However, they have low bioavailability after oral administration. Consequently, <b>sobuzoxane</b> has been developed. It has been prepared as a prodrug of bisdioxopiperazine ICRF- 154 to increase its bioavailability and ease the oral administration {{for the treatment of}} lymphomas and leukemias. It is assumed that <b>sobuzoxane</b> is metabolized to an active metabolite of ICRF- 154, and then supposedly converted to open analog EDTA-diamide. During preclinical researches of bisdioxopiperazines it has been discovered that they reduce the adverse effects (cardiotoxicity) of anthracyclines. Dexrazoxane has the greatest cardioprotective potential, so it has been used for 20 years as cardioprotective drug. The exact mechanism of antiproliferative and cardioprotective effects has not been fully understood yet. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop UHPLC-MS / MS method which enables the simultaneous analysis of <b>sobuzoxane</b> and it is anticipated metabolites, which would help in studying bioactivation of <b>sobuzoxane</b> in cardiac cells, in cell medium, and in plasma. There was developed UHPLC-MS/MS method with gradient elution for the analysis of sobuzoxan, ICRF- 154 and EDTAm in plasma and cell medium. For [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Anthracyclines (such as {{doxorubicin}} or daunorubicin) {{are among}} the most effective anticancer drugs, but their usefulness is hampered by the risk of irreversible cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane (ICRF- 187) is the only clinically approved cardioprotective agent against anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Its activity has traditionally been attributed to the iron-chelating effects of its metabolite with subsequent protection from oxidative stress. However, dexrazoxane is also a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II (TOP 2). Therefore, we examined whether dexrazoxane and two other TOP 2 catalytic inhibitors, namely <b>sobuzoxane</b> (MST- 16) and merbarone, protect cardiomyocytes from anthracycline toxicity and assessed their effects on anthracycline antineoplastic efficacy. Dexrazoxane and two other TOP 2 inhibitors protected isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes against toxicity induced by both doxorubicin and daunorubicin. However, none of the TOP 2 inhibitors significantly protected cardiomyocytes in a model of hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury. In contrast, the catalytic inhibitors did not compromise the antiproliferative effects of the anthracyclines in the HL- 60 leukemic cell line; instead, synergistic interactions were mostly observed. Additionally, anthracycline-induced caspase activation was differentially modulated by the TOP 2 inhibitors in cardiac and cancer cells. Whereas dexrazoxane was upon hydrolysis able to significantly chelate intracellular labile iron ions, no such effect was noted for either <b>sobuzoxane</b> or merbarone. In conclusion, our data indicate that dexrazoxane may protect cardiomyocytes via its catalytic TOP 2 inhibitory activity rathe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{in vitro}} antioxidant, {{antimicrobial}} and antitopoisomerase activities of crude Methanolic (Me) and Hexane (He) extracts {{of the stem}} bark of Ardisia compressa (AC) were investigated. Free radical-scavenging activity against 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was evaluated, acid ascorbic was used as reference standard. Antimicrobial activity was determined using the agar diffusion method; the bacteria K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. epidermidis and the fungus C. albicans. Controls employed were chloranphenicol (30 µg) and nystatin (100 units). Topoisomerase inhibition was determined by a clone-forming assay, which uses yeast (S. cerevisiae) strains as a model. Controls included dimethyl sulfoxide (1. 66 %); campothecin (50 µg/ml), etoposide (100 µg/ml) and <b>sobuzoxane</b> (150 µg/ml). Ascorbic acid was a substantially more powerful antioxidant than the extracts from the stem bark of AC. The Antiradical Efficiency (AE) of ascorbic acid was 249 -fold that for He and 8. 3 -fold that for Me. Only the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited by Me (MIC = 1. 875 mg/ml) and He (MIC = 0. 9375 mg/ml), while {{the growth of the}} other strains were not inhibited. He extract not showed antitopoisomerase activity. Me extract showed antitopoisomerase activity (- 15. 3 %). Open column chromatography of the methanolic extract was conducted and fourteen fractions were collected and tested. Fractions VI (- 21. 55 %), X (- 42. 49 %), XI (- 97. 68 %), XII (- 52. 34 %) and XIII (- 35. 97 %) showed antitopoisomerase I activity and fraction XIV (- 79 %) antitopoisomerase II (poison) activity. These results suggest that Me extract of the stem bark of A. compressa could be promising in its potential usefulness for treatment of cancer and deserves further investigation.
