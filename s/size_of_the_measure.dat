These external fields are called rational since their derivatives are rational functions. We analyze the evolution of the equilibrium measure, and its support, when the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure,</b> t, or other parameters in the external field vary. Our analysis is illustrated by studying with detail the case of a generalized Gauss-Penner model, which, in addition to its mathematical relevance, has important physical applications (in the framework of random matrix models).

40|$|Probe {{compensation}} {{is an essential}} element in near-field measurements when accurate fields are required. However, <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> probe compensation techniques heavily depends on <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> used probe factor. A major source <b>of</b> errors in <b>the</b> probe factors used in scalar and vector {{compensation is}} the truncation error. Increasing <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measuring</b> plane offers a solution, but is not practical in most cases. First, not every near-field scanner allows to measure a large area. Second, increasing <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measuring</b> plane also increases the measurement time. In this paper, a novel method to reduce <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> truncation errors on probe compensation is presented. The method uses auxiliary dipoles to extrapolate <b>the</b> <b>measured</b> near-field values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference structure(s) outside <b>the</b> <b>measuring</b> plane. <b>The</b> accuracy and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> method is evaluated for both scalar and vector compensation algorithms. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} that natural supersymmetry at the weak scale is not realized in nature.
