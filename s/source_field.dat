Findings - A reduced characterization of such fields is shown to be convenient for the coupling with complementary reaction fields and for simply and explicitly defining non-local quantities, such as currents in h-conform magnetodynamic formulations. The reduced form rests on the choice of supports for the fields limited to reduced cut spaces associated with cuts making the definition domain simply connected.

40|$|The B-mode {{polarization}} in {{the cosmic}} microwave background (CMB) anisotropies at large angular scales provides a smoking-gun evidence for the primordial gravitational waves (GWs). It is often stated that a discovery of the GWs establishes the quantum fluctuation of vacuum during the cosmic inflation. Since the GWs could also be generated by <b>source</b> <b>fields,</b> however, we need to check if a sizable signal exists due to such <b>source</b> <b>fields</b> before reaching a firm conclusion when the B-mode is discovered. <b>Source</b> <b>fields</b> of particular types can generate non-Gaussianity (NG) in the GWs. Testing statistics of the B-mode is a powerful way of detecting such NG. As a concrete example, we show a model in which a gauge <b>field</b> <b>sources</b> chiral GWs via a pseudoscalar coupling, and forecast the detection significance at the future CMB satellite LiteBIRD. Effects of residual foregrounds and lensing B-mode are both taken into account. We find the B-mode bispectrum "BBB" is in particular sensitive to the source-field NG, which is detectable at LiteBIRD with a > 3 σ significance. Therefore the search for the "BBB" will be indispensable toward unambiguously establishing quantum fluctuation of vacuum when the B-mode is discovered. We also introduced the Minkowski functional to detect the NGs. While we find that the Minkowski functional is less efficient than the harmonic-space bispectrum estimator, it still serves as a useful cross check. Finally, we also discuss the possibility of extracting clean information on parity violation of GWs, and new types of parity-violating observables induced by lensing.
