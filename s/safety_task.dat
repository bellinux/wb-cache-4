40|$|Political skill, which {{consists}} of social astuteness, interpersonal influence, networking ability, and apparent sincerity dimensions, is considered {{as one of the}} most important skills in general management. However, its importance in construction management, particularly construction safety management, is still not as well known. The aim of this research is to understand the role of political skill in implementing <b>safety</b> management <b>tasks</b> and developing construction safety climate. Quantitative research methodology was adopted to test the theoretical model developed in this research. Data were collected via a web-based online survey and the analysis was done using structural equation modeling (SEM) method. The results of the analysis support the research hypotheses which proposed that project personnel's political skill positively influences the implementation of <b>safety</b> management <b>tasks</b> and promotes the development of construction safety climate. Apparent sincerity and social astuteness are the political skill dimensions that initiate the whole relationships. They are the precursors of networking ability and interpersonal influence dimensions. Thereafter, interpersonal influence has positive impact on the implementation of <b>safety</b> management <b>tasks.</b> Finally, apparent sincerity and implementation of <b>safety</b> management <b>tasks</b> promote the development of construction safety climate. It is suggested that construction companies should incorporate the training of political skill into their human resource development programs and include <b>safety</b> management <b>tasks</b> into their <b>safety</b> management programs...|$|R

50|$|In Belgium and The Netherlands, train {{conductors}} {{have multiple}} <b>tasks</b> involving train <b>safety</b> and customer services. Belgian/Dutch train conductors {{are responsible for}} the departure of the train. In each station they give the permission to move on by giving a ready signal to the train driver. Therefore, train conductors in Belgium and The Netherlands always close (and in some scenarios also open) the doors. They are also responsible for performing <b>safety</b> <b>tasks</b> {{in case of an emergency}} or accident, such as fire, evacuation, etc. Because of these tasks, there has to be at least one conductor on each passenger train; a train without a conductor is uncommon, but still appears on some regional Dutch trains. The departure trains always have one conductor who is conductor-in-chief. He is responsible for the entire train, the on-board crew and the passengers. Some longer trains may have additional conductors who are under command of the conductor-in-chief. Besides the <b>safety</b> <b>tasks,</b> conductors also collect and punch tickets, fine people for not having a valid fare and make announcements to the passengers.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that creating {{and maintaining a}} safety culture in an organisation can lead to improved safety performance (Wu, Chen & Li, 2007). Recent investigations into construction site safety culture (Biggs et al., 2006, Dingsdag et al., 2006) have provided a means through which the industry could {{address the issue of}} improving safety culture. This chapter reports on a project to continue development of the Construction Safety Competency Framework, which identified <b>safety</b> management <b>tasks,</b> <b>safety</b> critical positions and skills, knowledge and behaviours required to create a safety culture. The current project formulated comprehensive implementation guides covering the 39 <b>Safety</b> Management <b>Tasks</b> and the <b>safety</b> critical positions identified in the Competency Framework. Developmental issues, industry liaison processes, and stakeholder ownership issues are discussed as well as future implications for skill acquisition of <b>safety</b> critical <b>tasks</b> and recruitment and professional development concerns.

50|$|DO-178B {{alone is}} not {{intended}} to guarantee software safety aspects. Safety attributes in the design and as implemented as functionality must receive additional mandatory system <b>safety</b> <b>tasks</b> to drive and show objective evidence of meeting explicit safety requirements. Typically IEEE STD-1228-1994 Software Safety Plans are allocated and software <b>safety</b> analyses <b>tasks</b> are accomplished in sequential steps (requirements analysis, top level design analysis, detailed design analysis, code level analysis, test analysis and change analysis). These software <b>safety</b> <b>tasks</b> and artifacts are integral supporting parts of the process for hazard severity and DAL determination to be documented in system safety assessments (SSA). The certification authorities require and DO-178B specifies the correct DAL be established using these comprehensive analyses methods to establish the software level A-E. Any software that commands, controls, and monitors safety-critical functions should receive the highest DAL - Level A. It is the software safety analyses that drive the system safety assessments that determine the DAL that drives the appropriate level of rigor in DO-178B. The system safety assessments combined with methods such as SAE ARP 4754A determine the after mitigation DAL and may allow reduction of the DO-178B software level objectives to be satisfied if redundancy, design safety features and other architectural forms of hazard mitigation are in requirements driven by the safety analyses. Therefore, DO-178B central theme is design assurance and verification after the prerequisite safety requirements have been established.|$|R
