40|$|Design and {{modelling}} {{aspects of}} torsional 1 D and 2 D Micro Scanning Mirrors are presented. During the oscillation {{of the mirror}} plate the inertial moment {{gives rise to a}} deformation of the plate. This dynamic deformation results in a defocusing of the reflected laser beam. Therefore, the scan frequency of a device with a given size of the mirror plate and deflection angle is limited. Further restrictions arise from the demanded mechanical robustness like resistivity against shock and torsional stress. This leads to a minimum eigenfrequency of the device which {{in the case of a}} rectangular <b>shaped</b> <b>spring</b> is proportional to the width of the spring. To enable a single mode operation it is advantageous that the torsion around the springs is the lowest mode sufficiently separated from all others. A FEM-analysis has been carried out to determine the mode sequence of a 1 D and 2 D Micro Scanner respectively. The analytical calculated eigenfrequencies agree well with the numerical determined. Taken into account the results of the analytical and numerical investigations several 1 D and 2 D Micro Scanning Mirrors have been designed and fabricated. The mirror and the springs are defined in a 20 to 30 µm thick single crystal silicon layer. The results of the experimental investigations with respect to the shock resistivity and the long run behaviour prove the suitability of the modelling...|$|E

On {{the day of the}} incident, the victim, a co-worker (an assistant engineer) and a student intern drove to a landfill to replace a battery of a flow meter that had been placed in a manhole. Once they arrived at the site, the victim opened the manhole cover with a pickaxe. The manhole was 7 ’ 4 ” deep and 24 ” in diameter at the point of entry. There were four iron rungs mounted into the cement wall of the manhole to form a ladder. The flow meter was attached to the top rung that was 34 inches below the manhole opening by a “U ” <b>shaped</b> <b>spring</b> loaded handle. The victim used a hook made of a wire hanger to catch a string that was looped and tied around the handle of the flow meter.

40|$|Abstract. Fretting wear {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on the wear behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare the wear behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting <b>spring</b> <b>shapes.</b> The variation of the real worn area in the wear scar, the change in the wear volume and the maximum wear depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of the wear tests showed that the wear volume and the maximum wear depth were sensitively affected by each <b>spring</b> <b>shape</b> with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the wear scar, it is possible to separate the size of the wear scar from the real worn area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the wear volume has a linear relation with the real worn area rather than the size of the wear scar and this was only determined by using each <b>spring</b> <b>shape</b> even though the wear tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a wear resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the real worn area and the wear behavior at each <b>spring</b> <b>shape...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: GTM have {{developed}} a primary torque standard which covers the range from 1 Nm to 1 kNm with a single load frame and only one weight stack per direction of operation. The design comprises a double-sided lever, supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a counter-torque drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the lever support, less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass <b>shaped</b> <b>springs</b> for the lever support can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of lever length falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides.

40|$|Springs have {{a complex}} geometry. In operation, large elastic {{deformations}} occur. Contacts within the spring, e. g. contacts of coils, and contacts to bordering components {{have to be}} taken into account. They all lead to great nonlinearities. Further difficulties are caused by spring natural oscillations in dynamic operations such as higher stress levels, friction, noises as well as lateral movements. The experimental analysis of springs is time-consuming. Therefore numerical simulation programs have been used more and more often. These programs are only usable by calculation engineers, specialy trained in the utilized numeric method and in spring technology. Therefore, with the FEM-spring-processor (FEM=Finite-Element-Method) and the MBS-spring-processor (MBS=Multi-Body Systems) two powerful object-oriented programs were developed, both usable without special knowledge of the numeric methods, with an easy-to-use graphical user-interface.

40|$|Solute {{concentration}} variations during flood {{events were}} investigated in a karst aquifer of the Swiss Jura. Observations {{were made at}} the spring, and at the three main subterraneous tributaries feeding the spring. A simple transient flow and transport numerical model was able to reproduce chemographs and hydrographs observed at the spring, {{as a result of}} a mixing of the concentration and discharge of the respective tributaries. Sensitivity analysis carried out with the model showed that it is possible to produce chemical variations at the spring even if all tributaries have constant (but different for each of them) solute concentrations. This process is called tributary mixing. The good match between observed and modelled curves indicate that, in the phreatic zone, tributary mixing is probably an important process that <b>shapes</b> <b>spring</b> chemographs. Chemical reactions and other mixing components (e. g. from low permeability volumes) have a limited influence. Dissolution-related (calcium, bicarbonate, specific conductance) and pollution-related parameters (nitrate, chloride, potassium) displayed slightly different behaviours: during moderate flood events, the former showed limited variations compared to the latter. During large flood events, both presented chemographs with significant changes. No significant event water participates in moderate flood events and tributary mixing will be the major process shaping chemographs. Variations are greater for parameters with higher spatial variability (e. g. pollution-related). Whereas for large flood events, the contribution of event water becomes significant and influences the chemographs of all the parameters. As a result, spring water vulnerability to an accidental pollution is low during moderate flood events and under base flow conditions. It strongly increases during large flood events, because event water contributes to the spring discharge...|$|R
