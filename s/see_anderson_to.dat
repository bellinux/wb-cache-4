40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we conduct a Monte Carlo study to {{determine}} the power of Pearson’s overall goodness-of-fit test {{as well as the}} “Pearson analog ” tests (<b>see</b> <b>Anderson</b> (1994)) <b>to</b> detect rejections due to shifts in variance, skewness and kurtosis, as we vary the number and location of the partition points. Simulations are conducted for small and moderate sample sizes. While it is generally recommended that to improve the power of the goodness-of-fit test the partition points are equiprobable, we find that power can be improved by the use of non-equiprobable partitions...|$|R

50|$|England faced South Africa {{at the end}} of the summer, {{with their}} Number One ranking on the line. The series was also {{anticipated}} as a chance <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Anderson</b> go head <b>to</b> head with Dale Steyn, regarded as the world's two best seam bowlers. The series was a disappointment for England. They lost the first Test by an innings, with Anderson managing figures of 1-116. The second Test was a tighter affair, with the match ending in a draw, but Anderson could only manage three wickets in the match. England lost the third Test, meaning a 2-0 series defeat, and South Africa earned their place at the top of the Test rankings. Anderson took 4-44 in the third ODI, and 2-41 in the fifth as the series ended as 2-2 draw. This was seen as a positive result for England, with several young players being blooded against an experienced South African team.|$|R

60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{varieties}} not naturally intercrossing, I have ascertained that the pea, which in this respect differs from some other Leguminosae, is perfectly fertile {{without the aid of}} insects. Yet I have seen humble-bees whilst sucking the nectar depress the keel-petals, and become so thickly dusted with pollen, that it could hardly fail to be left on the stigma of the next flower which was visited. Nevertheless, distinct varieties growing closely together rarely cross; and I have reason to believe that this is due to their stigmas being prematurely fertilised in this country by pollen from the same flower. The horticulturists who raise seed-peas are thus enabled to plant distinct varieties close together without any bad consequences; and it is certain, as I have myself found, that true seed may be saved during at least several generations under these circumstances. (9/88. <b>See</b> Dr. <b>Anderson</b> <b>to</b> the same effect in the 'Bath Soc. Agricultural Papers' volume 4 page 87.) Mr. Fitch raised, as he informs me, one variety for twenty years, and it always came true, though grown close to other varieties. From the analogy of kidney-beans I should have expected (9/89. I have published full details of experiments on this subject in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 October 25.) that varieties thus circumstanced would have occasionally crossed; and I shall give in the eleventh chapter two cases of this having occurred, as shown (in a manner hereafter to be explained) by the pollen of the one variety having acted directly on the seeds of the other. Whether many of the new varieties which incessantly appear are due to such occasional and accidental crosses, I do not know. Nor do I know whether the short existence of almost all the numerous varieties is the result of mere change of fashion, or of their having a weak constitution, from being the product of long-continued self- fertilisation. It may, however, be noticed that several of Andrew Knight's varieties, which have endured longer than most kinds, were raised towards the close of the last century by artificial crosses; some of them, I believe, were still vigorous in 1860; but now, in 1865, a writer, speaking (9/90. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 387.) of Knight's four kinds of marrows, says, they have acquired a famous history, but their glory has departed.|$|R
