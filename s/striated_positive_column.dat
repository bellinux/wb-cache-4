40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental study is reported of steady-state and time-dependent {{characteristics of the}} <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> and the hollow cathode discharge (HCD). The steady state of a non-isothermal, cylindrical <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in an axial magnetic field is described by three moment equations in the plasma approximation. Volume generation of electron-ion pairs by single-stage ionization, the presence of axial current, and collisions with neutrals are considered. The theory covers the range from the low pressure, collisionless regime to the intermediate pressure, collisional regime. It yields radial profiles of the charged particle velocities, density, potential, electron and ion temperatures, and demonstrates similarity laws for the <b>positive</b> <b>column.</b> The results are compared with two moment theories and with experimental data on He, Ar and Hg {{found in the literature}} {{for a wide range of}} pressures.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMoving striations and anode oscillations were studied {{over a wide}} range of gas pressures and discharge currents in an argon glow discharge. Striation spacing, frequency and velocity were measured as a function of discharge current from low currents to the current for extinction of moving striations, for pressures from 1 to 16 mm Hg. Striation frequency was also measured as a function of pressure for various radii discharge tubes. The anode spot light oscillations were eliminated by use of an auxiliary anode discharge, which brought the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in contact with the anode and eliminated the oscillat­ing anode fall in potential. This change in the anode region produced no significant change in the striation parameters, but greatly reduced and altered the frequency of the poten­tial oscillations across the discharge tube. The potential oscillations now followed the wave form and frequency of the striation oscillations instead of the frequency of the anode spot oscillations. By use of a discharge tube, constructed with sections of different radius, moving striations in the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> were isolated from both cathode and anode by sections of homogenous <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in which no voltage oscillations were detectable by floating probes. This leads to the con­clusion that striations are due to an inherent instability of the <b>positive</b> <b>column,</b> and not to the effects developed by the anode or cathode.

40|$|The {{electron}} energy distribution function (EEDF) in a <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> of low-pressure and discharge current is determined {{not only by}} the local collision processes and the axial electric field action, but also by the transport phenomenon, the radial ambipolar diffusion due to the gradient of plasma density. Thus, to completely determine the EEDF, the Boltzmann equation including radial inhomogeneity terms has to be solved. The present work proposes a simplified method to account for the radial inhomogeneity, when the electron kinetics in {{the central part of the}} <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> can be reduced to be one energy-dimensional. The radial diffusion of electrons is taken into account via a wall loss term. A greatly simplified kinetic equation is obtained and its numerical solutions agree well with the EEDF determined from Langmuir probe measurements in a helium dc discharge <b>positive</b> <b>column.</b> Also, a comparison of the present method with local and nonlocal approach theories is made.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a global model of micro-hollow cathode discharges working in argon gas. Inspired by experiments and two-dimensional numerical simulations, the discharge is decomposed into two main regions, labelled the cathodic {{region and the}} <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> region.

A cathode sheath model is developed to calculate the sheath size and the power dissipated by ions and electrons in the sheath. Charged-particle transport equations are solved in one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates, in the quasi-neutral plasma region, {{in order to determine}} the radial density profiles and the electron temperature in the microhole. A global power balance is then performed in the two distinct regions {{in order to determine the}} absolute electron density.

40|$|We {{consider}} the nonlocal theory of a <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in a glow discharge in two cases, where the {{mean free path}} of charged particles is either greater than the discharge tube radius (the free-flight regime) or {{much less than the}} radius (the collisional regime). The great bulk of electrons, which determines the density and the discharge current in the axial direction, appears to be trapped by the radial field of a <b>positive</b> <b>column.</b> The electron flux to the wall, which compensates for the ionization in a volume, is determined by fast electrons with energies of the order of wall potential, which are able to leave in a loss cone. The electron kinetic equation, which is solved by averaging it over the radial transits for the two regimes considered, permits us to obtain the electron density and the ionization rate. Thus, we develop the theory of a <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> for the non-Boltzmann electron distribution in the radial field. Under the free-flight regime, this theory is developed by analogy with the Langmuir-Tonks one. Under the collisional regime, the spatial distribution of the potential is obtained from the ion motion equation with the ambipolar diffusion coefficient, which depends on the radial coordinate.
