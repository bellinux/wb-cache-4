Initially he has appeared to come close to an admission, saying in 1992, [...] "in December 1970, I signed three or four documents" [...] to escape from the secret police. In his 1987 autobiography A Way of Hope, Wałęsa said, [...] "It is also the truth that I had not left that clash completely pure. They gave me a condition: signature! And then I signed." [...] He denies he acted upon the collaboration agreement. However, in his later years Wałęsa <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> documents are forgeries and told BBC in 2008, [...] "you will not find any signature of mine agreeing to collaborate anywhere".|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, while Soulfly was on tour, Max {{received}} a call from his brother, {{and by the end of}} the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix for the tenth anniversary of D-Low, an annual memorial show for Dana. At the concert, Igor joined Soulfly and performed two Sepultura songs, [...] "Roots Bloody Roots" [...] and [...] "Attitude," [...] for which Dana had written the lyrics. In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com, Max stated that performance was [...] "the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy". After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring. Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> songs were ready when he had only finished one. He added, [...] "It was one of those good lies. Everything rolled from there. What I like about the Conspiracy is that nothing is really planned. One thing leads to another. There's no pressure and it feels like a different project than anything I've done." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off {{a lot of the stuff}} that matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with several}} critics particularly complimenting the [...] "Swanson Pyramid of Greatness" [...] joke. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said the episode {{was effective in}} appealing to both new and old viewers, developing various character subplots and establishing the harvest festival story arc. He also praised the performances of Chris and Ann, which he called a far better and more interesting pairing than Ann with Mark Brendanawicz. Linda Holmes of NPR suggested the season premiere {{was a good place}} for newcomers to the series to start watching. She <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> characters were funny and the two new cast members had been seamlessly integrated into the show. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called the episode an [...] "excellent start" [...] to the season, and said the harvest festival subplot would help better focus the series by giving the characters a single goal. Poniewozki said it also [...] "reminds us that the show is about something: the idea, maybe quaint-seeming in this political climate, that civil servants can actually see themselves as servants and work in their community's interest". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] was an improvement on an already strong second season, claiming [...] "the comedy seemed snappier, the relationships better grounded and the ensemble cast at their best." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{admitted}} {{in his review}} that after seeing the promos for [...] "Generalissimo" [...] audibly groaned, and believed the story about a fictitious soap character resembling Baldwin's Jack would not work. He wrote {{that all of the}} [...] "over-the-top surreal subplots" [...] featured in the season would make this episode [...] "the worst one of all." [...] After watching the episode, however, Sassone <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> elements worked. Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly reported that the two stories, involving Liz and Drew and Jack and Elisa, respectively, were sublime. Barrett said that Baldwin's performance [...] "alone" [...] would have made the episode great. Jeremy Medina of Paste praised this episode, along with [...] "St. Valentine's Day", concluding, [...] "There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes. The show is just too lightning-quick for that." [...] Writing for The Monterey County Herald Marc Cabrera noted Jack's interactions with Elisa's grandmother amongst his favorite moments of season 3. The Guardians Will Dean wrote that [...] "Generalissimo" [...] was the [...] "best episode" [...] of the series. Staci Gold of North by Northwestern wrote that this episode was majorly improved by Baldwin's [...] "hilarious imitation of a Spanish accent." [...] IGN writer Robert Canning said that Baldwin stole the show in this episode, and rated it a 9.4 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said after}} six episodes, he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] was the episode where the Parks and Recreation {{found the right}} tone for the series and Leslie Knope character. Sepinwall <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} were very likable, the jokes seemed natural and the awkwardness of the show was turned down enough to work properly. The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said while the first five episodes of the season had been disappointing, [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked an improvement in which [...] "the characters were more defined, their quirks and rhythms understood". Matt Fowler of IGN {{said he did not}} find the episode especially funny but that it {{did a good job of}} fleshing out the characters. He said Chris Pratt was especially funny, and that his band's song [...] "The Pit" [...] was stuck in his head after the episode. The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps, who had mixed feelings about Parks and Recreation throughout the season, said [...] "Rock Show" [...] was very funny and restored his faith in the potential of the series. Phipps said he believed the show would become very popular in the second season, and that people would later claim to like the first season more than they did the first time they saw it. In October 2009, while reviewing the second season episode [...] "Sister City", A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said he believed Parks and Recreation showed a streak of vast improvement that started with [...] "Rock Show" [...] and continued into the second season.|$|E

An independent review was solicited by the zoo in December 2009 and {{was conducted by}} the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums. [...] The report, released in 2010, spotlighted systemic problems. In response, the zoo developed a 36-point plan that included improving animal care procedures and collection planning, addressing staffing issues like training and structure, enhancing security systems and safety drills, and upgrading aging zoo infrastructure. Later that year, the zoo hired noted animal welfare specialist, Dr. Jake Veasey, who has since instituted major changes and spearheaded new investment in animal facilities.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{documentary}} short that profiled Hank, his mother related how doctors {{had told her}} that Hank's liver was damaged, and that she didn't know how long he had to live, and that she [...] "didn't know what to do." [...] Hank had been in rehab before, as well as court-mandated detox, and it had never worked. [...] Once Hank was even kicked out of Alcoholics Anonymous because he brought into the meeting a bottle of Mad Dog 20-20 and started drinking it five seconds after the meeting started. [...] Regarding trying to get Hank help for his alcoholism, Howard Stern explained, [...] "People always asked me if we {{tried to get him to}} stop drinking, and I <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time we did..."

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1962, aged 11, Bolland remembers {{thinking}} that [...] "Carmine Infantino's {{work on the}} Flash and Gil Kane's on Green Lantern and the Atom had a sophistication about it that I hadn't [...] seen." [...] He would later cite Kane and Alex Toth as [...] "pinnacle of excellence," [...] alongside [...] "Curt Swan, Murphy Anderson, Sid Greene, Joe Kubert, Ross Andru, Mike Esposito, Nick Cardy and the under-rated Bruno Premiani," [...] whose influences showed in his [...] "early crude stabs at drawing comics." [...] The young Bolland did not rate Marvel Comics as highly as DC, feeling the covers cluttered and the paper quality crude. His appreciation of the artwork of Jack Kirby, he says, only materialised much later [...] "through {{the eyes of a}} seasoned professional." [...] He did however enjoy UK comics, including newspaper strips such as [...] "Syd Jordan's Jeff Hawke [...] David Wright's Carol Day, [...] " [...] and Valiant which featured [...] "Eric Bradbury's Mytek the Mighty and Jesus Blasco's Steel Claw [...] " [...] Despite such a variety of inspirations, Bolland credits his eventual pursuance of art as a hobby and then vocation to a primary school art teacher, who [...] "evidently <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> right things to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 6.5, stating {{that it was}} [...] "Passable" [...] and criticized the fact that while many other episodes take funny jokes at Los Angeles and Fox Broadcasting Company's expense, the ones in this episode fell flat. Canning also <b>said</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> guest spots were too [...] "wooden and unfunny", {{although}} he remarked that he liked the opening acts. Sharon Knolle of TV Squad loved the main plot and C-plot, but said the sub-plot was too unoriginal and that the Tiger Woods joke was the only successful one. She also criticized the ending; [...] "Too bad the episode ended on a lame joke at Jay Leno's expense. Not that he doesn't deserve it, but I'll bet the animated Rupert Murdoch {{was the only one}} laughing.". Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, the worst grade for that night's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] programs. VanDer Werff said that watching [...] "Judge Me Tender" [...] in the same night as the Lost finale and Breaking Bad episode [...] "Fly", both of which he praised as [...] "deeply ambitious" [...] television, [...] "just drove home for me how tired this show is and how little it tries anymore".|$|E
