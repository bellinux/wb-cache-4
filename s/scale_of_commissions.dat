In 1482 Leonardo came to Milan where he stayed with Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis, Evangelista de Predis and their four brothers, who all were artists of different kinds. Both Predis brothers are known for having collaborated with Leonardo da Vinci in the painting of the Virgin of the Rocks for the altarpiece in the chapel of the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception at the Church of San Francesco Grande, Milan.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{heritability}} of activity, attention, and impulsivity by comparing young monozygotic (MZ) twins with dizygotic (DZ) twins using objective measures. Method: The OPTAx test is an infrared motion analysis to record the movement pattern during a continuous performance test. Seventeen MZ and 12 same sexed DZ twin pairs in the range of 6 to 12 years were tested. The zygosity was determined by DNA-fingerprinting. The measures under investiga-tion were activity (microevents and spatial <b>scaling),</b> impulsivity (errors <b>of</b> <b>commission),</b> and attention (accuracy and variabil-ity). For statistical analyses, the classical model of Falconer and the ACE and ADE genetic model for twin data were applied in order to estimate the proportion of the variance in activity, impulsivity and attention that is due to genetic effects. Results: The respective coefficients of intraclass correlations in MZ twins ranged between. 35 and. 65 whereas for DZ twins the correlations were between. 12 and. 88. The heritability estimates resulting from both models were about 30 % for 4 of the 5 measures, but none of these was significantly different from 0. Conclusion: We found no significant influence of genetic factors for activity, attention, and impulsivity. The authors conclude that further investigation of heritability of ADHD is necessary using larger sample sizes and objective measures. (J. of Att. Dis. 2006; 9 (4) 575 - 581...|$|R

Fujiwara no Toyonari, who had opposed and been exiled {{by his brother}} Nakamaro, was brought back from Dazaifu [...] during the revolt on the 14th day of the 9th month (October 13, 764) and reinstated as Minister of Right. She promoted Dōkyō from junior 5th to junior 3rd rank, and in 765 made him prime minister prelate (daijōdaijin zenshi). His authority was further increased on the 20th day of the 10th month, 766, to Buddhist King (Hō-ō) and on the 20th day of the 3rd month, 767 by creation of the [...] "Imperial Office for the Buddhist King" [...] (Hō-ō Kyūshiki).

With Dōkyō's rise in power also came an active propagation of Buddhism.

40|$|Commissioning {{is gaining}} {{increasing}} {{recognition as a}} cost-effective strategy for reducing commercial building energy use. Although the success and cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> projects depends on how well the benefits <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> persist over time, this aspect <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> is not well understood. The persistence <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> benefits was recently studied in a PIER project evaluating ten buildings that were commissioned at building start-up {{at least two years}} ago. The researchers examined the commissioning reports, control algorithms, EMCS point measurements, and energy use data, and conducted operator and commissioning provider interviews to investigate the persistence <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> benefits. In addition, they conducted site visits in a sample of the buildings. A set <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> measures was selected for each building to compare the persistence of benefits. Persistence was measured both qualitatively through a discussion of occupant comfort and decreased maintenance and quantitatively through estimations of energy savings. This paper reports the results of the study. The discussion includes how well the benefits <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> persisted over time, reasons for declining performance, and methods for improving persistence. The results provide valuable insight into how to estimate the persistence <b>of</b> <b>commissioning</b> information central to the cost benefit analyses routinely performed for commissioning measures...|$|R
