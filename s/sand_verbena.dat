[...] Moving sand sheets consist of constantly moving sand, making it hard for vegetation to settle. The fore dunes begin at the high tide line, where only low growing plants with deep root systems (such as <b>sand</b> <b>verbena)</b> can live. The strong winds, salt spray, and massive amounts of sand make this area uninhabitable for other types of plants. [...] Plants in the dunes adapt growth forms to survive high winds.

The back dunes are dominated by shrub species like mock heather, dune lupine, coastal buckwheat, and blochman's senecio. The sandy beaches are a harsh environment with no plants able to survive there. [...] The wetlands include the areas that contain water: salt marshes, fresh and brackish-water marshes, swamps, and mudflats. [...] Plants that live there are adapted to dynamic environmental conditions including high salinity concentration and extreme temperatures.

50|$|The {{presence}} of a <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> on the Yellowstone Plateau is surprising {{because of the high}} elevation (approximately 7,740 feet, or 2,360 meters) and long, cold winters. Yellowstone <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> is a member of a New World plant family that typically lives in warmer climates such as deserts and tropical areas. The genus Abronia includes about 30 species that primarily occur in warmer areas of the western United States and Mexico. Some botanists speculate that the thermal activity in Yellowstone has made it possible for a <b>sand</b> <b>verbena</b> to survive the harsh winters here and slowly evolve into a species that is adapted to this climate.|$|E

50|$|In recent surveys, botanists have located four {{populations of}} Yellowstone <b>sand</b> <b>verbena,</b> but {{very little is}} known about its life history and biology.

50|$|They {{are native}} to western North America, from Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, south to west Texas, California, Baja California and central Mexico, growing on dry sandy soils.

50|$|Over 1,700 {{species of}} trees and other {{vascular}} plants are native to the park. Another 170 species {{are considered to be}} exotic species and are non-native. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September.
