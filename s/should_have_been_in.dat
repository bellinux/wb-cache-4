5|$|In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar {{of first-degree}} murder and sentenced her {{to life in prison}} with the {{possibility}} of parole after 30 years in 2025. Life with the possibility of parole was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas that could be imposed at the time. In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay. Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a museum.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once {{he was in the}} ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E

25|$|In December 1127, Lý Nhân Tông died at Vĩnh Quang Palace and was {{succeeded by}} the Crown Prince Lý Dương Hoán, now Lý Thần Tông. Immediately after the coronation, Thần Tông began to {{regulate}} the royal court and the royal family {{in order to keep}} the stability of the Lý Dynasty in the wake of Nhân Tông's death. This action of Lý Thần Tông was criticized by cpntemporary historians Lê Văn Hưu and Ngô Sĩ Liên who thought that Lý Thần Tông <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> mourning for his predecessor for a longer period to show his respect for the departed emperor.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Abramovich and Boris Berezovsky, an {{associate}} of President Boris Yeltsin, acquired the controlling interest in the large oil company Sibneft. The deal was within the controversial loans-for-shares program and each partner paid US$100million for half of the company, above the stake's stock market value of US$150million at the time, and rapidly turned it up into billions. The fast-rising value of the company led many observers, in hindsight, {{to suggest that the}} real cost of the company <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the billions of dollars. Abramovich later admitted in court that he paid huge bribes (in billions) to government officials and obtained protection from gangsters to acquire these and other assets (including aluminium assets during the aluminium wars).|$|E

25|$|Post-war writing {{by senior}} German {{officers}} like Hermann von Kuhl, Gerhard Tappen, Wilhelm Groener and the Reichsarchiv historians {{led by the}} former Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant-Colonel) Wolfgang Förster managed to establish a commonly accepted narrative that it was Moltke (the Younger)'s failure to follow the blueprint, rather than German strategic miscalculation, that condemned the belligerents to four years of attrition warfare instead of the quick, decisive conflict it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>In</b> 1956, Gerhard Ritter published Der Schlieffenplan: Kritik eines Mythos (The Schlieffen Plan: Critique of a Myth), which began a period of revision, when {{the details of the}} supposed Schlieffen Plan were subjected to scrutiny and contextualisation. The view that the plan had been a blueprint was rejected because this was contrary to the tradition of Prussian war planning established by Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, which treated military operations as inherently unpredictable. Mobilisation and deployment plans could be drawn up but campaign plans were pointless; rather than attempting to dictate to subordinate commanders, the commander gave the intent of the operation and subordinates had discretion in achieving it through Auftragstaktik (mission-type tactics).|$|E

500|$|One notable {{citation}} as {{an influence}} was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "I {{was trying to}} write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [...] When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> that band—or {{at least in a}} Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard." [...] Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 In Utero at the request of Cobain.|$|E

500|$|Outside the Pacific Northwest, {{a number}} of artists and music scenes {{influenced}} grunge. Noise rock bands such as Scratch Acid and the Butthole Surfers influenced Nirvana. Alternative rock bands from the Northeastern United States, including Sonic Youth, Pixies, Pavement, and Dinosaur Jr., are important influences on the genre. Through their patronage of Seattle bands, Sonic Youth [...] "inadvertently nurtured" [...] the grunge scene, and reinforced the fiercely independent attitudes of its musicians. The influence of Pixies on Nirvana was noted by Kurt Cobain, who commented in a Rolling Stone interview, [...] "I connected with that band so heavily that I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard."

500|$|Saldívar {{pleaded not}} guilty, saying the {{shooting}} was accidental. In his opening statement, Valdez {{said he believed}} Saldívar [...] "deliberately killed Selena". Valdez also called it a [...] "senseless and cowardly" [...] act because Selena {{was shot in the}} back. Tinker said the shooting was accidental and denied rumors Saldívar wanted to be romantically involved with Selena. On October 23, 1995, the jury deliberated for two hours before finding Saldívar guilty of murder. She received the maximum sentence of life in prison with no eligibility of parole for 30 years. On November 22, 1995, she arrived at the Gatesville Unit—now the Christina Crain Unit—in Gatesville, Texas, for processing. , Saldívar is serving her sentence in Gatesville at the Mountain View Unit, which is operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. She will be eligible for parole on March 30, 2025. Because of multiple internal death threats from incarcerated Selena fans, Saldívar was placed in isolation and spends twenty-three hours a day alone in her [...] cell. In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay.

500|$|In 1924, Macaulay further {{increased}} his total of wickets to 190 {{and lowered his}} bowling average to 13.23, placing him first in the national averages. His batting declined as he scored 395 runs {{at an average of}} 11.96. Although selected for another Test trial, [...] Macaulay did not play in the series against the touring South African team until the third Test at Leeds, where he took one wicket in each South African innings, but was omitted from the final two Tests. Despite his success in the season, he was not chosen to tour Australia with the MCC that winter, even though Maurice Tate, the leading bowler on the tour, lacked support. Macaulay had been involved in controversy on the field in 1924. At the time, the Yorkshire team were notorious for their aggressive attitude while fielding. In a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield, the hostility of the crowd provoked an MCC inquiry which found that Yorkshire bowler Abe Waddington had incited the spectators. Further incidents followed against Surrey. The editor of Wisden blamed Yorkshire's poor discipline on a small group of approximately four players. Without naming Macaulay as one of them, he noted that Lord Hawke, the Yorkshire president, believed Macaulay <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the team to Australia, and that [...] "it was entirely his own fault he was not chosen". It is also possible that during a match at this time, Macaulay openly criticised the captaincy and bowling of Arthur Gilligan, the England captain.|$|E
500|$|On 3 December, Benfica {{travelled}} to Barreiros to play Marítimo. Under {{pressure from}} the run of poor results, Koeman asked his players to give it all to beat Maritímo. Benfica fended off Marítimo attacks, responding with a goal through Mantorras in the 86th minute and winning {{for the first time}} since 26 October. Four days later, Benfica hosted Manchester United for the last match of the group stage. United's Paul Scholes scored first but ten minutes later, Geovanni equalized 1–1 and in the 34th minute, Beto fired a shot from outside the box to make it 2–1. The result was unchanged and Benfica qualified in second for the knockout stages {{for the first time since}} 1994–95. On 11 December, Benfica played Boavista at home. Anderson scored for Benfica off a corner-kick from Petit; the only goal of the game. Koeman was happy with the win, saying, [...] "We played well, as did the fans, who supported us. Like this, it is very difficult to beat us." [...] On 17 December, Benfica continued their winning run, beating Nacional 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. The goal was controversial because of an alleged infraction of Luisão over Diego Benaglio prior to the goal. Koeman said, [...] "I agree that it should have been signalled, like it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> many other instances". Benfica ended 2005 with an away visit to the Estádio do Bonfim. They struggled to beat Vitória de Setúbal's goalkeeper Marcelo Moretto throughout the game, only securing the win in the 90th minute through Nuno Gomes. The win was Benfica's fifth in December; enough to place them third in the league table just before the Christmas break.|$|E
