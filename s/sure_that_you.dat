He {{also pointed out}} that the German nationality of Gruban might prejudice the jury, and asked them to [...] "be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> permit no prejudice on their hand to disturb the balance of the scales of justice". The jury decided the case in only ten minutes, finding Booth guilty and awarding Gruban £4,750.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are doing what seems right to you, but be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E

He explains, [...] "if you're on the defensive, try to look completely dejected and uninterested, in the hope that your opponent will get careless; but once you start getting your pieces into action and complicating the position, look as confident as possible in an effort to frighten him." [...] Further, when you set a trap, try to look normal, or even to appear nervous if you're <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can do so without arousing your opponent's suspicions.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time the name of Otto Hahn was {{mentioned}} in connection with radium research, and his [...] "New radioactive Element, which evolves Thorium Emanation" [...] (so the original title) was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in the issue of 24 March 1905 (76 A, pages 115-117). It was the first of more than 250 scientific publications of Otto Hahn in the field of radiochemistry. In May 1905, Ramsay wrote to Ernest Rutherford: [...] "Hahn is a capital fellow and has done his work admirably. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would enjoy having him to work with you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other critics laud {{the use of}} plot {{twists and}} {{surprise}} endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observers issue of 5 November 1939 which began, [...] "No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a [...] trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers {{is one of the}} very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure." [...] After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, [...] "Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schuck {{initially}} {{wanted to}} become an aerial reconnaissance pilot, flying the Dornier Do 17. However, due to disciplinary problems following unauthorized aerobatics on a Focke-Wulf Fw 56 [...] "Stösser" [...] and an open conflict with his commanding officer, Oberleutnant Brunner, Schuck ran {{the risk of a}} potential court-martial. To avoid further escalations Schuck was transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) at Werneuchen. He arrived at Werneuchen on 16 June 1940 where he was assigned to the 3. Staffel (3rd squadron). The entire Gruppe was under the command of Oberleutnant Klaus Quaet-Faslem. Schuck's fighter pilot instructor was Oberfeldwebel Hobe, who was aware of Schuck's disciplinary history. Hobe commented [...] "Schuck, we don't want problems here. We now go on a test flight and I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will be leaving afterwards". Fearful that this might have end his flying career, Schuck followed Hobe's every maneuver, which impressed Quaet-Faslem who had witnessed their test flight. Schuck's flying career was saved. At Werneuchen the pilots were first trained on the Messerschmitt Bf 109 B-2, later the Bf 109 E-1, which had a more powerful engine. Schuck scored more than 90% hits during target practice, the highest score then achieved at Werneuchen. After his graduation from the fighter pilot school, he was transferred to a supplementary fighter group on 2 September 1940.|$|E
