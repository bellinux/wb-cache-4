5|$|Having seen Saigon <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> {{his hands}} on many {{occasions}} in the previous decade, Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his hold on the key southern city, turning it into his capital, and the base for his preparations for his planned conquest of the Tây Sơn and Vietnam. His enemies had regularly raided the area and confiscated the rice harvest.|$|E
5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E
5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County started to come back into the game; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall was {{a son of}} Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll (died 1164) and his wife, Ragnhildr, {{daughter}} of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. Somairle and Ragnhildr had at least three sons: Dubgall (died after 1175), Ragnall, Áengus (died 1210), and probably also a fourth, Amlaíb. Dubgall {{appears to have been}} the couple's eldest son. Little is certain of the origins of Ragnall's father, although his marriage suggests that he belonged to a family of some substance. In {{the first half of the}} twelfth century, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man (Mann) were encompassed within the Kingdom of the Isles, which was ruled by Somairle's father-in-law, a member of the Crovan dynasty. Somairle's rise to power may well have begun at about this time, as the few surviving sources from the era suggest that Argyll may have begun to <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> the control of David I, King of Scots (died 1153).|$|E

5|$|The {{final day}} started poorly for England, with Compton edging Johnston to a diving Miller at second <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> the second {{ball of the}} day. England had lost a wicket without adding to their {{overnight}} total. Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former. He then trapped Coxon lbw two balls later in the same over. Eight runs later, Dollery shaped to duck a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Toshack ended the innings with 5/40, while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively. The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were £43,000 — a record for a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|York {{were beaten}} {{for the first}} time in seven matches after losing 1–0 away to {{promotion}} contenders Shrewsbury, with Mark Ellis scoring their goal in the first half. York's final home match of the season ended in a 2–0 defeat to play-off chasing Newport, who scored twice in the second half with goals scored by David Tutonda and Lee Minshull, and Hyde had a penalty saved in between the goals. They finished the season after drawing 1–1 away to Portsmouth; Halliday equalised in the 85th minute after capitalising on a <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> Dan Butler, three minutes after Matt Tubbs had given the home team the lead. York's final league position in League Two was 18th, their lowest placing since promotion into that division three years ago. At an awards night held at York Racecourse, Lowe was voted by the club's supporters as the Clubman of the Year for 2014–15.|$|E
5|$|Milan won the toss and Liverpool kicked off. Playing in a 4–2–3–1 formation, {{they had}} the first attack of the match, but Jermaine Pennant could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross-field pass. Milan responded with two low {{attempts}} on the Liverpool goal, but Jamie Carragher was able to clear them both. The second clearance led to a corner, from which Milan failed to score. Liverpool had the first chance of the match in the ninth minute. A <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> Milan defender Marek Jankulovski allowed Pennant to run into space, he passed the ball to Dirk Kuyt who passed it back to him, Pennant's subsequent shot was saved by Milan goalkeeper Dida. Minutes later Gerrard won a header which found Pennant, however Gerrard was unable to make decent contact with the ball following Pennant's pass. Milan had their first shot of the match a few minutes later. Kaká received the ball outside the area and moved to his right before shooting, however Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina saved the shot. Liverpool continued to exert pressure leading Milan defender Massimo Oddo to mis-read a cross from Pennant, the ball reached Gerrard whose shot went over the goal.|$|E

5|$|On 17 January 2011, Bent {{submitted}} a transfer request, amid reports that Aston Villa {{had made a}} club record £18million bid for him, which was rejected. Villa then {{submitted a}}n improved offer of £18million, potentially rising to £24million, which was then accepted. The following day, Bent completed his move to Villa and signed a four-and-a-half-year deal. He scored the winning goal on his debut against Manchester City in a 1–0 victory at Villa Park. Bent scored his second Villa goal in his third appearance for his team when he completed the full 90 minutes against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 3–1 away defeat. Bent scored both of Villa's goals in their 2–1 away victory over Arsenal in the penultimate match of the season on 15 May. The first was a nicely crafted volley after he chested down a Kyle Walker chipped pass, with the second coming {{a few minutes later}} after a <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen allowed Ashley Young the time to thread a pass through the Gunners' defence and Bent to sidefoot home for 2–0. He finished the season with 9 goals in 16 Premier League appearances for Villa, becoming the club's joint top-scorer with Ashley Young, despite only joining in January. He was also the top English goalscorer in the Premier League and the fourth highest scorer overall that season with 17 goals, eight of which were scored for Sunderland.|$|E

25|$|Another {{method for}} {{piercing}} ears, first made {{popular in the}} 1960s, {{was the use of}} sharpened spring-loaded earrings known as self-piercers, trainers, or sleepers, which gradually pushed through the earlobe. However, these could <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> their initial placement position, often resulting in more discomfort, and many times would not go {{all the way through the}} earlobe without additional pressure being applied. This method has fallen into disuse due to the popularity of faster and more successful piercing techniques.|$|E

25|$|The game {{started with}} both teams exchanging chances. Argentina began to dominate, however, with England's goalkeeper Peter Shilton saving {{a number of}} good chances, many created by Maradona. Peter Beardsley had England's best chance after 13 minutes, {{following}} a <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> Nery Pumpido in Argentina's goal, but failed to take it. At half time, the score was 00, Argentina having had much more of the possession and territory – and done {{a great deal more}} of the running – but having failed to get through England's resolute defence.|$|E
25|$|Simpson {{was unable}} to pass 20 {{in the next two}} Tests, which were shared. In the Second Test at Lord's in the absence of Benaud, Simpson took 1/32 from 19 overs in the second innings, removed Ray Illingworth caught at leg <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> a googly {{immediately}} after stand-in captain Harvey moved himself to the position. In between these Tests, he struck a 103 against Lancashire. In the Third Test at Headingley, Simpson made two and three and went wicketless as England levelled the series with an eight-wicket win.|$|E
25|$|Following {{this was}} the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley Stadium. Tottenham entered the game as favourites against a {{recently}} relegated Portsmouth side. The game remained 0–0 for the 90 minutes and so entered extra time. Early {{in the first half}} of the extra 30, a Michael Dawson <b>slip</b> <b>from</b> a Portsmouth free-kick allowed Frédéric Piquionne to finish from a few yards out to give Portsmouth the initiative. Peter Crouch had a goal wrongly ruled out in the second half of extra time before ex-Tottenham player Kevin-Prince Boateng sealed the final place for Portsmouth with a last minute penalty.|$|E
