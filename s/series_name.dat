25|$|Major format {{changes were}} made for 1999, with the {{incorporation}} of the endurance races into the championship. Control tyres {{were used for the}} first time, with Bridgestone selected as the supplier. The series was also renamed from the 'Australian Touring Car Championship' to the 'Shell Championship Series', by virtue of Shell's sponsorship of the category. Reverse-grid races were introduced for multiple rounds in 2000 before being confined to just the Canberra round for 2001. Also in 2001, compulsory pit stops were introduced at certain rounds and the Top Ten Shootout was used at all rounds. The control tyre supplier changed from Bridgestone to Dunlop in 2002 and the <b>series</b> <b>name</b> was changed to the 'V8 Supercar Championship Series' after Shell discontinued their sponsorship.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, AVESCO {{changed its}} name to V8 Supercars Australia (VESA). The series {{continued}} to expand during this time, with races held outside of Australasia for the first time. The series travelled to the Shanghai International Circuit in China in 2005, originally on a five-year agreement, however the promoter of the race dropped their support and the series did not return thereafter. 2006 saw the series travel to the Middle East, with an event held at the Bahrain International Circuit in Bahrain. Multiple new street circuits appeared on the calendar in 2008 and 2009, with new events held in Hamilton in New Zealand, Townsville in North Queensland and at Sydney Olympic Park. The series' Middle East expansion continued in 2010 with a second round held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. In November 2010, the series was granted international status by the FIA for the 2011 season, allowing the series to race at up to six international venues each year. As a result, the <b>series</b> <b>name</b> was changed to the 'International V8 Supercars Championship'.|$|E
500|$|The {{prints were}} mass-marketed {{and by the}} mid-19th century total {{circulation}} of a print could run into the thousands. [...] Retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople. [...] In some cases the prints advertised kimono designs by the print artist. [...] From {{the second half of}} the 17th century, prints were frequently marketed as part of a series, each print stamped with the <b>series</b> <b>name</b> and the print's number in that series. [...] This proved a successful marketing technique, as collectors bought each new print in the series to keep their collections complete. [...] By the 19th century, series such as Hiroshige's Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō ran to dozens of prints.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} a {{reputation}} for high levels of bloody violence, including, most notably, its Fatalities (finishing moves, requiring a sequence of button inputs to perform). The Fatalities, in part, {{led to the creation of}} the ESRB video game rating system. The <b>series</b> <b>name</b> itself is also known for using the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for the hard C sound, thus intentionally misspelling the word [...] "combat", as well as other words with the hard C sound within later games in the series. Early games in the series were also noted for its realistic digitized sprites (which differentiated it from its contemporaries' hand-drawn sprites) and an extensive use of palette swapping to create new characters.|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, Night Dive Studios, after {{acquiring}} {{the rights to}} the System Shock franchise, stated they are considering developing a third title in the series. In December 2015, OtherSide Entertainment, a studio founded by former Looking Glass Studios designer Paul Neurath, announced they were developing System Shock 3 with rights granted to them by Night Dive Studios. OtherSide had acquired rights to make sequels to System Shock some years before this point but did not have {{the rights to the}} <b>series</b> <b>name,</b> which Night Dive was able to provide. The sequel will feature Terri Brosius reprising her voice for SHODAN, and will include work from original System Shock concept artist Robb Waters. Warren Spector, the producer of the first System Shock, announced in February 2016 that he has joined OtherSide Entertainment and will be working on System Shock 3. According to Spector, the narrative will pick up immediately from the end of System Shock 2, with SHODAN having taken over Rebecca's body. Starbreeze Studios is providing a $12 million [...] "publishing-only" [...] investment in System Shock 3, allowing Otherside to retain all rights while seeking a 120% return on investment followed by equal shares of revenue splitting. Starbreeze's investment will allow the game to be developed for consoles in addition to the planned personal computer versions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1965 the Eldorado, Sixty Special and Series 75 {{models were}} {{designated}} as Fleetwood “subseries” {{but this would}} only last through the 1972 model year and during this period {{there never was a}} separate Fleetwood series per se. [...] Fleetwood became a much more integral part of a Cadillac <b>series</b> <b>name</b> in 1977 with the introduction of the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham and the Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine, which replaced the Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham and the Fleetwood 75 respectively. [...] In 1985, Fleetwood finally became a separate series in its own right.|$|E
2500|$|Eiji Yoshida {{recorded}} {{the title of}} another print in the Fujo Ninsō Juppin series, Kasō no Bijin no Hanshin Zu ( [...] , [...] "Half-length picture of lower-class beauty"), in the last volume of Ukiyo-e Jiten, but no details of its composition are known. [...] Yoshida also noted that a catalogue from 1915 for the [...] trading company lists a Chawan o Noseta Chataku o Motsu Onna ( [...] , [...] "Woman holding a saucer with a teacup on it") from the Fujin Sōgaku Jittai series. [...] As these prints cannot be confirmed, there remains {{the possibility that the}} series remained unfinished after the publication of the eight known prints. [...] Yoshida suggests there may really have been two series: Fujo Ninsō Juppin was left incomplete after five prints, and Fujin Sōgaku Jittai followed but was also left complete. [...] Yoshida bases this assumption on the fact that, even if the <b>series</b> <b>name</b> ahd changed, {{there was no reason for}} Utamaro to change his signature from [...] in the one to [...] in the other (both read [...] and have the same meaning).|$|E

2500|$|Another {{modification}} to the Buk missile {{system was}} started in 1992 with work carried out between 1994 and 1997 to produce the 9K37M1-2 Buk-M1-2, which entered service in 1998. This modification introduced a new missile, the 9M317, which offered greater kinematic performance over the previous 9M38, which could still {{be used by the}} Buk-M1-2. Such sharing of the missile type caused a transition to a different GRAU designation, 9K317, which has been used independently for all later systems. The previous 9K37 <b>series</b> <b>name</b> was also preserved for the complex, as was the [...] "Buk" [...] name. The new missile, as well as a variety of other modifications, allowed the system to shoot down ballistic missiles and surface targets, as well as enlarging the [...] "performance and engagement envelope" [...] (zone of danger for potential attack) for more traditional targets like aircraft and helicopters. The 9K37M1-2 Buk-M1-2 also received a new NATO reporting name distinguishing it from previous generations of the Buk system; this new reporting name was the SA-17 Grizzly. The export version of the 9K37M1-2 system is called [...] "Ural" [...] (...) , this name has also been applied to M2, at least to early, towed, export versions.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Raven-Symoné {{was given}} the voice role of Monique on Kim Possible as the best friend of Kim Possible. She had a {{recurring}} role, as she was featured in all seasons of the show, and participated in the two films for the series, [...] (2003) and [...] (2005). In 2001, Symoné auditioned for a role on an upcoming series for the Disney Channel titled Absolutely Psychic, about a teenager with psychic abilities. She actually auditioned for the recurring role of Chelsea Daniels, but her role was changed to the lead character Raven Baxter and the <b>series</b> <b>name</b> changed to That's So Raven. The series debuted on January 17, 2003 and ended on November 10, 2007, becoming responsible for many firsts for Disney Channel including becoming the channel's highest-rated and longest-running series at 100 episodes (until it was surpassed by Wizards of Waverly Place in October 2011). The title character draws on her talent, ingenuity, psychic powers {{and a variety of}} disguises {{to get in and out}} of amusing adolescent and pre-adolescent situations. It spawned a franchise including soundtracks, dolls, episode DVDs, and video games. That's So Raven was nominated for Outstanding Children's Program during the 2005 and 2007 Emmy Awards.
