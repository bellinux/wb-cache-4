5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative {{opposition to abortion}} to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform. As a proponent of both Chicago school and <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> he is notable as an influence upon the Reagan agenda and {{the architect of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which is known as the Kemp–Roth tax cut.|$|E
5|$|Ryan has an {{interest}} in political economics and has been a thought leader in Congress on issues of budget reform. He helped bring the issues of the national debt and the national deficit into the national policy debate. Ryan subscribes to <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics.</b> His positions on fiscal policy have included tax cuts, cuts to entitlement programs, freezes on discretionary spending, the elimination of automatic inflation increases in calculating budget baselines, deregulation, and the privatization of social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education.|$|E
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E

40|$|The present article explores cinema {{economics}} in Austria from a <b>supply-side</b> media <b>economics</b> perspective. The main {{objective is to}} provide theoretical and empirical analysis for current changes in the economics of film distribution and exhibition in Austria. Theoretical challenge is to discuss the paradigms of market failure and imperfect competition for the cinema distribution and exhibition industry. Further, empirical evidence of market failure and imperfect competition will be assessed against theoretical assumptions and discussed with regard to effects on competition in the Austrian market. We argue that economic forces of market failure and imperfect competition cause economic inefficiencies. These forces also cause welfare losses in terms of reduced image diversity and plurality of outlets, and, consequently, {{a reduction in the}} diversity of views. which will endanger diversity and a pluralistic cultural supply. The six key words that reflect the project main ideas are: 1) Cinema economics 2) Market failure...|$|R

25|$|During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's {{editorial}} page was particularly influential {{as the leading}} voice for <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics.</b> Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and {{the capital gains tax}} could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.|$|E
25|$|In his 1980 {{campaign}} speeches, Reagan {{presented his}} economic proposals as {{a return to}} the free enterprise principles, free market economy that had been in favor before the Great Depression and FDR's New Deal policies. At the same time, he attracted a following from the <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> movement, which had formed in opposition to Keynesian demand-stimulus economics. This movement produced some of the strongest supporters for Reagan's policies during his term in office.|$|E

At the IEM, he helped organize debates about politics and economics, introduced Romanian students to the core notions of <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> and made hints about the need for profound change. Reportedly, Murgescu's 1982 work on the Japanese economic miracle was a Romanian best-seller. Allegedly, Murgescu had come to believe that the Valev Plan was a consistent form of economic integration, and that national communism was essentially flawed.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, John Maynard Keynes {{prompted}} a division between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Under Keynesian economics macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote aggregate demand for goods {{as a means}} to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, Milton Friedman created the concept of monetarism. Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> which advocates reducing taxes {{as a means to}} increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.|$|E
25|$|Brooks {{also wrote}} scores of {{articles}} and profiles for The New Yorker, many profiling well-known business figures, and written {{in an informal}} and erudite style that turned the accounts of bankers and traders into the stuff of drama. Brooks's best-known New Yorker two-part Annals of Business article was about Henry Ford II and the ill-fated introduction {{of the most famous}} failed automotive gambit in history, the Edsel. Brooks also wrote widely on other subjects as well, including the government-guaranteed loans to Chrysler Corporation, the public television show Wall Street Week and its creator Louis Rukeyser, an examination of <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> the banking behemoth Citibank, economist Arthur Laffer and his Laffer curve, the development of New Jersey's Meadowlands, New York City urban planner Robert Moses, and even the Southern grocery store chain Piggly Wiggly.|$|E
25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} {{began to come}} apart {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics.</b> The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the debates}} {{surrounding}} the United States federal budget center around competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of {{both private and public}} enterprise, a welfare state, and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either laissez-faire or <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country. These debates also deal with questions of morality, income equality, and intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance {{the quality of life for}} future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden.|$|E
25|$|During the recessions of the 1970s, {{inflation}} and unemployment rates soared simultaneously and budget deficits began to raise concerns among many Americans. In the early 1970s, America {{was still a}} moderately progressive country, as citizens supported social programs and voted down efforts to cut taxes. But {{by the end of}} the decade, a full-fledged tax revolt had gotten underway, led by the overwhelming passage in 1978 of Proposition 13 in California, which sharply cut property taxes, and the growing Congressional support for the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which proposed cutting federal income taxes by 30 percent. <b>Supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> developed during the 1970s in response to Keynesian economic policy, and in particular the failure of demand management to stabilize Western economies during the stagflation of the 1970s, in the wake of the oil crisis in 1973. It drew on a range of non-Keynesian economic thought, particularly the Chicago School and Neo-Classical School.|$|E
25|$|A {{second group}} put their main {{emphasis}} {{on tax cuts}} rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues. These additional government revenues, would {{in the long term}} reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit. Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011 and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics.</b> But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E
500|$|Kemp had {{his first}} {{encounter}} with <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> in 1976, when The Wall Street Journals Jude Wanniski interviewed him at his Congressional office. [...] Kemp questioned Wanniski all day (until midnight, at Kemp's Bethesda, Maryland home) and was eventually converted to University of Southern California professor Arthur Laffer's supply-side discipline. Thereafter, Kemp espoused <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> freely, and in 1978 he and Sen. Bill Roth of Delaware proposed tax-cutting legislation. Kemp has been credited as responsible for supply-side economics' inclusion in President Reagan's economic plan, although {{at the time of}} Robert Mundell's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to Mundell, Laffer, Robert Bartley, and Wanniski. In 1979, Kemp wrote An American Renaissance (...) , to deliver his message that [...] "A rising tide lifts all boats." [...] Although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to Reagan, they were initiated by Kemp and Roth through their 1981 Kemp–Roth Tax Cut legislation. Reagan's budget based on this legislation passed over the objection of United States House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski.|$|E
500|$|His legacy {{includes}} the Kemp–Roth Tax Cut of the 1980s, {{also known as}} the first of two [...] "Reagan tax cuts." [...] These served as the foundation of <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> known as Reaganomics. [...] Many Republicans have endorsed this Laffer Curve view that tax cuts spur economic growth and reduce deficits. Although George H. W. Bush called this philosophy voodoo economics, George W. Bush and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snow, were believers. Kemp is also remembered alongside George Wallace and William Jennings Bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{implemented}} policies {{based on}} <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> advocating a laissez-faire philosophy and free-market fiscal policy, seeking {{to stimulate the}} economy with large, across-the-board tax cuts. He also supported returning the United States to some sort of gold standard, and successfully urged Congress to establish the U.S. Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented. Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve. Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of [...] "peace through strength" [...] resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.|$|E
500|$|Kemp championed several Chicago {{school and}} <b>supply-side</b> <b>{{economic}}s</b> issues: economic growth, free markets, free trade, tax simplification and lower tax rates on both employment and investment income. He was a long-time {{proponent of the}} flat tax. He also defended the use of anti-Communist contra forces in Central America, supported the gold standard, spoke for civil rights legislation, opposed abortion, {{and was the first}} lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones, which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants. During his career, he sometimes sounded like a liberal Democrat: he supported affirmative action and rights for illegal immigrants. [...] The New York Times described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since Robert Kennedy. He differed from Rockefeller Republicans and earlier combatants such as Lyndon Johnson by supporting incentive-based systems instead of traditional social programs. For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party, David Gergen heralded him as a [...] "courageous voice in the wilderness." [...] Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals, he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools. Kemp at times felt his role was that of [...] "freewheeling, entrepreneurial, wildcatting backbencher." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> is {{a school}} of {{macroeconomic}} thought that argues that overall economic well-being is maximized by lowering the barriers to producing goods and services (the [...] "Supply Side" [...] of the economy). By lowering such barriers, consumers are thought to benefit from a greater supply {{of goods and services}} at lower prices. Typical supply-side policy would advocate generally lower income tax and capital gains tax rates (to increase the supply of labor and capital), smaller government and a lower regulatory burden on enterprises (to lower costs). Although tax policy is often mentioned in relation to <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> supply-side economists are concerned with all impediments to the supply of goods and services and not just taxation.|$|E
2500|$|Reaganomics ( [...] ; a {{portmanteau}} of [...] Reagan and economics, {{attributed to}} Paul Harvey) {{refers to the}} economic policies promoted by U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s. These policies are commonly associated with <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> referred to as trickle-down economics or voodoo economics by political opponents, and free-market economics by political advocates.|$|E
2500|$|Keynes's {{interpretation}} is rejected by many economists as a misinterpretation or caricature of Say's law — see [...] — and the advocacy {{of the phrase}} [...] "supply creates its own demand" [...] is today most associated with <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> which retorts that [...] "Keynes turned Say {{on his head and}} instead stated that 'demand creates its own supply'".|$|E
2500|$|The Laffer {{curve and}} <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> {{inspired}} Reaganomics and the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut of 1981. Supply-side advocates {{of tax cuts}} claimed that lower tax rates would generate more tax revenue because the United States government's marginal income tax rates prior to the legislation were {{on the right-hand side}} of the curve. This assertion was derided by George H. W. Bush as [...] "voodoo economics" [...] while running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980. During the Reagan presidency, the top marginal rate of tax in the United States fell from 70% to 31%.|$|E
2500|$|Her early {{tax policy}} reforms {{were based on}} the {{monetarist}} theories of Friedman rather than the <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> of Arthur Laffer and Jude Wanniski, which the government of Ronald Reagan espoused. There was a severe recession in the early 1980s, and the Government's economic policy was widely blamed. In January 1982, the inflation rate dropped to single figures and interest rate fell. Unemployment peaked at 3.1 million. [...] The recession of the early 1980s was the deepest in Britain since the depression of the 1930s and Thatcher's popularity plummeted; most predictions had her losing the next election.|$|E
2500|$|David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget {{director}} {{during his first}} administration {{and one of the}} early proponents of <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics,</b> was concerned that the administration did not pay enough attention to cutting government spending. He maintained that the Laffer curve was not to be taken literally—at least not in the economic environment of the 1980s United States. In The Triumph of Politics, he writes: [...] "he whole California gang had taken [...] literally (and primitively). The way they talked, they seemed to expect that once the supply-side tax cut was in effect, additional revenue would start to fall, manna-like, from the heavens. Since January, I had been explaining that there is no literal Laffer curve." [...] Stockman also said that [...] "Laffer wasn't wrong, he just didn't go far enough" [...] (in paying attention to government spending).|$|E
2500|$|As Brown campaigned {{in various}} primary states, he would {{eventually}} expand his platform beyond {{a policy of}} strict campaign finance reform. Although he focused {{on a variety of}} issues throughout the campaign, he highlighted his endorsement of living wage laws and opposition to free trade agreements such as NAFTA; he mostly concentrated on his tax policy, which had been created specifically for him by Arthur Laffer, the famous supporter of <b>supply-side</b> <b>economics</b> who created the Laffer curve. This plan, which called for the replacement of the progressive income tax with a flat tax and a value added tax, both at a fixed 13 percent rate, was decried by his opponents as regressive. Nevertheless, it was endorsed by The New York Times, The New Republic, and Forbes, and its raising of taxes on corporations and elimination of various loopholes which tended to favor the very wealthy, proved to be popular with voters. This was, perhaps, not surprising, as various opinion polls taken at the time found that as many as three-quarters of all Americans believed the current tax code to be unfairly biased toward the wealthy. He [...] "seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field ... for term limits, a flat tax, and the abolition of the Department of Education". Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado and seemed poised to overtake Clinton.|$|E
