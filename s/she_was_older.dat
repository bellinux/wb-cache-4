5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older.</b> She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{objections}} from his NEF colleagues, Renoir hired Gregor {{for the role}} of Christine. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than the original character and he made changes to the character based on Gregor's personality and on their dinner conversations, such as making Christine the daughter of an Austrian conductor. Many of Renoir's friends believed {{he fell in love with}} Gregor shortly after casting her. Zwoboda said Gregor had [...] "that which Renoir loved above all; an incontestable class, a style, the gestures and bearing of a great distinction." [...] Renoir said he cast Gregor because of her Austrian accent, which he believed would create [...] "a little barrier... between her and her surroundings" [...] and because of her appearance, which he considered [...] "birdlike" [...] and [...] "sincere." ...|$|E
5000|$|What {{some people}} think of as old other people may not. An actress in Hollywood may not {{consider}} herself <b>old</b> but can <b>be</b> told <b>she</b> <b>is</b> too <b>old</b> for a part. A very well known {{example of this is}} what happened to the actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, [...] "she was recently turned down for a role in a movie because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too <b>old</b> to play the love interest for a 55-year-old man." [...] When a woman <b>is</b> told <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>old</b> <b>she</b> can start to believe that <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> A woman can start acting as if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>older</b> than <b>she</b> believes because she internalizes what other people are saying and what they think about her.|$|R

500|$|James Sullivan {{was born}} on April 22, 1744, the fourth son of John Sullivan and Margery Brown Sullivan, in Berwick, {{in a part of}} the Province of Massachusetts Bay that is now the state of Maine. [...] Sullivan's father was from County Limerick, and his mother was a child aboard the ship on which they came over. [...] When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> he wooed and wed her. [...] The elder Sullivan was a schoolteacher and farmer in Berwick. [...] Sullivan was educated at home, and any {{prospects}} for military service were dashed when his foot was crushed in a childhood accident. [...] He was also afflicted with epilepsy while relatively young, and suffered generally mild seizures (but sometimes lasting several hours) for the rest of his life. [...] While convalescing from his foot injury he read a great deal, learning Latin and the classics. [...] His elder brother John, who was studying law, was instructed to supply his brother with law books and training. [...] Sullivan studied law in his brother's law practice in Durham, New Hampshire, and was eventually admitted to the bar in Massachusetts. [...] He established a practice first in Georgetown, then shortly afterward in Biddeford, where he was the town's first resident lawyer. [...] In 1768 he married Hetty Odiorne, the daughter of a successful Portsmouth, New Hampshire merchant.|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older.</b> In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

2500|$|... was a {{voracious}} reader, {{and became}} [...] "deeply immersed and seriously committed to Mexican culture, political activism {{and issues of}} social justice". The school promoted indigenismo, {{a new sense of}} Mexican identity that took pride in the country's indigenous heritage and sought to rid itself of the colonial mindset of Europe as superior to Mexico. Particularly influential to Kahlo at this time were nine of her schoolmates, with whom she formed an informal group called the [...] "Cachucas" [...] — [...] many of them would become leading figures of the Mexican intellectual elite. They were rebellious and against everything conservative, and pulled pranks, staged plays, and debated philosophy and Russian classics. To mask the fact that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> and to declare herself a [...] "daughter of the revolution", she began saying that she had been born on July 7, 1910, the year the Mexican Revolution began, which she would continue throughout her life.|$|E
2500|$|Nicholas Mikhailovich {{never came}} close to {{marriage}} again. Instead he channeled his energy into scholarly pursuits and the management of his several grand residences and estates, which gave employment and lodging to thousands. He was highly conscientious of his responsibility {{for the welfare of}} those who relied upon him for their livelihood. In his mature years little of his attention seems to have been directed toward women save that he mentions in a letter of 1910 that he had fallen in love again, as if by some miracle, [...] "imagine that, in love at fifty one". But this one and only mention of anything of the kind in all of his correspondence suggests this flight of fancy did not go far, and that his feelings were unrequited. One of his greatest female friends was Princess Elena (Nelly) Mikhailovna Baryatinskaya. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than he was and was typical of the highly dignified and platonic relationships that were the norm among most of the Imperial family.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though many}} {{young women in}} the 1920s saw flappers as the symbol of a {{brighter}} future, some also questioned the flappers' more extreme behavior. Therefore, in 1923, the magazine began asking for true stories from its readers for a new column called [...] "Confessions of a Flapper". Some of these were lighthearted stories of girls getting the better of those who underestimated them, but others described girls betraying their own standards of behavior {{in order to live}} up to the image of flappers. There were several examples, a newlywed confessed to having cheated on her husband, a college student described being told by a boyfriend that she was not [...] "the marrying kind" [...] because of the sexual liberties she had permitted him, and a minister's daughter recounted the humiliation of being caught in the lie of pretending <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> and more sophisticated than she was. Many readers thought that flappers had gone too far in their quest for adventure. One 23-year-old [...] "ex-vamp" [...] declared: [...] "In my opinion, the average flappers from 15 to 19 were brainless, inconsiderate of others, and easy to get into serious trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|Future Spice Girl Emma Bunton {{auditioned for}} the role of Bianca, however, it was actress Patsy Palmer who was {{eventually}} cast. Hester Lacey of The Independent has described Palmer's casting as an [...] "accident", as she did not formally audition {{for the role}}. EastEnders casting director Jane Deitch and writer–director McHale visited her drama class at the Anna Scher Theatre looking for a girl aged 16 or under. Palmer was not on the list of people they wanted to see as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older,</b> but she caught the attention of Deitch when she was messing around and giggling with friends. At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line [...] "I can't believe you just said that." [...] The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition. When she arrived at the audition, McHale told producers Palmer was 16 as she would have been refused the part. She was offered a three-month contract the same day. In 1996, Palmer commented to Lacey: [...] "I've been a lucky girl. I always used to say I'd love to get in EastEnders, because I used to think 'God, I'll never get a part where I have to speak really posh', – I'm not very good at accents." [...] Palmer was 21 when she first appeared on-screen as 16-year-old Bianca.|$|E
2500|$|Ethan Brown from New York {{magazine}} {{stated that}} the song [...] "elicits memories of past pop odes to dance culture", adding that the song's production is a [...] "giddy mix of electro-bounce, campy vocoder chants, and funky keyboard squeals." [...] In her favorable review of the song, Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters {{stated that the}} track [...] "reasserts the freewheeling, fun spirit that made Madonna so damn appealing when she debuted nearly twenty years ago," [...] adding that the song {{is an example of}} that [...] "indefinable thing that is what we love about Madonna." [...] Billboard acclaimed the song, stating [...] "the first listen's gonna blast you like a brick wall, as ears and minds try {{to make sense of the}} bombast of sonic missiles blasting from your speakers-but successive plays will make clear just how inventive this upstanding composition is." [...] It adds that [...] "it's guaranteed you've never heard Madonna-nor any other popular artist-pull it together this way." [...] While placing the song as the 66th best song of the 2000s decade, Slant Magazine commented that [...] "despite all the new pop starlets out there trying to jump her train, Madonna definitely [...] not slackening pace. When she dropped [...] "Music". <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than Britney and Christina combined, yet she took them to school with vintage electro-boom, Eurodisco flourishes from French producer Mirwais, and her own inimitable sass." [...] Apart from winning various other awards, [...] "Music" [...] earned two Grammy Award nominations in 2001, for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E

2500|$|During late May 1986 (around {{three weeks}} after Lords' 18th birthday), {{authorities}} discovered she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, {{and the general public}} for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested. (See United States v. X-Citement Video) She was taken into protective custody and hired [...] high-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson. On July 10, district attorney's investigators searched Lords' Redondo Beach home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the Sherman Oaks offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver's license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, spokeswoman for Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken (she was actually fifteen years of age in the photographs). When investigators used Lords' fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to [...] locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine Velvet during July 1984, and telephoned the district attorney's office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, [...] "There isn't anything we can do about it." ...|$|E
