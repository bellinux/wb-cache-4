5|$|According to Meek, Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore {{political}} boundaries.... The faint {{outline of}} the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January, Streep {{received}} her 14th Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, lengthening her record from 13 for most nominations by any actor male or female. Field received a Costume Design nomination as well. Neither won, but Blunt and Hathaway presented the last mentioned award, amusing the audience by <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> their characters for a few lines, nervously asking which of them had gotten Streep her cappuccino. Streep played along with a stern expression before smiling.|$|E
5|$|With {{the many}} uncharted shoals and reefs, and {{frequent}} storms, the South China Seas remain {{some of the}} most dangerous waters in the world. Despite the continual use of a sounding lead, on 18 February 1817, Alceste grounded on one of the many hidden reefs in the Java Sea. Maxwell ordered the anchor dropped to prevent the ship from <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> deeper water, an undesirable situation if the hull had been breached, {{which turned out to be}} the case. The pumps were unable to cope with the influx of water and the ship's carpenter, Cheffy, reported that Alceste was beyond repair.|$|E

5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E
5|$|Adam {{is convicted}} {{for the murder}} of his ex-wife, Skye Newman (Laura Stone). Sharon tries to help him, but is arrested for murder after finding Skye in Hawaii (where Skye fell into a volcano). After {{escaping}} and returning (after several months of being thought dead), Sharon is acquitted. She then dedicates herself to Victor, who is in jail protecting Nikki from a murder charge. Victor marries Sharon platonically to protect his assets, although the marriage is annulled two weeks later. Adam is believed to be permanently blind after an attack by Patty Williams, and Sharon helps him recover. They reunite, but more of his past schemes are revealed. After another nervous breakdown and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (which made her remarry Victor and take over Newman Enterprises), Sharon is re-hired at Newman as vice president for research and development. Adam is shot saving Victor's life; before <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> a coma he asks Sharon, his closest friend, to run Newman Enterprises. Sharon again becomes CEO of the company, angering the Newman's. She leaves the company upon Victor's return to run the company with Adam. Victor forces Adam, who is engaging in a sexual relationship with Sharon, to stop seeing her.|$|E

25|$|The 2016/17 {{season was}} one that started amid much uncertainty, with the club {{struggling}} financially whilst looking for new ownership and economic security.

The treasurer attempted to blame central-bank independence for the state's poor performance, but the issue fell from view after the state economy registered weak growth in the final quarter of 2006 - enough to avert a technical recession.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of the Little Bighorn in late June 1876, the {{government}} took punitive actions including disbanding U.S. Army Indian Scouts, clamping {{down on the}} agency bands and taking a census creating considerable unrest. On August 31, 1876, Blue Horse was arrested {{for a short time}} by General Ranald S. Mackenzie for not turning in northern “hostile” Indians <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> his Loafer village.

Atlas V's launch with the Intelsat 14 was scrubbed on the 14th due to a technical issue requiring a rollback. The scrub, lasting more than 24 hours, meant that Atlantis also avoided a possible postponement of its launch <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> November 17, 2009.|$|E

Though this has had no direct impact upon his position as Prime Minister, there were rumours that the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD) party that won the elections, would participate in federal government. Verhofstadt was suggested as a candidate to replace Romano Prodi as the next President of the European Commission, but his candidacy was opposed and rejected by a coalition led by Tony Blair and other leaders who had disagreed with Verhofstadt's uncompromising criticisms of the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq the previous year.|$|E

(His affection for that country and its people, despite his wartime experiences, had first been explored in 1968 in his Portrait of Japan.) By now Ingaret was <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> senility, and he spent much time with Frances Baruch, an old friend. In 1984 his son John (who had gone on to be an engineer in London) died, and van der Post spent time with his youngest daughter Lucia and her family.|$|E
25|$|Bennett left Fox to play Amy, a pert sister {{competing}} with Katharine Hepburn's Jo in Little Women (1933), which {{was directed by}} George Cukor for RKO. This movie brought Bennett {{to the attention of}} independent film producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a contract and began managing her career. She played the role of Sally MacGregor, a psychiatrist's young wife <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> insanity, in Private Worlds (1935) with Joel McCrea. She starred in the film Vogues of 1938 (1937), including the title sequence, where she donned a diamond and platinum bracelet set with the Star of Burma ruby. Wanger and director Tay Garnett persuaded Bennett to change her hair from blonde to brunette as part of the plot for her role as Kay Kerrigan in the scenic Trade Winds (1938) opposite Fredric March.|$|E
