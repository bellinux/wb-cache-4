The shell theorem says that no force is exerted on charged particles inside a sphere (of arbitrary charge) (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/potsph.html). Since the ion atmosphere is assumed to be (time-averaged) spherically symmetric, with charge varying as a function of radius , it may be represented as an infinite series of concentric charge shells. Therefore, inside the radius , the ion atmosphere exerts no force. If the force is zero, then the potential {{is a constant}} (by definition).|$|E
