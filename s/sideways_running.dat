40|$|Time-motion {{analyses}} and physiological measurements {{were performed to}} investigate the physiological demands of football referees (n = 15) and assistant referees (n = 15) in international games and to examine whether high-intensity running (HIR) correlates to the referees' ability {{to keep up with}} play. Total distance covered (10. 27 +/- 0. 90 vs. 6. 76 +/- 0. 83 km) and HIR (1. 92 +/- 0. 58 vs. 0. 97 +/- 0. 22 km) was higher (P < 0. 05) for referees than assistant referees, while sprinting distance was not different. Referees covered 0. 89 +/- 0. 37 km by backwards running and assistant referees covered 1. 54 +/- 0. 66 km by <b>sideways</b> <b>running.</b> Mean heart rate was higher (P < 0. 05) for referees than assistant referees (150 +/- 3 vs. 123 +/- 3 b. p. m.), whereas blood lactate was not different. Backwards/sideways running decreased (P < 0. 05) from the first to the last 15 -min period for referees (49 %) and assistant referees (42 %), whereas HIR was unaltered. HIR was inversely correlated with the five highest distances from infringements in both halves (r = - 0. 60 and - 0. 58, P < 0. 05). In conclusion, international match officials carry out an important amount of HIR throughout games, while low-intensity and unorthodox running activities are reduced during games. Referees performing the most high-intensity work are better to keep up with play. The match activities differ significantly between referees and assistant referees, which should be considered in training and testing procedures. status: publishe...|$|E

The negative effect of HIIT in the Ekblom’s test in comparison to SSG (Fig.  4) may be explained by the various soccer-specific movements involved in this test (i.e., jumping, slalom running, running backward, changes in direction, <b>running</b> <b>sideways),</b> which are most closely mimicked in SSG.|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Real-time physics-based {{character}} simulation {{with our}} framework. (a) A single controller for a planar biped responds to unanticipated changes in terrain. (b) A walk controller reconstructed from motion capture data responds to a 350 N, 0. 2 s diagonal push to the torso. Physics-based simulation {{and control of}} biped locomotion is difficult because bipeds are unstable, underactuated, high-dimensional dynamical systems. We develop a simple control strategy {{that can be used}} to generate a large variety of gaits and styles in real-time, including walking in all directions (forwards, backwards, <b>sideways,</b> turning), <b>running,</b> skipping, and hopping. Controllers can be authored using a small number of parameters, or their construction can be informed by motion capture data. The controllers are applied to 2 D and 3 D physically-simulated character models. Their robustness is demonstrated with respect to pushes in all directions, unexpected steps and slopes, and unexpected variations in kinematic and dynamic parameters. Direct transitions between controllers are demonstrated as well as parameterized control of changes in direction and speed. Feedback-error learning is applied to learn predictive torque models, which allows for the low-gain control that typifies many natural motions as well as producing smoother simulated motion. ...|$|R
5000|$|The IMAX dome {{projection}} method (called [...] "OMNIMAX") uses 70 mm film <b>running</b> <b>sideways</b> {{through the}} projector {{to maximize the}} image area and extreme wide angle lenses to obtain an almost hemispherical image. The field of view is tilted, as is the projection hemisphere, so one may view {{a portion of the}} ground in the foreground.

While there are not many theaters capable of displaying this format there are regular productions in the fields of nature, travel, science, and history, and productions may be viewed in most large urban regions. These dome theaters are mostly located in large and prosperous science and technology museums.|$|R

The pygidial border is narrow.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{road car}} to {{implement}} racing stripes was the 1965 Ford Mustang GT350. From the 1960s, stripes have sometimes {{been applied to}} road cars as well as racing cars.

[...] An alternative style features stripes which wraps around the car <b>sideways</b> instead of <b>running</b> {{down the center of the}} vehicle called [...] "bumblebee" [...] stripes. These stripes were featured prominently on the Dodge Charger Daytona race car. Dodge's [...] "Scat Pack" [...] performance package for 1968-1971 muscle cars featured the bumblebee stripe as a signature.

50|$|In the final, {{the slowest}} to react was Justin Gatlin, {{still with the}} most {{powerful}} first steps, Gatlin led from the gun, with Kim Collins, the next slowest to react, also getting a typically fast start (typically in lane 1). A step behind, back from injuries, defending champion Maurice Greene, was fastest to react but <b>running</b> <b>sideways</b> in quicksand. He was joined by Francis Obikwelu and Shawn Crawford, who had a slight edge on the other competitors {{in the center of}} the track. Collins faded as Obikwelu, Crawford and Greene gained. Feeling his lead disappearing rapidly, Gatlin leaned early still maintaining the lead across the line. The tall Obikwelu perfectly timed his dip to clearly grab silver. Crawford's finish occurred two meters too late giving Greene another medal with the same time as his win four years earlier. Two years later, Gatlin beat Greene's world record only to have it erased as he was banned from the sport for four years for using performance-enhancing drugs.|$|R
50|$|While {{the purpose}} of {{automobile}} suspension is to let the wheels move vertically {{with respect to the}} body, it is undesirable to allow them to move forward and backwards (longitudinally), or side to side (laterally). The Panhard rod restricts lateral movement. This is different from a traction bar, which controls axle wrap and suspension loading. The track bar or Panhard bar is a simple device, consisting of a rigid bar <b>running</b> <b>sideways</b> in the same plane as the axle, connecting one end of the axle to the car body or chassis {{on the opposite side of}} the vehicle. The bar attaches on either end with pivots that let it swivel upwards and downwards only, so that the axle can move in the vertical plane only. This does not effectively locate the axle longitudinally, therefore it is usually used in conjunction with trailing arms that stabilize the axle in the longitudinal direction. This arrangement is not usually used with a leaf spring suspension, where the springs themselves supply enough lateral rigidity, but only with coil spring suspensions (Ford did use a similar rear axle damper (5th shock) on some Explorers and light trucks with rear leaf springs).|$|R
5000|$|Development {{of various}} film camera systems must {{ultimately}} {{cater to the}} placement of the frame in relation to the lateral constraints of the perforations and the optical soundtrack area. One clever wide screen alternative, VistaVision, used standard 35 mm film <b>running</b> <b>sideways</b> through the camera gate, so that the sprocket holes were above and below frame, allowing a larger horizontal negative size per frame as only the vertical size was now restricted by the perforations. There were even a limited number of projectors constructed to also run the print-film horizontally. Generally, however, the 1.50:1 ratio of the initial VistaVision image was optically converted to a vertical print (on standard four-perforation 35 mm film) to show with the standard projectors available at theaters, and was then masked in the projector to the US standard of 1.85:1. The format was briefly revived by Lucasfilm in the late 1970s for special effects work that required larger negative size (due to image degradation from the optical printing steps necessary to make multi-layer composites). It went into obsolescence largely due to better cameras, lenses, and film stocks available to standard four-perforation formats, in addition to increased lab costs of making prints in comparison to more standard vertical processes. (The horizontal process was also adapted to 70 mm film by IMAX, which was first shown at the Osaka '70 Worlds Fair.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Nezhnie's {{first major}} {{personal}} {{work of the}} 1970s was the 60" [...] x 138" [...] Wild Cherry Charms in 1971. Five girls dressed in Halloween costumes pose on the viewer's right side, with larger-than-life faces of two {{of them on the}} left. Large circles appear in front of the figures with letters of a Cherry Charm candy wrapper <b>running</b> <b>sideways</b> across the tapestry. Many more innovative figurative works followed, including her most ambitious non-rectilinear star shaped Constellation, spanning 84". Perhaps Nezhnie's best examples of dichotomy between what appears to be realistic imagery at a distance but becomes unrecognizable color fields when viewed at a few feet are Shining Knight, a portrait woven in nubby brown cotton on a backdrop of shiny mylar, and Nader, which is a very long, 39"x188", magnification of Ralph Nader's eye and eyebrows. In general, she created the images by altering the form of lines. In the case of Nadar the details appear to cluster or cling to the rhythmical vertical lines creating convincingly attractive abstract shapes. In the later 1970s she wove small 7" [...] or 8" [...] lustrous silk portraits framed by dark brown raw silk borders. During the decade, she wove at least 13 portraits, many as private commissions. In all, she executed over 45 tapestries during the 1970s, including the first of the Holocaust series, Daughters of Auschwitz, in 1979.|$|R
