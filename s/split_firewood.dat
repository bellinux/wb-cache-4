50|$|Typically a {{conveyor}} that pulls the <b>split</b> <b>firewood</b> {{away from the}} processor and into a waiting delivery truck’s box or a woodpile for later handling. Some setups will use multiple conveyors and introduce a tumbling system to clean the firewood.|$|E

40|$|Crisp, clear fall {{days are}} perfect for <b>splitting</b> <b>firewood,</b> tilling the garden under and {{collecting}} soil samples to check fields for the soybean cyst nematode (SCN). Although soil sampling for SCN might not be on most people’s list of favorite autumn chores, fall {{is a great time}} to sample fields for this pest. Reasons to sample for SCN include to check for the presence of the nematode in fields and to monitor SCN numbers in fields known to be infested with the pest...|$|R
60|$|The snows fell deep in February {{and when}} at last the warm March winds began to blow, lakes {{developed}} with magical swiftness in the fields, and streams filled every swale, transforming the landscape into something unexpected and enchanting. At night these waters froze, bringing fields of ice almost to our door. We forgot all our other interests in {{the joy of the}} games which we played thereon at every respite from school, or from the wood-pile, for <b>splitting</b> <b>firewood</b> was our first spring task.|$|R
50|$|The three cabins {{have all}} the {{amenities}} of home - propane lights, propane stoves, wood stoves, piles of <b>split</b> <b>firewood</b> neatly stacked right outside the door, bunk beds, sleeping pads, pots, pans, cups, silverware, etc. There is a fresh spring from which to draw water to avoid hauling water or melting snow.|$|E
50|$|A {{firewood}} processor is {{a machine}} designed {{to cut and}} <b>split</b> <b>firewood</b> with minimal manual handling of the logs. There are typically four main parts of the machine, each dedicated to a separate function. Processing begins with a log pile - a pile of logs that have been de-limbed and cut to an appropriate length, generally 10 - 12 ft. Popular brands include Wood Beaver, DYNA, Multitek and Blockbuster. Many individuals use processors commercially and also privately as a hobby. Others choose to rent them {{as an alternative to}} purchasing.|$|E
50|$|Cordwood {{construction}} is an economical use of log ends or fallen trees in heavily timbered areas. Other common sources for wood include sawmills, <b>split</b> <b>firewood,</b> utility poles (without creosote), split rail fence posts, and logging slash. It is more sustainable and often economical to use recycled {{materials for the}} walls. Regardless of the source, all wood must be debarked before the construction begins. While over 30 different types of wood can be used, the most desirable rot resistant woods are Pacific yew, bald cypress (new growth), cedars, and juniper. Acceptable woods also include Douglas fir, western larch, Eastern White Pine, and Spruce Pine.|$|E
50|$|A log {{splitter}} {{is a piece}} of machinery or equipment used for <b>splitting</b> <b>firewood</b> from softwood or hardwood logs that have been pre-cut into sections (rounds), usually by chainsaw or on a saw bench. Many {{log splitter}}s consist of a hydraulic or electrical rod and piston assembly and these are often rated by the tons of force they can generate. The higher the pressure rating, the greater the thickness or length of the rounds that can be split. The log splitter consists of all four major hydraulic components.|$|R

50|$|Log {{splitting}} is {{the act of}} <b>splitting</b> <b>firewood</b> from logs {{that have}} been pre-cut into sections (rounds, bolts, billets). This {{can be done by}} hand, using an axe or maul, or by using a mechanical log splitter. When splitting a log by hand, it is best to aim for the cracks (called checks), if there are any visible. Some types of wood are harder to split than others, including extremely hard woods, as well as types like gum which an axe will often bounce off of, and cherry, which is typically so twisted it's near impossible to get a clean split, and elm. Any type of wood, being thick or tall, having large knots or twisted grain can make it difficult to split. In some cases, it is easiest to aim for the edges and split the log into multiple pieces. Batoning is splitting small pieces of wood for kindling or other purposes sometimes with a batoning chisel, a special chisel with one sharp side used for splitting.|$|R
50|$|The old unit of dry volume for <b>split</b> <b>firewood,</b> or Scheitholz, {{was based}} on this unit of length. A klafter of wood corresponded to a stack of wood with a length and height of one klafter; the depth of this pile corresponded {{to the length of}} the log but, as a rule was 3 feet long, that is 0.5 klafters. The volume of a pile of logs was {{therefore}} only 0.5 cubic klafters. This in turn corresponded, depending on the area, to 3 to 4 steres or approximately 2 to 3 m³ of wood. The old Prussian klafter corresponded to 3.339 m³; in Austria, a klafter was equivalent to 3.386 m³. By comparison the North American cord, used to measure firewood and pulpwood, is slightly larger at 3.62 m³.|$|E
30|$|The general {{trend in}} the loss of {{woodlands}} is attributable to three factors, the first of which is the increased cutting of hardwood trees for charcoal and firewood. During the field process, piles of charcoal and <b>split</b> <b>firewood</b> amounting to many tonnes could be observed along the roads and villages in mainly woodland areas of Abim, Napak (particularly Iriir), Moruita in Amudat district and Tokora area and Namalu in Nakapiripirit district. This pattern is a result of expansion of the charcoal belt to eastern and northern regions of Uganda as well as the increased demand in the urban areas surrounding the sub-region to the west. However, to the Karamojong people, this is the only means available to circumvent the impacts of poverty, hunger and climatic variability. These practices have hitherto been identified as a host of maladaptation strategies employed in the sub-region following the loss of livestock (Quam 1997; Levine 2010). The second reason for the loss of woodlands is a breakdown in traditional institutions, in particular the control previously exerted by the elders over the youth with respect to natural resources management. This has allowed tree cutting to flourish unabated. Thirdly, expanding croplands are exerting pressure on woodland land cover. Locations where woodlands exist and are accessible to the communities are preferred for establishment of farmlands because they are believed to be fertile. During the interviews and focus group discussions, the soils in such areas were described as [*]cool’ and thus good for sorghum and maize production.|$|E
40|$|My thesis body of {{work will}} {{investigate}} techniques and processes that can yield forms that are in harmony and sympathetic with forms and relationships found in nature. Using wood as my primary material, I will create a {{body of work}} that draws inspiration from trees, the way they grow, {{and the ways in which}} patterns can emerge from a tree when dissected in different ways. To achieve this I will explore techniques such as coopering in order to create shells that mimic the cambium layer of a tree or how a ripple in a surface makes visual reference to the way that curly grain appears on the face of hand <b>split</b> <b>firewood.</b> Another example would be how a table edge can be shaped similarly to the way that grain undulates or the leg of a chair can transition into the back splat with the same elegance that the limb of a tree has when transitioning out of the tree’s trunk. I plan to discover forms through exploring the many stages of the life cycle of the material for example, the tree as it stands, a fallen tree cut into logs, the manifold of the intersection of tree appendages, split boards, and cross sections of trunks. Woodworking is rectilinear in nature and as a result the natural characteristics of the wood are stripped away as it moves through the milling process. My objective is to put back into the material the beauty and the qualities it loses throughout said process. I intend to investigate form by exploring how techniques such as laminating and coopering can yield forms that resemble objects of the natural world. The structure of the tree becomes a metaphorical model of life lessons, as well as a role model for successful wooden objects. Examples of this would be the way that grain follows form, building up layers of dense winter growth and less dense summer growth. These structural qualities are one of the many ways that the tree builds strength while defining its form. I will abstract these complex qualities of the tree and showcase them by letting them define the details in my designs. Through this exploration of form I hope to create {{a body of work}} that exists in harmony and is sympathetic with forms and relationships found in nature...|$|E
50|$|A {{cleaving}} axe or cleaver {{is a form}} of axe used within green woodworking {{to split}} wood lengthways. Cleaving (riving) is used to turn a log into lumber or billets (short or thick pieces of wood) into <b>firewood.</b> <b>Splitting</b> axe is sometimes described as an old name for a splitting maul or froe.|$|R
5000|$|Splitting mauls {{are heavy}} axes (6 lbs or more) used for rough <b>splitting</b> of <b>firewood.</b> They have small heads {{in terms of}} edge length, but are heavy as they are {{especially}} wide across the cheeks and have a steep taper for rapid splitting. To provide the power necessary, they have full-length shafts and are used with a full swing at the log. Splitting is usually done to logs that are already sawn to length and so they may be split vertically. To split longer logs, wedges are driven with the heavy poll of this maul, giving its alternative name of [...] "hammer-poll axe".|$|R
25|$|The {{growth in}} {{popularity}} of wood heat {{also led to}} the development and marketing of a greater variety of equipment for cutting, <b>splitting</b> and processing <b>firewood.</b> Consumer grade hydraulic log splitters were developed to be powered by electricity, gasoline, or PTO of farm tractors. In 1987 the US Department of Agriculture published a method for producing kiln dried firewood, on the basis that better heat output and increased combustion efficiency can be achieved with logs containing lower moisture content.|$|R
5000|$|The scheitholt {{may have}} derived from an ancient Greek {{instrument}} for theoretical education {{in music and}} physics, the so-called monochord (an oblong wooden box with only one string). Scheitholt originally referred to logs <b>split</b> into <b>firewood</b> or Scheitholz (Scheit = piece, chip; Holz or Low German Holt = wood). Since the 16th century, the instrument was called by that name, presumably because it had a similar shape or size. The best known description of this instrument is by Michael Praetorius in 1619. A number of regional names for the instrument exist. In northern Germany the instrument is often called hummel, meaning [...] "bumble bee" [...] (a reference to the humming sound of the drone strings—the same word was also used for the bagpipe). Other names include the Dutch noordse balk, French bûche or bûche de Meuse, Flemish vlier and Swiss German Hexenscheit.|$|R

6000|$|But {{even if he}} had had, personally, as many pretensions as he had few, he must in {{the nature}} of things have been more or less of a consenting democrat, for {{democracy}} was the very key-stone of the simple social structure in which he played his part. The air of his journals and his tales alike are full of the genuine democratic feeling. This feeling has by no means passed out of New England life; it still flourishes in perfection in the great stock of the people, especially in rural communities; but it is probable that at the present hour a writer of Hawthorne's general fastidiousness would not express it quite so artlessly. [...] "A shrewd gentlewoman, who kept a tavern in the town," [...] he says, in Chippings with a Chisel, [...] "was anxious to obtain two or three gravestones for the deceased members of her family, and to pay for these solemn commodities by taking the sculptor to board." [...] This image of a gentlewoman keeping a tavern and looking out for boarders, seems, {{from the point of view}} to which I allude, not at all incongruous. It will be observed that the lady in question was shrewd; it was probable that she was substantially educated, and of reputable life, and it is certain that she was energetic. These qualities would make it natural to Hawthorne to speak of her as a gentlewoman; the natural tendency in societies where the sense of equality prevails, being to take for granted the high level rather than the low. Perhaps the most striking example of the democratic sentiment in all our author's tales, however, is the figure of Uncle Venner, in The House of the Seven Gables. Uncle Venner is a poor old man in a brimless hat and patched trousers, who picks up a precarious subsistence by rendering, for a compensation, in the houses and gardens of the good people of Salem, those services that are know in New England as [...] "chores." [...] He carries parcels, <b>splits</b> <b>firewood,</b> digs potatoes, collects refuse for the maintenance of his pigs, and looks forward with philosophic equanimity to the time when he shall end his days in the almshouse. But in spite of the very modest place that he occupies in the social scale, he is received on a footing of familiarity in the household of the far-descended Miss Pyncheon; and when this ancient lady and her companions take the air in the garden of a summer evening, he steps into the estimable circle and mingles the smoke of his pipe with their refined conversation. This obviously is rather imaginative--Uncle Venner is a creation with a purpose. He is an original, a natural moralist, a philosopher; and Hawthorne, who knew perfectly what he was about in introducing him--Hawthorne always knew perfectly what he was about--wished to give in his person an example of humorous resignation and of a life reduced to the simplest and homeliest elements, as opposed to the fantastic pretensions of the antiquated heroine of the story. He wished to strike a certain exclusively human and personal note. He knew that for this purpose he was taking a licence; but the point is that he felt he was not indulging in any extravagant violation of reality. Giving in a letter, about 1830, an account of a little journey he was making in Connecticut, he says, of the end of a seventeen miles' stage, that [...] "in the evening, however, I went to a Bible-class with a very polite and agreeable gentleman, whom I afterwards discovered to be a strolling tailor of very questionable habits." ...|$|R
5000|$|Abraham had {{a choice}} to {{complete}} the task or to refuse to comply to God's orders. He resigned himself to the three-and-a-half-day journey and to the loss of his son. [...] "He said nothing to Sarah, nothing to Eliezer. Who, after all, could understand him, for did not the nature of temptation extract from him a pledge of silence? He <b>split</b> the <b>firewood,</b> he bound Isaac, he lit the fire, he drew the knife." [...] Because he kept everything to himself and chose not to reveal his feelings he [...] "isolated himself as higher than the universal." [...] Kierkegaard envisions two types of people in Fear and Trembling and Repetition. One lives in hope, Abraham, the other lives in memory, The Young Man and Constantin Constantius. He discussed them beforehand in Lectures delivered before the Symparanekromenoi and The Unhappiest Man. One hopes for happiness from something [...] "out there" [...] while the other finds happiness from something in themself. This he brought out in his upbuilding discourse, published on the same date. [...] When one person sees one thing and another sees something else in the same thing, then the one discovers what the other conceals. Insofar as the object viewed belongs to the external world, then how the observer is constituted is probably less important, or, more correctly then what is necessary for the observation is something irrelevant to his deeper nature. But the more the object of observation belongs {{to the world of the}} spirit, the more important is the way he himself is constituted in his innermost nature, because everything spiritual is appropriated only in freedom; but what is appropriated in freedom is also brought forth. The difference, then, is not the external but the internal, and everything that makes a person impure and his observation impure comes from within.

60|$|As he {{approached}} the village he saw, with surprise and anxiety, that a party of soldiers were quartered near it, and, what was worse, that they seemed stationary there. This he conjectured from a few tents which he beheld glimmering upon {{what was called the}} Common Moor. To avoid the risk of being stopped and questioned in a place where he was so likely to be recognised, he made a large circuit, altogether avoiding the hamlet, and approaching the upper gate of the avenue by a by-path well known to him. A single glance announced that great changes had taken place. One half of the gate, entirely destroyed and <b>split</b> up for <b>firewood,</b> lay in piles, ready to be taken away; the other swung uselessly about upon its loosened hinges. The battlements above the gate were broken and thrown down, and the carved bears, which were said to have done sentinel's duty upon the top for centuries, now, hurled from their posts, lay among the rubbish. The avenue was cruelly wasted. Several large trees were felled and left lying across the path; and the cattle of the villagers, and the more rude hoofs of dragoon horses, had poached into black mud the verdant turf which Waverley had so much admired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Officially, {{the body}} of the little girl in the red frock is the first thing that came ashore from that ship. But I have {{patients}} amongst the seafaring population of West Colebrook, and, unofficially, I am informed that very early that morning two brothers, who went down to look after their cobble hauled up on the beach, found, a good way from Brenzett, an ordinary ship's hencoop lying high and dry on the shore, with eleven drowned ducks inside. Their families ate the birds, and the hencoop was <b>split</b> into <b>firewood</b> with a hatchet. It is possible that a man (supposing he happened to be on deck {{at the time of the}} accident) might have floated ashore on that hencoop. He might. I admit it is improbable, but there was the man--and for days, nay, for weeks--it didn't enter our heads that we had amongst us the only living soul that had escaped from that disaster. The man himself, even when he learned to speak intelligibly, could tell us very little. He remembered he had felt better (after the ship had anchored, I suppose), and that the darkness, the wind, and the rain took his breath away. This looks as if he had been on deck some time during that night. But we mustn't forget he had been taken out of his knowledge, that he had been sea-sick and battened down below for four days, that he had no general notion of a ship or of the sea, and therefore could have no definite idea of what was happening to him. The rain, the wind, the darkness he knew; he understood the bleating of the sheep, and he remembered the pain of his wretchedness and misery, his heartbroken astonishment that it was neither seen nor understood, his dismay at finding all the men angry and all the women fierce. He had approached them as a beggar, it is true, he said; but in his country, even if they gave nothing, they spoke gently to beggars. The children in his country were not taught to throw stones at those who asked for compassion. Smith's strategy overcame him completely. The wood-lodge presented the horrible aspect of a dungeon. What would be done to him next?... No wonder that Amy Foster appeared to his eyes with the aureole of an angel of light. The girl had not been able to sleep for thinking of the poor man, and in the morning, before the Smiths were up, she slipped out across the back yard. Holding the door of the wood-lodge ajar, she looked in and extended to him half a loaf of white bread--'such bread as the rich eat in my country,' he used to say.|$|R
