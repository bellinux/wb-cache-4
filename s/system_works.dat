5|$|After {{the success}} of the first Guilty Gear {{released}} on May 14, 1998 for PlayStation, Sammy Studios commissioned an arcade sequel in February 1999. Developed by Team Neo Blood, an Arc <b>System</b> <b>Works</b> production group led by Daisuke Ishiwatari, the sequel was about two years in development. Unveiled at the Amusement Expo in February 2000, Guilty Gear X was released for Japanese arcades on the Sega NAOMI system in July 2000. After the game's release, it was speculated that it would be ported to home consoles. Although the developers initially indicated that Guilty Gear X would debut for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), it was first released for Dreamcast on December 14, 2000 and re-released as part of a Dreamcast collection on May 23, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} also been ported to various consoles. It was ported by Mindscape to the Amiga home {{computers}} in 1992, by Arc <b>System</b> <b>Works</b> to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear both on 13 July 1993, and by Mindscape to the Amiga CD32 in 1994. Ports for PC DOS and the Atari ST were planned by Mindscape but never released. European CEO of Virgin Interactive, Tim Chaney, purchased the rights for Battletoads from Tradewest after the game found popularity in the United States, and planned a Master System release in 1993; however, it never materialised.|$|E

5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational <b>system</b> <b>works</b> largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear Isuka was {{released}} in Japan on December 17, 2003 by Sammy for the Atomiswave arcade cabinets, followed by the PlayStation 2 version on July 29, 2004. An Xbox version {{was released}} by Arc <b>System</b> <b>Works</b> on December 16, 2004, and Sourcenext released the game for Windows on November 25, 2005. In North America, Guilty Gear Isuka was released by Sammy for PlayStation 2 on November 2, 2004. In Europe, 505 Games Street released it on June 16, 2005 for PlayStation 2, and the PC version was released on April 7, 2006 by Zoo Digital Publishing (now Zushi Games). In 2007, the game was made compatible with Xbox 360. DotEmu also released Guilty Gear Isuka on its DRM-free shop in April 2011. On January 16, 2014, the game was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows PCs.|$|E
5|$|If {{a device}} {{key is to}} be revoked, the media key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation <b>system</b> <b>works</b> by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique key, BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the Megami Tensei series is developed by Atlus' R Department 1. Other developers {{have been involved with}} the series: these include Multimedia Intelligence Transfer (Last Bible series), Lancarse (Strange Journey), CAVE (Imagine) and Nex Entertainment (Nine), and Arc <b>System</b> <b>Works</b> (Persona 4 Arena). Most of the games up to 2003 were handled by Okada, but when he departed to form his own company Gaia, Kazuma Kaneko became the series' creative director. There are two main writers in the franchise: Shogo Isogai and Ryutaro Ito. Ito first worked on Megami Tensei II, joining the team after development to write the script, along with working with the script and being part of the debug team. Isogai's first work for the series was the script for Shin Megami Tensei II. The next entry If... was also written by Ito, and designed as a departure from the grand scale of previous games, instead being set within a cloistered school environment. His final work for the series was the first Devil Summoner. Isogai also worked on Shin Megami Tensei II and If..., and later worked on multiple Devil Summoner games, Nocturne and Strange Journey. The music for the first five main Megami Tensei titles was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. For Nocturne, Shoji Meguro, who had done work on earlier spin-off titles, was brought in. He later became well known for his work on the Persona titles.|$|E
