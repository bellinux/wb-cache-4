Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have {{attracted the attention of}} publishers by <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has added weight to the honour of the award.|$|E

25|$|Jean Ritchie {{was awarded}} a Fulbright {{scholarship}} to trace the links between American ballads and the songs from Britain and Ireland. As a song-collector, she began by <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> the 300 songs that she already knew from her mother's knee. Ritchie spent 18 months tape recording and interviewing singers. Pickow accompanied her, photographing Seamus Ennis, Leo Rowsome, Sarah Makem and other musicians. In 1955 Ritchie {{wrote a book about}} her family called Singing Family of the Cumberlands.|$|E

25|$|Helicopters {{have taken}} a primary role in air-sea rescue since their {{introduction}} in the 1940s. Helicopters can fly in rougher weather than fixed-wing aircraft, and they can deliver injured passengers directly to hospitals or other emergency facilities. A practical amphibious helicopter first appeared in 1941 and the water-landing feature soon proved its worth. Non-amphibious helicopters were required to hover above {{the scene of a}} water accident and utilize a hoist but amphibious helicopters were capable of <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> on the water to effect a rescue more directly.|$|E
25|$|Rudying held a {{large number}} of ecclesiastical offices, many of them simultaneously, {{including}} Prebendary of Biggleswade in Lincoln Cathedral, Archdeacon of Bedford, Vicar of St Michael the Archangel in Gloucester, Archdeacon of Stow, Archdeacon of Northampton and Archdeacon of Lincoln. Despite all these pluralist offices Rudying clearly chose to be buried in St Andrew's in Biggleswade by <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> so large a tomb. Perhaps it was his intention to be buried in the centre of the chancel he had rebuilt or at the least had restored; however, he is actually buried in Buckingham.|$|E
25|$|After her {{retirement}} from the stage, {{she continued to}} give concert performances and record – first for EMI (<b>setting</b> <b>down</b> her definitive account of Isolde in the first commercially released account of Tristan und Isolde, and then for Decca Records. She even made some stereophonic recordings, including excerpts from Wagner's operas with Hans Knappertsbusch and Sir Georg Solti conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1958, she sang the part of Fricka in Wagner's Das Rheingold, the first instalment in Solti's complete stereophonic set of the Ring Cycle, released by Decca on LP and reel-to-reel tape. She also spent time mentoring young singers in her native country, including contralto Eva Gustavson.|$|E

25|$|Weighing in on Quon's {{side was}} the AFL-CIO, {{on behalf of}} those members of its {{constituent}} labor unions who were public employees. The New York Intellectual Property Law Association (NYIPLA), whose members litigate privacy claims, called on the Court to refrain from <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> any clear rules as technology, and social expectations of privacy related to it, were still evolving. The Electronic Privacy Information Center's brief, signed by technical experts as well as lawyers, focused {{on the importance of}} data minimization to both security and privacy protection. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy and Technology and Public Citizen filed a joint brief. The conservative Rutherford Institute filed a motion requesting leave to file their amicus in favor of respondents since one withheld permission.|$|E
25|$|In July 1996, Lord Woolf {{published}} Access to Justice, {{a report}} on the accessibility of the courts to the public. Woolf identified civil litigation as being characterised by excessive cost, delay and complexity, and managed to replace the diverse rules with a single set of Civil Procedure Rules. Before Woolf had even published his final report, Sir Jeffery Bowman, the recently retired senior partner of PriceWaterhouse, was commissioned to write {{a report on}} the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. Bowman noted a growing workload and delays, with 14 months between <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> and disposing of a case in 70 percent of cases, the rest taking even longer than that – some had taken five years. He recommended extending the requirement to ask leave to appeal to almost all Appeal cases, to allow certain appeals to be heard at a lower level, to focus procedure, impose time limits on oral arguments and move judicial time more towards reading and less towards sitting in court.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 1 February 1995, {{this episode}} {{examines}} how plants either share environments harmoniously or compete for dominance within them. Attenborough highlights the 1987 storm and the devastation it caused. However, for some species, {{it was that}} opportunity for which they had lain dormant for many years. The space left by uprooted trees is soon filled by others who move relatively swiftly towards the light. The oak {{is one of the}} strongest and longest-lived, and other, lesser plants nearby must wait until the spring to flourish before the light above is extinguished by leaves. Tropical forests are green throughout the year, so brute force is needed for a successful climb {{to the top of the}} canopy: the rattan is an example that has the longest stem of any plant. As its name suggests, the strangler fig 'throttles' its host by growing around it and cutting off essential water and light. Some can take advantage of a fallen tree by <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> roots on the now horizontal trunk and getting nutriment from the surrounding moss and the fungi on the dead bark. The mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) grows so tall, that regeneration becomes a considerable problem. It is easily flammable, so its solution is to shed its seeds during a forest fire and sacrifice itself. It therefore relies on the periodic near-destruction of its surroundings in order to survive. Attenborough observes that catastrophes such as fire and drought, while initially detrimental to wildlife, eventually allow for deserted habitats to be reborn.|$|E

500|$|Fuming was an {{accidental}} discovery in England {{after it was}} noticed that oak boards stored in a stable had darkened. [...] This {{was caused by the}} ammonia fumes from the horse urine reacting with the wood. [...] At {{the end of the nineteenth}} and beginning of the twentieth centuries fuming became popular with furniture makers in the Arts and Crafts movement. [...] The technique was introduced to the US by Gustav Stickley in 1901 and a manufacturing technique was perfected in the mission style furniture line of the Stickley family business. [...] Stickley also described a method of fuming the wooden architecture of an entire room by <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> bowls of ammonia within the room and completely sealing it. [...] This method was not very practical and quite dangerous for the person placing the ammonia without the personal protective equipment available to modern workers. [...] Stickley was quickly followed by other American Arts and Crafts furniture makers [...] such as Charles Limbert and the Roycroft community.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, C. Everett Koop wrote The Right to Live, The Right to Die, <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> his own {{concerns}} about abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia. [...] Koop also {{took some time}} off from his surgical practice to make a series of films with Christian apologists Frank Schaeffer and his father Francis Schaeffer in 1978, entitled Whatever Happened to the Human Race? {{based on the book}} of the same title that had been previously written by the elder Schaeffer. Frank Schaeffer and his associate, Jim Buchfuehrer provided a private, five-hour screening of Whatever Happened to the Human Race? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that, according to Frank Schaeffer's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book Crazy for God, led to both the Schaeffers and Koop obtaining [...] "...access to everyone in the Republican Party". Joanne Kemp once suffered a miscarriage, which Kemp later said made him re-evaluate the sanctity of human life and affirmed his opposition to abortion.|$|E
500|$|After <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> {{briefly on}} Tenerife, Gonsales {{is forced to}} take off again by the {{imminent}} approach of hostile natives. But rather than flying {{to a place of}} safety among the Spanish inhabitants of the island the gansas fly higher and higher. On the first day of his flight Gonsales encounters [...] "illusions of 'Devils and Wicked Spirits in the shape of men and women, some of whom he is able to converse with. They provide him with food and drink for his journey and promise to set him down safely in Spain if only he will join their [...] "Fraternity", and [...] "enter into such Covenants as they had made to their Captain and Master, whom they would not name". Gonsales declines their offer, and after a journey of 12 days reaches the Moon. Suddenly feeling very hungry he opens the provisions he was given en route, only to find nothing but dry leaves, goat's hair and animal dung, and that his wine [...] "stunk like Horse-piss". He is soon discovered by the inhabitants of the Moon, the Lunars, whom he finds to be tall Christian people enjoying a happy and carefree life in a kind of pastoral paradise. Gonsales discovers that order is maintained in this apparently utopian state by swapping delinquent children with terrestrial children.|$|E

These items were heated in small furnaces, covered in sal ammoniac, and then used for soldering seams.|$|E
2500|$|John Reed {{was on an}} {{assignment}} for The Masses, a magazine of socialist politics, when he was reporting the Russian Revolution. Although Reed states that he had [...] "tried to see events with {{the eye of a}} conscientious reporter, interested in <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> the truth" [...] {{during the time of the}} event, he stated in the preface that [...] "in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral" [...] (since the book leans towards the Bolsheviks and their viewpoints).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{estimation}} of historian Shmuel Galai, the programmatic originality of the People's Rights Party lay not in its <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> of political liberty as a goal of the organization — which had been stated as an objective by other radical populist organizations — but its intimation that {{the adoption of the}} methods of liberal democracy would be the means to that end as well. Citing the group's program, Galai has asserted that [...] "for {{the first time in the}} annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy," [...] in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.|$|E
