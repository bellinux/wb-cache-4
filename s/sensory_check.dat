Results: Recruitment rate was 28 % of eligible patients (recruited n = 90, attrition n = 1). Following instruction by the research nurse the familymember delivered the intervention which was assessed to be feasible and acceptable by family members and nurses. Protocol adherence could be improved with alternative data collection methods. Nurses considered the activities acceptable. Conclusion: The study was able to recruit, randomise and retain family member participants. Further strategies are required to assess intervention fidelity and improve data collection.

40|$|The {{portion of}} food {{interest}} of sea urchin {{is located in}} the gonads, a dish increasingly appreciated in the international cuisine. The aims of this study were evaluate the process of fresh roes from rock-boring urchin sea Echinometra lucunter for human consumption, check the acceptance and preference of the product, and consumer purchase intent. Studies on processing of roes from E. lucunter are nonexistent, thus, this study is a pioneer in Brazil. The roes were processed following the steps: wash in a solution of potassium alum, drainage, separation by color, packaging and storage under refrigeration (0 - 4 °C). Following, batches of the roes were characterized by physical, chemical and microbiological analyses, and subjected to <b>sensory</b> analysis to <b>check</b> acceptance and preference of potential consumers. The methodology of potassium alum used was efficient for E. lucunter roes and the color attribute was more relevant in the acceptance, preference and purchase intent from processed fresh roes. The extraction process might be improved in order to minimize rupture of the gonads. For managers of fisheries and sea food quality we recommend the implementation of public policies that result in the sustainability of sea-urchin species and food safety for the consumers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if obese patients have a different sensory regression time from subarachnoid block than non-obese patients using hyperbaric 0. 75 % bupivacaine. A quasi-experimental design was used. Twenty patients were separated into two groups; one group was classified as obese, and the other group was classified as non-obese. The data consisting of age, height, weight, sex, and surgical procedure were recorded preoperatively. All the patients received hyperbaric 0. 75 % bupivacaine via subarachnoid puncture. The levels of spinal anesthesia were recorded at the highest level achieved. The injection time was also recorded. When the surgery was completed, the patient was transferred to the recovery room and levels of <b>sensory</b> blockade were <b>checked</b> by pin-prick with an 18 -gauge needle every 10 minutes until complete recovery from the spinal anesthesia had been achieved. The hypothesis, there will be no difference in sensory regression time from SAB with hyperbaric 0. 75 % bupivacaine between obese and non-obese patients, failed to be rejected. No statistically significant difference, using linear regression analysis, was found in mean regression time between groups (obese versus non-obese) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} {{drug abuse and}} {{addiction}} have crossed the health and medical borders and have {{been turned into a}} social-medical problem. Spinal anesthesia for lower extremity surgery {{could be used as a}} selective method for pulmonary and systemic diseases such as diabetes, liver and kidney disorders and so on. Also it is possible to see pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases at the same time in addicts. In this research the rate of success in spinal anesthesia in addict and non addict males was evaluated. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 50 patients. The patients were classified into two groups. Including 25 addicts and 25 non addicts. The age range was selected between 25 - 50 years and the height range between 165 - 180 cm. Addiction and non addiction confirmed by morphine urine test. Spinal anesthesia was introuduced in sitting position,the spinal needle was inserted in the L 3 - L 4 interspace. Local anesthetic was 2 cc Lidocaine 5 %. Five minutes after injection of lidocaine, the <b>sensory</b> blockagde was <b>checked</b> by needle method without patients' attention. The data were collected and finally analysed by SPSS ver 10. Results: Spinal anesthesia was 100 % successful in both addict and non addict groups. Five addicts (20 %) and two non addicts (8 %) felt pain during the surgery. We evaluated sensory blockade of these patients again,all of them had not pain but malingered to have pain. Conclusion: Spinal anesthesia is effective in addicts and is a suitable method for surgery candidates...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} in the work-place {{can result}} {{in the loss of}} sensation and pain in workers. These effects may be exacerbated by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or the presence of primary Raynaud 73 s phenomena. The goal of these studies was to use an established model of vibration-induced injury in Zucker rats. Lean Zucker rats have a normal metabolic profile, while obese Zucker rats display symptoms of metabolic disorder or Type II diabetes. This study examined the effects of vibration in obese and lean rats. Zucker rats were exposed to 4 h of vibration for 10 consecutive days at a frequency of 125 Hz and acceleration of 49 m/s(2) for 10 consecutive days. <b>Sensory</b> function was <b>checked</b> using transcutaneous electrical stimulation on days 1, 5 and 9 of the exposure. Once the study was complete the ventral tail nerves, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord were dissected, and levels of various transcripts involved in sensorineural dysfunction were measured. Sensorineural dysfunction was assessed using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Obese Zucker rats displayed very few changes in sensorineural function. However they did display significant changes in transcript levels for factors involved in synapse formation, peripheral nerve remodeling, and inflammation. The changes in transcript levels suggested that obese Zucker rats had some level of sensory nerve injury prior to exposure, and that exposure to vibration activated pathways involved in injury and re-innervation.

40|$|AbstractSessile Joyweed (Alteranthera sessilis) {{which is}} {{commonly}} known as Mukunuvenna in Sri Lanka, is the most widely produced and most popular of nine leafy vegetables cultivated and sold on a commercial scale in Sri Lanka. This is primarily consumed locally, while only a small quantity is exported. However, the shelf life of Mukunuvenna is as low about 3 - 4 days due to leaf yellowing and wilting. Consumers prefer green and turgid leafy vegetables and thus the loss is considerably high after wilting and yellowing. Ethylene is a critical problem in leaf senescence. Minute concentrations such as 1 μL/L ethylene can affect leaf yellowing significantly. Thus, an ethylene blocker, 1 -Methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), which is now commonly being used in the fruit industry, can be considered as an effective solution for extending the postharvest life of A. sessilis. It is not toxic and environmentally friendly thus safe with edible produce. The present study was done, with the objective of investigating effects of 1 -MCP on postharvest life and sensory qualities. Two experiments were conducted for several dosages (concentration × time) to investigate the shelf-life performances and processed A. sessilis samples were used to <b>check</b> <b>sensory</b> qualities such as taste, smell, texture and colour. Samples treated with 1 -MCP showed high levels of chlorophyll, lower yellowing and higher overall quality. Postharvest life of treated samples increased by 1 full-day (25 % increase) under the room temperature. 1 -MCP, 5 ppm for 8 hour duration showed promising results. However, the obtained results did not show a specific treatment combination as the best treatment and 1 -MCP did not alter the sensory qualities of the processed product...|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{attributes}} and extrinsic {{factors associated with}} the product presentation are important drivers of product liking and consumer choice. It is therefore useful to investigate consumers’ acceptability {{in the light of}} all these aspects for better supporting product development and marketing. It is relatively simple to conceive experiments to investigate these aspects in the case of processed products. In this work we extended this approach to the case of fresh unprocessed products such as fruit and vegetables presenting two case studies on apple acceptability. In a first study, we investigated whether the intensity of intrinsic sensory {{attributes and}} different information on fibre and antioxidant content, provided immediately before tasting, could affect the acceptability of four varieties of apple, characterised by four combinations of two levels (high and low) of crunchiness and sweetness. Higher crunchiness and sweetness increased the liking whereas the effect of nutritional information was not significant, at least for the mean of the population. Interesting results emerged when segmenting consumers and characterising them according to their age and their awareness of healthy aspects. In a second study, the combined effect of flavour and different external information (apples claimed to be ‘traditional’ or ‘chosen for their intense aroma’) on acceptability was studied. For this purpose, the flavour of apples was artificially modified maintaining constant the other <b>sensory</b> attributes as <b>checked</b> by a <b>sensory</b> trained panel. Two apple treatment variants were developed: anise and flower flavoured. The concentration of 2 flavouring agents in treated apples and the related flavour profiles were statistically significant different from the reference untreated apple as demonstrated by instrumental head space analysis (SPME–GC–MS and PTR-MS) and by sensory analyses (discriminant and descriptive) respectively. Anise flavour significantly reduced the global liking of apple of the whole consumer panel, whereas external information seemed relevant only for specific groups of consumers, who are not interested in natural food. Our findings suggest that also for fresh unprocessed products it is possible to investigate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors by conjoint analysis. This work is a contribution to apple producers/distributors who gained {{a better understanding of the}} importance consumers give to sensory attributes and health information in order to support consumer-led breeding selections...|$|R
40|$|Neste trabalho foi estudado o efeito da introdução de energia de microondas no assamento de biscoito semi-doce duro, no gradiente de umidade, incidência de quebra, qualidade sensorial, medidas instrumentais de cor e textura e medidas físicas de diâmetro, espessura, fator de expansão, perda de peso, volume e densidade. Inicialmente foi utilizado um planejamento fatorial completo para os tempos de exposição em microondas de 15, 20, 30 e 40 segundos nas potências alta e média, após o assamento convencional dos biscoitos (2400 C por 4 minutos), visando avaliar o comportamento do gradiente de umidade e umidade global dos mesmos. A partir da análise do modelo ajustado ao primeiro fatorial selecionou-se um segundo plano fatorial com tempos de exposição de 23 e 29 segundos nas potências alta e média de microondas, para proceder às análises tecnológicas do produto. Os biscoitos resultantes destes tratamentos apresentaram redução significativa (p produto padrão, e a textura (dureza) daqueles foi significativamente menor (1207. 59 g) comparada ao padrão (1601. 35 g). O valor de fator de expansão (DIE) para biscoitos padrão (11. 3) foi significativamente maior do que o tratamento com microondas (10. 7), mostrando que á energia de microondas exerce um efeito de encolhimento no produto. Com relação à perda de peso, os resultados evidenciaram que a retirada da umidade {{residual}} pela ação das microondas aumenta a perda de peso do produto (de 0. 910 para 0. 956). No entanto, a diferença de peso não foi suficiente para distinguir as amostras (padrão e microondas) com relação à densidade. Portanto, concluímos que a introdução da energia de microondas no pós-assamento de biscoitos foi capaz de eliminar o problema de fissura do produto através da diminuição do gradiente de umidade dos mesmos, preservando sua qualidade sensorial e alterando muito pouco as propriedades físicas do produto. In this work, {{the effect}} of the introduction of microwave energy in the post-baking of hard semi-sweet biscuits, on humidity gradient, incidence of <b>checking,</b> <b>sensory</b> profile, instrumental measurements of colour and texture, and physical diameter, thickness, expansion ratio, loss of weight, volume and density was studied. A complete factorial plan was used initially at 15, 20, 30 and 40 seconds with high and medium power of microwaves in the post-baking (240 °C/ 4 min) of biscuits, in order to evaluate the humidity gradient and global humidity. Based on this first factorial ajusted model a second plan was selected at 23 and 29 seconds of high and medium microwave power exposure, in order to carry out a complete analysis of the products. The resulting biscuits showed a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in the humidity gradient and percent of checking, and showed no significant sensory difference with respect to the standard product. The texture analyses showed no difference between the treatments, but all were less hard than the standard: With respect to colour, the products submitted to medium microwave power exposure (23 and 29 sec.) did not differ significantly from the standard, but those exposed to high microwave energy (23 and 29 sec.) did not differ from each other but were different from the standard. The biscuits baked in a conventional oven (electrical heating) at 240 °C/ 4 min and subsequently dried with medium microwave power for 29 sec, showed a significant reduction in the humidity gradient (from 2. 16 % to 0. 88 %) and in the incidence of checking (from 41. 7 %to 0 %). The instrumental measurement of colour (L parameter) of the biscuits (combined, process) was significantly (p< 0. 05) equal to the standard sample and that of texture (hardness) was lower (1207. 59 g) then the standard (1601. 35 g). The expansion ratio of the standard sample. (11. 3) was significantly higher than the combined process sample (10. 7), showing a shrinkage effect due to the microwave energy. With respect to weight losses, the results showed us that the residual humidity removal by the action of microwaves increased the product weight loss (from 0. 912 to 0. 956 g). However, the weight difference was not sufficient to differenciate the samples. It was concluded that the introduction of microwave energy in the pot-baking of the biscuits could solve the checking problem through a decrease in the humidity gradient, without causing any sensory changes or notable alterations in the physical properties of the product...|$|R
