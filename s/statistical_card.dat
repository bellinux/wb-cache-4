40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the social workers 2 ̆ 7 and clients’ perceptions of change in the treatment process; specifically to examine the question of why clients discontinue service prior to planful termination. Also, the authors attempted to assess the client 2 ̆ 7 s perception of gain and the worker 2 ̆ 7 s assessment of gain. Significant Findings Seventy-two per cent of the clients who responded to the questionnaire felt they had been helped. In those cases where the client indicated he had received no help or that his situation became worse, the authors found that the client often indicated that his spouse was unable or unwilling to participate in treatment. These clients also often indicated that they had divorced. The client tended to rate the gains he made from treatment slightly higher than the worker rated them. The inability or unwillingness of the spouse to participate in the treatment process was seen as an important reason for discontinuance before six interviews were completed. The client seemed more likely to indicate fee as a reason for termination of service after six interviews. Clients who paid no fee were more likely to terminate in an unplanned manner before six interviews. If the client paid any fee, his termination was more likely to be planful. Recommendations and Suggestions for Further Research The authors recommend, as in the study done by Dr. Dan Jennings, that any questionnaire mailed out by the agency in the future be a more immediate follow-up to treatment, that is, {{there is a need for}} further exploration of the optimum time for follow-up study. A future questionnaire might be returned to the individual practitioner so that he could evaluate the service. Also a planned follow-up of this sort might result in the practitioner reaching out to the client to re-involve him in the treatment process if the client so indicated the need on the returned questionnaire. Recommendations and Suggestions for Further Research The authors recommend that workers indicate clearly on the statistical cards which members of the family were seen in order to facilitate and expedite data gathering. The statistical cards give assessment of service in terms of gain only. The authors recommend that because service is not always gainful, that there be a place on the <b>statistical</b> <b>card</b> to so indicate this. The situation may be so deteriorated that in the worker 2 ̆ 7 s assessment there is no ability on the part of the client for motivation, capacity and opportunity for change. On the basis of the data derived from the questionnaire, the authors recommend that further exploratory study be done in the following areas: (a) In the cases where the spouse is unable or unwilling to participate in the treatment process. (b) In the cases where the clients who paid no fee were more likely to terminate unplanned and before six interviews. The authors recommend, as in the study done by Dr. Dan Jennings, that any questionnaire mailed out by the agency in the future be a more immediate follow-up to treatment, that is, there is a need for further exploration of the optimum time for follow-up study. A future questionnaire might be returned to the individual practitioner so that he could evaluate the service. Also a planned follow-up of this sort might result in the practitioner reaching out to the client to re-involve him in the treatment process if the client so indicated the need on the returned questionnaire. Findings in this study showed that the critical period for clients continuance seems to be within the first five interviews. The author recommend that further exploratory study be done on this critical period of treatment...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A German {{genome-wide}} nonsynonymous {{single nucleotide}} polymorphism (nsSNP) association study identified ATG 16 L 1 as a Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility gene. The association appeared to be confined to the nsSNP rs 2, 241, 880 and was confirmed in 2 German independent case-control collections (combined P = 4. 0 x 10 (- 8), odds ratio [OR] 1. 45; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 21 - 1. 74), a CD transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) collection, and an independent UK cohort. A weak <b>statistical</b> interaction with <b>CARD</b> 15 was demonstrated. No association with ulcerative colitis (UC) was demonstrated. The aims {{of the study were}} to replicate the association with CD, examine subphenotype associations and <b>statistical</b> interactions with <b>CARD</b> 15, IL 23 R, and the IBD 5 risk haplotype, as well as explore the association with UC. METHODS: The study included 645 CD and 676 UC rigorously phenotyped patients recruited from a single UK center. Unaffected controls comprised either spouses of patients (141) or individuals recruited from well-person clinics (1, 049). The nsSNP rs 2, 241, 880 was genotyped using MassArray (Sequenom). RESULTS: A strong association with CD was demonstrated (P = 2. 33 x 10 (- 7), OR 1. 45 [1. 25 - 1. 67]), but no significant association was demonstrated with any subphenotype. We failed to replicate the reported interaction between rs 2, 241, 880 and the CARD 15 low-risk haplotypes dd and Dd. No significant statistical interaction with the 3 known CD susceptibility genes was seen. No association with UC susceptibility (P = 0. 37, OR 1. 06 [0. 93 - 1. 22]), or any UC subphenotype was identified. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the findings that ATG 16 L 1 is a CD susceptibility gene and found no evidence of interaction with CARD 15, IL 23 R, or IBD 5...|$|R

The aim of {{study was to identify}} the consistency rate of drug record information between cardex and patients medical cards in teaching hospitals of Yasuj, Iran Methods: The present descriptive sectional study was conducted in teaching hospitals of Yasuj in 2012. Case Sampling was convenience sampling. A number of 400 patient’s charts were selected and drug orders were compared with cardex and drug patient’s <b>cards.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis was performed by SPSS software and descriptive tests. Results: Of 400 charts, only 1670 charts had drug orders and there were a total 337 of drug errors in cardex and drug cards. The highest rate of inconsistency of drug details was related to entering drug routes into cradex and drug cards that were reported 41 % and 43. 2 % respectively. In addition about 5 % and 23. 4 % of administrated drugs were not recorded in cardex and drug cards. It is also indicated that 1 % and 2. 5 % of deleted drug orders in the chart were not deleted in cardex and drug cards. Conclusions: There are relatively large numbers of inconsistency cases of drug details between cardex, drug cards and patient’s charts. It is necessary to clarify the issue, and also performed new methods of drug registration in the hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Curriculum and InstructionThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was {{to determine whether or not}} students in high school chemistry have the prerequisite math skills, the application of equivalent fractions to unit conversions, needed to work dimensional analysis problems in chemistry. If students do not have the math skills but are actively taught them, then they should be able to use this skill to solve chemistry problems. The participants of the study included 78 honors and non-honors high school chemistry students. The math data was analyzed from the fall Northwest Evaluation Association, NWEA, data and correlated with a student's chemistry pretest data involving dimensional analysis. In teaching dimensional analysis, teacher-centered instruction was compared to manipulative-assisted instruction. The teacher-centered instruction involved the use of notes, lecture, and problem worksheets. The manipulative-assisted instruction dealt with the use of unit conversion manipulatives, specifically animal/insect picture cards. Students who used the picture cards were found to have higher average retention test scores compared to those who used the teacher -centered strategy. Although the average score was higher with the picture cards, the increases were not statistically significant. In order to show <b>statistical</b> significance, the <b>cards</b> need to be used earlier in the year or possibly in previous courses for extensive exposure. As students work with the cards, they will internalize dimensional analysis and should improve the retention test scores.

40|$|Purpose: i/ To {{compare the}} {{differences}} between the acute skin reaction of patients undergoing radiation therapy to the breast or chest wall washing with water and a mild cleansing agent (pH= 7), and patients washing with water only, and ii/ to determine whether there is any psychological benefit for those patients washing with water and a mild cleansing agent compared to those washing with water only. Methods: Forty three (43) patients receiving tangential radiation therapy for early stage primary breast cancer were randomised to one of two treatment arms: Group 1 - washing with water and a mild cleansing agent (21 patients). Group 2 - washing with water only (22 patients). Acute skin reaction was assessed weekly by a radiation oncologist and radiation therapist using a modified EORTC/RTOG skin reaction scale. Acute skin reaction and psychological benefit was assessed by the patient using a weekly diary skin assessment <b>card.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis of the differences in skin reaction and the psychological benefit between the groups was tested. Results: No statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups was found for the degree of skin reaction for weeks one through to five. The study measured a statistically significant psychological benefit for those patients washing with water and a mild cleansing agent (p= 0. 016). Discussion: Given that there is no statistically significant difference in acute skin reactions between the two groups, the psychological benefit provided to those patients allowed to use a cleansing agent supports the skin care regime of washing with water and a mild cleansing agent...|$|R
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a palliative {{treatment}} {{option for}} unresectable hilar biliary tract cancer (BTC) showing a considerable benefit for survival {{and quality of}} life with few side effects. Currently, factors determining the cellular response of BTC cells towards PDT are unknown. Due to their multifaceted nature, microRNAs (miRs) are a promising analyte to investigate the cellular mechanisms following PDT. For two photosensitizers, Photofrin® and Foscan®, the phototoxicity was investigated in eight BTC cell lines. Each cell line (untreated) was profiled for expression of n = 754 miRs using TaqMan® Array Human MicroRNA <b>Cards.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis and bioinformatic tools were used to identify miRs associated with PDT efficiency and their putative targets, respectively. Twenty miRs correlated significantly with either high or low PDT efficiency. PDT was particularly effective in cells with high levels of clustered miRs 25 - 93 *- 106 b and (in case of miR- 106 b) a phenotype characterized by high expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and high proliferation (cyclinD 1 and Ki 67 expression). Insensitivity towards PDT was associated with high miR- 200 family expression and (for miR-cluster 200 a/b- 429) expression of differentiation markers Ck 19 and Ck 8 / 18. Predicted and validated downstream targets indicate plausible involvement of miRs 20 a*, 25, 93 *, 130 a, 141, 200 a, 200 c and 203 in response mechanisms to PDT, suggesting that targeting these miRs could improve susceptibility to PDT in insensitive cell lines. Taken together, the miRNome pattern may provide a novel tool for predicting the efficiency of PDT and—following appropriate functional verification—may subsequently allow for optimization of the PDT protocol...|$|R
