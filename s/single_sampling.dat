40|$|Amylobarbitone sodium (200 mg) {{was given}} by {{intravenous}} injection to nine healthy, young adults (four males). Subjects were drug-free and nonsmokers. Serial blood samples were drawn for 48 h following the infusion, and multiple <b>sample</b> and <b>single</b> <b>sample</b> estimates of clearance were calculated. The mean (+/- s. d.) values for clearance (CL) and apparent volume of distribution (V) were 0. 032 (+/- 0. 007) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 and 1. 08 (+/- 0. 16) 1 kg- 1, respectively. The mean (+/- s. d.) <b>single</b> <b>sample</b> estimate of clearance, CL, based on just the 48 h plasma concentrations of amylobarbitone was 0. 033 (+/- 0. 006) 1 h- 1 kg- 1.

Values of the 48 h CL when compared to CL exhibited a mean prediction error (mpe) of 1. 2 % with 95 % confidence limits of - 6. 3 % to 9. 4 %, and a root mean squared error (rmse) of 9. 4 %.

40|$|Acceptance Sampling is the {{methodology}} {{which deals with}} procedures through which decisions to accept or reject of a lot {{which are based on}} the result of inspection of samples. The foundation of the scheme of acceptance sampling has laid by Dodge and Romig (1959). General procedures and necessary tables are provided for the selection of <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan through tangent angle as proposed by Norman Bush (1953). Mandelson (1962) has explained the desirability for developing a system of sampling plans indexed through MAPD. Mayer (1967) has explained that the quality standard that the MAPD can be considered as a quality level with other conditions to specify the OC curve.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ciprofloxacin}} treatment on theophylline clearance was evaluated with a theophylline multiple dose, multiple sample protocol {{and with a}} <b>single</b> dose, <b>single</b> <b>sample</b> protocol. The object {{was to determine whether}} a <b>single</b> dose, <b>single</b> <b>sample</b> protocol for estimating theophylline clearance {{could be used as a}} screening strategy for evaluating host factor influences on theophylline clearance. Ciprofloxacin (750 mg per os) was administered every 12 h for nine doses in the multidose study and every 12 h for seven doses in the single dose protocol. Subjects were sixteen healthy, non-smoking young adult males. The oral clearance of theophylline at steady state, (CL/F) ss, decreased from a mean (+/- s. d.) value of 0. 035 (+/- 0. 008) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 to 0. 024 (+/- 0. 004) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 during ciprofloxacin treatment. <b>Single</b> <b>sample</b> estimates of theophylline clearance, CL/F, similarly decreased from 0. 040 (+/- 0. 014) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 to 0. 018 (+/- 0. 008) 1 h- 1 kg- 1. Mean theophylline clearances were significantly different when comparing control with ciprofloxacin treatment means (P less than 0. 01), but were not different when comparing <b>single</b> <b>sample</b> vs multiple sample clearances for a given treatment (i. e. control or ciprofloxacin).

The inspection efficiency of CV method is higher than S method and σ method. Tong and Chen (1991) proposed a variable <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan using CV to evaluate the quality stability of normally distributed products. Yan et al.

30|$|The {{traditional}} {{sampling plans}} are applied when the experimenter or the producer is certain about the proportion parameter. So, the sampling plans having {{the assumption of}} determined value cannot be applied when there is uncertainty or indeterminacy about proportion parameter. The fuzzy sampling plans have been widely applied for the lot sentencing when there is uncertainty in the proportion parameter. Several authors contributed to designing the sampling plan using the fuzzy approach, see for example, Cheng et al. [2] proposed a fuzzy testing process to select a better process. Jamkhaneh et al. [3] studied the effect of inspection error using the <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan. Sadeghpour Gildeh et al. [4] and Jamkhaneh and Gildeh [5] designed double sampling plan under the fuzzy approach. Turanoğlu et al. [6] studied the characteristic curve of the sampling plan. Jamkhaneh and Gildeh [7] proposed the fuzzy sequential sampling plan. Divya [8] worked on a <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan using the Poisson distribution. Venkateh and Elango [9] designed sampling plan for fuzzy gamma distribution. Kahraman et al. [10] designed the single and double sampling plans under the fuzzy approach. Afshari and Gildeh [11], Afshari et al. [12, 13] designed fuzzy plans using multiple dependent state sampling. Elango et al.
