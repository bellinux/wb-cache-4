2500|$|While Frank is at work, Lucille bemoans {{the state}} of their marriage, believing herself unappreciated by a man <b>so</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> himself. She {{reflects}} on her unfulfilled life and wonders whether or not Leo was the right match for her ("Leo at Work" [...] / [...] "What Am I Waiting For?"). Mary Phagan arrives in Leo's office to collect her paycheck. That night, two policeman, Detective Starnes and Officer Ivey, rouse Frank from his sleep, and without telling him why, demand he accompany them to the factory, where the body of Mary Phagan has been found raped and murdered in the basement. [...] The Police immediately suspects Newt Lee, the African-American night watchman who discovered the body ("Interrogation"). Throughout his interrogation, he maintains his innocence, but inadvertently directs Starnes' suspicion upon Frank, who did not answer his telephone when Lee called him to report the incident. Leo is arrested, but not charged, and Mrs. Phagan, Mary's mother, becomes aware of Mary's death.|$|E
2500|$|Eclipse {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Anne Rouyer of School Library Journal {{gave the}} novel a positive review and said that, [...] "Meyer knows what her fans want: thrills, chills, {{and a lot}} of romance, and she delivers on all counts." [...] Rouyer also thought that as in the two previous installments, [...] "it is Meyer's effective and intense portrayal of first love in all its urgency, passion, and confusion that drives the story along with the supernatural elements coming in a close second", and said that the [...] "injection of heightened sexual tension and sensuality that hasn't been present in the series before" [...] contributed well to the emotional atmosphere of the novel. However, she found that the werewolves' and vampires' histories slowed the book's pace and called the newborn army's story a [...] "convoluted add-in", while noting that they [...] "contribute in some way to Bella's epiphanies about her future." [...] Katie Trattner of Blogcritics praised the characters and their development throughout the novel, particularly the histories of Rosalie and Jasper—contradicting Rouyer—stating, [...] "The history that formed them and their reactions towards Bella become clear and the characters much more solid because of this knowledge. I think {{that is part of the}} appeal of these books—the fact that you do become <b>so</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the characters, that they touch places deep inside yourself." [...] She commended Meyer for painting a good emotional image, as well as Bella's emotional growth, and went on to say that she [...] "writes so fluidly and propels the reader forward so effortlessly." [...] Selby Gibson-Boyce of Tulsa World wrote, [...] "I read without stopping until I finished. Meyer's book would not detach itself from my hand. Exactly the same thing happened with Twilight and New Moon." [...] Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "The legions of readers who are hooked on the romantic struggles of Bella and the vampire Edward will ecstatically devour this third installment of the story", while noting that, [...] "it's unlikely to win over any newcomers." [...] Kirkus Reviews concluded its review stating that the book's [...] "unsettling racially charged characterizations are offset by messages of overcoming difference and working together. Fans of Bella's angst-drenched love triangle will gobble this entry up, and the open-ended conclusion paves the way for Jake's story to come." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{she went}} gamely to church with the others. If Mr. Meredith {{had not been}} <b>so</b> wholly <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> and carried away with his subject he might have noticed the pale little face and hollow eyes in the manse pew beneath. But he noticed nothing and his sermon was {{something}} longer than usual. Then, just before be gave out the final hymn, Una Meredith tumbled off {{the seat of the}} manse pew and lay in a dead faint on the floor.|$|R
60|$|It {{was as if}} {{allegiance}} to poor Juliana's dislikes had hitherto kept Sir Bevil aloof from Phoebe, and deterred him from manifesting his good-will; but the marriage brought him at last to Beauchamp, kind, grave, military, and melancholy as ever, and <b>so</b> much <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his little girl and his fancied memory of her mother, that Cecily's dislike of long attachments was confirmed by his aspect; and only her sanguine benevolence was bold enough to augur his finding a comforter in her cousin Susan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] I said resolutely; [...] "but not {{the sense}} of mystery. It's THAT that appals me so! I'd rather know the truth than be <b>so</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the incomprehensible." ...|$|E

"As James was asleep, and I was by {{this time}} {{uncommon}} hungry, I thought I WOULD go into the Refreshment Room and just take a little soup; <b>so</b> I <b>wrapped</b> him <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his cloak and laid him by his mamma, and went off.

"Herodotus {{was only}} four years old when Xerxes invaded Greece, and of course all his {{knowledge}} concerning that expedition was second-hand, {{and by the time}} he began to write his history of the campaign there were very few people living who knew anything personally about it. If he had not been a man <b>so</b> entirely <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his own work he would have wondered how any one of my apparent age could give him so much in the way of personal experience; but he seemed to have no suspicions, and, at any rate, asked no questions, and as I had a great desire that this remarkable historical event should be fully recorded, I helped him as much as I could.|$|R

60|$|We were {{up early}} the next morning, as {{we wanted to be}} in Oxford by the afternoon. It is {{surprising}} how early one can get up, when camping out. One does not yearn for “just another five minutes” nearly <b>so</b> much, lying <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a rug on the boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag for a pillow, as one does in a featherbed.

60|$|What that fool Rochez {{was doing}} I could not {{definitely}} ascertain. I {{looked through the}} vasistas of the coach, but could see nothing in pursuit of us.

6000|$|... "I sent {{my son to}} Dr. Randall's," [...] he began, sinking {{his voice}} to a {{confidential}} whisper, [...] "not because he was backward in his studies--for such is not, I believe, the case--but because he has unfortunately inherited a very deplorable taste. I found it out only by accident, {{and it was a}} very great shock to me. Leonard is fond--too fond--of playing cards for money. I thought that at Borden Tower he would have no opportunity for indulging this lamentable weakness; but from what I have recently heard about Dr. Randall, it has occurred to me that he is perhaps a little too much of the student and too little of the schoolmaster. You understand me? I mean that he is perhaps <b>so</b> closely <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his private work, that after the hours which he gives to his pupils for instruction they may secure almost as much liberty as though they were at college." ...|$|R

60|$|There was {{something}} maddeningly incurious about her. He couldn't {{understand why she}} didn't even pause to hear what Georgina had done {{and what he had}} to say about it.

6000|$|The {{courtship}} {{had been}} the more ardent from Fanny's alarm lest the brother should deprive her of Alison; and when she found her fears groundless, she thanked him with such fervour, and talked so eagerly of his sister's excellences that she roused him into a lucid interval, in which he told Colonel Keith that Lady Temple might give him {{an idea of the}} style of woman that Lucy had been. Indeed, Colin began to think that it was as well that he was <b>so</b> well <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> smoke and chemistry, otherwise another might {{have been added to the}} list of Lady Temple's hopeless adorers. The person least satisfied was Tibbie, who could not get over the speediness of the marriage, nor forgive the injury to Miss Williams, [...] "of bringing her hame like any pleughman's wife, wantin' a honeymoon trip, forbye providin' hersel' with weddin' braws conformable. Gin folk tak' sic daft notions aff the English, they'd be mair wise like to bide at hame, an' that's my way o' thinkin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon not," [...] he {{interrupted}} gravely. [...] "I didn't stay long.

6000|$|Two of the {{men were}} talking at the gate, one of them {{carrying}} a spade in hands still crusted with the soil of graves.

But on this occasion I was doomed to disappointment. My two friends were far into the region of generalities. Their profession was forgotten in their electorship. Politics had engulfed the narrower economy of gravedigging. [...] "Na, na," [...] said the one, [...] "ye're a' wrang."

60|$|And now I set {{myself to}} the task of putting as broad a stretch of moor between the prison and myself as the {{remaining}} hours of darkness would allow. Setting my face to the wind once more, I ran until I fell from exhaustion. Then, after five minutes of panting among the heather, I made another start, until again my knees gave way beneath me. I was young and hard, with muscles of steel, and a frame which had been toughened by twelve years of camp and field. Thus I was able to keep up this wild flight for another three hours, during which I still guided myself, you understand, by keeping the wind in my face. At the end of that time I calculated that I had put nearly twenty miles between the prison and myself. Day was about to break, so I crouched down among the heather upon the top of one of those small hills which abound in that country, with the intention of hiding myself until nightfall. It was no new thing for me to sleep in the wind and the rain, <b>so,</b> <b>wrapping</b> myself <b>up</b> <b>in</b> my thick warm cloak, I soon sank into a doze.|$|R
6000|$|As the Broadstone {{carriage}} rolled swiftly {{on there}} was not much conversation between its occupants. To the somewhat sensitive mind of Mrs. Easterfield it seemed that Olive was a little disappointed at the change of companions, but this may have been a mere fancy. The girl was <b>so</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> self-concentrated thought that it was not likely that she would have talked much to any one. Suddenly, however, Olive broke out: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was really}} a fine old man, but <b>so</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his {{scientific}} experiments that he {{paid little attention to}} the world at large, or what was going on around him. He was very learned, but apt to be forgetful to the last degree. He lived alone, and it was reported that he had a goodly sum in the bank. Certainly he never seemed to want for funds, although his mode of living was far from extravagant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, of course! I {{remember}} it well now! Strange how I should forget.

6000|$|So she {{continued}} till she heard Henrietta's approaching steps, when {{she rose and}} opened the door, ready to welcome her with all the affection and consolation in her power. There stood Henrietta, a heavy weight on her eyes, her hair on one side all uncurled and flattened, the colour on half her face much deepened, and a sort of stupor about her whole person, as if but one idea possessed her. Beatrice went up to meet her, and took her candle, asking what account she brought of the patient. [...] "No better," [...] was all the answer, and she sat down making no more detailed answers to all her cousin's questions. She {{would have done the}} same to her grandmamma, or any one else, <b>so</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> was she <b>in</b> her own grief, but this conduct gave more pain to Beatrice than it could have done to any one else, since it kept up the last miserable feeling of being unforgiven. Beatrice let her sit still for some minutes, looking at her all the time with an almost piteous glance of entreaty, of which Henrietta was perfectly unconscious, and then began to beg her to undress, seconding the proposal by beginning to unfasten her dress.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{boatswain}} {{died during}} a storm, <b>so</b> they <b>wrapped</b> him <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a sheet, {{and put him}} in his own sea-chest, and threw him overboard; but they neglected in their hurry-skurry to say prayers over him--and the storm raged and roared louder than ever, and they saw the dead man seated in his chest, with his shroud for a sail, coming hard after the ship; and the sea breaking before him in great sprays like fire, and there they kept scudding day after day and night after night, expecting every moment to go to wreck; and every night they saw the dead boatswain in his sea-chest trying to get up with them, and they heard his whistle above the blasts of wind, and he seemed to send great seas mountain high after them, that would have swamped the ship if they had not put up the dead lights. And so it went on till they lost sight of him in the fogs of Newfoundland, and supposed he had veered ship and stood for Dead Man's Isle. So much for burying a man at sea without saying prayers over him." ...|$|R

"He is an Eskimo," [...] replied Grabantak, with {{a sudden}} air of solemnity in his manner, [...] "whose first forefather came in the far past longtime, from nobody knows where; but this first forefather never had any father or mother. He settled among the Eskimos and taught them many things. He married one of their women, and his sons and daughters were many and strong. Their {{descendants}} inhabit the Great Isle of Flatland at the present day. They are good and strong; great hunters and warriors. The first forefather lived long, till he became white and blind. His power and wisdom lay in a little strange thing which he called `buk.' How it made him strong or wise no one can tell, but so it was. His name was Makitok. When he died he gave buk to his eldest son. It was <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a piece of sealskin. The eldest son had much talk with his father about this mystery-thing, and was heard to speak much about the Kablunets, but the son would never tell what he said. Neither would he unwrap the mystery-thing, for fear that its power might escape. <b>So</b> he <b>wrapped</b> it <b>up</b> <b>in</b> another piece of sealskin, {{and gave it to}} his eldest son, telling him to hand it down from son to son, along with the name Makitok. So buk has grown to be a large bundle now, and no one understands it, but every one has great reverence for it, and the Makitok now in possession is a great mystery-man, very wise; we always consult him on important matters." ...|$|R
