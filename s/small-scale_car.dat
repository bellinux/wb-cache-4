50|$|The {{family of}} Matherson's late wife are <b>small-scale</b> <b>car</b> {{collectors}} {{who happen to}} own a 1959 Edsel, {{in addition to a}} Mustang. The two cars are so old that the EMP did not affect them because they have no modern EMP-sensitive electronics, such as transistors. Another local resident owns a vintage airplane that later becomes very useful, as it too is so old that it has no vulnerable electronics.|$|E
50|$|Russia's largest monotown is Tolyatti, {{which has}} a {{population}} of 700,000. It is home to the large AvtoVAZ factory, which in late 2008 employed 106,000 people. AvtoVAZ is Russia's largest carmaker, accounting for 1% of the country's GDP. As of 2014, the AvtoVAZ is owned by Nissan-Renault, which uses even harsher workforce policies than the previous owner. However, the situation is somewhat aided by widespread of <b>small-scale</b> <b>car</b> parts producers and other small car-oriented enterprises in the region, which are providing many additional workplaces.|$|E

At a time when amusement parks catered almost exclusively to adults, Elitch's Kiddieland was an instant hit attraction with the first of many lucky generations of small fry. Lots of fun stuff for tots, like 2-seat rocket planes, open-wheel race cars, real floating [...] "motorboats", a real <b>small-scale</b> <b>car</b> track with gas station, all in Kid Scale. The floral business side of the park was quite successful, becoming the largest supplier of carnations in the country in the early 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people. In 1828, Ányos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor, created a small model car powered by his new motor. In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport built a similar contraption which operated on a short, circular, electrified track. In 1834, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a <b>small-scale</b> electrical <b>car,</b> powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.|$|R
25|$|In November 1958, Meccano Ltd {{introduced}} the Dublo Dinky range of models in 1:76 OO scale, {{designed to be}} used with the Hornby railway system (Force 1988, pp.165–166). These were relatively cheap to produce – having a one-piece die-cast metal body, a base plate and or windows on some, and plastic wheels. There was the added bonus of being able to compete in the <b>small-scale</b> toy <b>car</b> market which, at the time was dominated by Lesney's Matchbox (see Force 1988, p.47).|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than being}} moulded {{in a single}} piece as for the {{preceding}} A310, the new Alpine's body was moulded in {{a large number of}} small separate panels. This required a major overhaul of the Alpine plant, leaving only the sandblasting machinery intact. The car was also considerably more efficient to manufacture, with the time necessary to build a finished car dropping from 130 to 77 hours - still a long time, but acceptable for a <b>small-scale</b> specialty <b>car.</b> The PRV engine in the naturally aspirated model was identical to the version used in the Renault 25, a 2849 cc unit producing [...] Also available was the smaller (2.5 litres) turbocharged model.|$|R
40|$|During a flood, it {{is often}} not the water itself, which causes heavy damage to people and property. In Nagasaki flood in 1982, flooded cars brought damage to the {{structures}} and lost of lives. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to study car behaviors on flooded roads. In this study, flume experiments were conducted using two types of <b>small-scale</b> model <b>cars.</b> The experimental data obtained for the model cars were used to determine the incipient velocity for flooded cars. We also measured the drag force exerted on the cars in flood roads. The results revealed the relationship between depth and velocity and produced a limit of stability for flooded vehicles. These results can be used as preliminary assessment to define the hazards to cars on flooded roads...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} an embedded nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy for autonomous vehicles under a minimum time objective. The time-optimal control problem is stated in a path-parametric formulation such that existing reliable numerical methods for real-time nonlinear MPC can be used. Building on previous work on timeoptimal driving, we present an approach {{based on a}} sequential quadratic programming type algorithm with online propagation of second order derivatives. As an illustration of our method, we provide closed-loop simulation results based on a vehicle model identified for <b>small-scale</b> electric race <b>cars...</b>|$|R

The Britain family controlled the firm until 1984 {{when it was}} sold to a British conglomerate, Dobson Park Industries. They combined the operations with an existing line of toys and renamed the company Britains Petite, Ltd. (Opie 1993). During {{the first half of}} the 20th century, Britains expanded its range and market. By 1931 the firm employed 450 at its London factory. The catalogue had expanded to 435 sets and twenty million models a year were being produced. (Wallis 1981).In the early 1950s Britains was associated with W. Horton Toys and Games which made the diecast Lilliput ranges of <b>small-scale</b> rather generic <b>cars</b> and trucks and other vehicles. Later, Britains acquired Herald Miniatures, plastic figures designed by Roy Selwyn-Smith. The company was also known for its American Revolutionary War soldiers.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the experience of}} five senior secondary teachers in Palu city, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia who participated in a pilot of Classroom Action Research (CAR) project that held by the Provincial Education Office (locally termed as DIKJAR Provinsi) five years ago. These teachers attended a five-day CAR workshop in 2005 {{and went on to}} conduct a <b>small-scale</b> project of <b>CAR</b> in their own classroom working collaboratively with other teachers in their schools. The main {{purpose of this study was}} consider the benefits and barriers of doing CAR, to understand the nature of support from school principal, colleagues and supervisor that helped the teachers conduct a successful CAR project, to investigate factors that impact on the sustainability of the practice of CAR beyond one pilot over a longer timeframe, and to find out teachers’ perception of how CAR as professional development (PD) programme should be effectively planned and implemented. This study adopted a qualitative case study approach. Purposive sampling was used to select the teachers who participated in the CAR pilot for the study. Data was collected through in-depth interviews, brief semi-structured interviews with a closed-response questionnaire, and the collection of policy documents. Interviews were also held with local DIKJAR staff and one of the workshop instructors who provided documents pertaining to the pilot. The thematic analysis of this data revealed that engaging with CAR impacted on teachers’ teaching practices, teachers’ awareness and better understanding of students’ learning problems, and their role as a teaching professional, and their personal and professional development. Some notable barriers that teachers experienced during their CAR project were insufficient knowledge of CAR concepts, lack of advice, lack of assistance from research project collaborators and a time constraint. The study found teachers were well supported by school principals with administrative help as well as recognition of effort. Colleagues provided support as mentors or giving advice. The study also found 3 of 5 teachers continued CAR approaches in their classroom after their first pilot experience, believing CAR is a path toward their own PD; while the other two gave limited knowledge of CAR as the main reason for the lack of motivation to carry on. This study also found for CAR to be a sustainable practice for teachers, such a PD programme should be designed to fit the teaching background and subject area of participants and provide internal (e. g. school principals, colleagues), and external support (e. g. mentors from teacher educators, teacher trainers, and master teachers) as well as the chance to get recognition of their work. The implication of the study for facilitating teachers to grow professionally through CAR is discussed...|$|R
