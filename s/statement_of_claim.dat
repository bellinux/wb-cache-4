In March 2016, Sukhvir Tehethi, a local taxi driver, filed an injunction against Uber. Toronto's city council amended a bylaw in October 2015 and, according to Tehethi's lawyer, Uber drivers are in violation of it.

25|$|Relationships between Fitzroy and Brisbane were {{strained}} in late 2009, when Brisbane {{announced that}} it was adopting a new logo for season 2010 and beyond, which Fitzroy Football Club believed contravened Section 7.2 c) of the merger agreement. The new logo, a lion's head facing forward, replaced the former Fitzroy logo of a passant lion with a football. On 22 December 2009, Fitzroy lodged a <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Claim</b> with the Supreme Court of Victoria, seeking an order that the Brisbane Lions be restrained from using as its logo, the new logo or any other logo other than 'the Fitzroy lion logo'. On 15 July 2010, the two clubs reached a settlement, agreeing that the Fitzroy logo symbolically represents the historic merger between the Bears and Fitzroy and the first 13 years of the Brisbane Lions competing in the AFL, and that Brisbane would use both the old and new logos alongside each other in an official capacity (e.g. on letterheads, marketing, etc.), with the old logo to be phased out altogether after 2024 (or 2017 {{in the case of the}} Brisbane Lions website). Brisbane will return to using the old logo on its playing guernseys from 2015, but the new logo will remain for corporate purposes.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 2012, Toronto {{officials}} charged Uber with 25 municipal licensing infractions, including {{operation of}} an unlicensed taxi brokerage and unlicensed limousine service. Municipal {{officials said they}} had advised the company to comply with local regulations and that rival taxi dispatch apps had obtained licenses. Despite support from some quarters including mayor John Tory Toronto Police Service launched a crackdown on Uber drivers, and a court hearing is deciding if an injunction to prohibit the service is warranted. In July 2015, a $400M class-action lawsuit was filed against UberX and UberXL in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on behalf of Ontario taxi and limo drivers, brokers, and owners.

A Toronto city councillor warned that passengers using UberX may be fined up to $20,000.

25|$|Yvonne Bédard {{was born}} in the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Brantford {{as a member of the}} Iroquois Nation. On May, 1964, Mrs. Bédard married a non-Indian, begetting two {{children}} with him. Mrs. Bédard and her spouse lived together off the Reserve until June 23, 1970, when they separated. Mrs. Bédard returned with her two children to the Reserve to live in a house bequeathed to her by her mother, Carrie Williams. Since Mrs Bédard had married a non-Indian, she was no longer listed in the Registry as an Indian. When she began to occupy the house on the reserve, the Six Nations Band Council passed a resolution ordering Mrs. Bédard to dispose of the property within the next six months, during which time she could live there. The Council latter adopted two additional resolutions allowing Mrs. Bédard to live in the house for another six months, and then another two months, but no longer than that. In order to act in accordance with the Council's resolutions, Mrs. Bédard eventually transferred ownership of the property to her brother (a registered member of the Band) who was granted a Certificate of Possession of the property on March 15, 1971, by the Minister of Indian Affairs as required by the Indian Act. Mrs. Bédard and her children, with her brother's consent, remained to occupy the premises without rent. On September 15, 1971, the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, requesting the Brantford District Supervisor to serve notice to Mrs. Bédard that she shall quit the Reserve. Mrs. Bédard would later lose her status as an Indian shortly after taking the Six Nations Band Council to Court, slightly before she could deliver her <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> against the Council.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} covered in lurid detail, {{especially}} by the Edmonton Bulletin, which called it [...] "the greatest drama ever {{to be heard in}} an Alberta court". [...] The Bulletin was a Liberal paper, and MacLean had given it an advance copy of his <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim,</b> which allowed MacMillan's allegations to be published and disseminated before the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> was filed. [...] The Bulletin was emphatically sympathetic to MacMillan in its coverage, and printed her detailed testimony (which included the dates and times of specific encounters) almost verbatim. [...] Under the headline [...] "Vivian Testifies to Harrowing Ordeal", it praised the young plaintiff as [...] "bearing up with wonderful fortitude" [...] and facing the ordeal [...] "with courageous mien". [...] Brownlee, in contrast, was a [...] "love-torn, sex crazed victim of passion and jealousy, forcing his will upon her in parked autos and on country highways". [...] The jury was not sequestered and was free to read these accounts. [...] Edmontonians were no less enthralled than their newspaper, and many showed up to the courthouse early on the days of trial, hoping to get a seat. [...] Towards the end of the trial, Ives revoked the Bulletins press privileges at the trial and fined its publisher $300 and a reporter $100 for publishing writing [...] "likely to inflame public opinion and interfere with the even-handed course of justice." ...|$|E

500|$|On September22, MacLean filed a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> before Judge John R. Boyle {{on behalf}} of Allan and Vivian MacMillan.

[...] It alleged that Brownlee, after {{arranging}} for Vivian's move from Edson to Edmonton, had seduced her {{in the fall of}} 1930 when she was eighteen, and had had regular sexual contact with her for a period of three years. [...] Brownlee denied the allegations immediately (and made a rejected offer to resign from the Royal Commission) and on November 13 filed a counter-claim against Vivian MacMillan and John Caldwell, alleging that they had conspired to obtain money through false allegations.|$|E

[...] Upon her arrival, she had become a close friend of the family's. [...] One night Brownlee had told her that because of his wife Florence's ill health, they were unable to have a sexual relationship, and that MacMillan must yield to him to prevent him from resuming a sexual relationship with Florence that would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan had eventually yielded, and the ensuing affair lasted until July 1933. [...] Brownlee denied MacMillan's story completely and counter-sued MacMillan and her fiance, John Caldwell, for conspiracy.|$|E

The analyses showed that Chinese participants tended {{to engage in}} potentially more complex argumentation, whereas U. S. participants tended to utilize proportionally more <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> convergence (agreements, acknowledgments, and concessions).

In addition, <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> convergence were found to be negatively related to measures of persuasion, indicating that such statements do not necessarily indicate true agreements or shifts in opinion. The results are discussed in terms of structuration theory and the socioegocentric model of communication. Argumentation is a pervasive mode of discourse, occurring in face-to-face (FtF), mass-mediated and computer-mediated contexts, and in oral and written discourse. Various definitions of argumentation exist, depending on disciplinary and functional orientations to the study of argument (Voss & Van Dyke, 2001).

This motion, which first brought the whole case under the notice of the public, was strenuously resisted by Mr. James Short, and resulted in the matter being referred to the learned Registrar for his report. On the next motion day this report was presented, and, on its appearing from it that the photography had taken place in his presence and accurately represented the tattoo marks on the lady's shoulders, the Court declined to harass the [...] "will" [...] by ordering her to submit to any further inspection before the trial. It was on this occasion that it transpired that the will was engaged to be married to the plaintiff, a fact at which the Court metaphorically opened its eyes. After this the defendants obtained leave to amend their answer to the plaintiffs <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim.</b> At first they had only pleaded that the testator had not duly executed the alleged will in accordance with the provisions of 1 Vic., cap. 26, sec. 2, and {{that he did not know}} and approve the contents thereof.
