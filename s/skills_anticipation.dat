40|$|Abstract &nbsp; Background and Aim: Measurement of {{reaction}} time and <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> are used widely in therapeutic exercises or sport programs. Improvement of anticipation skill&nbsp; and reaction time in any exercise or activity that need fast and correct reaction time for deciding {{and doing a}} suitable movement, can improve the motor control and its strategies as well as central processing. There {{is a need for}} an easy-to-use program that can run reaction time tasks and <b>anticipation</b> <b>skills</b> with no special experiments. There is no system for objective measurement of above variables in our country, so designing and construction of a system for reaction time test and <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> estimation was carried out. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: A system that consist of software, lap top, LCD and key board was designed. The software of the system had two subsystems for measuring reaction time and estimating <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill.</b> &nbsp; Results: By use of the above equipments, 6 tests of video choice reaction time, audio choice reaction time, video complex choice reaction time, audio complex choice reaction time, high speed <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> and low speed <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> were performed. Structural and content validity of the system was estimated very high. &nbsp; Conclusion: Current system can use in many therapeutic and sport centers simply and provide basic data about motor control strategies.

40|$|Rapid {{economic}} restructuring {{has led to}} the emergence of serious skill gaps in many transition economies. Such changes have been especially pronounced in the countries of the Western Balkans due to the break-up of the former Yugoslavia and the subsequent reorientation of previous patterns of economic activity. Structural unemployment has increased to high levels, yet the education and training systems have failed to adapt to the needs for new skills in service sectors and sectors subject to global technological change. This article investigates the use of various <b>skills</b> <b>anticipation</b> methods to inform education and training policy in the region. It argues that the information on skill gaps gathered through these methods are not being used effectively to address skill mismatch, and that existing supply-led matching policies have failed to meet the challenge of high levels of structural unemployment. An alternative demand-led approach is identified, which relies on more decentralized methods to place effective power and influence in the hands of users, whether employers, employees, job-seekers or discouraged workers. It is suggested that this would provide a more appropriate model for the improvement of workforce skills in the Western Balkan countries...|$|E
40|$|A {{mail survey}} {{designed}} {{to obtain the}} views of New Zealand primary producers on the important management competencies {{was sent to a}} randomly selected sample of 2300 managers in mid-February 2001. The sample was stratified according to region, farm type and area. The response rate was 41. 1 %. Most production units are ‘family farms’ and 92 % employ, including the managers, four or less people. The five most important managerial attributes were: a) keeping up-to-date with {{the current state of the}} property, b) an ability to identify key factors, c) making requirements clearly understood (communication), d) assessing job priorities, e) quickly sorting out new situations. This priority list is very similar to that proposed by a sample from the members of the New Zealand Institute of Primary Industry Management (NZIPIM). Essentially, the important attributes involve observation, introspection (key factors, job priorities) and communication. It should also be noted that other attributes were reasonably highly ranked. Respondents did, therefore, believe a wide range of skills were important. The ranking list was relatively stable when various sub-divisions were created using age, education, gender, managerial style, self-assessed managerial ability, profit objective variations, computer ownership and farm type. This same conclusion applied to all competencies listed below. For the entrepreneurial skills the following list gives the five highest scored competencies: a) understanding deadlines and acting on time, b) an ability to obtain information, c) being able to negotiate the best deal, d) understanding risk and reducing its impact, e) an intuition that gives early warning signs. While not ranked as highly, a factor analysis also showed that learning new <b>skills,</b> <b>anticipation,</b> and a belief that a manager can control many factors are all important components of a kit bag of skills. The most important personal attributes with scores of 6 or more on a 1 to 7 scale, were: a) early observation of important factors, b) an ability to learn from experience, c) developing a good moral character, d) keeping a cool head, e) maintaining a good relationship with bankers and accountants, f) having the confidence to make quick decisions and act, g) obtaining the co-operation of employees and contractors. A three factor correlated grouping of all personal attributes included most of this listed group in factor one. The respondents were also asked to provide information on their managerial style as this could impact on the best training packages, and whether in fact managerial skill can be improved for some styles. A factor analysis of the style components gave the following factors as the main components of style: a) concern for correctness, b) conscientious planning, c) thoughtful creativity, d) enthusiastic communitarian, e) consultative logician, f) benign management. All managers can be grouped according to their rating with respect to each of these factors. A cluster analysis with reasonable numbers in each group gave four relatively distinct clusters. Producers’ objectives may also impact on their interest in managerial training. A factor analysis of a range of scored potential goals or aims structured views into five main objectives: a) making a comfortable living, b) improving the condition of the property, c) ensuring employees enjoy their jobs, d) minimizing pollution, e) maintaining good working conditions. As it turned out a comparison of people with and without a strong sustainable profit motive did not impact on competency groupings or ranking. It was also found that an increasing number of managers use computers with some 55 % ownership and that computer-based managerial training modules were the second choice after locally based tutored training programmes. Given the costs involved, computer-based systems are the most practical. Of all the respondents 71 % said they would make use of training programmes to a greater or lesser extent. Those requesting training tended to be computer owners, female, younger and had a lower score on the self-rated managerial skill question. Finally, a factor analysis of the most highly ranked competencies from all areas clearly indicated there were three summary factors which express the respondents’ views of the important components of good management. These factors embody: a) good skills in selecting and managing people, b) planning and the successful implementation of the plans and in controlling the implementation through skills such as early observation, c) deciding and acting quickly, d) learning from experience. There are, however, many facets to each of the factors indicating improving managerial skill is probably not a simple and quick operation. On the contrary, it will involve dedication, practice and perseverance...|$|E

This article reviews the empirical literature on expert visual anticipation in striking sports since 2012 to determine if it has contributed to advancement of a theoretical model.

Second, an existing model is outlined to present {{what is known about}} the theoretical underpinning of expert visual anticipation. Third, empirical evidence of key factors that contribute to expert visual anticipation are discussed. Moreover, whether <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> can be improved and transferred to different contexts is discussed.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that anticipation {{is one of the best}} determinants of skill in numerous complex and dynamic domains, such as law enforcement, driving, aviation, surgery, and sport (for a review see Ward, Williams, & Hancock, 2006). Likewise, recognition ability has formed the cornerstone of much of the naturalistic decision making literature for the last 3 decades (e. g., Klein, Calderwood, & Clinton-Cirocco, 1986). In this research, we examined whether skill at anticipating the outcome of a dynamic situation would predict recognition skill, over and above domain-general measures of cognitive ability. We expected that domain-general cognition would account for some of the variance in recognition <b>skill,</b> but that <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> would explain additional, unique variance. Counter to our expectations, <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> did not explain significant unique variance.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to apply a comprehensive test battery to young players with a view to distinguishing between elite and sub-elite groups on the basis of performance on test items. Thirty-one (16 elite, 15 sub-elite) young players matched for chronological age (15 ± 16 years) and body size were studied. Test items included anthropometric (n = 15), physiological (n = 8), psychological (n = 3) and soccer-specific skills (n = 2) tests. Variables were split into separate groups according to somatotype, body composition, body size, speed, endurance, performance measures, technical <b>skill,</b> <b>anticipation,</b> anxiety and task and ego orientation for purposes of univariate and multivariate analysis of variance and stepwise discriminant function analysis. The most discriminating of the measures were agility, sprint time, ego orientation and <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill.</b> The elite players were also significantly leaner, possessed more aerobic power (9. 0 ± 1. 7 vs 55. 5 ± 3. 8 ml´kg- 1 ´min- 1) and were more tolerant of fatigue (P < 0. 05). They were also better at dribbling the ball, but not shooting.

30|$|Field-of-study {{mismatch}} is {{responsive to}} the broader labour market context; {{it is not an}} individual outcome or one that results uniquely from workers’ choice. Field saturation is predictive of a higher likelihood of individual field-of-study mismatch. The demand for skills in the labour market is one of the drivers of mismatch: when there are more graduates from a particular field than jobs available in that field, some necessarily need to look elsewhere for a job. Some of these workers may find work in another field for which they are overqualified; others will be adequately matched by their qualifications. The costs of mismatch can be reduced if graduates from saturated fields need not downgrade to jobs with lower qualification requirements or if <b>skill</b> <b>anticipation</b> systems are in place to reduce the likelihood that any given field is highly saturated in the future. Training programmes that recognise skills developed in another field can allow workers from saturated fields to apply their skills to other fields without having to undergo complete training programmes again.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to extend theoretical understanding of transfer of learning by investigating whether expert perceptual <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> transfers to a dissimilar domain. The capability of expert and near-expert rugby players as well as novices to anticipate skill type within rugby (learning sport) was first examined using a temporal occlusion paradigm. Participants watched video footage of an opponent performing rugby skill types that were temporally occluded {{at different points in}} the opponent’s action and then made a written prediction. Thereafter, the capability of participants to transfer their <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> to predict pitch type in baseball (transfer sport) was examined.

Results indicated that expert and near-expert rugby players anticipated significantly better than novices across all occlusion conditions. However, none of the skill groups were able to transfer <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> to predict pitch type in baseball.

40|$|Introduction Measures of domain-specific memory {{have been}} shown to be {{correlated}} with <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> in sport (North et al., 2011). However, the cognitive processes supporting recognition appear to be simpler than those supporting anticipation (North et al., 2011) and may be underpinned by general cognitive abilities, especially in low-skilled performers (Ackerman, 1988). In this paper we hypothesized that domain-general ability would predict domain-specific recognition skill in soccer in a low-skilled sample but that <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> would explain additional unique variance. Methods 58 recreational-level soccer players completed two domain-general tests (i. e., Mental Rotations Test [MRT-A], Peters, et al., 1995; Berlin Numeracy Test [BNT], Cokely et al., 2012), a test of <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> (Online Assessment of Strategic Skill In Soccer [OASSIS], Belling, Suss, & Ward, 2014), and a soccer recognition test. Results The MRT-A (β =. 42, p <. 01) and BNT (β =. 06, p =. 67) predicted recognition skill (R 2 =. 20, F = 6. 72, p <. 01). However, the OASSIS did not explain more variance (R 2 change =. 01, F =. 78, p =. 38). Discussion Only spatial ability significantly predicted recognition performance suggesting that domain-general abilities may be more relevant than <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> at this level. The data partially support Ackerman’s (1988) model—domain-general ability predicted performance but a more central measure of general cognitive ability (i. e., BNT) did not, despite the complexity of the recognition task. Further research should explore the benefit of recognition versus anticipation training for improving perceptual skill...|$|R

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to isolate the differences between inexperienced and experienced drivers in complex scenarios, to design a training program to reduce these differences in both simple and complex scenarios, and then {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the training program in both simple and complex scenarios. The results of Experiment 1 support the hypothesis that drivers with more driving experience will anticipate more possible hazards and will better mitigate hazards by driving slower in the segments of the road where hazards can materialize. Two training protocols, Multi-Skill (MulS) training and Placebo training, were used to train two groups of inexperienced drivers. Multi-Skill training program (MulS) consisted of three PC-based modules, each dedicated to one of the skills, and a driving simulator-based practice drive where users could practice their skills in simple and complex driving scenarios. Both the PC-based and simulator-based training modules were designed using methods that had proven successful in the design of previous training programs for hazard anticipation, hazard mitigation and attention maintenance performance in simple scenarios. The results of Experiment 2 support this hypothesis for two of the three <b>skills,</b> hazard <b>anticipation</b> and hazard mitigation. With respect to hazard anticipation, on average, MulS training increased hazard anticipation performance by 35 percentage points.

40|$|In this thesis, two {{concepts}} concerning conditions of practice were examined for the practice, retention and transfer of perceptual-cognitive <b>skill,</b> specifically <b>anticipation</b> in tennis. First, from the motor skills literature, the contextual interference (CI) effect was investigated {{for the first}} time in perceptual-cognitive skill training. A blocked and random schedule of practice was used to train <b>anticipation</b> <b>skills</b> in tennis using video simulation techniques with transfer of learning assessed using a field-based task. Results showed support for the CI effect in this new domain as random practice had significantly greater response accuracy in the retention test, and significantly reduced decision time in the field-based transfer test, when compared to the blocked group. Subsequently, the underpinning mechanisms of the CI effect were examined focusing on cognitive effort and error processing. Across two experiments results showed that following errors, the random groups exhibited greater cognitive effort compared to errorless trials, whereas the blocked groups showed no difference between errorless and error trials. These results provided an alternative account for the CI effect by suggesting that it is not solely the switching of the tasks during random practice, but the role of error processing in conjunction with the switching tasks that result in greater cognitive effort and the CI effect. Second, the role of contextual information in perceptual-cognitive skills training was examined. Tennis shots were displayed to participants in either a smart-random structure, which showed shots in a tactically relevant manner, or in a random order so that no contextual information was available, just postural cue information. The smart-random structure group showed superior response accuracy in retention and reduced decision time in a field-based transfer test. Results demonstrated the benefits of contextual information for the retention and transfer of perceptual-cognitive skills in tennis.

To corroborate the value of ST to SI in anticipation, an empirical experiment, against and around which this pilot study is propped, was carried out in two locations: Sydney and New York with the participation of three groups of subjects: professional interpreters, simultaneous interpreting beginners and interpreting beginners. While the professional group was made of United Nations interpreters who performed ST from English into French, the two other groups were interpreting students from Macquarie University, Sydney, who performed from English into Chinese. The experiment consisted in comparing the ST renditions by those groups of two texts, excerpted from a speech by President Bush on climate change. One text was given wholly to the subjects, while the second one was externally paced and fed to the subjects in a chunked way. While it appeared difficult to identify clear patterns of anticipation in this specific experiment, this paper offers an insight into a promising methodology allowing a) to observe anticipation in ST; and b) to design teaching tools helping to transfer <b>anticipation</b> <b>skills</b> from ST into SI...|$|R
40|$|Expert {{performers}} in striking sports can hit objects moving {{at high speed}} with incredible precision. Exceptionally well developed <b>anticipation</b> <b>skills</b> are necessary {{to cope with the}} severe constraints on interception. In this paper, we provide a review of the empirical evidence regarding expert interception in striking sports and propose a preliminary model of expert anticipation. Central to the review and the model is the notion that the visual information used to guide the sequential phases of the striking action is systematically different between experts and nonexperts. Knowing the factors that contribute to expert anticipation, and how anticipation may guide skilled performance in striking sports, has practical implications for assessment and training across skill levels...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examined}} 13 skilled, 13 recreational, and 11 novice players' {{awareness of}} the advance visual information {{that they used to}} judge tennis serve direction. Participants viewed video clips of serve actions under 5 conditions of spatial occlusion. The authors assessed participants' awareness by comparing the different groups' confidence associated with correct and incorrect judgments and by conducting a postexperiment free-recall test. The results indicated that information from the ball toss and the arm + racquet region underpinned players' <b>anticipation</b> <b>skill</b> and that greater expertise was accompained by increasing {{awareness of the}} information on which judgments were based. The authors discuss the implications of the present results for researchers' use of confidence ratings to assess awareness in perceptual-judgment tasks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current article is to review {{findings}} from the visual anticipation literature with a particular focus on penalty kick goalkeeping in Association football. We give a brief introduction to the area of research before providing reviews of two recent studies. First, we focus on the applied implications of a study that examined the effect of deception and non-deception penalty kick strategies on goalkeeping performance. Second, we consider further limiting factors on the accuracy of goalkeeper visual anticipation through examination of the relationship between goalkeeper action capabilities and the timing and accuracy of goalkeeper responses. Finally, the implications of the results are considered with recommendations for coaching practices aimed at improving visual <b>anticipation</b> <b>skills...</b>|$|R
