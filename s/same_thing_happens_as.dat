60|$|They fired together, and {{the brand}} {{was seen to}} drop to the ground. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> the other two sparks of light approached; then it was again quiet. Now a score of little lights flashed through the air.|$|R
6000|$|But the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> on {{the night}} before. Just as those Ducks were almost near enough, a gun went [...] "bang, bang," [...] and away went the Ducks. They didn't come back again, and once more a {{disappointed}} hunter went home without any.|$|R
60|$|When {{the king}} had so said, the door opened of itself, and they went in, while the king gnawed his {{moustache}} in anger. Then {{they came to the}} second door, where the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> at the first, and they went in and found the princess.|$|R

50|$|Later, Lacey's husband {{brings in}} the family priest to {{investigate}} the mirror, only to see that when the priest's hand touches the mirror, it suddenly turns red. A piece of the mirror floats {{across the room and}} becomes lodged over Lacey's eye, letting the ghost possess her body. Controlling Lacey's body, the ghost nearly kills her husband and attacks the priest. Before he dies, the priest removes shard from Lacey's eye, releasing her from the ghost's control, and throws it into the kitchen sink, where it bursts into flames as it touches the water. The remainder of the mirror is then thrown into a well, where the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happens,</b> <b>as</b> an explosion releases and destroying the mirror once and for all.|$|E
60|$|The third {{night the}} troll {{of the house}} came, and brought with him six others. Then the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> before, and they beat the Prince with great cudgels as thick as my thumb. At last the morning came, and they went away bellowing and howling, for their enchantment had gone. As for the Prince, he lay upon the floor more dead than alive, for he could neither see nor hear {{anything}} that happened about him.|$|R
50|$|On {{board the}} {{airborne}} second Concorde, Flight 128, {{a crew member}} turns {{on one of the}} inboard engines on the plane. Up in the cockpit, the pilot Captain Scott (Van Johnson) discovers something which <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> with the first attack: loss of power. This is because a henchman puts vials of acid in the food of the flight which breaks upon being heated up and acid breaks through the microwave ovens and severs the electrical lines in the cabin.|$|R
60|$|Following that {{we changed}} places several times, {{in one of}} which R. C. had a strike, but failed to hook the fish. Just {{opposite}} the old wreck on the shore I had another fish take hold, and, upon hooking him, had precisely the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happen</b> <b>as</b> in the first instance. I think the bag of my line, which I could not avoid, allowed the lead to sag down and drag upon the bottom. Of course when it caught the bonefish pulled free.|$|R
60|$|The {{soldiers}} again {{rolled the}} frame in position, having first pulled the Great Knife {{once more to}} the top of the derrick. The immense blade was so heavy that it took the strength of seven Blueskins to raise it. When all was in readiness, the King pulled the cord a second time, and Trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> before. Cap'n Bill rolled away in his frame, and the knife fell harmlessly.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, Little {{was playing}} in a Muskegon factory league when an AAGPBL scout signed her to a contract, as she went to Opa-locka, Florida for spring training. She was {{assigned}} to her home team, Muskegon Lassies, but she was never given enough playing time because already the Lassies had the slick-fielding Sara Reeser at first base. She then was reassigned to the Fort Wayne Daisies the next season and the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>as</b> they used outstanding first sacker Betty Foss. Unable to crack the lineup as a regular, Little {{decided to leave the}} league. In a sixteen-game career, she collected six hits in 47 at-bats for a [...]128 batting average. She also made one pitching appearance.|$|R
50|$|The prince accidentally shot {{an arrow}} into the cage, and the gold-bearded man {{refused to give}} it back unless he freed him. After much pleading, the prince was convinced. The gold-bearded man promised to repay him a thousand-fold and vanished. The prince decided that running away could not be more {{dangerous}} than staying and left. As he went along, he met a wood dove. He {{was on the verge of}} shooting it when it implored him not to because its two children would starve. He spared it, and the dove said that because of his act of mercy it would find a way to repay him. The prince continued on, eventually meeting with a duck and then later a stork. Both times the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> had with the wood dove.|$|R

50|$|In the 2013-14 season, the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in the {{previous}} season, where three coaches led the team in a row. They started the season led by coach Jamal Ali and who resigned because the results were not good, especially after the 2-1 loss to Al-Karkh. Ali won two matches as coach, drew four and lost three, so the club turned {{the leadership of the}} team to his assistant Ammar Hussein, who also did not remain long; he resigned after the 3-0 loss to Al-Zawra'a, and he won three matches, drew four and lost three. The club then appointed coach Hassan Mawla, who finished the season in 11th place, and he led the team for just four matches, winning one, losing one and drawing two, and he could not continue the rest of the matches because of Iraq Football Association suspended the Premier League and considered it finished on June 18, 2014.|$|R
2500|$|Fortuyn was {{compared}} with the politicians Jörg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen in the foreign press. These comparisons were often referred to by Dutch reporters and politicians. An explicit comparison with Le Pen was made by Ad Melkert, then lijsttrekker of the Labour Party, who said in Emmen on 24 April 2002: [...] "If you flirt with Fortuyn, then in the Netherlands the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> will <b>happen</b> <b>as</b> <b>happened</b> in France.

60|$|Next {{evening the}} <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> again, just <b>as</b> before, {{but as the}} woman was going away {{she said in a}} sad tone, 'Two are gone, and one only is left,' and then {{disappeared}} as before. The nurse was still more frightened when she heard the woman say this, and thought that perhaps some danger was hanging over the child, though she had no ill-opinion of the unknown woman, who, indeed, had behaved towards the child as if it were her own. The most mysterious thing was the woman saying 'and only one is left;' but the nurse guessed that this must mean that only one day was left, since she had come for two days already.|$|R
