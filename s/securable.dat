6000|$|A {{charm of}} another sort in Pulci, {{and yet in}} most instances, perhaps, owing {{the best part of}} its charmingness to its being {{connected}} with the same feeling, is his wit. Foscolo, it is true, says it is, in general, more severe than refined; and it is perilous to differ with such a critic on such a point; for much of it, unfortunately, is lost to a foreign reader, in consequence of its dependance on the piquant old Tuscan idiom, and on popular sayings and allusions. Yet I should think it impossible for Pulci in general to be severe at the expense of some more agreeable quality; and I am sure that the portion of his wit most obvious to a foreigner may claim, if not to have originated, at least to have been very like the style of one who was among its declared admirers,--and who was a very polished writer,--Voltaire. It consists in treating an absurdity with an air as if it were none; or {{as if it had been}} a pure matter of course, erroneously mistaken for an absurdity. Thus the good abbot, whose monastery is blockaded by the giants (for the virtue and simplicity of his character must be borne in mind), after observing that the ancient fathers in the desert had not only locusts to eat, but manna, which he has no doubt was rained down on purpose from heaven, laments that the [...] "relishes" [...] provided for himself and his brethren should have consisted of [...] "showers of stones." [...] The stones, while the abbot is speaking, come thundering down, and he exclaims, [...] "For God's sake, knight, come in, for the manna is falling!" [...] This is exactly in the style of the Dictionnaire Philosophique. So when Margutte is asked what he believes in, and says he believes in [...] "neither black nor blue," [...] but in a good capon, [...] "whether roast or boiled," [...] the reader is forcibly reminded of Voltaire's Traveller, Scarmentado, who, when he is desired by the Tartars to declare which of their two parties he is for, the party of the black-mutton or the white-mutton, answers, that the dish is [...] "equally indifferent to him, provided it is tender." [...] Voltaire, however, does injustice to Pulci, when he pretends that in matters of belief he is like himself,--a mere scoffer. The friend of Lucrezia Tornabuoni has evidently the tenderest veneration for all that is good and lovely in the Catholic faith; and whatever liberties he might have allowed himself in professed extravaganzas, when an age without Church-authority encouraged them, and a reverend canon could take part in those (it must be acknowledged) unseemly [...] "high jinks," [...] he never, in the Morgante, when speaking in his own person, and not in that of the worst characters, intimates disrespect towards any opinion which he did not hold to be irrelevant to a right faith. It is observable that his freest expressions are put in the mouth of the giant Margutte, the lowest of these characters, who is an invention of the author's, and a most extraordinary personage. He is the first unmitigated blackguard in fiction, and is the greatest as well as first. Pulci is conjectured, with great probability, to have designed him as a caricature of some real person; for Margutte is a Greek who, in point of morals, has been horribly brought up, and some of the Greek refugees in Italy were greatly disliked for the cynicism of their manners and the grossness of their lives. Margutte is a glutton, a drunkard, a liar, a thief, and a blasphemer. He boasts of having every vice, and no virtue except fidelity; which is meant to reconcile Morgante to his company; but though the latter endures and even likes it for his amusement, he gives him to understand that he looks on his fidelity as only <b>securable</b> by the bastinado, and makes him the subject of his practical jokes. The respectable giant Morgante dies of the bite of a crab, as if to spew on what trivial chances depends the life of the strongest. Margutte laughs himself to death at sight of a monkey putting his boots on and off; as though the good-natured poet meant at once to express his contempt of a merely and grossly anti-serious mode of existence, and his consideration, nevertheless, towards the poor selfish wretch who had had no better training.|$|E

To help address this problem, this paper describes a technique that can be used to model the trust boundaries that are created by <b>securable</b> objects on Windows. Dynamic instrumentation is used to generate object trace logs which describe the contexts in which <b>securable</b> objects are defined, used, and have their security descriptor updated. This information is used to identify the data flows that are permitted by the access rights granted to <b>securable</b> objects.

The work, for resource distribution between <b>securable</b> objects, formulates a task of the two players’ game (a defender and a forward) with the zero-sum. The possible loss of a defender is used as a score. The statement of problem for each player, when holding the other player’s solution, is the task of linear programming with one restriction. For the solution of similar tasks the paper offers a linear programming method. For a defender to search a solution, it is offered to use a saddle-point criterion. If the saddle point is not found, a criterion of the guaranteed result is used. For search of the saddle point, two algorithms are offered. Originally, an optimization algorithm, based on the sequential solution of the optimization tasks by each player, seeks the saddle point. If the first algorithm does not find the saddle point, there is a developed search algorithm of the saddle point based on the support of equal security of some objects of a <b>securable</b> system. For the support of equal security of some objects an offer is to solve a system of linear equations. For algorithm are formulated and proved sufficient conditions that the received solution is the saddle point.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} the gain-scheduled filtering {{problem for a}} class of discrete-time systems with missing measurements, nonlinear disturbances and external stochastic noises. The measurement missing phenomenon is assumed to occur in a random way, and the missing probability is time-varying with <b>securable</b> upper and low bounds that {{can be measured in}} real time. The multiplicative noise is a state-dependent scalar Gaussian white noise sequence with known variance. The addressed gain-scheduled filtering problem is concerned with the design of a filter such that, for the admissible random measurement missing, nonlinear parameters and external noise disturbances, the error dynamics is exponentially mean-square stable. The desired filter is equipped with time-varying gains based primarily on the timevarying missing probability and is therefore less conservative than the traditional filter with fixed gains. It is shown that the filter parameters can be derived in terms of the measurable probability via the semi-definite programme method.
