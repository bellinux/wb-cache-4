40|$|Objective: With {{this study}} we analyse the current European {{legislation}} {{in order to provide}} guidance for regenerative medicine professionals on correct Adipose-derived Stem Cells (ASCs) isolation and use protocols for clinical applications. Materials and Methods: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) considers that ASCs does not fall within the definition of an advanced therapy medicinal product if the cells have not been subjected to a <b>substantial</b> <b>manipulation,</b> and the mode of action of the cells (contribute to and enhance tissue renewal and turnover of the subcutaneous tissue) is considered to be homologous to the donor fat tissue. Results: Collagenase digestion, as well as cell culturing, {{is considered to be a}} <b>substantial</b> <b>manipulation.</b> Only transplantation of a non-manipulated tissue to another location in the same anatomical or histological environment is considered to be homologous. Conclusions: According to these considerations, ASCs should be not-cultured, isolated mechanically and used only in the subcutaneous tissue...|$|E

40|$|In {{repetitive}} work, {{more physical}} variation {{is believed to}} reduce the risk of eventually developing musculoskeletal disorders. We investigated the extent to which workstation designs leading to more variation in upper arm postures during a pick-and-place task influenced outcomes of relevance to musculoskeletal disorder risk, including muscle activity, cardiovascular response, and perceived exertion, measured through the maximal acceptable work pace. Posture variation to the extent obtained in our experiment had only minor effects on these outcomes, and considerably less impact than a moderate change in working height.

40|$|Jury {{members do}} not {{normally}} have {{the privilege of}} a complete, unbiased picture of the case. To {{make the best of}} patently incomplete evidence, they cannot but at least partially rely on their intuition. We provide evidence for this claim based on self-report data as well as more subtle measures of unconscious modifications of the evidence in order to fit the favoured interpretation (coherence shifts). In three experiments we investigated whether members of a mock jury apply standards of proof in a normatively appropriate way, how well they take into account explicitly stated probability information, and which factors influence the size of coherence shifts. We found a mixed pattern of results: manipulation of the standard of proof influences conviction rates in the intended direction, but there are fewer convictions in both standard of proof conditions than normatively expected. When asked to indicate the minimum probability of guilt necessary for conviction, subjects do not sufficiently discriminate between beyond a reasonable doubt 9 ̆ 4 and preponderance of the evidence 9 ̆ 4. Even <b>substantial</b> <b>manipulations</b> of the posterior probability of guilt had very little effect on conviction rates. Reliance on intuitive processes seems to reduce the influence of explicitly stated probabilities. We furthermore found effects of verdict and of the probability manipulation on the size of coherence shifts. We argue that the performance of jury members could be improved by providing them with supplementary information on context, such that they are able to put explicit information on probabilities in perspective...|$|R

40|$|Microstructure {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in determining the properties of crystalline materials 1. A widely used method to influence microstructure is the addition of nucleating agents 1. Observations on films formed from clay–polymer blends indicate that particulate additives,in addition to serving as nucleating agents, may also perturb crystal growth, leading to the formation of irregular dendritic morphologies 2, 3. Here we describe the formation of these ‘dizzy dendrites’using a phase-field theory,in which randomly distributed foreign particle inclusions perturb the crystallization by deflecting the tips of the growing dendrite arms. This mechanism of crystallization, which is verified experimentally, leads to a polycrystalline structure dependent on particle configuration and orientation. Using computer simulations we demonstrate that additives of controlled crystal orientation should allow for a <b>substantial</b> <b>manipulation</b> of the crystallization morphology...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{the profile of the}} tax liability of individual taxpayers in South Africa as well as the impact of tax reform policies since the mid-nineties on the progressivity of their tax liability using a static microsimulation tax model. Using the 2005 / 06 Income and Expenditure survey data from Statistics South Africa, the revenue base had to be determined and aligned to the official figures published by the South African Revenue Services and the National Treasury. This exercise required <b>substantial</b> <b>manipulation</b> of the data but the outcome is surprisingly close to the official R 104 billion compared to the published SARS figure of R 96 billion. The model allows for the dissemination of individual taxpayers by income groups, gender, educational level, age group, etc. Testing for progressivity, the results show that although still more progressive than most other tax structures world-wide, the level of skewness has marginally declined {{over the past few years}} with the share of those in the lower income groups gradually increasing. This phenomenon is also enhanced by relatively more taxpayers entering the tax net at this level. With the top marginal rates already at the current high levels little can be done at the higher end of the scale to expand the revenue base and therefore the solution lies in raising the contribution of those in the lower but especially the middle income groups. As far as gender is concerned, disparities in the labour market require an examination of tax policy that may contribute towards a more equal distribution of individual tax on a gender basis. The results also show that tax policy adjustments that contribute towards the improvement of the quality of education would also be a positive investment for future revenue collection.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: Repetitive light assembly work is associated with an increased risk for developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. More exposure variation, for instance by redesigning the workstation, has been proposed as an effective intervention. Purpose: We investigated the effect of upper arm posture variation in a 1 -hour repetitive pick-and-place task on shoulder muscle activity, heart rate, and perceived exertion, measured on the Borg CR- 10 scale and in terms of maximal acceptable work pace (MAWP). Methods: Thirteen healthy participants performed the task in three workstation designs where the hand was moved either horizontally (H 30 / 30), diagonally (D 20 / 40), or vertically (V 10 / 50), with a mean upper arm elevation of ∼ 30 °. In a fourth design, the hand was moved horizontally at ∼ 50 ° mean arm elevation (H 50 / 50). Results: As intended, upper arm posture variation, measured by the upper arm elevation standard deviation and range of motion, differed between H 30 / 30, D 20 / 40, and V 10 / 50. However, MAWP (10. 7 cycles·min− 1 on average across conditions; determined using a psychophysical approach), mean upper trapezius activity (54 % reference voluntary exertion [RVE]), and heart rate (69 bpm) did not differ between these workstation designs. In H 50 / 50, MAWP was lower (9. 3 cycles·min− 1), while trapezius activity (78 % RVE) and perceived exertion (Borg CR- 10) tended to be higher. Conclusions: Our results indicate that posture variation to the extent achieved in the current experiment leads to less effects on muscle activity and perceived exertion than a moderate change in working height...|$|R
40|$|Despite various {{obstacles}} {{the promise}} of gene therapy {{has begun to be}} realized, as demonstrated by the successful phenotypic correction of X-linked SCID in infants. Although ex vivo gene therapy is advantageous, many diseases, for example, disseminated cancers, require intravascular administration of the gene therapy vector in vivo. In this scenario, the development of sophisticated vectors suitable for targeted intravascular gene delivery is required to both improve efficacy and minimize toxicity. Vectors based on adenovirus (Ad) show immense promise because they are highly efficient in transducing non-dividing cells, can tolerate <b>substantial</b> genetic <b>manipulation</b> (eg, the incorporation of targeting agents), can be produced to high titer, do not integrate into the genome, and have undergone significant investigation in the clinic. However, the use of Ad-based vectors is limited by the inherent hepatic tropism of intravascularly administered Ad, which precludes targeted delivery to alternative organs or disease sites, and by the associated host inflammatory responses to the vector. An improved knowledge of the complex series of interactions is of fundamental importance to the field. This review discusses the current understanding of Ad vector and host interactions, as well as suitable technologies for optimizing delivery to target cells in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen shallow {{lakes in}} The Netherlands were {{subjected}} to biomanipulation, i. e. drastic reduction of the fish stock, {{for the purpose of}} lake restoration. The morphology and the nutrient level of the lakes differed, as did the measures applied. In some lakes biomanipulation was accompanied by reduction of the phosphorus loading. In all but two lakes, the Secchi disk transparency increased after the fish removal. Eight lakes (no phosphorus loading reduction, except for one lake) showed a strong and quick response to the measures: the bottom of the lake became visible (‘lake bottom view’) and there was a massive development of submerged macrophytes. In eight other lakes the water transparency increased, but lake bottom view was not obtained. In the biomanipulated lakes the decrease in total phosphorus and chlorophyll a and the increase in Secchi disk transparency were significantly stronger than the general trend occurring in Dutch lakes where no measures had been taken. The improvement in the Secchi depth and chlorophyll a was also stronger than in lakes where only the phosphorus load was reduced. The critical factor for obtaining clear water was the extent of the fish reduction in winter. Significant effects were observed only after> 75 % fish reduction. Success seems to require <b>substantial</b> fish <b>manipulation.</b> In such strongly biomanipulated lakes, wind resuspension of the sediment never prevented the water from becoming clear.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to promote a broad and {{flexible}} perspective on ecological restoration of Southwestern (U. S.) ponderosa pine forests. Ponderosa pine forests in the region have been radically altered by Euro-American land uses, including livestock grazing, fire suppression, and logging. Dense thickets of young trees now abound, old-growth and biodiversity have declined, and human and ecological communities are increasingly vulnerable to destructive crown fires. A consensus has emerged that it is urgent to restore more natural conditions to these forests. Efforts to restore Southwestern forests will require extensive projects employing varying combinations of young-tree thinning and reintroduction of low-intensity fires. Treatments must be flexible enough to recognize and accommodate: high levels of natural heterogeneity; dynamic ecosystems; wildlife and other biodiversity considerations; scientific uncertainty; and the challenges of on-the-ground implementation. Ecological restoration should reset ecosystem trends toward an envelope of “natural variability,” including the reestablishment of natural processes. Reconstructed historic reference conditions are best used as general guides rather than rigid restoration prescriptions. In the long term, the best way to align forest conditions to track ongoing climate changes is to restore fire, which naturally correlates with current climate. Some stands need <b>substantial</b> structural <b>manipulation</b> (thinning) before fire can safely be reintroduced. In other areas, such as large wilderness and roadless areas, fire alone may suffice as the main tool of ecological restoration, recreating the natural interaction of structure and process. Impatience, overreaction to crown fire risks, extractive economics, or hubris could lead to widespread application of highly intrusive treatments that may further damage forest ecosystems. Investments in research and monitoring of restoration treatments are essential to refine restoration methods. We support the development and implementation of a diverse range of scientifically viable restoration approaches in these forests, suggest principles for ecologically sound restoration that immediately reduce crown fire risk and incrementally return natural variability and resilience to Southwestern forests, and present ecological perspectives on several forest restoration approaches...|$|R

In eight other lakes the water transparency increased, but lake bottom view was not obtained. In the biomanipulated lakes the decrease in total phosphorus and chlorophyll aand the increase in Secchi disk transparency were significantly stronger than the general trend occurring in Dutch lakes where no measures had been taken. The improvement in the Secchi depth and chlorophyll awas also stronger than in lakes where only the phosphorus load was reduced. The critical factor for obtaining clear water was the extent of the fish reduction in winter. Significant effects were observed only after > 75 % fish reduction. Success seems to require <b>substantial</b> fish <b>manipulation.</b> In such strongly biomanipulated lakes, wind resuspension of the sediment never prevented the water from becoming clear. No conclusion can be drawn with respect to the possible negative impact of cyanobacteria or Neomysison grazing by Daphniaand consequently on water clarity. In all lakes where there had been a high density of cyanobacteria or years with a high density of Neomysisother factors such as insufficient fishery may explain why lake bottom view was not obtained. In all lakes with additional phosphorus loading reduction the fish stock has been reduced less drastically (15 – 60 %). In these lakes the effects on transparency were less pronounced than in the lakes with > 75 % fish removal. Daphniagrazing seems responsible for spring clearing in all clear lakes but one. In three lakes the reduction of benthivorous fish also increased the transparency. The factors that determine water clarity in summer are less obvious. In most clear lakes a low algal biomass coincided with a macrophyte coverage of more than 25 % of the lake surface area. However, it was not clear what mechanism caused the low algal biomass in summer, although inorganic nitrogen concentrations were regularly found to be very low. Daphniagrazing in open water seemed to be of little importance for suppressing the algal biomass in summer. Although in most lakes the total phosphorus concentration decreased after the biomanipulation, the dissolved phosphorus concentration remained too high to cause phosphorus limitation of the algal growth. In four out of six clear lakes for which there are long-term data the transparency decreased again after 4 years. In one lake with lower nutrient levels the Secchi disk transparency increased over the years. However, the number of lakes with low nutrient levels is too small for conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of nutrient levels on the stability of the clear water state...|$|R
