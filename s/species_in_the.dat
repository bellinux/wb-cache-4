5|$|In 2006, Latiolais {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} a cladogram (tree of descent) {{that attempts to}} show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 <b>species</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Strombus (including Strombus canarium) and three <b>species</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> allied genus Lambis. The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny Strombus canarium, Strombus vittatus (a synonym for Doxander vittatus) and Strombus epidromis (Labiostrombus epidromis) are closely related, and appear to share a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all <b>species</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but {{will attempt to}} climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other <b>species</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala.

However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia <b>species</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
