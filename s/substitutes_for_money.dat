60|$|After {{experience}} {{had shown that}} pieces of paper, of no intrinsic value, by merely bearing upon them the written profession of being equivalent to {{a certain number of}} francs, dollars, or pounds, could be made to circulate as such, and to produce all the benefit to the issuers which could have been produced by the coins which they purported to represent, governments began to {{think that it would be}} a happy device if they could appropriate to themselves this benefit, free from the condition to which individuals issuing such paper <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> were subject, of giving, when required, for the sign, the thing signified. They determined to try whether they could not emancipate themselves from this unpleasant obligation, and make a piece of paper issued by them pass for a pound, by merely calling it a pound, and consenting to receive it in payment of the taxes.|$|E
60|$|It is chiefly in {{the latter}} form [promissory notes] that it has become, in {{commercial}} countries, an express occupation to issue such <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money.</b> Dealers in money wish to lend, not their capital merely, but their credit, and not only such portion of their credit as consists of funds actually deposited with them, but their power of obtaining credit from the public generally, so far as {{they think they can}} safely employ it. This is done in a very convenient manner by lending their own promissory notes payable to bearer on demand—the borrower being willing to accept these as so much money, because the credit of the lender makes other people willingly receive them on the same footing, in purchases or other payments. These notes, therefore, perform all the functions of currency, and render an equivalent amount of money, which was previously in circulation, unnecessary. As, however, being payable on demand, they may be at any time returned on the issuer, and money demanded for them, he must, on pain of bankruptcy, keep by him as much money as will enable him to meet any claims of that sort which can be expected to occur within the time necessary for providing himself with more; and prudence also requires that he should not attempt to issue notes beyond the amount which experience shows can remain in circulation without being presented for payment.|$|E
60|$|The same effects {{which would}} thus {{arise from the}} {{discovery}} of a treasure accompany the process by which bank-notes, {{or any of the other}} <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money,</b> take the place of the precious metals. Suppose(282) that the United States possessed a currency, wholly metallic, of $200,000,000, and that suddenly $200,000,000 of bank-notes were sent into circulation. If these were issued by bankers, they would be employed in loans, or in the purchase of securities, and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest, which would probably send a great part of the $200,000,000 of gold out of the country as capital, to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere, before there had been time for any action on prices. But we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers, or money-lenders of any kind, but by manufacturers, in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials, or by the Government [as, e.g., greenbacks] in its ordinary expenses, so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities. The following would be the natural order of consequences: All prices would rise greatly. Exportation would almost cease; importation would be prodigiously stimulated. A great balance of payments would become due, the exchanges would turn against the United States, to the full extent of the cost of exporting money; and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth, over the various countries of the world, in the order of their proximity, geographically and commercially, to the United States.|$|E

Frank Fisher of MIT predicted in the 80s that such a currency [...] "would lead to the kind of distortion of market forces which had crippled Russia's economy." [...] It is precisely the non-commercial, not-for-profit, noncontractual, and non-monetary value of time dollars which exempts them from taxation in the United States; were they {{to be used as a}} <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>money,</b> they would simply be another form of exchange.|$|R

In particular, they are lower than in previous papers, suggesting that economies of scales in the demand <b>for</b> <b>money</b> are even bigger than formerly thought.

In the first model, matured bonds circulate in the goods market as perfect <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> and there are a continuum of stationary equilibria of this sort. In the second model, matured bonds do not circulate in the goods market and there is a unique stationary equilibrium.

40|$|U. S. {{velocity}} of base money exhibits three distinct trends since 1950. After rising steadily for thirty years, it flattens {{out in the}} 1980 s and falls substantially in the 1990 s. This paper explores whether the observed secular movements in velocity can be accounted for exclusively by endogenous responses to changing expectations about monetary and fiscal policy. We use a model with two key features: a <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> in transactions {{and an array of}} assets that includes money, nominal bonds, and physical capital. The model maps policy expectations into portfolio decisions, making equilibrium velocity a function of expected future money growth, tax rates, and government spending. When expectations are estimated using Bayesian updating, simulated velocity matches the trends in actual velocity surprisingly well.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{exchange rate}} rules in {{their role as}} macroeconomic instruments. Two quite different approaches are pursued. The traditional view is that exchange rate flexibility is a <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> wage flexibility so that managed money and managed exchange rates yield the necessary instruments for internal and external balance. An entirely different perspective is offered by the modern macro-economics of wage contracting and the long run trade-off between the stability of output and the stability of inflation. In this context it is shown that exchange rate policies that seek to maintain real exchange rates or competitiveness do stabilize output but do so {{at the cost of}} in-creased inflation instability. Exchange rate rules such as full purchasing power parity crawling pegs are the analogue of full monetary accommodation of price disturbances. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} money plays an {{important}} role in the assessment of the efficacy of monetary policy. Prior to the early 1970 s, there was a consensus among the empirical literature that a stable {{demand for money}} function existed. During the early 1970 s, most empirical studies indicated that the demand for money had shifted about in an unpredictable manner, making the assessment of the efficacy of monetary policy hazardous. This thesis investigates the causes of the instability of the demand for money by going back to first fundamentals of the theory of the demand for money. Two main possible causes are identified, viz: financial innovation, and frequent changes in taxation regimes. With regard to financial innovation, which may take on the form of lower transaction costs, improved cash-management techniques and the increased proliferation of new <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money,</b> the following propositions are made: that a change in transactions costs affects the demand for money, and that improved cash-management techniques and new <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> will lead to increased interest-elasticities for the demand for money. The use of divisia monetary aggregates as a possible replacement for simple-sum aggregates is also considered. With regard to frequent changes in taxation regimes, the theoretical relationship between expected inflation and interest rates as embodied in the Fisher hypothesis is analysed. Two neoclassical monetary growth models are discussed in which each model has a different method of capital financing by the firm, viz: all-debt, and debt-equity financing. The Fisher hypothesis is then refined to take into account the different features of each taxation regime. Whilst the original Fisher hypothesis predicts that the nominal interest rate will adjust pari passau in response to expected inflation, the refined hypothesis predicts that nominal interest rates will adjust by more than the expected rate of inflation. The refined Fisher hypothesis is then incorporated into the steady-state demand for money, and it is suggested that frequent changes in taxation regimes can lead to the instability of the steady-state demand for money...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{many economists}} {{have argued that}} money is a buffer stock held solely for transactions. On this {{interpretation}} there can be deviations between desired and actual money balances because of lags in adjustment {{to changes in the}} desired volume of transactions or changes in interest rates. But each of the writers in this tradition denies the existence of an asset demand for money and for this reason, denies that money {{is a part of the}} desired portfolio of assets and that wealth influences the demand for real money balances. In defense of this mew, many cite the conclusions of James Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s justly famous paper on liquidity preference, namely: In a world with close <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> such as time deposits, money is 2 ̆ 2 dominated 2 ̆ 2 by other assets that are said to have all of the properties of money and to have the additional property or advantage of bearing interest.

40|$|We {{know little}} about the {{processes}} by which we evaluate the opportunity to look at another person. We propose that behavioural economics provides a powerful approach to understanding this basic aspect of social attention. We hypothesized that the decision process culminating in attention to another person follows the same economic principles that govern choices about rewards such as food, drinks and money. Specifically, such rewards are discounted {{as a function of}} time, are tradable for other rewards, and reinforce work. Behavioural and neurobiological evidence suggests that looking at other people can also be described as rewarding, but to what extent these economic principles apply to social orienting remains unknown. Here, we show that the opportunity to view pictures of the opposite sex is discounted by delay to viewing, <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> and reinforces work. The reward value of photos of the opposite sex varied with physical attractiveness and was greater in men, suggesting differential utility of acquiring visual information about the opposite sex in men and women. Together, these results demonstrate that choosing whom to look at follows a general set of economic principles, implicating shared neural mechanisms in both social and non-social decision making...|$|E

It is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of money—the natural and average prices of commodities—are not in question here. These are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals. An ounce of gold or silver will in the long run exchange for as much of every other commodity as can be produced or imported at the same cost with itself. And an order, or note of hand, or bill payable at sight, for an ounce of gold, while the credit of the giver is unimpaired, is worth neither more nor less than the gold itself.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze how {{interest}} rates, output and welfare {{depend on the}} liquidity of nominal bonds. The model features limited participation in the bonds market and decentral-ized exchanges (search) in the goods market. In a fraction of trades in the goods market, a legal restriction forbids the use of bonds as the means of payments. I show that nominal bonds can become illiquid endogenously when tastes are strong for the goods in the restricted trades. When such tastes are not very strong, bonds are liquid and the yield curve is nega-tively sloped, but bonds {{may or may not}} be perfect <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money.</b> As the coverage of the legal restriction increases, welfare first decreases and then increases, but eliminating the legal restriction altogether increases welfare. I also compare economies with exogenous degrees of bonds ’ liquidity. Completely illiquid bonds can yield higher welfare and higher nominal interest rates than liquid bonds. However, between two economies in which bonds have interior degrees of liquidity, it is possible that welfare is higher when bonds are more liquid, that welfare is higher when the nominal interest rate is lower, and that the interest rate is higher when bonds are more liquid...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{critique of}} the "real bills " doctrine argues that the price level may be unstable in a monetary regime without a central bank and a market-determined money supply. Hong Kong's experience sug-gests this problem may not arise in a small open economy. In our century, it is generally assumed that mone-tary control exerted by central banks is necessary to prevent excessive money creation and to achieve price stability. More recently, in the 1970 s, this assumption is evident in policymakers ' concern that financial innovations have eroded monetary con-trols. In particular, the proliferation of market-created <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> not directly {{under the control of}} monetary authorities has led Phillip Cagan (1979) to argue for regulatory reform: New financial developments may make the past degree of monetary control increasingly more difficult to maintain. Yet pursuit of national policies to restrain inflation and sta-bilize economic activity appears impossible without effective monetary controls. The creation of a regulatory environment in which the erosion of monetary controls is kept to a minimum is particularly important in the present period of rampant inflation. While this statement reflects the mainstream view today, it has not always been obvious that the government, rather than the market, should deter-mine the money supply. A market-determined money supply is traditionally associated with the long discredited "real bills " doctrine. This doctrin...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to relate {{policies of the}} Central Bank with {{the behavior of the}} money market. The money market is defined as the short-term financial market covering instruments that are close <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>money.</b> By convention, only instruments with a maturity of less than sixty days are analyzed although data for instruments with longer maturities are presented. Based on the observation of the abovementioned performance measures, it can be generally concluded that regulations prior to 1981 produced a less efficient but more stable market. During the liberalization period, the behavior of the money markets was significantly affected by the Dewey Dee crisis in 1981 and the balance-of-payments (BOP) crisis in 1983 which led to the 1984 - 1985 recession. Since data on the money market for 1981 were not provided by the Central Bank, the assessment of key events focuses only on the effect of the BOP crisis. The Central Bank's main policy instruments during the crisis were the controversial "Jobo" bills which carried artificially high interest rates to arrest capital outflows. Stability in the monetary system was achieved but at the expense of operating efficiency. Transactions in the money market instruments, excluding Treasury bills and interbank call loans, declined rapidly during the period 1983 -' 85 and have since not recovered. 'Hiis paper, thus, clearly points out the trade-off between operating efficiency, on one hand, and stability, on the other...|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} asserted that monetary and fiscal policy {{may have to}} be coordinated if they are to provide a nominal anchor and avoid the pathological outcomes of sunspots or explosive price paths. In this paper, we study a model in which government bonds are an imperfect <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>money</b> in the transactions technology, providing a new channel for debt dynamics to feed into inflation dynamics. This modification of an otherwise standard NNS model substantially alters the conditions for local determinacy and the requirements for macroeconomic policy coordination: the Taylor Principle is no longer sacrosanct; a weak fiscal response to debt is no longer the panacea for a weak monetary policy; sunspot equilibria may be less relevant than previously thought; and the need for coordination may be less than previously thought. In addition, our model provides a new way of thinking about the structural break that is thought to have occurred around 1980 in monetary policy and in the dynamics of government spending and private consumption.
