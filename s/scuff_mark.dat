50|$|The {{ballistic}} {{model is}} also detailed, {{taking into account}} drag coefficient properties, muzzle velocity, and mass of each individual type of ammunition. The game engine considers the physical details of all rounds in flight and at point of impact, calculating the angle of impact and energy of the round, and the thickness and slope of the target vehicle's armor. Rounds which manage to penetrate may go on to cause damage to components or crew members {{in the path of}} penetration. High energy rounds that do not fully penetrate may still cause spall (high velocity metal fragments) within the vehicle, if close enough to penetration. Rounds that penetrate a vehicle will usually leave a visible hole on the outside, while rounds that don't penetrate may leave a <b>scuff</b> <b>mark</b> where the round bounced off. Small arms fire will also often leave bullet holes or scuff marks on buildings or vehicles.|$|E
40|$|A ball-on-plate (both {{consisting}} of hardened M- 50 steel) sliding elastohydrodynamic contact was run with trimethylolpropane triheptanoate (TMPTH) {{with and without}} tricresyl phosphate (TCP). The contact area of the plate was optically profiled with a phase-locked interference microscope (PLIM) {{both before and after}} exposure to alcoholic hydrochloric acid. As scuffing was approached, the profile within the contact region changed more rapidly after the acid treatment; after scuffing, it assumed a constant high value. A metallurgical phase found in the <b>scuff</b> <b>mark</b> was apparently responsible for the high reactivity. The microscopic profile changes (sensitivity, + or - 3 nm (+ or - A) in depth) involved primarily the small asperities (radius, 3 microns); the larger ones were unaffected. Soaking the steel in TCP smoothed the fine structure of the surface profile but increased its reactivity toward alcoholic hydrochloric acid before sliding was started. Thus it would appear that PLIM examination could be used for screening potentially scuff-resistant materials...|$|E

40|$|An {{electronic}} optical {{laser interferometer}} capable of resolving depth differences of {{as low as}} 30 A and planar displacements of 6000 A was constructed to examine surface profiles of bearing surfaces without physical contact. Topological chemical reactivity was determined by applying a drop of dilute alcoholic hydrochloric acid and measuring {{the profile of the}} solid surface before and after application of this probe. Scuffed bearing surfaces reacted much faster than virgin ones but that bearing surfaces exposed to lubricants containing an organic chloride reacted much more slowly. The reactivity of stainless steel plates, heated in a nitrogen atmosphere to different temperatures, were examined later at ambient temperature. The change of surface contour {{as a result of the}} probe reaction followed Arrhenius-type relation with respect to heat treatment temperature. The contact area of the plate of a ball/plate sliding elastohydrodynamic contact run on trimethylopropane triheptanoate with or without additives was optically profiled periodically. As scuffing was approached, the change of profile within the contact region changed much more rapidly by the acid probe and assumed a constant high value after scuffing.

50|$|Skid marks {{will vary}} {{depending}} on whether the car uses ABS or not. If not, there will be two lines. The darker marks on the outside are from the front wheels, while the back tires leave thinner marks. This is because the force exerted on them makes the wheels take on a conical shape. If the car uses ABS, the marks will be much fainter as less heat is produced by the release-stop mechanism of ABS. <b>Scuff</b> <b>marks</b> may be visible however with ABS.|$|R

25|$|The CAB {{investigated}} the accident, {{and as the}} wreckage pieces were reassembled and scrutinized, {{it became apparent that}} a critical 5/16 inch AN-175-21 nickel steel bolt was missing in the elevator boost linkage mechanism. By carefully examining and analyzing the various <b>scuff</b> <b>marks</b> and grease patterns near the missing bolt, the CAB investigators concluded that the bolt had fallen out prior to the aircraft's disintegration and collision with the ground, and not {{as a result of the}} accident itself. Without the bolt in place, the elevator (when in boost mode) and hence the entire aircraft would become uncontrollable, leading the investigators to deduce that the bolt had fallen out, most likely by working itself loose, a short time prior to the beginning of the accident sequence.|$|R

30|$|In this computer-centric {{world we}} now live in, Schaller, {{who has spent}} over fifty years {{conducting}} fieldwork and promoting wildlife conservation throughout the world, understands the value {{of time spent in}} the field: ‘I console myself that natural history remains the cornerstone of conservation, that it must be learned on the ground, asking questions, observing, listening, taking notes, getting the boots muddy. Technology helps to open the world but technology can also close it unless one learns directly from nature.’ The following passage about the snow leopard is an interesting example of his passion for understanding wild animals and the mountains they live in and the fieldwork that is necessary: ‘I examined each scat with special interest. A sniff gave an idea of its freshness. Picked apart, the hair and bone fragments reveal what the cat had eaten. Long, curved incisors and tan, black-tipped hairs are from marmot, brittle grayish hair from blue sheep, or curly white wool from domestic sheep, to mention just three. Sometimes I stumbled on a kill, wild or domestic. I recorded species, sex, approximate age, and physical condition, and saved the lower jaw for determining age at death more precisely from the tooth wear. <b>Scuff</b> <b>marks</b> and tracks gave an indication of how the animal was ambushed, and tooth and claw marks show how it was killed. Was the body warm? How much had been eaten?’ The ability to ask these kinds of questions comes from lots of time spent in the field. Schaller also has an uncanny ability to synthesize arcane bits of zoological data into easily understood facts about Tibetan wildlife and their habitats, greatly improving the reader’s understanding of the ecology of the Roof of the World.|$|R
40|$|The gears in a {{transmission}} are lubricated {{to prevent their}} premature failure {{as a result of}} pitting and wear on the tooth surfaces. Furthermore, the lubricant also limits the rise in surface temperature of the gears, which could otherwise lead to failure as a result of scuffing. The purpose of this thesis was to construct a fairly realistic theoretical lubrication model for spur and helical gears, the primary output parameters of this model being film thickness and flash temperatures, which would help in the identification of areas on the gear tooth surface prone to the aforementioned modes of failure. This thesis was carried out at the Gear Technology group in Scania CV AB in collaboration with the department of machine design at KTH. Gear lubrication is tricky as it entails the determination of parameters such as loads, curvatures, and velocities; which are different along the entire surface of the gear tooth. Primarily the loads are hard to obtain as they are dynamic in nature; the load is shared between different pairs of teeth during motion. The calculation of velocities and curvatures in an area of the gear surface called the tip relief can also not be done in a straightforward manner. These issues were simplified to a large extent with the assistance of a program called Helical 3 D; owing to its powerful contact analysis algorithm, values of the film thickness and flash temperatures could be determined in almost every region where contact occurred between the gear teeth. The results of the lubrication model showed a reduction in film thickness in the tip relief area of the gear tooth surface; which meant that there were higher chances for the incidence of pitting and wear in this region. This was later confirmed when photographs from experimental tests illustrated a pitting line in the tip relief region of the helical gear. It was also inferred from the model that the occurrence of pitting could be greatly reduced if a quadratic tip relief modification were applied when compared to the existing linear modification used at Scania. Another important conclusion drawn was that thermal effects contributed to a significant decrease in the film thickness. Furthermore, the model showed higher flash temperatures close to the tip of the gear tooth surface, and photographs from experiments conducted showed the prescence of <b>scuffing</b> <b>marks</b> there...|$|R
40|$|Gears are {{important}} mechanical components for power transmissions. Tooth wear {{is one of}} the most common failure modes, which can present throughout a gear’s lifetime. It is significant to accurately monitor gear wear progression in order to take timely predictive maintenances. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is an effective and non-intrusive approach which is able to monitor faults from both electrical and mechanical systems. However, little research has been reported in monitoring the gear wear and estimating its severity based on MCSA. This paper presents a novel gear wear monitoring method through a modulation signal bispectrum based motor current signal analysis (MSB-MCSA). For a steady gear transmission, it is inevitable to exist load and speed oscillations due to various errors including wears. These oscillations can induce small modulations in the current signals of the driving motor. MSB is particularly effective in characterising such small modulation signals. Based on these understandings, the monitoring process was implemented based on the current signals from a run-to-failure test of an industrial two stages helical gearbox under a moderate accelerated fatigue process. At the initial operation of the test, MSB analysis results showed that the peak values at the bifrequencies of gear rotations and the power supply can be effective monitoring features for identifying faulty gears and wear severity as they exhibit agreeable changes with gear loads. A monotonically increasing trend established by these features allows a clear indication of the gear wear progression. The dismantle inspection at 477 hours of operation, made when one of the monitored features is about 123 % higher than its baseline, has found that there are severe <b>scuffing</b> wear <b>marks</b> on a number of tooth surfaces on the driving gear, showing that the gear endures a gradual wear process during its long test operation. Therefore, it is affirmed that the MSB-MSCA approach proposed is reliable and accurate for monitoring gear wear deterioration...|$|R
5000|$|In the Douglas hospital, as {{he helped}} to {{question}} the convalescing evangelist, Assistant Deputy District Attorney Joseph Ryan enthusiastically professed his faith in McPherson's story. He even said he could make the desert trip without <b>scuffing</b> or <b>marking</b> his commissary shoes. Later, in Los Angeles, Ryan testified though, he knew McPherson was a [...] "fake and a hypocrite" [...] {{the first time he}} saw her in the hospital. Ryan was assistant to District Attorney Asa Keyes, and essentially did much of the legwork in building the case against McPherson. The defense contended both Ryan and his father-in-law, Captain Herman Cline, neglected their duty by disregarding evidence unearthed by border authorities that substantiated the evangelist’s version of her re-appearance. The declaration by W. A. Gabrielson, chief of police of Monterey, said that [...] "Mr. Ryan's conduct of this case was most unethical" [...] referring to the methods Ryan used, among them entering the cottage in Carmel-by-the-Sea; without a warrant, and without any local official present. Of particular interest among the seized pieces of evidence was a medicine bottle; because it was dated May 25, 1926 and inside the timeframe Ormiston and [...] "Miss X" [...] occupied the cottage. Again without warrant, demands were then made of the druggist and prescribing doctor about the medicine's user. [...] As it turned out, the bottle belonged to the landlord, H. C. Benedict, and contained a [...] "commonplace preparation." [...] Keyes, thought all the evidence obtained at Carmel-by-the-Sea was too vague for a successful prosecution for perjury and was ready to quit the case. Ryan met with his superior Prosecutor Keyes and presented his [...] "ace in the hole evidence" [...] for continuance at Carmel-by-the-Sea. What Ryan offered was in the form of a receipt for a telegram said by him to be in McPherson's handwriting, signed by her at the Carmel cottage with two related witness identifications.|$|R
2500|$|Bob Willis {{opened the}} bowling {{with a stiff}} breeze behind him, but Peter Lever found it too much going into the wind and Mike Hendrick (2/64) {{replaced}} him after one over. Hendrick got Wally Edwards to mis-hook a short ball to a tumbling Dennis Amiss. At the other end Ian Redpath was backing away to leg to avoid Willis's bouncers, but exposed his off-stump and was yorked for 5, leaving Australia 10/2. The Chappell brothers recovered the innings with a stand of 100 runs in 155 minutes with Denness rotating his bowlers every four overs so they could rest. Ian Chappell was out of form and took 97 minutes to make 11 runs, but after lunch the fast bowlers were replaced by Tony Greig, who suffered as the brothers took advantage of his poor length. In {{the end it was}} Derek Underwood who dismissed Greg Chappell for 58 with the best ball of the day, a leg-spinner which clipped the edge of his bat and was taken by Keith Fletcher at slip. The Australian captain started arguing with Greig as the lanky bowler's footmarks were in line with the stumps and obliterating Chappell's block <b>mark.</b> Greig kept <b>scuffing</b> the block <b>mark</b> to even the ground so he would not trip and Chappell kept re-marking his block until they looked like schoolboys kicking dirt at each other. Chappell built up another partnership of 87 with Ross Edwards until the captain reached 90, decided to attack the bowling in the last hour of play and hooked Willis (4/56) into the hands of Greig, soon followed by Doug Walters who hooked him to Lever. Edwards was caught behind by another deadly delivery from Underwood (2/54) and 197/3 became 205/6 and 216/6 at stumps. The overnight batsmen Rod Marsh and Terry Jenner had to face Willis with the new ball and Jenner mis-hooked him to square-leg, where Lever ran 22 yards to take the catch. Marsh was beaten by Hendrick's swing and was caught by Denness to leave Australia 228/8 and in real trouble when they were saved by a wagging tail. The 6'4" [...] Max Walker started swinging the bat for 41 not out and added 29 with Dennis Lillee, who fell over trying to hook a medium-paced bouncer from Greig (1/70) and gloved the ball to the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, who had missed a chance off Walker at 242/8. After Lillee had given Greig a few words of discouragement and walked off Jeff Thomson hit 23 and added 52 runs for the last wicket until he was run out by a brilliant pick up and throw from the England captain and Australia were all out for 309.|$|R
