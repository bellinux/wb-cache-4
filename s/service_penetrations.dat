50|$|Passive {{house is}} {{designed}} so {{that most of the}} air exchange with exterior is done by controlled ventilation through a heat-exchanger in order to minimize heat loss (or gain, depending on climate), so uncontrolled air leaks are best avoided. Another reason is the passive house standard makes extensive use of insulation which usually requires a careful management of moisture and dew points. This is achieved through air barriers, careful sealing of every construction joint in the building envelope, and sealing of all <b>service</b> <b>penetrations.</b>|$|E
50|$|Buildings {{designed}} with sustainable architecture principles use airtight technologies to conserve energy. Under low energy building, passive house, low-energy house, self-sufficient homes, zero energy building, and superinsulation standards, structures {{must be more}} air-tight than previously. Air barriers, careful sealing of construction joints and <b>service</b> <b>penetrations</b> (holes for pipes, etc.) achieve this. Airtightness minimizes the amount of warm (or cool) air that can pass through the structure, so the mechanical ventilation system can recover the heat before discharging air externally. Green buildings may include windows that combine triple-pane insulated glazing with argon or krypton gas to reduce thermal conductivity and increase efficiency. In landscape and exterior construction projects, airtight seals protect general service and landscape lighting electrical connections and splices. Many other specific applications must meet airtight standards to be waterproof or vapor-proof for human safety and proper function.|$|E
50|$|Interior {{retrofits}} {{are possible}} where the owner wants {{to preserve the}} old exterior siding, or where setback requirements don't leave space for an exterior retrofit. Sealing the air barrier is more difficult and the thermal insulation continuity compromised (because of the many partition, floor, and <b>service</b> <b>penetrations),</b> the original wall assembly is rendered colder in cold weather (and hence more prone to condensation and slower to dry), occupants are exposed to major disruptions, and the house is left with less interior space. Another approach {{is to use the}} 1/3 to 2/3 method mentioned above â€” that is, to install a vapor retarder {{on the inside of the}} existing wall (if there isn't one there already) and add insulation and support structure to the inside. This way, utilities (power, telephone, cable, and plumbing) can be added in this new wall space without penetrating the air barrier. Polyethylene vapor barriers are risky except in very cold climates, because they limit the wall's ability to dry to the interior. This approach also limits the amount of interior insulation that can be added to a rather small amount (e.g., only R6 can be added to a 2x4 R12 wall).|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” Enhanced UMTS traffic {{generation}} and activity models are described and characterised, based on population and <b>service</b> <b>penetration</b> values. An offices scenario was defined with {{a selection of}} relevant applications. ON/OFF states have been characterised by appropriate statistical distributions, and parameters for source traffic modelling have been presented. In the office scenario, if the cell radius decreases {{and the number of}} BSs increases, the blocking probability decreases with a linear trend. One concludes that the supported traffic and the corresponding throughput significantly increase when the cell radius decreases. However, increasing system capacity by decreasing the cell radius, causes an increase in the intensity of handovers and a decrease in the throughput per BS. Hence, optimum values for the coverage distance will correspond to higher cell radius. Delay and delay variation are not a limitation. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} whether a natural level of non-penetration exists, and if so, what the maximum attainable penetration rate is. Universal <b>service</b> <b>penetration</b> levels have steadily {{increased over the}} last decade. This paper hypothesizes that penetration levels will level off over time at some point below 100 %. Econometric models have been created to estimate penetration rates {{as a function of}} several explanatory variables, including per capita personal income, price changes for residential local service, price changes for toll services, and the existence of lifeline programs. The modeling results also provide information on cross-elasticities between toll and local service and the effects of the FCC's subscriber line charges and lifeline programs on the universal service policy goal. In summary, this research provides new information on the topic of what constitutes universal service and provides considerable data regarding own-price and cross-price elasticities associated with residential local service. ...|$|R

Furthermore, we find that MFIs are spatially clustered and identify three main reasons for this: common attraction factors i. e. the characteristics of one area place fits to the preferences of all MFIs so that they are all located in the same areas; payoff externalities to be collocated; and herd behaviour, i. e.

Most importantly, we find that a significant part of this herding process is rational, i. e. early locations of MFIs convey information used by later ones such that it reverses or neutralizes the negative impact of uncertainty resulting then in more locations in needier areas. Since it allows them to be located in poorer areas, MFIs improve the achievement of their social goal.

40|$|Cellular service {{diffusion}} {{has been}} widely explained using classic diffusion modeling which uses the accumulated number of subscriptions or possession of active SIM cards -often known as the cellular phone penetration rate- as the proxy. Such approach tends to overlook the presence of cellular service multiple-subscriptions {{as well as the}} problematic inaccuracies of cellular <b>service</b> <b>penetration</b> rate as the proxy. As an alternative, the present study explains the diffusion of cellular service using multiple ownerships diffusion models with longitudinal cross-section data as the proxy. Based on curve-fit estimation of the model using data obtained from nation-wide survey during 2002 - 2010, this study found that diffusion of cellular service with single subscriptions have higher innovation coefficient but lower imitation coefficient than one with multiple subscriptions. This indicates that the nature of demand for additional subscriptions may be different than that for first subscriptions and therefore the trend of growth should be estimated separately. Further, the multiple-unit ownership diffusion modeling offers more advantages than classic diffusion modeling as it can indicate the percentage of cellular service non-adopters in a population which can be estimated by examining the trend of cellular service adopters with single subscriptions to the population trend. The model also has a more intuitive forecasting power as it also distinguishes the growth trend projection for each type of adopters...|$|R

We model dynamic conditional correlations and volatility spillovers between these assets. Our {{results indicate that}} spot gold {{can be an effective}} hedge against stock prices. A $ 1 long position in the NIFTY Financial Services index can be hedged for 12 cents with a short position in spot gold and a $ 1 long position in the NIFTY Information Technology index can be hedged for 5 cents with a short position in spot gold. Gold also seems to act as a safe haven asset during the Global Financial Crisis period between 2007 and 2009. Our results suggest that crisis or not a prudent investor should allocate around 30 per cent of her investable assets in gold within a gold/stock portfolio. Given that in India around 41 % of the population is still without access to banking services and are hence deprived of interest-earning deposits, it is not very surprising to find goldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s optimal portfolio weight to be as high as 30 per cent.

However, compared with the rest of the world, the region has still lagged behind. Yet this could change fairly rapidly as more countries adopt liberalization polices and good governance that would attract FDI and expand the markets.

Using the Norton-Bass and Islam-Meade models, it plots annual mobile <b>service</b> <b>penetration</b> rate data from the year 1956 to 2010 to explain the pattern of mobile telephone service diffusion. The results show that only Norton-Bass model could achieve convergence status in the program iteration. The model fit indicates that Norton-Bass model is still reasonably good for explaining the intergenerational diffusion process. The results also show that the coefficient of innovation p has a lower value than the coefficient of imitation q. This suggests that the diffusion process is affected more by external factors,ã€€such as word of mouth, than by inherent innovativeness of users. Furthermore, the results also indicate that each type of technology has a different market potential with the later technology having higher market potential then the previous. This {{suggests that there is}} a positive intergenerational effect on the adoptionã€€decision from the proportion already adopted. Furthermore, the study also recognizes that the intergenerational process of mobile communication technology diffusion is comparable to the evolutionary process of technology {{in the sense that the}} process shows two main evolutionary features, i. e. the emergence of technology variation across generation and the selection process from earlier generation of technology to the new one.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an econometric study {{of information and}} communication technology (ICT) in all 70, 000 rural villages in Thailand, where the ICT considered consists of fixed-line telephone service, mobile telephone service, public telephones, computers, and Internet service. The results may provide information that helps policymakers decide where to put limited resources to promote ICT, and helps profit-seeking ICT companies target regions that maximize revenues. The study found that education {{is far more important}} than income in predicting the percentage of households who adopt ICT services, and that some unexpected variables such as the penetration of pickup trucks are useful predictors as well. Even in areas where fixed-line phone service is available, 70 % of households with computers choose not to become Internet subscribers, although many presumably have enough money and technical knowledge. By separating availability from penetration of ICT, the study found that they can have different predictors, which means that researchers who do not separate them may get misleading results. There is no evidence showing mobile telephone service as a substitute for fixed-line telephone service. Also, public telephone service had little or no impact as a substitute for fixed-line or mobile telephone service, so phone companies need not fear that deployment of more public telephones will decrease their subscribership. Finally, there appears to be significant unmet demand for telephone service in rural Thailand where the infrastructure does not yet exist.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades {{electricity}} sectors in both developed and developing countries have been subject to restructuring to introduce private capital and increase competition. This has been accompanied by the introduction of new regulatory regimes. Although the effects of such reforms in a number of the developed economies are now well documented, apart from a few case studies, the experience of developing countries is much less well researched. This is important because privatisation, competition and the reform of state regulation are key themes in donor aid programmes, notably of the World Bank. This paper provides an econometric assessment of the effects of privatisation, competition and regulation on the performance of the electricity generation industry using panel data for 51 developing countries, over the period 1985 to 2000. The study identifies the impact of these reforms on generating capacity, electricity generated, labour productivity in the generating sector, capacity utilisation and industrial and residential user prices. The paper concludes that competition appears to bring about favourable results for <b>service</b> <b>penetration,</b> capacity expansion, labour efficiency and prices to industrial users. The effect of privatisation and having an independent regulator, separately, is statistically insignificant except in the case of capacity utilisation and privatisation; while the co-existence of these two reforms does seem to be correlated with greater electricity availability, more generation capacity and higher labour productivity. The main policy conclusions are that on their own privatisation and regulation do not lead to obvious gains in economic performance. When privatising electricity under conditions of monopoly, emphasis should be placed on implementing [...] ...|$|R
40|$|National Computerization Agency The {{past decade}} has seen phenomenal growth of mobile service in Korea. Growth in mobile {{services}} began to spurt in the late 1990 s when all the other {{sectors of the economy}} were suffering the effects of financial crises and undergoing a painful restructuring process. Mobile infrastructure facilitated the fast flow of information among workers and investors and helped the economy to get over turmoil by reducing coordination costs among those economic agents. Both the fixed and mobile networks seemed to reinforce each other at the early stages of mobile development, working as vehicles for telecom development in Korea. By the mid 1990 s, fixed line penetration in Korea had already reached a very high level by OECD standards, centering at around 45 percent of total population. Mobile <b>service</b> <b>penetration</b> expanded far beyond fixed line penetration reaching 67. 5 percent at the end of year 2002. Along with these developments and great technological achievements in data transmission and fixed-mobile convergence, many important questions arose regarding substitutability and integration between fixed and mobile services {{and the role of the}} fixed network in the development of the telecom sector as a whole. Empirical analyses of access to networks have so far suggested complementarity between the stock of fixed lines and mobile subscribers and strong substitutability between new fixed-line and mobile subscribers. However, without further information on substitution and complementarity between the services themselves, it would be difficult to assess the economic impact of changes in mobile technology and regulatory responses in Korea. In fact the rapid development of fixed-mobile convergence and internet business created a new area of competition for both fixed an...|$|R
