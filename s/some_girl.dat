500|$|Around early 1809 Austen's brother Edward {{offered his}} mother and sisters a more settled life – {{the use of a}} large cottage in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate, Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family's move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna {{described}} the family's life in Chawton as [...] "a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching <b>some</b> <b>girl</b> or boy to read or write." ...|$|E

500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like <b>some</b> <b>girl</b> who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E

[...] From Deathwish Inc.'s official website:Word from various members of <b>Some</b> <b>Girls</b> {{is that they have}} officially and quietly put the band to rest. <b>Some</b> <b>Girls</b> released music on Deathwish, 31G, and lastly Epitaph Records. The band also toured with the likes of Daughters, The Locust, Converge, and many more during their short life.|$|R

2500|$|In effect, Frege invented axiomatic {{predicate}} logic, {{in large}} part thanks to his invention of quantified variables, which eventually became ubiquitous in mathematics and logic, and which solved the problem of multiple generality. Previous logic had dealt with the logical constants and, or, if... then..., not, and some and all, but iterations of these operations, especially [...] "some" [...] and [...] "all", were little understood: even the distinction between a sentence like [...] "every boy loves some girl" [...] and [...] "some girl is loved by every boy" [...] could be represented only very artificially, whereas Frege's formalism had no difficulty expressing the different readings of [...] "every boy loves <b>some</b> <b>girl</b> who loves some boy who loves some girl" [...] and similar sentences, in complete parallel with his treatment of, say, [...] "every boy is foolish".|$|E
2500|$|Though {{her speech}} {{was met with}} much praise from the media, on August 17, it was {{announced}} that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting [...] "homosexual propaganda" [...] which was against the law, and allegedly [...] "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" [...] at the concert. According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, [...] "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So we will speak in the language of money...maybe someone does not see the link but after Madonna's concert maybe some boy becomes gay, <b>some</b> <b>girl</b> becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders—for me it causes moral suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2016, {{an unnamed}} woman {{who wrote that}} {{she was married to}} Gafni from 1999 to 2004 {{published}} an opinion piece in The Times of Israel in response to a New York Times article about Gafni the preceding week. She catalogued what she described as her [...] "story of abuse" [...] and wrote that she had gone public to [...] "Protect <b>some</b> <b>girl.</b> Protect some woman. Some student. Some unsuspecting soul." [...] Within two weeks, Sara Kabakov revealed in The Forward that she was the formerly unnamed teenage girl who had been abused by Gafni in the early 1980s, beginning when she was thirteen years old. Gafni commented, [...] "she was 14 going on 35, and I never forced her." [...] In a subsequent article, The Forward published Gafni's response together with the analysis of sexual abuse experts. Gafni included polygraph results to support his claim that his relationship with Kabakov was consensual.|$|E

2500|$|Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos {{described}} in a 1990 article in the LA Times how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a [...] "landing station" [...] on the planet Venus, where the thetan is re-implanted and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, [...] "capsule" [...] it, and {{send it back to}} Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, [...] "If you can get out of that, and through that, and wander around through the cities and find <b>some</b> <b>girl</b> who looks like she is going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you're all set. And if you can find the maternity ward to a hospital or something, you're OK. And you just eventually just pick up a baby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tha Carter III {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on 26 reviews. AllMusic editor David Jeffries praised Wayne's [...] "entertaining wordplay {{and plenty of}} well-executed, left-field ideas". The Guardians Alex Macpherson lauded Wayne's rapping, stating [...] "Just {{trying to keep up}} with Wayne's mind as he proves the case is a thrill. He breaks language down into building blocks for new metaphors, exploiting every possible semantic and phonetic loophole for humour and yanking pop culture references into startling new contexts". Jonah Weiner of Blender called it [...] "a weird, gripping triumph". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen commended its themes and stated [...] "This isn't a mixtape, it's a suite of songs, paced and sequenced for maxaqimum [...] impact." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Wayne [...] "has clearly worked to make Tha Carter III a statement of its own: one that moves beyond standard hip-hop boasting (though there's plenty of that) to thoughts that can be introspective or gleefully unhinged". Pitchforks Ryan Dombal stated, [...] "he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau noted that [...] "every track attends to detail" [...] and quipped, [...] "From the start you know this is no mixtape because it's clearer and more forceful." [...] Uncut stated that [...] "the prince of hip-hop gets a blessing from the king." [...] Mosi Reeves of Paste gave it a favorable review and noted that the album [...] "hearkens to when rap meant rapp: Isaac Hayes talking for days about <b>some</b> <b>girl</b> he broke with, or Bobby Womack signifying while strumming a blues guitar." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called Lil Wayne [...] "the man of the moment, but the disc's best moments strive for timelessness and attain it." ...|$|E
