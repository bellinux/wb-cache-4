50|$|In {{intelligent}} networks (IN) and cellular networks, <b>service</b> <b>layer</b> is a conceptual layer within a {{network service provider}} architecture. It aims at providing middleware that serves third-party value-added services and applications at a higher application layer. The <b>service</b> <b>layer</b> provides capability servers owned by a telecommunication network service provider, accessed through open and secure Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) by application layer servers owned by third-party content providers. The <b>service</b> <b>layer</b> also provides an interface to core networks at a lower resource layer. The lower layers may also be named control layer and transport layer (the transport layer is {{also referred to as}} the access layer in some architectures).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} three-layer {{workflow}} concept framework to realize workflow enactment flexibility by dynamically binding activities to their implementations at run time. A <b>service</b> mediating <b>layer</b> {{is added to}} bridge business process definition and its implementation. Based on this framework, we propose an extended workflow management systems architecture, in which <b>service</b> contracting <b>layer,</b> <b>service</b> binding <b>layer</b> and <b>service</b> invocation <b>layer</b> are extensions to support the proposed service mediating concept. According to an enactment specification, different instances of the same activity can be bound to different services to achieve enactment flexibility. The conceptual framework and architecture together provide a comprehensive approach to flexible service enactment in B 2 B collaborative settings...|$|R

50|$|The MOST {{specification}} {{defines the}} physical and the data link layer {{as well as all}} seven layers of the ISO/OSI-Model of data communication. Standardized interfaces simplify the MOST protocol integration in multimedia devices.For the system developer, MOST is primarily a protocol definition. It provides the user with a standardized interface (API) to access device functionality.The communication functionality is provided by driver software known as MOST Network Services. MOST Network <b>Services</b> include Basic <b>Layer</b> System <b>Services</b> (<b>Layer</b> 3, 4, 5) and Application Socket <b>Services</b> (<b>Layer</b> 6). They process the MOST protocol between a MOST Network Interface Controller (NIC), which is based on the physical layer, and the API (Layer 7).|$|R

It provides more complex access paths, mappings, particular extensions for special data models, that are represented in the Storage <b>Services</b> <b>Layer.</b> Moreover, it is responsible for sorting record sets, navigating through logical record structures, making joins, and similar higher-level operations. This layer represents a key factor to database performance.

50|$|Symbian has a {{microkernel}} architecture, {{which means}} that the minimum necessary is within the kernel to maximise robustness, availability and responsiveness.
