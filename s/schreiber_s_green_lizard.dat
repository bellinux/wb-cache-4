40|$|Based on {{the results}} of field {{investigations}} carried out in 1994 – 2008 period, the author established the general distributional patterns {{in the northern part of}} the Dobrogean mainland of three lizard species. The Sand Lizards (Lacerta agilis) populates habitats with linear shape, the species being present along river valleys and some roads. The Balkan <b>Green</b> <b>Lizards</b> (L. trilineata) and the <b>Green</b> <b>Lizards</b> (L. viridis) were recorded mostly nearby or inside the forests (or plantations). In case of L. trilineata and L. viridis there is quite obvious the spatial segregation: in areas where the two species were present, the Balkan <b>Green</b> <b>Lizard</b> (L. trilineata) occurs mostly at lower altitudes, meanwhile the <b>Green</b> <b>Lizard</b> (L. viridis) was more frequently present at higher altitudes...|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} lizard {{species can}} be found at the great pasture of Hajúbagos. These are the balkan or crimean wall lizard (Podarcis taurica), the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and the <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta viridis). All of them are protected by law in Hungary but while sand <b>lizard</b> and <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> is common all over the country, the amount of the balkan wall lizard is decreasing. The main cause of this regrettable possession is the habitat degradation and thus habitat loss. Namely balkan wall lizard not only prefers but suffers open sand grasslands and these kinds of habitats are disappearing in Hungary. Due to the fact that the extensive animal grazing lost its importance, open sand pastures started to change, succession can be realized. Thus grass closing constantly what is favourable for sand <b>lizard</b> and <b>green</b> <b>lizard.</b> Furthermore sand lizard and balkan wall lizard share roughly the same food source and moreover <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> could possibly pass into a predator of balkan wall lizard juveniles also. Therefore sand <b>lizard</b> and <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> became competitors (or predators) of balkan wall lizard and the proportion of the three species compared to each other is changing. My aim is to examine the vegetation change and simultaneously monitor the amount of the mentioned three lizard species. After all I would like to make a well established proposal on the management of protected grasslands...|$|R

40|$|In spite that chemoreception is {{important}} in sexual selection for many animals, such as reptiles, the mechanisms that confer reliability to chemical signals are relatively unknown. European <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> (Lacerta viridis) have substantial amounts of α-tocopherol ( = vitamin E) in their femoral secretions. Because vitamin E is metabolically important and can only be attained from the diet, its secretion {{is assumed to be}} costly. However, its role in intraspecific communication is unknown. Here, we experimentally show that male European <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> that received a dietary supplement of vitamin E increased proportions of vitamin E in their femoral secretions. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that females preferred to use areas scent marked by males with experimentally increased vitamin E levels in their secretions. Finally, female preferences were stronger when vitamin E differences between a pair of males' secretions were larger. Our results demonstrate that female <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> are able to discriminate between males based on the vitamin E content of the males' femoral secretions. We suggest that the possible cost of allocating vitamin E to secretions, which might be dependent on male quality, may be a mechanism that confers reliability to scent marks of <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> and allows their evolution as sexual signals...|$|R

40|$|In Europe, spirochetes {{within the}} Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex are {{transmitted}} by Ixodes ricinus ticks. Specific associations are described between reservoir hosts and individual genospecies. We focused on <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta viridis) as a host for ticks and potential host for borreliae. In 2004 and 2005, {{a total of}} 146 <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> infested by ticks were captured, and 469 I. ricinus ticks were removed. Borrelial infection was detected in 16. 6 % of ticks from lizards. Of 102 skin biopsy specimens collected from lizards, 18. 6 % tested positive. The most frequently detected genospecies was B. lusitaniae (77. 9 %- 94. 7 %). More than 19 % of questing I. ricinus collected in areas where lizards were sampled tested positive for borreliae. B. garinii was the dominant species, and B. lusitaniae represented 11. 1 %. The presence of B. lusitaniae in skin biopsy specimens and in ticks that had fed on <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> implicates this species in the transmission cycle of B. lusitaniae...|$|R
50|$|In January 2006, <b>Green</b> <b>Lizard</b> {{released}} {{their third}} full-length album, called Las Armas Del Silencio.

The first single, One Minute, was released before the album and is a split EP with the Belgian Punk band Janez Dedt. Both contribute two songs (the other <b>Green</b> <b>Lizard</b> song being All You Have). On May 5 the album was released in Europe and in 2007 the record was released in the United States.

40|$|European <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta viridis) is {{critically}} endangered species. Bohemian populations are usually isolated and with lower degree of genetical variability, which {{gives them a}} higher degree of vulnerability. Isolated populations are interesting because animals often live there under ultimate possible life conditions for given species, usually in original environment. For the sake of an effective protection of the species morfological, ethological and ecological data are necessary, as well as comparisions between populations of this character, so we studied {{from this point of view}} given population of European <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> and conclusions and comparisions were made...|$|R
