60|$|Roger Wildrake, {{by making}} himself an auditor of the debate, {{contrived}} to augment its violence. He took, of course, a most decided {{part in a}} question, the merits of which were totally unknown to him. Somewhat overawed by Holdenough's ready oratory and learning, the cavalier watched with a face of anxiety the countenance of Dr. Rochecliffe; but {{when he saw the}} proud eye and <b>steady</b> <b>bearing</b> of the Episcopal champion, and heard him answer Greek with Greek, and Hebrew with Hebrew, Wildrake backed his arguments as he closed them, with a stout rap upon the bench, and an exulting laugh {{in the face of the}} antagonist. It was with some difficulty that Sir Henry and Colonel Everard, having at length and reluctantly interfered, prevailed on the two alienated friends to adjourn their dispute, removing at the same time to a distance, and regarding each other with looks in which old friendship appeared to have totally given way to mutual animosity.|$|E

50|$|The bridges are of ashlar masonry, and {{are strong}} and {{substantially}} constructed, except one which carries the turnpike road from Edinburgh to Ayr over the line. The railway is {{here on the}} level of the natural surface, and the bridge is wholly elevated. The abutments have been insufficient of themselves to sustain the arch which has spread; so that the piers, which were originally plumb, are six inches wider at the top than {{at the level of the}} ground, and the joints of the arch were opened. The abutments do not rest against solid material, but are backed with peat dug from the adjoining moss, which, when thrown up and drained of its moisture, becomes light an offers no resistance to the thrust. This bridge, however, appears to have settled down to a <b>steady</b> <b>bearing,</b> as the soffit of the arch had been pointed with cement on the 15th April last, since which time there has been no further yielding. I examined it very carefully, having got on the roof of a carriage, and passed very slowly along it, and I could not perceive any crack or defect in the pointing, so that I do not apprehend any danger; but I intimated to the directors that it would be necessary to strengthen the abutments, and to remove the peat by small portions at a time, supplying its place with earth, gravel, or other heavy and resisting material, well rammed, and immediate attention was promised to it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} part of a single {{assembly}} including its clutch and gearbox. This assembly was held at three points in [...] "live rubber" [...] with a <b>steadying</b> <b>bearing</b> forward of the flywheel. Suspension was by long semi-elliptic springs at each corner of the car controlled by Luvax shock absorbers combined with a front (anti-roll) torsion bar. The chassis was mounted on large section tyres. Spare wheel and tyre were stowed in a separate compartment below the luggage locker. Permanent hydraulic jacks were built into the chassis. Both springs and frame pass beneath the back axle.|$|R
60|$|The {{first use}} which the {{lieutenant}} made of his authority--even before giving directions for the burial--was {{to order the}} cords of the prisoners to be cut. Then the corps continued its march and, by the brightened faces of the men, it could be seen easily enough how unpopular their late commander had been; and that they cherished but slight animosity against the slayer. In a short time they struck up one of their marching songs and--prisoners as they were--the Barclays could not but admire the <b>steady,</b> martial <b>bearing</b> of the men, as they strode along, making the woods echo with the deep chorus.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The fluid-solid {{coupling}} {{analysis of}} the nonlinear rotor-bearing system with labyrinth seal was presented. The dynamic equations of rotor-bearing system were built up by combining d’Alemdert principle with Rize way, then the nonlinear oil film forces based on <b>steady</b> short <b>bearing</b> model, unbalanced excitation forces and gas excitation forces calculated by FLUENT could be coupled to system. Such nonlinear equations were numerically solved by Newmark integration method. The dynamics and the representation characteristics were investigated {{through a lot of}} numerical calculations, then the occurrence and development mechanism of the different coupling faults revealed {{based on the results of}} numerical calculation. The severity and mutation of some faults were also studied...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the {{progress in the}} first eight months of the project. The objectives of this research project are to theoretically predict the steady operating conditions and the rotor dynamic coefficients of gas foil journal bearings. The project is currently on or ahead of schedule with the development of a finite element code that predicts <b>steady</b> <b>bearing</b> performance characteristics such as film thickness, pressure, load, and drag. Graphical results for a typical bearing are presented in the report. Project plans for the next year are discussed...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 92 This lecture {{discusses}} how {{the vibration}} characteristics and eccentricity measurements were combined with rotordynamic analyses {{to help improve}} the reliability of a turbine generator unit. It also explains certain vibration characteristics at partial load conditions that resulted in changes of the bearing load magnitude and direction. The measurements of a stable backward whirl orbit at certain load conditions will be shown and discussed. The rotordynamic analyses also simulated field balancing measurements that compared well with the synchronous response calculations. These analyses were also {{used to examine the}} benefits of retrofitting a <b>steady</b> <b>bearing</b> at the unsupported shaft pump extension...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 11 Testing of an API Standard 610 [1] {{bearing frame}} inline pump at pumpage {{temperatures}} up to 650 degrees F is presented. The thermal response throughout the pump, and {{specifically in the}} bearing frame area, is quantified. <b>Steady</b> state <b>bearing</b> operating temperatures are measured for various lubrication options and cooling configurations. The experimental results are used to correlate an analytical thermal model previously developed to analyze response of an API 610 horizontal overhung process pump. The predictive capability of the model for bearing frame inline pumps is described. Conclusions are developed regarding lubrication and cooling requirements for bearing frame inline pumps to meet the operating temperatures required in refinery processing units...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{those old}} ships, {{one of the}} {{frequent}} faults is that the exhaust temperature of marine diesel generator is too high. This fault may lead exhaust pipe to be burned red, outlet valve to be burned down, piston and piston ring to be melted, and many other troubles. In this paper, aiming at the reason of fault of NO. 1 marine auxiliary diesel engine exhaust pipe burned red while running without load, the author analyzes the every possible causes of the malfunction, finds out the real causation of high exhaust temperature is <b>steady</b> ball <b>bearing</b> of timing gear partial wears seriously. Then, the writer expounds elimination process and solutions, and proposes some suggestions about operation and maintenance in the end...|$|R
40|$|Foil journal {{bearings}} {{consist of a}} compliant metal shell or foil which supports a rigid journal {{by means of a}} fluid film. Foil bearings are considered to be a potential alternative to rolling element or traditional rigid surface bearings in cryogenic turbomachinery applications. The prediction of foil bearing performance requires the coupled solution of the foil deflection and the fluid flow in the bearing clearance between the rotor and the foil. The investigations being conducted in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Penn State are focused in three areas: theoretical prediction of <b>steady</b> state <b>bearing</b> performance, modeling of the dynamic bearing characteristics to determine performance in rotor systems, and experimental verification of analysis codes. The current status and results from these efforts will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The present {{theoretical}} {{analysis is}} {{to investigate the}} effect of nonNewtonian Pseudoplastic & Dilatant lubricants (lubricant blended with viscosity index improver) –Rabinowitsch fluid model on the dynamic stiffness and damping characteristics of pivoted curved slider bearings. The modified Reynolds equation has been obtained for steady and damping states of the bearing. To analyze the steady state characteristics and dynamic characteristics, small perturbation theory has been adopted. The results for the <b>steady</b> state <b>bearing</b> performance characteristics (<b>steady</b> state film pressure, load carrying capacity and centre of pressure) as well as dynamic stiffness and damping characteristics have been calculated numerically for various values of viscosity index improver using Mathematical 7. 0 and it is concluded that these characteristics vary significantly with the non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid consistent with the real nature of the problem...|$|R
40|$|SRS and NASA/MSFC have {{developed}} software with unique capabilities to couple bearing kinematic modeling with high fidelity thermal modeling. The core thermomechanical modeling software {{was developed by}} SRS {{and others in the}} late 1980 's and early 1990 's under various different contractual efforts. SRS originally developed software that enabled SHABERTH (Shaft Bearing Thermal Model) and SINDA (Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer) to exchange data and autonomously allowing bearing component temperature effects to propagate into the <b>steady</b> state <b>bearing</b> mechanical model. A separate contract was issued in 1990 to create a personal computer version of the software. At that time SRS performed major improvements to the code. Both SHABERTH and SINDA were independently ported to the PC and compiled. SRS them integrated the two programs into a single program that was named SINSHA. This was a major code improvement...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} journal bearing lubricated with couple stress fluids considering {{the effects of a}} layer adhered to bearing surface. The modified classical Reynold’s equation is derived considering the effects of surface layer and couple stress fluids. In the present study, the effects of couple stresses on the <b>steady</b> state journal <b>bearing</b> performance characteristics are analyzed based on Stokes micro-continuum theory. The Reynold’s boundary conditions are used in the analysis. Results of non-dimensional load capacity and coefficient of friction are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{performance}} of a finite length journal bearing, taking into account effects of non-Newtonian Rabinowitsch flow rheology and elastic deformations of the bearing liner. According to the Rabinowitsch fluid model, the cubic-stress constitutive equation is used to account for the non-Newtonian effects of pseudoplastic and dilatant lubricants. Integrating the continuity equation across the film, the nonlinear non-Newtonian Reynolds-type equation is derived. The elasticity part of the problem is solved on the base of Vlassov model of an elastic foundation. The numerical solution of the modified Reynolds equation is carried out by using FDM with over-relaxation technique. The results for <b>steady</b> state <b>bearing</b> performance characteristics have been calculated for various values of nonlinear factor and elasticity parameters. It was concluded that in comparison with the Newtonian lubricants, higher values of film pressure and load carrying capacity have been obtained for dilatant lubricants, while the case was reversed for pseudoplastic lubricants...|$|R
6000|$|And in {{his early}} letters he was greatly {{exercised}} by the elementary science of drill and discipline, and the discussion of whether these things were necessary. He began by assuming that their importance was overrated. He went on to discover that they constituted the very essentials of all good soldiering. [...] "In a crisis," [...] he concluded, [...] "there is no telling what will get hold of a man, his higher instincts or his lower. He may show courage of a very splendid sort--or a hasty discretion. A habit is much more trustworthy than an instinct. So discipline sets up a habit of <b>steady</b> and courageous <b>bearing.</b> If you keep your head you are at liberty to be splendid. If you lose it, the habit will carry you through." ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{the court}} Sir Terence {{was the only}} member who could have desired to prolong the painful {{examination}} of her ladyship. But he perceived from the president's attitude {{that he could not}} do so without betraying the vindictiveness actuating him; and so he remained silent for the present. He would have {{gone so far as to}} suggest that her ladyship should be invited to remain in court against the possibility of further evidence being presently required from her but that he perceived there was no necessity to do so. Her deadly anxiety concerning the prisoner must in itself be sufficient to determine her to remain, as indeed it proved. Accompanied and half supported by Miss Armytage, who was almost as pale as herself, but otherwise very <b>steady</b> in her <b>bearing,</b> Lady O'Moy made her way, with faltering steps to the benches ranged against the side wall, and sat there to hear the remainder of the proceedings.|$|R
6000|$|For it {{is among}} the repulsive effects of this bad temper, which is {{supposed}} to be compatible with shining virtues, that it is apt to determine a man's sudden adhesion to an opinion, whether on a personal or impersonal matter, without leaving him time to consider his grounds. The adhesion is sudden and momentary, but it either forms a precedent for his line of thought and action, or it is presently seen to have been inconsistent with his true mind. This determination of partisanship by temper has its worst effects in the career of the public man, who is always in danger of getting so enthralled by his own words that he looks into facts and questions not to get rectifying knowledge, but to get evidence that will justify his actual attitude which was assumed under an impulse dependent on something else than knowledge. There has been plenty of insistance on the evil of swearing by the words of a master, and having the judgment uniformly controlled by a [...] "He said it;" [...] but a much worse woe to befall a man is to have every judgment controlled by an [...] "I said it"--to make a divinity of his own short-sightedness or passion-led aberration and explain the world in its honour. There is hardly a more pitiable degradation than this for a man of high gifts. Hence I cannot join with those who wish that Touchwood, being young enough to enter on public life, should get elected for Parliament and use his excellent abilities to serve his country in that conspicuous manner. For hitherto, in the less momentous incidents of private life, his capricious temper has only produced the minor evil of inconsistency, and he is even greatly at ease in contradicting himself, provided he can contradict you, and disappoint any smiling expectation you may have shown that the impressions you are uttering are likely to meet with his sympathy, considering that the day before he himself gave you the example which your mind is following. He is at least free from those fetters of self-justification which are the curse of parliamentary speaking, and what I rather desire for him is that he should produce the great book which he is generally pronounced capable of writing, and put his best self imperturbably on record for the advantage of society; because I should then have <b>steady</b> ground for <b>bearing</b> with his diurnal incalculableness, and could fix my gratitude as by a strong staple to that unvarying monumental service. Unhappily, Touchwood's great powers have been only so far manifested as to be believed in, not demonstrated. Everybody rates them highly, and thinks that whatever he chose to do would be done in a first-rate manner. Is it his love of disappointing complacent expectancy which has {{gone so far as to}} keep up this lamentable negation, and made him resolve not to write the comprehensive work which he would have written if nobody had expected it of him? ...|$|R
