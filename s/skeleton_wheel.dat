5000|$|Of {{the many}} {{attempts}} to produce cinematograph pictures... {{the greatest amount}} of attention so far has been attracted by a system invented by George Albert Smith, and commercially developed by Charles Urban under the name of [...] "Kinemacolor." [...] In this system (to quote from Cassell's Cyclopædia of Photography, edited by the editor of this present book), only two colour filters are used in taking the negatives and only two in projecting the positives. The camera resembles the ordinary cinematographic camera except that it runs at twice the speed, taking thirty-two images per second instead of sixteen, and it is fitted with a rotating colour filter in addition to the ordinary shutter. This filter is an aluminium <b>skeleton</b> <b>wheel...</b> having four segments, two open ones, G and H; one filled in with red-dyed gelatine, E F; and the fourth containing green-dyed gelatine, A B. The camera is so geared that exposures are made alternately through the red gelatine and the green gelatine. Panchromatic film is used, and the negative is printed from in the ordinary way, and it will be understood that there is no colour in the film itself.|$|E

Training included practicing starts using a <b>skeleton</b> sled with <b>wheels</b> underneath. 35 people were selected for a training camp, and 10 comprised a squad that competed in the sport internationally.|$|R
50|$|A chapel in Olintepeque, Guatemala is {{dedicated}} to the veneration of El Rey San Pascual. Devotees leave thank you notes, offer capes or burn candles. The color of the candle burned signifies the nature of the request for intercession: red for love, pink for health, yellow for protection, green for business, blue for work, light blue for money, purple for help against vices, white for the protection of children, and black for revenge. A festival is celebrated annually on May 17, the feast day of Saint Paschal Baylon. Another sacred replica, represented by a seated <b>skeleton</b> in a <b>wheeled</b> cart, is kept in the Church of San Pascualito in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, city at Mexican state of Chiapas.|$|R
5000|$|For {{most of its}} history, USC {{dominated}} the series, and overall USC has won {{about two-thirds of the}} games, but the rivalry has been marked with notable incidents and expressions of disdain between the two schools. In 1972, USC coach John McKay accused Stanford and its fans of having [...] "no class" [...] and said he'd [...] "like to beat Stanford by 2,000 points"; Stanford coach Jack Christiansen responded that he wouldn't [...] "get into a urinating contest with a skunk". In 1979, Stanford came back in the last four minutes to tie #1 USC 21-21 on October 13. This game, considered one of the greatest of the 20th century, effectively cost USC a national title (they dropped to #4 in the polls afterwards). USC finished 11-0-1, but was ranked #2 in both polls due to the tie. In 1980, the Stanford Band marched onto the field accompanied by a horse <b>skeleton</b> on <b>wheels,</b> being ridden by a Trojan-helmeted human skeleton, in a parody of USC's Traveler mascot. [...] For the 2012 game, the Stanford band leader inexplicably showed up dressed as the USC Trojan mascot.|$|R
