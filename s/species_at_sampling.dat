40|$|Among the 155 {{species of}} fish {{recorded}} {{so far in the}} St Lucia estuarine lake, Oreochromis mossambicus and Ambassis ambassis are the two most prominent. Although originally endemic to southern Africa, O. mossambicus {{is now one of the}} most widely distributed exotic fish species worldwide. Together with A. ambassis, they have become the dominant fish species in the St Lucia estuarine lake since the closure of the mouth in 2002 and are, therefore, a crucial component of the food webs throughout the system. After a decade dominated by dry and hypersaline conditions, the St Lucia system has changed dramatically in terms of prevailing environmental conditions, as a result of higher than average rainfall at the end of 2011 and the onset of a new wet phase at the start of 2012. In response, A. ambassis, which prefers lower salinity regimes, has expanded its distribution range throughout the estuarine lake. Stable δ 15 N and δ 13 C isotope analysis was used in conjunction with gut content analysis to elucidate the diet of these <b>species</b> <b>at</b> <b>sampling</b> localities spanning the geographical range of the system and determine whether these species shift their diet in response to environmental or climatic shifts.

40|$|Fish assemblages of unconsolidated {{sedimentary}} habitats on continental {{shelves are}} poorly described {{when compared to}} those of hard substrata. This lack of data restricts the objective management of these extensive benthic habitats. In the context of protecting representative areas of all community types, one important question {{is the nature of}} the transition from reefal to sedimentary fish assemblages. We addressed this question using Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) to assess fish assemblages of sedimentary habitats at six distances from rocky reefs (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m) at four sites in subtropical eastern Australia. Distance from reef was important in determining fish assemblage structure, and there was no overlap between reef sites and sedimentary sites 400 m from reef. While there was a gradient in assemblage structure at intermediate distances, this was not consistent across sites. All sites, however, supported a mixed ‘halo’ assemblage comprising both reef and sediment <b>species</b> <b>at</b> <b>sampling</b> stations close to reef. BRUVs used in conjunction with high-resolution bathymetric and backscatter spatial data can resolve differences in assemblage structure at small spatial scales (10 s to 100 s of metres), and has further application in unconsolidated habitats. Unless a ‘reef halo ’ assemblage is being examined, a minimum of 200 m but preferably 400 m distance from any hard substrate is recommended whe...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{distribution}} of zoobenthos in the Kemskaya Guba (or Kemskaya Bay - the estuary of the Kem' River entering the Onega Bay of the White Sea), which is {{strongly influenced by}} river runoff, are presented. The number of <b>species</b> <b>at</b> <b>sampling</b> stations varied from 4 to 65. Density of communities and zoobenthos biomass varied from 342 ± 68 to 4293 ± 96 #/m** 2 and from 0. 418 ± 0. 081 to 1975. 22 ± 494. 36 g/m** 2, respectively. Shannon index values varied between 1. 19 to 4. 7 bit/ind. At {{the upper part of}} the estuary, detritivores dominated, while in the central part and at outlets sestonophages prevailed. Changes in quantitative parameters of the zoobenthos along gradient of water salinity were traced, and relations of these parameters with seven other environmental factors were revealed. It was found that species composition, biodiversity, and trophic structure of the zoobenthos significantly correlated with some of parameters mentioned above. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess combined effect of factors, and it revealed which of them played a determining role in Kemskaya Guba: for species composition - depth, water color, and total concentration of suspended matter; for number of species - contents of < 0. 01 mm grain size (pelite) fraction and organic carbon in bottom sediments. Biomass depended on water salinity, water chromaticity, and organic carbon contents in bottom sediments and suspended matter. Values of the Shannon index of diversity are determined by water color, and contents of organic carbon and pelite fraction in bottom sediments.

Based on moss specimens collected in 2010 throughout Europe, the statistical relation between a set of potential predictors (such as the atmospheric deposition calculated by use of two chemical transport models (CTM), distance from emission sources, density of different land uses, population density, elevation, precipitation, clay content of soils) and concentrations of HMs and nitrogen (N) in moss (response variables) were evaluated {{by the use of}} Random Forests (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Four spatial scales were regarded: Europe as a whole, ecological land classes covering Europe, single countries participating in the European Moss Survey (EMS), and moss <b>species</b> <b>at</b> <b>sampling</b> sites. Spatial patterns were estimated by applying a series of RF models on data on potential predictors covering Europe. Statistical values and resulting maps were used to investigate to what extent the models are specific for countries, units of the Ecological Land Classification of Europe (ELCE), and moss species. Results Land use, atmospheric deposition and distance to technical emission sources mainly influence the element concentration in moss. The explanatory power of calculated RF models varies according to elements measured in moss specimens, country, ecological land class, and moss species. Measured and predicted medians of element concentrations agree fairly well while minima and maxima show considerable differences. The European maps derived from the RF models provide smoothed surfaces of element concentrations (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, N, Ni, Pb, Hg, V, Zn), each explained by a multivariate RF model and verified by CART, and thereby more information than the dot maps depicting the spatial patterns of measured values.

40|$|Background: Amblyomma variegatum and A. hebraeum are two ticks of {{veterinary}} {{and human health}} importance in south-east Africa. In Zimbabwe they occupy parapatric (marginally overlapping and juxtaposed) distributions. Understanding the mechanisms behind this parapatry is essential for predicting the spatio-temporal dynamics of Amblyomma spp. and the impacts of associated diseases.

[br/] Methods: To explore this competitive exclusion hypothesis we conducted field surveys at the two species' range limits in Mozambique to identify areas of sympatry (overlapping areas) and to study potential interactions (communicative and reproductive interference effects) in those areas.

Individual burn characteristics were not independent and had a mean partial correlation of r = 0.28 and ranged between 0.07 and 0.97 among pair-wise comparisons of variables. Therefore, they are not suitable for individual statistical analysis. We compared the mean PCA axis scores for each for Q. stellata and Q. marilandica leaves separately, with regression lines fit using functions of the elapsed time (days) since leaf fall {{at the end of the}} growing season. The Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC; McCune and Grace 2002) was used for selection among linear and polynomial models. To compare the change in collective burn characteristics over time between species, we used a two-tailed t-test to compare slopes of the fitted regression lines (Steel et al. 1997). Individual burn characteristics were fitted with regression models to indicate trends only. To compare collective burn characteristics between the two <b>species</b> <b>at</b> specific <b>sampling</b> dates, a two-tailed t-test {{was used to}} detect differences between the 40 mean axis 1 scores for both Q. stellata and Q. marilandica for each sampling period.

30|$|P. horticola was {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>species</b> <b>at</b> the <b>sampling</b> sites (99 % of all collected grubs). The rather shallow sampling depth of 10  cm allowed more samples per site, but could have biased the outcome to some degree. First, other grub pest species than P. horticola might tend to deeper soil layers, especially when the top soil is occupied by P. horticola larvae. Second, the third larval instar of M. melolontha starts pupating in deeper soil layers approximately {{at the end of}} June (Pötsch et al. 1997, Albert and Fröschle 2010, Kahrer et al. 2011). These grubs would have been missed in the grub survey from September to early October. However, no main flight year of M. melolontha was to be expected for the following year 2012 in the investigated regions (Faber 1961, Kahrer et al. 2011). Accordingly, the proportion of third instar larvae in 2011 would have been rather low. Third, under drought stress grubs might migrate into deeper soil regions with more favorable conditions (Ritterhaus 1927, quoted after Milne 1956, Benker and Leuprecht 2005, Albert and Fröschle 2010). Consequently, the densities of some grub species might be underrepresented in our results. But, if sites would have harbored significant populations of other species than P. horticola, it would have been quite unlikely that all individuals were located strictly below 10  cm soil depth. According to Keller et al. (2008) grub damage is usually caused by a single species. Therefore, we conclude that P. horticola was the dominant <b>species</b> <b>at</b> all <b>sampling</b> sites. This supports observations reported in the literature that this species is largely responsible for damage in Austrian mountainous grassland, while Melolontha spp. tend to lower altitudes (Pötsch et al. 1997, Traugott 2003, Benker and Leuprecht 2005).|$|R

Two approaches are employed to study {{ecological niche}} clustering of the Huai River Basin zoobenthos {{in order to identify}} key regions for ecosystem restoration. Results show that habitat changes will significantly impact Corbicula fluminea (Muller), whereas influences on Corbicula nitens (Philippi) will be the least significant. Total phosphorus has the greatest impact on zoobenthos, and high-concentrated ammonia nitrogen is also detrimental. Decreasing the discharge of both phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen in the Huai River Basin is therefore required to facilitate restoration. Changing habitat parameters has only a limited effect on alteration of zoobenthos structure. The application of these niche clustering approaches has identified priority locations for ecological restoration in the Huai River Basin. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

For instance, Norway spruce trees growing in Germany, Romania and Poland showed almost identical increases in δ 13 C during drought years (matching the strong declines in growth observed at these sites for this species). In Finland, spruce trees did show a less pronounced increase in δ 13 C in response to drought {{compared to the other}} three sites. However, this was also associated with a much weaker (and non-significant) decline in growth at this site, likely reflecting the lower intensity of the drought event in Finland relative to the other sites (Table 1), as well as the fact that in high-latitude forests photosynthetic activity and growth are primarily limited by temperature rather than by water availability (Babst et al. 2013; Jucker et al. 2016). The same pattern, whereby <b>species</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>at</b> multiple sites exhibited increases in δ 13 C during drought years that were comparable in magnitude, was also found for sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and Scots pine. The only exception we found to this pattern was birch (Betula pendula), which exhibited a much more pronounced increase in δ 13 C at the site in Finland compared to that in Poland (despite the fact that the drought at the second of these two sites was more intense and lasted longer; Table 1).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} eight scaphopod <b>species</b> found <b>at</b> 128 <b>sampling</b> {{stations}} near {{the coast of}} Valencia (Spain) during the campaigns of the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /CE) 2005, 2006 and 2008. Samples deposited in several Valencian institutions and private collections are also described. The identified species belong to four families: Dentaliidae (Antalis dentalis, A. inaequicostata, A. novemcostata, A. vulgaris, and A. caprottii n. sp., a new species described from material found on the coasts of the province of Castellón), Fustiariidae (Fustiaria rubescens), Entalinidae (Entalina tetragona) and Gadilidae (Dischides politus). We describe the characteristics and conchiological variations for each species and give geographic distribution maps on the Valencian coast for each specie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —We used seining and hoop netting {{to collect}} fish at 15 sites in five large prairie rivers in Oklahoma to (1) {{determine}} {{the amount of}} effort needed to detect the maximum number of <b>species</b> <b>at</b> a <b>sample</b> site and (2) examine the selectivity of fish species detected by the two gear types. Analysis of the similarities of the fish collected in six different habitat types identified two distinct habitat types based on fish species composition: shallow–backwater (SBW) habitat (depth 0. 75 m) and deep–nonwadeable (DNW) habitat (depth. 0. 75 m). We estimated that between 6 and 10 (mean 8) SBW habitats and between 1 and 6 (mean 4) DNW habitats <b>at</b> each <b>sample</b> site were needed to obtain maximum species richness during a sampling event. The sampling distance needed to encounter the minimum number of habitats ranged from 400 to 1, 600 m and averaged 887 m. Gear evaluation showed that seining captured more species per unit effort than hoop netting (3. 6 and 1. 4, respectively); however, hoop netting captured significantly larger fish (527 mm; P, 0. 001) than seining (42 mm). Based on these collections, we present recommendations for sampling fish assemblages in large prairie rivers in the southern Great Plains to aid in the rapid bioassessment and monitoring of fish assemblages in large prairie rivers. Rapid bioassessment protocols to assess the biotic integrity of riverine environments have become a...|$|R
40|$|The present {{occurrence}} of benthic algae (excl. Charales and diatoms) was investigated <b>at</b> 187 <b>sampling</b> sites <b>at</b> {{streams and rivers}} all over Germany. In total, more than 170 taxa from 11 algal classes were found. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that <b>species</b> composition <b>at</b> the <b>sampling</b> sites differed mostly with respect to water hardness and acid neutralizing capacity, but also with respect to anthropogenic degradation (higher levels of nutrients or pollution). Five types of running waters could be defined which show a characteristic species composition under reference conditions. Out of these, the siliceous waters in the Central Highlands are the most species-rich. Further research should focus on calcareous waters in the Northern Plains as here {{a great part of}} variation in species composition is not well understood yet. Parts of this work were conducted within the PHYLIB project which led to an assessment routine as needed for the application of the Water Framework Directive...|$|R
40|$|We tested {{whether the}} {{processes}} of exploration and exploitation can be explicitly distinguished as plants grow and develop within a habitat using two stoloniferous clonal herbs, Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides (Umbelliferae) and Potentilla anserina (Rosaceae). Ramets were planted in four circular trays differing in diameter. One replicate from each diameter-group was <b>sampled</b> <b>at</b> intervals corresponding to plant coverage of the trays, and plant biomass allocation to leaves, stolons, and roots and internode length were quantified. For both <b>species,</b> <b>at</b> early <b>sampling</b> times (when the smallest trays were full), total plant biomass and ramet number were larger in the smaller trays than in the larger trays. However, this trend was reversed for plants collected at later times. For H. sibthorpioides, leaf mass ratios (leaf mass to total plant mass) were significantly greater, but stolon mass ratios (stolon mass to total plant mass) were less in the small trays than in the larger ones, particularly {{during the early stages}} of the experiment. Similarly, for P. anserina, leaf mass ratios decreased in the smaller trays but increased in the larger ones as the experiment progressed. Root mass ratios showed contrasting pattern to leaf mass ratios for both species; stolon mass ratios were significantly smaller in the smaller trays than in the larger ones, although there were no obvious patterns during the course of the experiment. In addition, for both species, internode length was shorter but the number of ramets was greater in the smaller trays <b>at</b> early <b>sampling</b> times. We conclude that plants invest greater biomass in resource-exploring organs (stolons) than in resource-exploiting organs (leaves or roots) as they initially establish in a habitat. The relatively lower plant productivity in the largest trays <b>at</b> early <b>sampling</b> times presumably reflects the cost of exploration prior to resource exploitation and utilization.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that problems in segregating tangled and attached chromosomes or gene amplification via the Breakage–Fusion–Bridge cycle could cause lobed nuclei or blebbed nuclei during the elimination of amplified DNA from the nucleus (Çavaş 2008). Likewise, the occurrence of lobed and notched nuclei has been attributed to the presence of substances able to induce cytotoxicity and it is recommended to quantify thus abnormalities separately (Bolognesi and Hayashi 2011). At this regard, the higher presence of lobed and notched nuclei in both fish <b>species</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>at</b> the site 3 indicates the presence of cytotoxic damage in peripheral erythrocytes; furthermore, based on our results it is possible to infer that A. gr. bimaculatus is more sensitive to the formation of this type of nuclear abnormalities.|$|R
