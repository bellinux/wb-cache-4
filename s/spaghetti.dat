5|$|According to Henderson, {{newspaper}} {{articles on the}} Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster {{attracted the attention of}} book publishers; he said that at one point, there were six publishers interested in the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster. In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from Villard to write The Gospel of the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, the Swedish concept {{designer}} Niklas Jansson {{created an}} adaptation of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, superimposing the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster over God. This became and remains the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster's de facto brand image. The Hunger Artists Theatre Company produced a comedy called The Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster Holiday Pageant in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism. The production has spawned a sequel called Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster Holy Mug of Grog, performed in December 2008. This communal activity {{attracted the attention of}} three University of Florida religious scholars, who assembled a panel at the 2007 American Academy of Religion meeting to discuss the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster.|$|E
5|$|In September 2005, before Henderson had {{received}} an advance {{to write the}} Gospel of the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster, a Pastafarian member of the Venganza forums known as Solipsy, announced {{the beginning of a}} project to collect texts from fellow Pastafarians to compile into the Loose Canon, the Holy Book of the Church of the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster, essentially analogous to the Bible. The book was completed in 2010 and was made available for download.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-clerical protesters wore colanders to Piazza XXIV Maggio {{square in}} Milan, Italy, on June 2, 2012, in mock {{obedience}} to the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{progressive}} {{rock band}} Little Tragedies, the Hungarian band Yesterdays and the Italian group N.O.T. (Noise Overtones Therapy) composed and performed 20-minute pieces {{based on the}} film, titled The Voice of Silence, Suite Pauline and Epilogo respectively, {{as part of the}} Colossus Project, a musical project set up by the Finnish Progressive Music Association to encourage bands and musical artists to musically interpret the film and other <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns. The songs were released on the album The <b>Spaghetti</b> Epic Volume Three – The Greatest Silence.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, a self-declared Pastafarian {{was denied}} the right to wear a <b>spaghetti</b> {{strainer}} on his head for his driver's license photo by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, which stated that a pasta strainer was not on a list of approved religious headwear.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, union {{officials}} at London South Bank University forbade an atheist group to display posters of the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster at a student orientation conference and later banned the {{group from the}} conference, leading to complaints about interference with free speech. The Students' Union subsequently apologized.|$|E
5|$|In Indonesia KFC is {{the largest}} Western {{restaurant}} chain, with 466 outlets as of December 2013. The chain has grown to hold an estimated 32 percent market share, and menu items include <b>spaghetti,</b> wraps and chicken porridge. The master franchisee is PT Fastfood Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 a New Zealand man {{obtained}} a driver's license with {{a photograph of}} himself wearing a blue <b>spaghetti</b> strainer on his head. This was granted under a law allowing the wearing of religious headgear in official photos.|$|E
5|$|Mediterranean Italian cuisine {{includes}} much of Italy {{outside the}} north and the mountainous inland regions. It is a diverse cuisine, but among its best-known and most characteristic foods are risotto, pizza in Neapolitan and Sicilian styles, and pasta dishes such as <b>spaghetti.</b>|$|E
5|$|Basil was no {{more than}} the name of {{bachelor}} uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat <b>spaghetti</b> or pick a globe artichoke to pieces.... Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand that we could do better with what we had.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a <b>Spaghetti</b> Western.|$|E
5|$|Highway401 widens to 18lanes {{south of}} Toronto Pearson International Airport. Progressing eastward, eight lanes are carried beneath the large <b>spaghetti</b> {{junction}} at Highway427. The highway curves northeast and follows a power transmission corridor to Highway409, which merges with the mainline and forms the collector lanes. It returns to its eastward route through Toronto, now carrying 12–16lanes of traffic on four carriageways.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an American pro-life crisis {{pregnancy}} center {{operated by}} Christians in Grayson County, Kentucky, offered {{a course on}} the topic of sexual integrity that employed When God Writes Your Love Story and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles — Single Women Are Like <b>Spaghetti.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2012, DiCaprio starred as villainous Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino's <b>spaghetti</b> western, Django Unchained. While filming Django Unchained, DiCaprio accidentally cut {{his hand}} on glass, but {{continued}} filming despite the injury, and Tarantino elected to use the take in the final movie. The film received positive reviews from critics and earned DiCaprio his ninth nomination from the Golden Globes. Django Unchained grossed $424 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|National {{branches}} of the Church of the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster have been striving in many countries to have FSMism become an officially (legally) recognized religion, {{with varying degrees of}} success. Pastafarianism/FSMism is recognized as a religion in the Netherlands, and New Zealand, where Pastafarian representatives have been authorized to celebrate weddings.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, 2011 the {{chairman}} of the church of the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster Germany, Rüdiger Weida, obtained a driver's license with a picture of him wearing a pirate bandana. In contrast to the Austrian officials in the case of Niko Alm the German officials allowed the headgear as a religious exception.|$|E
5|$|The Great Silence was one {{of several}} <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns {{produced}} between 1967 and 1968, along with Enzo G. Castellari's Kill Them All and Come Back Alone and One Dollar Too Many, Sergio Sollima's Run, Man, Run and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, to be showcased in Patrick Morin's made-for-television documentary Western, Italian Style. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns in general (comparing the use of violence in such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and reaching for a long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{score to}} Zombi 2 was {{composed}} by Fabio Frizzi, who frequently scored Fulci's works, including Sette note in nero, I quattro dell'apocalisse and Sella d'argento previously. Zombi 2 {{marked the first}} time the two had worked together on a straight horror movie as opposed to their previous <b>spaghetti</b> western and giallo thriller work; Frizzi would go on to compose for many more horror films with and without Fulci.|$|E
5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of <b>spaghetti</b> Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{popularity}} and exposure, the Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster {{is often used}} as a contemporary version of Russell's teapot—an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make unfalsifiable claims, not on those who reject them. Pastafarianism has received praise from the scientific community and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in Polk County, Florida, where they {{played a role in}} dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.|$|E
5|$|Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and {{political}} figure. After achieving {{success in the}} Western TV series Rawhide, he rose to international fame with {{his role as the}} Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more and more people have adopted it as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and <b>spaghetti</b> and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E
5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, {{despite the}} implications of a large budget {{as a result of}} an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance in the quality of the film stock. In comparison to the Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns were filmed in, The Great Silence was filmed in the standard European widescreen format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E
5|$|Following the film's completion, The Great Silence was, as per {{standard}} procedure for a <b>Spaghetti</b> Western, edited in its final, completed form and dubbed into five languages: Italian, French, Spanish, German and English. Subtitled versions were created for foreign markets {{outside of the}} dubbed versions. The English-language version was written by John Davis Hart and Lewis E. Ciannelli (the son of Eduardo Ciannelli) and recorded at Via Margutta Studios in Rome under Ciannelli's direction. Mel Welles provided Pistilli's English voice.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Pastafarians in Crossville, Tennessee, were {{permitted}} to place a Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster statue in a free speech zone on the courthouse lawn, and proceeded to do so. The display gained national interest on blogs and online news sites and was even covered by Rolling Stone magazine. It was later removed from the premises, {{along with all the}} other long-term statues, {{as a result of the}} controversy over the statue. In December 2011, Pastafarianism was one of the multiple denominations given equal access to placing holiday displays on the Loudoun County courthouse lawn, in Leesburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The Great Silences soundtrack was {{composed}} by Ennio Morricone, Corbucci's frequent musical collaborator since Navajo Joe, and conducted by Bruno Nicolai. A melancholic, emotive score, Morricone personally {{viewed it as}} his best <b>Spaghetti</b> Western soundtrack aside from his compositions for Sergio Leone. The soundtrack was released on CD, also containing five tracks from Morricone's score for That Splendid November, in 1995, 2005 and 2014. A limited edition LP (consisting of 500 copies) was released by Dagored in April 2016.|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{enters the}} Salt Lake Valley {{on the former}} {{alignment}} of North Temple Street until it passes the Salt Lake City International Airport, where the freeway veers slightly south and leaves the North Temple Street corridor which leads to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) TRAX system briefly parallels I-80 before traveling {{down the center of}} North Temple Street. I-80 becomes concurrent with I-15 after interchanges with SR-58 and 600South and continues south for about , passing along the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City. The southern interchange with I-15, which also includes SR-201 (21st South Freeway) and marks the end of the concurrency, is known as the <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl,. In the southwestern corner of the <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City. After separating from I-15, the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake, loosely following an alignment just south of 2100South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the Sugar House neighborhood and past Sugar House Parkonce the home of the Sugar House Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I-215 270° belt route around Salt Lake. It continues through Parley's Canyon, where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway. Between the mouth of the canyon and the Summit county line, the route re-enters the Wasatch National Forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the I-94 overlap in downtown Saint Paul {{did not include the}} right-side ramps that eliminate weaving. The ramp from I-35E northbound to I-94 eastbound was added when I-35E was finally completed in 1990, and a five-year construction project that was completed in 1992 added the ramp from I-35E southbound to I-94 westbound, as well as a direct ramp from I-35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid weaving across I-94 east. This project was done because the old <b>Spaghetti</b> Junction at the east split of I-35E and I-94 {{would not be able to}} handle the extra load from the completed I-35E parkway.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Carey {{lived with}} her mother Patricia in a small {{apartment}} on Long Island, New York. They were poor and had to move several times as Patricia found different jobs. As a result, Carey frequently transferred into different schools, and {{at the age of}} seventeen, she moved into a small Manhattan studio with other young women to pursue a career in music. She had already begun working on her demo tape with Ben Margulies, a classmate at her school in Huntington, Long Island. During this period, she lived a lifestyle of poverty, often sharing a box of <b>spaghetti</b> with her five roommates and wearing torn shoes. She held several jobs, while juggling school, writing, and recording music.|$|E
5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{squashes}} (ghia) {{are cooked}} with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} gratin, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from Liguria, or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like <b>spaghetti</b> alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the {{conventions}} of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in North West Frontier (1959), and a scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in Once Upon a Time in the West. Some plot elements were borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973).|$|E
5|$|Interstate 80 (I-80) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway System {{that runs}} from San Francisco, California, to Teaneck, New Jersey. The portion of the highway in the U.S. state of Utah is , through the {{northern}} part of the state. From west to east, I-80 crosses the state line from Nevada in Tooele County and traverses the Bonneville Salt Flatswhich are a part of the larger Great Salt Lake Desert. It continues alongside the Wendover Cut-offthe corridor of the former Victory HighwayU.S. Route 40 (US-40) and the Western Pacific Railroad Feather River Route. After passing the Oquirrh Mountains, I-80 enters the Salt Lake Valley and Salt Lake County. A short portion of the freeway is concurrent with I-15 through Downtown Salt Lake City. At the <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl, I-80 turns east again into the mouth of Parley's Canyon and Summit County, travels through the mountain range and intersects the eastern end of I-84 near Echo Reservoir before turning northeast towards the Wyoming border near Evanston. I-80 was built along the corridor of the Lincoln Highway and the Mormon Trail through the Wasatch Range. The easternmost section also follows the historical routes of the First Transcontinental Railroad and US-30S.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with three}} lanes in each direction, the highway {{straddles}} {{the boundary between}} Salt Lake City and West Valley City, another suburb of the former. The road continues due east with diamond interchanges at 5600 West (SR-172) and Bangerter Highway (SR-154). Immediately following a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) at 3200 West, the freeway intersects I-215 {{in the form of}} a cloverleaf interchange. The road dips to the south slightly and, following two SPUIs at Redwood Road (SR-68) and 900 West, the freeway terminates at the <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl interchange, giving eastbound motorists on SR-201 the option of continuing to I-15, I-80, 1300 South and 900 South. However, an eastbound traveler wanting to continue on the surface portion of SR-201 to State Street must exit on 900 West, head north briefly and then turn eastbound on 2100 South; a westbound traveler on 2100 South wishing to connect to the freeway must take an on-ramp from the surface street just before 900 West. Prior to 1997, this connection was direct. Now on the four-lane 2100 South, a secondary surface street, the route runs along the Salt Lake City-South Salt Lake border. State maintenance of 2100 South ends at the intersection of State Street (US-89).|$|E
