50|$|A {{paddling}} trip usually {{done by a}} group {{where they}} will descend a technical creek {{over a period of}} days. The group will usually survive on supplies they begin the trip with stored in their creek boats. The level of difficulty in creeking makes packing for overnight trips especially challenging as adding weight to the kayak can severely hamper the performance of the kayak, whereas canoes do not usually have as much of a problem. The placement of the gear within the kayak also impacts the performance of the boat as the center of gravity moves. Essential gear for multi-day trips includes fire starting gear, food and/or fishing line, and warm gear or a sleeping bag for the nights. Tents, <b>sleeping</b> <b>pads,</b> and cooking equipment are optional based on weight and space. This activity is comparable to mountaineering in scale and exposure, and mountaineering grade equipment is favored for its weight characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight, reduced-size and reduced-thickness air {{mattresses}} specifically {{intended for}} camping and backpacking are sometimes called <b>sleeping</b> <b>pads,</b> especially when {{a layer of}} foam insulation is added under the air chambers. Better quality air chambers, that are designed for permanent use in the home, are constructed of vulcanized rubber, covered in canvas or of polyurethane. These chamber(s) are then installed into a cloth shell or tick(ing). Permanent air beds will look almost like conventional beds {{with the exception of}} having a hose (one air chamber) or hoses (two air chambers) coming out of the head of the bed. These hoses will be connected to an air inflation device, with two outlet valves, that will have a remote control(s) so that each person can adjust the firmness of his or her side to his/her own exact needs. The firmness can be adjusted up or down, with the simple push of a button, on the remote(s).|$|E
5000|$|In the mid 20th-century {{there was}} a {{cultural}} shift in wilderness ethics from woodcraft where wilderness travelers prided themselves {{on their ability to}} rely on the resources of wild lands to a post-WWII ethics of minimal impact on the environment. Leave No Trace began in the 1960s and 1970s. There was a large increase of wilderness visitation following the creation of new recreational equipment such as white gas stoves, synthetic tents, and <b>sleeping</b> <b>pads.</b> This began a commercial interest in outdoor recreation which in turn caused more visitors to national parks. In those decades, the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the National Park Service started to teach their non-motorized visitors how to have a minimal impact on the land. Wilderness Informational Specialists were trained to educate visitors on minimal impact camping in the different parks. In 1987 the three departments cooperatively developed a pamphlet titled [...] "Leave No Trace Land Ethics".|$|E
50|$|A {{sleeping}} bag's rating typically {{indicates the}} lowest temperature {{at which it}} will keep the average sleeper warm. For example, with a 0° bag, a person {{should be able to}} sleep in 0° temperature, but not necessarily comfortably.There is no standard measurement rating in the U.S., so a 20° bag from one company may not provide the same warmth as a 20° from another company. Other important variables include what the user plans to wear while sleeping, what type of <b>sleeping</b> <b>pad</b> is used, and how well the user holds heat in the bag.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom of}} a {{sleeping}} bag typically does not provide significant insulation, because body weight crushes the loft of the insulation material. It is therefore necessary to use a pad or other less crush-able insulation underneath the sleeper, especially in cold weather. Due to this, some sleeping bags do not include insulation on the bottom. Some include a sleeve for holding a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pad.</b> Additionally, some campers, especially ultralight backpackers or hammock campers, have started to use a top quilt, essentially a sleeping bag without a back. Some top quilts include a foot box, while others are just simple blankets.|$|R
50|$|Polly Mead Patraw {{first visited}} the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in 1927 {{as part of}} an {{undergraduate}} western National Parks field trip. At the time she was earning her bachelor's degree in Botany. After graduation, her benefactor and Aunt gave her the choice to go to Europe or to return to the Grand Canyon. Polly Mead Patraw chose to return to the Grand Canyon and spent the summers of 1928 and 1929 doing research there for her master's thesis. As part of her research, it was reported that she would take overnight trips exploring the Canyon with nothing but a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pad</b> and a pistol. Her research focused on the causes of the abrupt tree line throughout the Kaibab Plateau - North Rim Parkway.|$|R

40|$|A {{lightweight}} camping cot {{is currently}} unavailable in the backpacking market. Although camping cots do exist, {{they are not}} competitive in weight and size with <b>sleeping</b> <b>pads</b> typically used by campers. On average, <b>sleeping</b> <b>pads</b> weigh 2 pounds while the lightest weight camping cot on the market is 5 pounds. In addition, the cot does not collapse {{to the size of}} a sleeping pad. These factors prevent cots from being a suitable alternative to <b>sleeping</b> <b>pads.</b> In order to bridge this discrepancy, a lightweight cot was designed and constructed in order to give campers a viable alternative to <b>sleeping</b> <b>pads.</b> The lightweight cot designed for this thesis weighs approximately 3 pounds and collapses {{to the size of a}} sleeping pad. This 1 pound increase in weight from a sleeping pad is made up for by increased comfort while sleeping and safety during lightning storms. The lightweight cot utilizes carbon fiber poles for its structural support and ripstop nylon for the cot surface. The carbon fiber poles are connected with plastic fittings. Each of the cot's components was selected due to its highly lightweigh...|$|E
50|$|An {{overnight}} shelter may be {{as simple}} as a wool blanket and tarp, or a complete sleep-system inside a double-walled, four-season tent. Sleeping layers may be layered the same way as clothing layers: inner, mid, and outer shell. Bedding options range from a pillow made from clothes to a sleep system comprising <b>sleeping</b> <b>pad,</b> <b>sleeping</b> bag, bivouac shelter, bag liner, and compression sack. Shelter structures can be constructed from a tarpaulin, ground sheet, rope, poles, or trees, with a mosquito net. Rain poncho may be used as a ground sheet, or used as an overhead tarp, or rigged as a hammock. Tent hammocks comes with a bug net and overhead tarp. A cave, bivouac shelter, or debris shelter can also be used. Jungle shelters are used in jungles and tropical rainforest, where rainfall, mud, invertebrates, and snakes are common. A Venezuelan or jungle hammock is well ventilated, with a bug net and a covering tarpaulin. A platform can be built off the ground or tied into a tree. Trekking poles can be used to construct a shelter; they can be used as poles for a tarpaulin. Some tents are designed to use trekking poles in place of carrying additional poles, a technique common in ultralight backpacking.|$|R
50|$|A {{sleeping}} bag is an insulated covering for a person, essentially a lightweight quilt {{that can be}} closed with a zipper or similar means to form a tube, which functions as lightweight, portable bedding in situations where a person is sleeping outdoors (e.g. when camping, hiking, hill walking or climbing). Its primary purpose is to provide warmth and thermal insulation through its synthetic or down insulation. It also typically has a water-resistant or water-repellent cover that protects, to some extent, against wind chill and light precipitation, but a tent is usually used {{in addition to a}} {{sleeping bag}}, as it performs those functions better. The bottom surface also provides some cushioning, but a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pad</b> or camp cot is usually used in addition for that purpose. The bottom surface of a sleeping bag may be moderately water repellent, but a plastic tarp or groundsheet is often used to protect against moist ground.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sleeping}} pads's warmth {{is characterized}} by R-value. But unlike sleeping bags' EN 13537 test standard and widely accepted recommendations, <b>sleeping</b> <b>pad</b> R-values lacks a simple mapping and label for 'how much warmth' a consumer should expect. Combining various standards and various authors' research, an approximate R-value to temperature chart follows: Same as EN 13537, a [...] "standard man" [...] {{is assumed to be}} 25 years old, with a height of 1.73 m and a weight of 73 kg; a [...] "standard woman" [...] is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.60 m and a weight of 60 kg. The <b>sleeping</b> bag and <b>pad</b> system (above, below, and sides) should provide the same insulation value all around a person, but cost, size, weight, comfort, and lack-of-knowledge often lead persons to reduce the R-value to below their personal 'recommended R-value'. Since the pad and bag work together, a 'warmer' bag can compensate the a 'thin' pad and a 'thick pad' for a 'cold' bag. Highly heat-conductive surfaces (e.g. concrete, granite) [...] require more insulation for the same temperature than insulating ground surfaces (e.g.snow, dry moss, loose soil, wood, etc.). More heat is lost downward when sleeping on one's stomach vs sleeping one's side (due to reduced contact area and cooler body parts in contact). Most persons can 'feel the cold ground' at approximately half the 'recommended R-values'.|$|R

50|$|Reduction {{in weight}} of {{the second of the}} big three, the {{sleeping}} system, is achieved through reduction of the quantity of fabric used in its manufacture or through use of lighterweight materials in its construction. The use of down as an insulation material which is lighter by volume than currently available synthetic fibers will decrease bag weight but alternately suffer from its susceptibility to loft loss caused by moisture. Reducing the overall weight of a sleeping bag by eliminating superfluous material will reduce its weight. An example of this is the use of a sleeping quilt or top bag. A sleeping quilt is a bottom-less insulated blanket which has no insulation on its bottom side, relying on the user's <b>sleeping</b> <b>pad</b> to guard against conductive heat loss into the ground. A top bag is more like a conventional sleeping bag in that it wraps around the user's entire body but the bottom fabric contains no insulation. The philosophy behind these two alternatives is that insulation crushed under a person's weight is devoid of air and therefore useless. Some modern down sleeping bags are through-baffled and under-filled such that the user can shift all the insulation to the top of their body thereby maximizing its potential to retain heat. Ultralight hikers also tend to carry bags rated for warmer temperatures than traditional-weight backpackers, making up the difference on cold nights by wearing insulated clothing to bed, such as a balaclava or an insulated jacket. Proper camping site selection that avoids colder hollows (low points where cold air tends to collect) or that makes use of natural wind barriers such as thick vegetation or cliffs makes up the difference in heat lost by lighter gear.|$|R
50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that thermal pads are {{for creating}} a more comfortable sleeping or picnic spot. This is what gives rise to their other name 'ground pads'. In fact, {{the purpose of the}} thermal pad is to prevent the loss of body heat into the ground while <b>sleeping.</b> The foam <b>pad,</b> which is filled with air bubbles, slows down the conduction of heat through the pad since air {{is one of the best}} (and cheapest) insulators.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{appeal of}} hammock camping for most users is comfort and better sleep, as {{compared}} to <b>sleeping</b> on a <b>pad</b> on the ground. Hammock camping enthusiasts argue that hammocks don't harm the environment {{in the way that}} conventional tents do. Most hammocks attach to trees via removable webbing straps, or [...] "tree-huggers," [...] which don't damage the bark and leave little or no marks afterward. Whereas it's easy to see a frequently used campground because of the effect on the grass, scrub and topsoil, the presence of a hammock camping site is much harder to detect. This has found favour with hikers and campers who follow the principles of Leave No Trace camping. Hammock camping also opens up many more sites for campers - stony ground, slopes, and so on - as well as keeping them off the ground and away from small mammals, reptiles and insects. Sleeping off the ground also keeps the camper out of any rainwater runoff that might seep in under a tent during a downpour. Lastly, the relatively light weight of hammocks makes them ideal for reducing backpack weight, thereby making it a good option for ultralight backpacking enthusiasts.|$|R
