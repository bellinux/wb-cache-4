An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} develop low Z-force (normal/forge load) friction stir spot welds (FSSWs) using conventional tooling and process development approaches. Low Z-forces {{can be achieved by}} studying the relationship between pin tool features, geometries, processing parameters, and resultant strength of coupons produced by friction stir spot welding (FSSW). The effects of geometrical and feature changes of pin tool designs—including <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameters,</b> <b>shoulder</b> features, probe <b>diameters,</b> probe shapes, and probe features—on the joint properties of 0. 040 -inch-thick bare 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy were evaluated. Welding tools included Psi™, Counterflow™, Modified Trivex™, and V-flute™ pin tools. A Box-Behnken design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to investigate the effects of three process parameters: spindle speed, Z-force (forge load), and travel speed. The goal of the {{investigation was}} to maintain the ultimate tensile load (UTL) in unguided lap shear coupons tested in tension while reducing the Z-force required for producing a sound joint. This goal was achieved on a specially built MTS Systems Corporation ISTIR PDS FSW gantry system. In addition to single-spot unguided lap shear tests, the performance of low Z-force FSSW joints was evaluated by optical metallographic cross-section analyses, which were then correlated with process parameters, UTL, and pin tool designs. The maximum Z-force spikes encountered during the initial plunge were reduced by an order of magnitude, and the Z-force processing loads were reduced by half for Octaspot™ swept FSSW, most effectively by controlling the plunge rate under force control. Additional reductions in Z-force were achieved by refining the conventional FSSW tool shoulder and probe designs. Therefore, it was demonstrated that weld forces can be reduced {{to the point where it}} would be feasible to perform robotic low Z-force FSSW for at least some applications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFriction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} novel solid state welding process that strong enhanced the welding of aluminum alloys for structural applications. In this process, the heat necessary for the required plastic flow of material is produced at the interfase tool-work piece, being affected by factors such as rotational speed, axial load and tool <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameter,</b> among others. The objective of this work was to study the effect of tool <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameter</b> on heat input during FSW of AA 5052 -H 32 alloy and the resulting characteristics of the produced welded joints.

Six transversal body dimensions were studied: biacromial, transverse chest, antero-posterior chest, biiliocristal, bicondylar humerus and bicondylar femur diamters. A significant increase in body diameters has been observed {{until the age of}} 14 to 15 in girls and until the age of 16 in boys, showing that girls have a 1 to 2 years shorter period of growth.

The studied transversal body segments showed different growth dynamics, which is gender-specific. While sexual dimorphism in pelvic and <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameters</b> emerged with pubertal spurt, gender differences in chest and extremities’ diameters started early in life.

Friction stir processing is a solid state process where the material beneath the shoulder and around the pin region undergoes severe plastic deformation resulting in dynamically recrystallised equiaxed grain structure. The extruded AZ 31 B magnesium alloy used in this work reveals limited ductility because of hexagonal closed packed structure and severe mechanical twinning.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted fat-saturated, and proton density-weighted fat-saturated spin-echo sequences were acquired in 15 cadaveric <b>shoulders.</b> Biceps tendon <b>diameter</b> (normal, flattened, thickened, and partially or completely torn) and signal intensity (compared with bone, fat, muscle, and joint fluid) were graded by two readers independently and in a blinded fashion. The distance of tendon abnormalities from the attachment at the glenoid were noted in millimeters. MRI findings were related to gross anatomic and histologic findings. RESULTS: On the basis of gross anatomy, there were six normal, five flattened, two thickened, and two partially torn tendons. Reader 1 graded nine diameter changes correctly, missed two, and incorrectly graded four. The corresponding values for reader 2 were seven, one, and five, respectively, with kappa = 0. 75. Histology showed mucoid degeneration (n = 13), lipoid degeneration (n = 7), and fatty infiltration (n = 6). At least one type of abnormality was found in each single tendon. Mucoid degeneration was hyperintense compared with fatty infiltration on T 2 -weighted fat-saturated images and hyperintense compared with magic-angle artifacts on proton density-weighted fat-saturated images. MRI-based localization of degeneration agreed well with histologic findings. CONCLUSION: Diameter changes are specific but not sensitive in diagnosing tendinopathy of the biceps tendon.

40|$|Friction Stir Processing (FSP) {{is a new}} and {{exciting}} processing technique to locally modify the grain structure and improve mechanical properties of metals. Numerical modelling of the process will allow for improved understanding of the deeply complex thermo-mechanical processes that occur within this seemingly simple technique. An accurate numerical model will increase understanding {{of the process and}} reduce the number of experimental trials required to achieve the desired result. In FSP, a cylindrical non-consumable tool, generally consisting of a pin and shoulder, is rotated and plunged into the surface of a metal workpiece. The larger <b>diameter</b> <b>shoulder</b> prevents the surface of the metal workpiece from flowing outwards, while the specially designed pin induces a stirring action, producing a combination of frictional and adiabatic heating allowing the metal to flow around the pin from the advancing side to the retreating side. Localised severe plastic deformation occurs generally resulting in grain refinement. It is the grain refinement that has attracted the attention of many researchers and prompted development of numerical models. The typical numerical methods applied in literature rely on Eulerian or Lagrangian meshes which struggle to overcome large mesh deformation and track material history respectively. In addition, phenomenological models are generally applied which do not have a physical basis. To this end, this work will implement a particle based numerical method with a physically based constitutive law. The proposed three-dimensional fully-coupled thermo-mechanical model is able to concurrently determine the temperature field, material flow and microstructure evolution dependent on the processing conditions of FSP.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} aims at studying the {{friction stir welding}} of thin AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheets (1. 5 mm in thickness). Different tool geometries and process parameters were investigated. In particular, two properly designed tools, with different values of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameter,</b> have been used; each of them has been manufactured both with and without the pin (“pin” and “pinless” tool). It was shown that, as the tool characterised by the shoulder with lower diameter (8 mm) is used, {{the presence of the}} pin leads to the obtaining of peak stress and ductility values higher than those provided by the “pinless” tool. A strong beneficial effect on both ductility and strength of the joint is obtained by increasing the <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameter</b> (19 mm) even though the “pin” tool configuration is characterized by a very narrow welding window. An investigation has been also carried out in order to evaluate the micro-hardness distributions and the microstructure of the welded joints. A different metal flow can be clearly observed depending on the presence/absence of pin. Moreover, a more homogeneous microstructure is obtained using the “pinless” tool...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} campaign aimed at the study of the microstructure of Friction Stir Welded butt joints. In this solid-state welding technology, a rotating tool moves into the material and translates along the interface of two or more parts. During this process friction heats the material which is extruded around the tool and forged by the large pressure produced by the tool shoulder. The experimental campaign was performed by means of a CNC machine tool. Butt joints were obtained on sheets having a thickness equal to 8 mm. An AA 6060 aluminum alloy in the T 6 artificially aged condition was used for this purpose. Sheets were welded by using a standard tool with smooth plane shoulder and cylindrical pin. The tool was fabricated using AISI 1040 steel, <b>shoulder</b> and pin <b>diameters</b> are respectively equal to 20 and 8 mm. The tilt angle, was fixed at 2. 5 Â° and the pin was inserted into the workpiece for 7. 8 mm. The joints were executed by varying the process parameters, namely rotational speed (S [rev/min]) and feed rate (f [mm/min]). The selection of the parameter values was based on a DOE (Design of Experiments) approach. The metallurgical analysis was carried out to evaluate the microstructure of the joints transverse section {{as a function of the}} process parameters and to evaluate the grain size in the different regions of the joints: Nugget, HAZ - Heat Affected Zone, TMAZ - Thermo Mechanical Affected Zone. The grain count was executed according to the standard ASTM E 112 - 96 (2004). The ratio between feed rate and rotational speed resulted to be a significant parameter for the control of the joints grain size. The Nugget showed a microstructure with very small grains with an average dimension equal to one third with respect to the grains of the base material. The grain size linearly decreases for increasing values of the f/S ratio. The TMAZ is characterized by strongly elongated grains, oriented in a different way with respect to the ones of the other regions. Also in this case, an almost linear correlation between grain size and f/S ratio was observed. On the opposite, in the HAZ, the grain size decreases for increasing values of the f/S ratio. A tensile test campaign was also carried out to evaluate the mechanical properties of the joints. Specimens having a width and a thickness equal respectively to 18 mm and 8 mm were tested orthogonally with respect to the welding direction by means of a Galdabini machine. Except for the joints containing defects, the rupture always occurred in the HAZ. The increase of UTS was observed for increasing values of the ratio between feed rate and rotational speed (f/S). An inverse behaviour was observed for the strain at rupture. Finally, the quality of the joins, in terms of tensile strength, was compared with the metallurgical properties observed on the joints. The tensile strength resulted to increase for decreasing values of the grain size...|$|R
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is an {{emerging}} solid state welding process. It {{has been a}} proven method for welding high strength aluminium alloys which were previously not recommended for conventional fusion welding. Since {{the invention of the}} process by The Welding Institute, United Kingdom, in 1991, {{a number of studies have}} been conducted on the material flow, microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of friction stir welds. However, there is not enough conceptual background available on FSW process for physical understanding of the mechanism of weld formation. In addition to that, FSW welds of high strength precipitation hardenable aluminium alloys suffer from reduced joint efficiency due to overaging in the heat affected zone. In the present investigation, experimental analysis has been carried out to understand the mechanism of weld formation and parameter optimization for aluminium alloys 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6. For this purpose the investigations have been made on both the process aspects and the material aspects. The process aspects are analyzed with the objective of learning the mechanism to produce defect free welds. For this purpose experiments have been carried out to analyze the effect of FSW parameters, material flow and the frictional characteristics between the tool and base metal. Preliminary experiments are conducted on aluminium alloy 7020 -T 6 with different tool geometries to analyze the interaction of the tool with the base metal using a knee-type vertical milling machine. Then, the tool geometry which produced defect-free weld is used for further experimentation. The role of tool pin, shoulder and axial load on the formation of defect free weld is analyzed in an innovative experiment, where the tool and base metal interaction is continuously increased by continuously increasing the interference between the tool and base metal. In another experiment the initial abutting interface position with respect to the tool is continuously varied to study the interaction of the tool with the initial interface and to find the positional information where the initial interface is completely eliminated. Further, the tool metal interface condition is studied using a specially designed tribological experiment which simulates the FSW condition. From the base metal point of view, due to the strain, strain rate and temperature imposed on the base metal during the process, the microstructure is altered. In precipitation hardenable aluminium alloys the strengthening precipitates are dissolved or overaged in the weld region depending on the peak temperature in the region, which reduces the joint efficiency. However, the dissolution and overaging are kinetic process. In order to analyze this time dependant softening behavior of the base metal 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6, isothermal annealing and differential scanning calorimetric studies are performed. In order to obtain FSW welds with maximum joint efficiency, the welding temperature should not exceed the “softening temperature” of the base metal. But, to produce defect free welds favorable material flow in the weld nugget is necessary. The material flow and consolidation depend on the process temperature. Hence, for a given tool to produce defect free weld there is a need for minimum temperature. If the weld formation temperature is less than the base metal softening temperature, the weld can be made with 100 % joint efficiency. In order to optimize the FSW parameter which gives defect free weld with lowest possible temperature, an instrumented programmable FSW machine is designed and developed. The machine is designed in such a way that welding parameters – rotation speed, traverse speed and plunging depth – can be continuously varied from the start to end of the weld between given two values. This reduces the number of experimental trials, material and time. Based on the experimental results the following conclusions are derived. 1. The minimum diameter of the pin required for FSW depends on the base metal and tool material property for a given set of parameters. If the pin diameter is insufficient for a given set of welding parameters, it fails during plunging operation itself. 2. There is a minimum <b>diameter</b> of the <b>shoulder</b> for a given diameter of the pin which produces defect free weld. The ratio of pin to shoulder to produce a defect free weld is not a constant value. It changes with tool geometry and process parameters. 3. Increasing the area of contact between the tool and shoulder for a given set of parameters increases the heat input and results in increased weld nugget grain size. 4. Initial abutting interface of the base metal is eliminated at the leading edge of the tool. However, new surfaces are generated due to interaction with the tool and the newer surfaces are consolidated at the trailing edge of the tool. Importantly, the weld strength is controlled by the defects generated due the improper elimination of newly generated surfaces. 5. Optimal axial load is required to generate the required pressure to consolidate the transferred material at the trailing edge of the tool and should be equal to the flow stress of the material at the processing temperature. The optimal axial load is 8. 1 kN for a tool having 20 mm <b>diameter</b> <b>shoulder</b> with 6 mm diameter frustum shaped pin. 6. Only the material that approaches the tool at the leading edge on the advancing side is stirred and the remaining material is simply extruded around the tool. Further, the initial abutting interface is completely removed only when it is located in the stirring zone, otherwise the initial abutting interface is not eliminated. In the present study the interface is completely stirred when it is located on the advancing side of the tool between 0. 5 mm away from the centerline and edge of the tool. 7. The temperature and pressure at the tool–base metal interface is above the temperature and pressure required for seizure to occur for given tool material (H 13) and base metal (7020 -T 6). Hence, it is clear that during FSW the base metal transfers on to the tool and interaction occurs between transferred layer on tool and base metal. The coefficient of friction between the given tool material and base metal in FSW condition is in the range of 1. 2 – 1. 4. 8. The minimum temperature requirement for FSW of 7020 -T 6 is 400 oC and 6061 -T 6 is 430 oC. However, 7020 -T 6 and 6061 -T 6 softens at lower temperatures than that of the minimum FSW temperature. 7020 -T 6 softens 30 % in 7 min at 250 oC, 4 min at 300 oC, 2 min at 350 oC and 1 min at 400 oC. After softening 30 %, there is 10 % recovery in hardness and the hardness remains constant thereafter. Whereas 6061 -T 6 softens gradually up to 47 % in 7 min at 350 oC and 400 oC, below the temperature of 250 oC for 7020 -T 6 and 350 oC for 6061 -T 6 there is no softening observed in 7 min. 9. The maximum joint efficiency of the 7020 -T 6 weld is 82 % and 6061 -T 6 weld is 60 %. 10. The reduction in joint efficiency is attributed to overaging of the material in the heat affected zone...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} work is to analyze the {{influence}} of <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameter</b> and plunge depth on the formability of friction stir welded sheets. The base material used for welding and forming was AA 6061 -T 6. Formability evaluation was performed through limiting dome height tests. The forming limit curve, FLC (only in the stretching region), thickness distribution, and strain hardening exponent of the weld region were monitored during formability studies. It is found from the work that the forming limit of friction stir welded sheets is better than unwelded sheets. In general, {{with an increase in}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>diameter</b> and plunge depth, the forming limit is found to improve considerably. With a decrease in thickness gradient severity and an increase in strain hardening exponent (n) of the weld region, the forming limit is found to increase. The increase in n value of the weld region is believed to occur because of the reduction in dislocation density. The maximum thickness difference is higher in the retreating side, rather than in the advancing side, of the weld. This is due to the differential straining and hardness levels attained by both sides during friction stir welding...|$|E
