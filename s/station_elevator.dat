25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Canadian Northern Railway, the J.D. Douglas General Store, {{blacksmith}} shop, railway <b>station,</b> <b>elevator,</b> stock yards, section master's house and were built. Over the next few years, the post office moved to Argyle Village, more homes were built and the new Brant Consolidated School (now Brant-Argyle School) was constructed (1914). This united three small schools (Brant, Bruce & McLeod) in the region. The railway made it easier to ship materials to and from the district, in 1919 the CNoR was assumed by the Canadian National Railway which operated it until 1991.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{entrance}} {{at the head}} of Fort Washington Avenue, where it ends at Margaret Corbin Circle. There is also {{an entrance}} at the west side of Bennett Avenue {{on the bottom of the}} ridge, midblock between Broadway and 192nd Street, consisting of a passageway to the mezzanine and the elevator banks. The building for the entrance on Fort Washington Avenue was originally a plain brick one, but it was later given a stone facade to harmonize it with the entrance to Fort Tryon Park, which lies directly across Margaret Corbin Circle. Fare control is located in one central location on the lower mezzanine level. The elevators are available for use at no charge for pedestrians going between Hudson Heights, on top of the ridge, to the Broadway valley of Washington Heights at the bottom. Because of stairs at the Ft. Washington Avenue entrance, the pedestrian connection is not handicap accessible. There is an accessible pedestrian connection at 184th street using the 181st <b>Station</b> <b>elevator.</b>|$|E

The 190th Street <b>station</b> <b>elevators</b> lead to the entrance at Bennett Avenue north of West 193rd Street, and the 184th Street elevators go to Overlook Terrace and 184th Street. When originally built, fare control for both of these entrances were in the station house, outside the elevators, which meant that they could only be used by paying a subway fare, but both have had fare control moved down to the mezzanine level, making the elevators free for neighborhood residents to use, and providing easier pedestrian connection between Hudson Heights and the rest of Washington Heights.|$|R

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{elevator}} operators {{working in}} the New York City Subway system. They are located at four stations: 168th Street, 181st Street, 190th Street, and 191st Street subway stations in Washington Heights, upper Manhattan. In these <b>stations,</b> <b>elevators</b> serve as the sole means of non-emergency access. The elevators were made automated during the 1970s, but the operators were retained, albeit being reduced in quantity in 2003. The elevator operators in the New York City Subway system serve as crowd controllers, and elevator operators usually had other jobs in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority prior to being assigned to that job.|$|R

5000|$|Ad creep says, [...] "There are ads in schools, airport lounges, doctors offices, movie theaters, hospitals, gas <b>stations,</b> <b>elevators,</b> {{convenience}} stores, on the Internet, on fruit, on ATMs, on {{garbage cans}} {{and countless other}} places. There are ads on beach sand and restroom walls." [...] "One of the ironies of advertising in our times is that as commercialism increases, it makes it that {{much more difficult for}} any particular advertiser to succeed, hence pushing the advertiser to even greater efforts." [...] Within a decade advertising in radios climbed to nearly 18 or 19 minutes per hour, on prime-time television the standard until 1982 was no more than 9.5 minutes of advertising per hour, today it is between 14 and 17 minutes. With the introduction of the shorter 15-second-spot the total amount of ads increased even more. Ads are not only placed in breaks but also into sports telecasts during the game itself. They flood the Internet, a growing market.|$|R

The 190th Street station, along with the 191st Street station, has {{the distinction of being}} one of the deepest in the entire subway system by distance to ground level. Therefore, the IND 181st Street and 190th Street <b>stations</b> provide <b>elevator</b> connections between Hudson Heights, {{on the top of the}} ridge, and the Broadway valley of Washington Heights below. The IRT 191st Street <b>station</b> also has <b>elevators</b> to street level.|$|R
25|$|Proposals {{usually have}} {{stations}} close together, and located on side tracks so that through traffic can bypass vehicles picking up or dropping off passengers. Each station might have multiple berths, with perhaps {{one-third of the}} vehicles in a system being stored at stations waiting for passengers.
