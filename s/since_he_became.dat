5|$|Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was {{appointed}} as his replacement, initially {{on a temporary}} basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day}} of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> president three years prior.|$|E
5|$|The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season.

25|$|With another general {{election}} approaching in 1970 a Conservative policy document {{emerged from the}} Selsdon Park Hotel that offered free-market oriented policies as solutions to the country's unemployment and inflation problems. Heath stated that the Selsdon weekend only reaffirmed policies that had actually been evolving <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> leader of the Conservative Party. The Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, thought the document a vote-loser and dubbed it the product of Selsdon Man – after the supposedly prehistoric Piltdown Man – to portray it as reactionary. Heath's Conservative Party won the {{general election}} of 1970 with 330 seats to Labour's 287. The new cabinet included Margaret Thatcher (Education and Science), William Whitelaw (Leader of the House of Commons) and {{the former prime minister}} Alec Douglas-Home (Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs).|$|E

25|$|Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was {{the leader}} of the National Socialist German Workers' Party and Chancellor of Nazi Germany from 1933 (Führer from 1934) to 1945. Hitler has been {{represented}} in popular culture ever <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a well-known politician in Germany. His distinctive image was often parodied by his opponents. Parodies became much more prominent outside Germany during his period in power. Since the end of World War II representations of Hitler, both serious and satirical, have continued to be prominent in popular culture, sometimes generating significant controversy. In many periodicals, books, and movies, Hitler and Nazism fulfill the role of archetypal evil. This treatment is not confined to fiction but is widespread amongst nonfiction writers who have discussed him in this vein. Hitler has retained a fascination from other perspectives; among many comparable examples is an exhibition at the German Historical Museum which was widely attended.|$|E
25|$|Scott Stadium {{sits across}} from the first-year dorms along Alderman Road and {{is home to the}} University of Virginia's {{football}} program. The press box at Scott Stadium was a gift from an alumnus in honor of Norton G. Pritchett, the admired athletic director at UVA from 1934 until his death in 1950. Students, fans and alumni began to sport orange clothing for the games, a new tradition the former head coach, Al Groh, had been pushing for <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> head coach in 2000. Many students, however, have continued to wear the traditional sundresses or coats and ties at football games. Several fans have also begun garbing themselves in outlandish costumes in the style of football superfans (such as the Orange Gorilla or The Superhoo). Funding from benefactor Carl Smith created the foundation for the 280-piece Cavalier Marching Band in 2004, replacing the Virginia Pep Band in its official capacity at athletic events. The current head coach is Bronco Mendenhall, former head coach at BYU, who replaced Mike London in December 2015.|$|E

Despite Key's office claiming Fletcher was [...] "the best candidate for the job", Fletcher {{was in fact the}} only candidate interviewed. Key said he hadn't originally mentioned the phone call because he [...] "forgot". Political commentator Bryce Edwards called it the [...] "most appalling political management <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> Prime Minister back in 2008".

2500|$|According to Hasan of Basra Iblis {{was already}} a Jinni in heaven, and was banished after he sinned by refusing God's command to bow before Adam.

Ibn Arabi {{describes}} in his work Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya Iblis was not the first Jinni, but the first who refused to obey, thus he was the first demon. Among some Muslim traditions assuming Iblis to be the father of the Jinn, still gives him an angelic origin, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a Jinni after his fall.|$|E
