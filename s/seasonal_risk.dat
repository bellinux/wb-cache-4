50|$|A key {{component}} in Integrated Pest Management for museums {{is the ability}} to identify the pests causing issues so the museum staff can establish a plan of attack to remove the pest from the building. Traps can be used to identify the pests, the extent of infestation, and determine the source of the infestation. All of the identification information on the pests should be documented {{to keep track of the}} pests, points of entry, and potential damage the pest may cause. Having these “records of inspection results...will help identify <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> factors and areas with a high frequency of problems”. The museum should review the data and ask “can we simply remove the pest? are eggs present? what is the least damaging approach to treatment?”. Once a museum have this information written down and confirmed by all those involved in the program, a treatment strategy can be planned and implemented.|$|E

40|$|Heat {{waves and}} cold spells pose ongoing <b>seasonal</b> <b>risks</b> {{to the health}} and {{well-being}} of vulnerable individuals. Current attempts to address these risks in the UK are implemented through fuel-poverty strategies and heat-wave planning. This paper examines evidence from the UK on whether heat waves and cold spells are addressed differently by public policy in the UK given that risks are mediated by similar perceptions that shape behavioural responses by vulnerable individuals. It is based on a review of UK policies and on a qualitative interview study of risk perceptions of elderly people as a primary identified vulnerable group to these weather extremes. The study involved in-depth repeat interviews with fifteen elderly respondents in summer 2007 and winter 2008 in Norwich (UK). Results suggest that neither heat risks nor cold risks are perceived as personal risks and therefore planned preventive measures by individuals are largely elusive. Cold risk policy reduces vulnerability; policy related to heat relies on early warning and public information programmes and does not reduce underlying vulnerability. Both types of policies largely ignore public perceptions of risks and could benefit from a more cohesive approach, supporting similar measures to reduce seasonal vulnerability. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of commodity markets calls for advanced models {{to capture and}} analyze complex properties of the markets. This dissertation focuses on a large sector: the US natural gas market, and consists of three papers where three stochastic models are proposed to investigate the distinct characteristics of the market. Model parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood functions {{with the aid of}} the Kalman filter and the Kim filter. The first paper explores the multi-factor structure and risk premiums implied from the natural gas spot and futures. The model features a two-short-term/one-long-term structure, time-varying risk premiums and a <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> premium. We find that three factors and the <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> premium are needed to accurately describe the term structure of the natural gas futures. The coefficients for the time-varying risk premiums are significant. We also reveal a negative correlation between the <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> premium and the uncertainty of the natural gas total consumption. The second paper deals with the changing slope of the natural gas futures long-end curve. We develop a Markov regime-switching model with a regime-dependent drift term under the equivalent martingale measure. The model has two factors and three regimes to capture three basic cases of the changing slope. The estimation results show that the model is able to produce a downward/flat/upward slope in each regime and classifies the regime status generally consistent with the observation. Through detailed model comparisons, we find that models without the regimes or the two factors lead to poor results. The third paper considers the variance dynamics of the natural gas futures returns. We directly model and estimate the variance dynamics. The model incorporates two variance factors, the Samuelson effect and seasonality. The estimation is implemented using a dataset of synthesized variance swap rates on the futures across the term-structure dimension. The rates are computed by integrating prices of relevant futures options across the strike dimension. The results indicate the existence of the Samuelson effect, seasonal variance and a negative variance risk premium. In addition, the two-factor setup exhibits its advantage along the term-structure dimension...|$|E
40|$|Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) is a {{physically}} and economically devastating parasitic trematode whose rise {{in recent years}} has been attributed to climate change. Climate has an impact on the free-living stages of the parasite and its intermediate host Lymnaea truncatula, with the interactions between rainfall and temperature having the greatest influence on transmission efficacy. There have been a number of short term climate driven forecasts developed to predict the following season’s infection risk, with the Ollerenshaw index being the most widely used. Through the synthesis of a modified Ollerenshaw index with the UKCP 09 fine scale climate projection data we have developed long term <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> forecasts up to 2070 at a 25 km square resolution. Additionally UKCIP gridded datasets at 5 km square resolution from 1970 - 2006 were used to highlight the climate-driven increase to date. The maps show unprecedented levels of future fasciolosis risk in parts of the UK, with risk of serious epidemics in Wales by 2050. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> maps demonstrate the possible change in the timing of disease outbreaks due to increased risk from overwintering larvae. Despite an overall long term increase in all regions of the UK, spatio-temporal variation in risk levels is expected. Infection risk will reduce in some areas and fluctuate greatly in others with a predicted decrease in summer infection for parts of the UK due to restricted water availability. This forecast is the first approximation of the potential impacts of climate change on fasciolosis risk in the UK. It can be used as a basis for indicating where active disease surveillance should be targeted and where the development of improved mitigation o...|$|E

It is found that, on average, there are significant positive risk premiums in short-term electricity futures prices. The significance and size of the premiums, however, varies seasonally over the year; whereas it is greatest during winter, it is zero in summer. It is also found that time-varying risk premiums are significantly related to unexpectedly low reservoir levels. Furthermore, before the unprecedented supply-shock that hit the market around the end of year 2002, the risk premiums were related to the variance and the skewness of future spot prices.

Suicidal ideation is a common symptom in depressed mothers. Depression and suicidality vary across the seasons in many populations. We examined the relationship between <b>seasonal</b> variation and <b>risk</b> for depression risk and suicidal ideation (SI) in postpartum women. From 2006 - 2010, women who were 4 - 6 weeks after delivery received telephone screenings for postpartum depression (PPD) with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The outcome variables were: EPDS≥ 10 (depression risk) and EPDS item 10 ≥ 1 (suicidality). The explanatory variable included the calendar months of the year. We used spectral analysis to explore <b>seasonal</b> variations in <b>risk</b> for depression and suicidal symptoms. The team screened 9339 women; 1316 (14 %) women had positive EPDS≥ 10 scores which suggested PPD risk; 294 (3 %) women had suicidal ideation (EPDS item 10 ≥ 1). Patients with depression risk had high odds for any SI (OR= 41; 95 %CI 30 - 59). Depression risk peaked in the winter. We detected no <b>seasonal</b> effect on <b>risk</b> for suicidal symptoms.

Homesteads operationally targeted for IRS and ITNs during a district-based emergency response undertaken by an international relief agency were selected at random for evaluation. Five hundred and ninety homesteads were selected (200 with no vector control, 200 with IRS and 190 with ITNs). In July 2000, residents in these homesteads were randomly sampled according to three age-groups: 6 months- 4 years, 5 - 15 years, and > 15 years {{for the presence of}} P. falciparum antigen (Pf HRP- 2) using the rapid whole blood immunochromatographic test (ICT). The prevalence of P. falciparum infection amongst household members not protected by either IRS or ITN was 13 %. Sleeping under a treated bednet reduced the risk of infection by 63 % (58 - 68 %) and sleeping in a room sprayed with insecticide reduced the risk by 75 % (73 - 76 %). The economic cost per infection case prevented by IRS was US$ 9 compared to US$ 29 for ITNs. This study suggests that IRS may be both more effective and cheaper than ITNs in communities subjected to low, <b>seasonal</b> <b>risks</b> of infection and as such should be considered as part of the control armamentarium for malaria prevention...|$|R
40|$|The Malden River {{is located}} in the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts. The River {{has a long history of}} abuse and neglect {{stemming}} from urbanization and industrial activity along the River and in the surrounding areas. Community groups, however, are advocating restoration of the Malden River to a healthy and thriving ecosystem that also provides a viable outdoor recreational area for the local community. There is concern, however, that bacterial concentrations are at levels that can cause excess gastrointestinal illness to recreational users. As part of assessing this issue, I performed a recreational risk assessment based on microbial concentration data from water quality sampling performed by the Mystic River Watershed Association (MyRWA) and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). A significant difference in the bacterial data from the two organizations, in which samples are taken approximately one mile from each other, was found. This indicated the possibility of significant bacterial variability in the River and, therefore, risk was calculated separately for each data set. The Wiedenmann (2007) dose response model was used to analyze risk; however, not all site-specific parameters were known. Overall risk, risk after significant rainfall, and <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> were all analyzed. Using the Wiedenmann risk model, I determined that after 0. 5 inches of rain in 72 hours, exposure associated with primary and secondary recreation causes the incremental risk to double. The overall and <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> analysis showed that the risks associated with the MyRWA sampling location were consistently at least twice that of the MWRA location. by Margaret Jacques.

In this model both short and long-run factors are unobservable and are hence estimated as latent variables using the Kalman filter. The proposed model has several advantages. First, it seems to capture in a parsimonious way the most important risks that practitioners face in the market, such as spike risk, short-term risk and long-term risk. Second, it explains the <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> premium observed in the market and improves the fit between theoretical and observed forward prices, particularly for long-dated forward contracts. Finally, closed-form solutions for forward contracts, derived from the model, are consistent {{with the fact that the}} correlation between contracts of different maturities is imperfect.

40|$|Two {{opposing}} hypotheses concerning {{determinants of}} mangabey (Cerco-cebus albigena) ranging patterns have been advocated. One hypothesis suggests that ranging patterns of mangabeys are largely {{a response to}} fruit availability, while the other hypothesis advocates that concerns of fruit availability are supplemented or overridden by concerns of fecal contamination and {{that the risk of}} parasite infection, especially during dry weather, determines their pattern of range use. In this 9 month study of mangabeys in the Kanyawara study area of Kibale National Park, mangabeys moved longer distances during the wet season than during the dry season. There were no seasonal differences in group spread, num-ber of 50 by 50 m quadrats used, or in quadrat overlap between sequen-tial sample periods. Intensity of quadrat use was closely related to the number of fruiting trees/lianas in the quadrats, irrespective of season.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} {{was performed to}} identify risk factors for seabather's eruption. METHODS: Study participants were recruited at four beaches in Palm Beach County, Florida, during three weekends of May and June 1993. Participants were interviewed by telephone after 48 hours regarding medical history, beach activities, development of rashes, and use of possible preventive measures. RESULTS: Seabather's eruption, defined by the occurrence of a rash within two days of exposure to seawater, was reported by 114 (16 %) of 735 respondents. The strongest predictor of seabather's eruption was a past history of the condition. Children less than 16 years of age were also at increased risk, as were surfers. Showering with one's bathing suit off was a useful protective measure. CONCLUSION: The study's findings suggest that when the <b>seasonal</b> <b>risk</b> of seabather's eruption is present, children, people {{with a history of}} seabather's eruption, and surfers are at greatest risk.

Through this research, it was determined that decisions about the fire management system used by farming households and community plantations are primarily made at the provincial level, with their implementation (and funding) delegated to the district and village levels. The clarity of roles and responsibilities mean that {{a relatively small number of}} key staff at the provincial level needed to be convinced of the utility of <b>seasonal</b> fire <b>risk</b> information.

The average seasonal rate of excess P&I hospitalization was 49 (range, 8 ± 102) / 100, 000 persons, but average rates were twice as high during A(H 3 N 2) in¯uenza seasons as during A(H 1 N 1) /B seasons.

This paper examines the role of the derivatives market in South Africa and provides policy options for promoting the development of derivatives markets in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa’s derivatives market has grown rapidly in recent years, supporting capital inflows and helping market participants to price, unbundle and transfer risk. There are tight regulations on asset allocations by insurance and pension funds to prevent excessive risk taking. The development of derivatives markets in sub-Saharan African countries could enable market participants to self-insure against volatile capital flows.

40|$|A {{seasonal}} affine jump diffusion spike {{model with}} regime switching in the long-run equilibrium level {{is applied to}} model spot and forward prices in the Scandinavian power market. The spike part of the model incorporates different coefficients of mean reversion in the spike and normal variables and thus improves the spot-forward relationship, particularly at time periods when spikes occur. The regime switching part of the model contains two separate regimes to distinguish between periods {{of high and low}} water levels in the reservoirs, reflecting the availability of hydropower in the market. The performance of the models is compared with that of other models proposed in the literature in terms of fitting the observed term structure, as well as by generating simulated price paths that have the same statistical properties as the actual prices observed in the market. In particular, the model performs well in terms of capturing the spikes and explaining their fast mean reversion as well as in terms of reflecting the seasonal volatility observed in the market.

30|$|As a {{collection}} of papers, the volume highlights the challenges of understanding complex socioecological systems operating at multiple scales. Ecology can provide a useful framework for exploring evolving human-animal relationships {{from the very start}} of animal husbandry (e.g. Bendrey 2014), but in terms of understanding pastoral systems, we must also be aware of the possible variations in practices, such as the directions and timings of movements within the same ecological context (e.g. Behnke et al. 2011). As advocated by Shutes, studies of contextualised pastoral systems allow understanding of the social adaptations that have emerged to mediate <b>seasonal</b> shortage, <b>risk</b> and uncertainty. These can be directly observable in ethnographic studies but are more challenging to demonstrate in the archaeological record; however, increasing analytical power is being brought through modelling approaches that can explore and test past relationships (e.g. Rogers et al. 2012). The combination of past and present perspectives adds significant value and richness to this volume, and together, the studies demonstrate the depth and breadth of ongoing research into the ecology of pastoralism.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{geographical}} {{information systems}} model that identifies regions of the United States of America (USA) susceptible to West Nile virus (WNV) transmission risk is presented. This system has previously been calibrated and tested in the western USA; {{in this paper we}} use datasets of WNV-killed birds from South Carolina and Connecticut to test the model in the eastern USA. Because their response to WNV infection is highly predictable, American crows were chosen as the primary source for model calibration and testing. Where crow data are absent, other birds are shown to be an effective substitute. Model results show that the same calibrated model demonstrated to work in the western USA has the same predictive ability in the eastern USA, allowing for a continental-scale evaluation of the transmission risk of WNV at a daily time step. The calibrated model is independent of mosquito species and requires inputs of only local maximum and minimum temperatures.

40|$|Abstract—Oceanic storms are {{the main}} reason for {{shipping}} delays in the North Atlantic Ocean, due to the uncertainty in the forecast of tropical cyclones and extra tropical winter storms. This work investigates the relation between the statistical storm risk and the accuracy of the wind and wave forecast in the North Atlantic. The evaluation is based on historical wind and wave forecast data from the German Weather Service (DWD) between August, 2005 and November, 2010. First of all the regional storm risk in the North Atlantic is assessed. For this purpose 11 different storm clusters have been identified in the historical weather data with a non-parametric clustering algorithm. It shows that the storm risk varies between the storm clusters regionally as well as seasonally. Furthermore a correlation was found between the storm risk and the wind speed and wave height forecast root mean squared error (RMSE). The results allow for estimating future forecast accuracy based on the assessment of the regional and <b>seasonal</b> storm <b>risk.</b> Index Terms—Wind and wave forecast accuracy, North Atlantic Ocean, storminess, risk management.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{displays a}} month-of-birth effect, with {{an excess of}} individuals being born {{in the spring and}} a deficit in the winter. This effect was shown to be more pronounced in familial cases of MS. In the present study, we investigated whether this month-of-birth association has any relation to the principal MS susceptibility gene, HLA-DRB 1. METHODS: A total of 4, 834 patients with MS, 4, 056 controls, and 659 unaffected siblings from Canada, Sweden, and Norway were genotyped for the HLA-DRB 1 gene. Month of birth was compared for patients, controls, and unaffected siblings with and without the MS risk allele HLA-DRB 1 * 15. RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients with MS carrying the HLA-DRB 1 * 15 risk allele were born in November compared with patients not carrying this allele (p = 0. 02). Additionally, patients with MS carrying HLA-DRB 1 * 15 had a higher number of April births compared with patients with MS not carrying HLA-DRB 1 * 15 (p = 0. 004). These differences were not present in controls or unaffected siblings. CONCLUSIONS: Month of birth, HLA-DRB 1 genotype, and risk of multiple sclerosis are associated.

We included all nuclear reactors that are currently operational, under construction and planned or proposed.

Based on the continued operation of the current nuclear power plants, we calculate that the risk of radioactive contamination to the citizens of the USA will remain to be highest worldwide, followed by India and France.

Blankets picked up {{the greatest number of}} ticks, but heel flags provided important complementary counts of the immature stages in bracken plots; they showed clearly that the decline in tick numbers on blankets in early summer was due to the seasonal growth of vegetation that lifted the blanket clear of the typical questing height, but in reality ticks remained abundant through the summer. Leggings picked up only 11 % of the total nymphs and 22 % of total adults counted, but this still represented a significant hazard to humans. These results should prompt a greater awareness of the fine-scale distribution of this species in relation to human activities that determines the most likely zones of contact between humans and ticks. Risk communication may then be designed accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal climate {{forecasts}} {{could be}} an important planning tool for farmers, government and insurance companies {{that can lead to}} better and timely management of <b>seasonal</b> climate <b>risks.</b> However, climate <b>seasonal</b> forecasts are often under-used, because potential users are not well aware of the capabilities and limitations of these products. This study aims at assessing the merits and caveats of a statistical empirical method, the ensemble streamflow prediction system (ESP, an ensemble based on reordering historical data) and an operational dynamical forecast system, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts—System 4 (S 4) in predicting summer drought in Europe. Droughts are defined using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for the month of August integrated over 6 months. Both systems show useful and mostly comparable deterministic skill. We argue that this source of predictability is mostly attributable to the observed initial conditions. S 4 shows only higher skill in terms of ability to probabilistically identify drought occurrence. Thus, currently, both approaches provide useful information and ESP represents a computationally fast alternative to dynamical prediction applications for drought prediction. JRC.

40|$|Coronary {{heart disease}} {{exhibits}} a winter peak and summer trough in incidence and mortality, in countries both {{north and south}} of the equator. In England and Wales, the winter peak accounts for an additional 20 000 deaths per annum. It is likely that this reflects <b>seasonal</b> variations in <b>risk</b> factors. <b>Seasonal</b> variations have been demonstrated in a number of lifestyle risk factors such a physical activity and diet. However, {{a number of studies have}} also suggested a direct effect of environmental temperature on physiological and rheological factors. We review the available evidence on seasonal variations in coronary heart disease and possible explanations for them...|$|R
40|$|A {{geographical}} {{information systems}} model that identifies regions of the United States of America (USA) susceptible to West Nile virus (WNV) transmission risk is presented. This system has previously been calibrated and tested in the western USA; {{in this paper we}} use datasets of WNV-killed birds from South Carolina and Connecticut to test the model in the eastern USA. Because their response to WNV infection is highly predictable, American crows were chosen as the primary source for model calibration and testing. Where crow data are absent, other birds are shown to be an effective substitute. Model results show that the same calibrated model demonstrated to work in the western USA has the same predictive ability in the eastern USA, allowing for a continental-scale evaluation of the transmission risk of WNV at a daily time step. The calibrated model is independent of mosquito species and requires inputs of only local maximum and minimum temperatures. Of benefit to the general public and vector control districts, the model predicts the onset of <b>seasonal</b> transmission <b>risk,</b> although it is less effective at identifying the end of the transmission risk season...|$|R
