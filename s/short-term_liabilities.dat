2500|$|Managing the corporation's {{working capital}} {{position}} to sustain ongoing business operations {{is referred to}} as working capital management. These involve managing the relationship between a firm's short-term assets and its <b>short-term</b> <b>liabilities.</b> In general this is as follows: As above, the goal of Corporate Finance is the maximization of firm value. In the context of long term, capital budgeting, firm value is enhanced through appropriately selecting and funding NPV positive investments. These investments, in turn, have implications in terms of cash flow and cost of capital. The goal of Working Capital (i.e. short term) management is therefore to ensure that the firm is able to operate, and that it has sufficient cash flow to service long-term debt, and to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses. In so doing, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the cost of capital; See Economic value added (EVA). [...] Managing short term finance and long term finance is one task of a modern CFO.|$|E
5000|$|A bank {{could also}} have {{substantial}} long-term assets (such as fixed-rate mortgages) funded by <b>short-term</b> <b>liabilities,</b> such as deposits. If short-term interest rates rise, the <b>short-term</b> <b>liabilities</b> re-price at maturity, while the yield on the longer-term, fixed-rate assets remains unchanged. Income from the longer-term assets remains unchanged, while {{the cost of the}} newly re-priced liabilities funding these assets increases. This is sometimes called a maturity mismatch, which can be measured by the duration gap.|$|E

40|$|Debt arrears {{occur when}} {{scheduled}} payments (repayment of principal or coupons) {{are not made}} by their due-for-payment date. The current statistical manuals seem to follow two separate bases for time of recording for repayments of debts. I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issue In general, all macroeconomic statistics use the accrual basis for determining time of recording. However, the treatment differs for arrears. The External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users (External Debt Guide) defines arrears as amounts that are past due-forpayment and unpaid (paras. 3. 36, 3. 37). The time of recording basis followed in the BPM 5 (paras. 123, 528), External Debt Guide (paras. 2. 29, 3. 36), and Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001; para. 9. 19) is that when a debt liability goes into arrears, transactions are imputed as if the repayment of debt liability had been made and a new <b>short-term</b> <b>liability</b> created. This time of recording basis conforms with the due-for-payment basis as repayments are recorded {{at the time they}} are due. The treatment followed, in principle, in the 1993 SNA (paras. 3. 94 and 11. 101) and Monetar...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a very rapid rise since the early 1990 s in foreign {{reserves}} held by developing countries. These reserves have climbed to almost 30 % of developing countries' GDP and 8 months of imports. Assuming reasonable spreads between the yield on reserve assets and the cost of foreign borrowing, the income loss to these countries amounts to close to 1 % of GDP. Conditional on existing levels of short-term foreign borrowing, this does not represent too steep a price as an insurance premium against financial crises.

Introduction The East Asian crisis has emphazised, among other things, the dangers of maintaining acute mismatches between foreign assets and liabilities, with the latter being short-dated in comparison to the former. To the extent that the East Asian economies are predominantly bank-based, the bulk of the foreign liabilities were incurred by money-centre banks 1. Thus, Rajan (1999) has noted that: (i) n order to understand the boom-bust cycle faced by East Asia, it is therefore important to focus specifically on modeling the financial intermediation process and its impact [...] ...|$|R

40|$|New {{empirical}} evidence {{with regards to}} the effectiveness and efficiency of Chile’s capital controls is provided here, based on more and better data on the range of controls and a broad assessment of their costs and benefits. The paper concludes that capital controls have been partially effective by raising the wedge between domestic and foreign interest rates, reducing aggregate net capital inflows, and changing the debt composition toward longer maturities, without significantly altering the real exchange rate. Part of these effects is temporary as the effectiveness of controls is eroded over time for a given interest rates differential. Controls may have been crucial by contributing to Chile’s lower exposure to <b>short-term</b> foreign <b>liabilities</b> {{at the time of the}} 1997 - 98 international financial turmoil. However, achieving temporary macroeconomic benefits by relying on capital controls involves incurring in financial and growth effects that raise concerns about their efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} modern {{readers to}} the basic understanding of the banking system that was held by academics and practitioners {{in the early years}} of the 20 th century – that is, to traditional banking theory. This theory is completely inconsistent with the theoretic framework that views banks as financial intermediaries that receive deposits and invest those deposits in assets. Thus, this paper first sets forth in detail the basic elements of traditional banking theory and then relates those elements to the modern network effects literature. From this a bank-centered view of the money market is derived: all demand and <b>short-term</b> bank <b>liabilities,</b> including contingent liabilities, are potential money and nearmoney assets, and any non-bank liabilities that have monetary properties will derive them from their relationship with the banking system. This framework is then used to evaluate modern money markets, and this paper finds that indeed the so-called market-based money market in fact functions as a means of reallocating the bank liabilities held (indirectly) by the public from deposits to wholesale and contingent bank liabilities. This paper proposes that bank liability-based measures of the money supply be developed, and that regulators recognize that contingent bank liabilities often function as a substitute for deposits and should be regulated similarly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{private debt}} maturity choices in a dynamic macroeconomic {{model in which}} financial frictions give rise to systemic risk {{in the form of}} amplification effects, and shows that decentralized maturity decisions may result in a socially excessive reliance on <b>short-term</b> debt. Long-term <b>liabilities</b> provide insurance against shocks to the asset side of the balance sheet, but they come at an extra cost. The debt maturity structure therefore maps into an allocation of aggregate risk between lenders and leveraged borrowers, and fundamental shocks propagate more powerfully in the economy when the maturity is shorter. The market equilibrium is not constrained efficient as borrowers fail to internalize their contribution to systemic risk and take on too much short-term debt in a decentralized economy.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has revealed deficiencies of the Russian economic system which {{are caused by}} {{the path of the}} transformation from central planning to the market economy, and not only attributable to the downfall of crude oil prices. While the worldwide liquidity crunch impaired the availability of loans to enterprises, the situation in Russia has deteriorated especially by the large exposure of the private sector to <b>short-term</b> foreign <b>liabilities</b> and by the one-sided orientation of the economy relying on the natural resources industry. Until the mid- 2008, the foreign debt of the private banks and non-banks had increased strongly and had strengthened the dependence of the Russian economy on the developments on the international financial markets. The Ruble devaluation at the end of January 2009 aggravated the situation. The high short-term foreign debt of the private sector and the dependence on exports of natural resources are typical outcomes of the Russian transformation path. Therefore, on the one hand, the banking sector has not being able to satisfy financing demand of the private sector beyond the natural resources industries, enterprises became forced to borrow short-term money abroad. On the other hand, the economic strategy of the past seventeen years has strengthened the influence of the state on the natural resources sector – with the strong priority to develop it further. Hence, the one-sided economic development negatively affects the adaptability of the real-economic sector to change during the crisis period. In essence, the present political preferences of the government are aimed at providing direct financial assistance and at protectionist measures. In the long run, these actions could lead to stronger intervention of the state in the economy. Due to these recent developments, the crisis is likely to continue in Russia longer than in the other transformation countries. ...|$|R
