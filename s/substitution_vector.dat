40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{generating}} phage collections representing eukaryotic genomes {{has been developed}} by using a novel bacteriophage lambda vector, lambda 1059. The phage is a BamHI <b>substitution</b> <b>vector</b> that accommodates DNA fragments 6 - 24 kilobases long. Production of recombinants in lambda 1059 requires deletion of the lambda red and gamma genes. The recombinants are therefore spi- and may {{be separated from the}} spi+ vector phages by plating on strains lysogenic for bacteriophage P 2. Random fragments suitable for insertion into lambda 1059 are obtained by partial digestion of high molecular weight eukaryotic DNA with Sau 3 a. This restriction enzyme cleaves at the sequence G-A-T-C and leaves a 5 '-tetranucleotide "sticky end. " Because G-A-T-C extensions are also produced by BamHI cleavage, these fragments may be annealed directly to BamHI-cleaved lambda 1059. By using these methods, a set of clones covering the entire Caenorhabditis elegans genome was constructed. DNA segments which include the unc- 54 myosin heavy chain gene have been isolated from this collection...|$|E

An intertemporal model captures the extent into which non-traded goods consumption affects traded-goods consumption, clarifying the roles of intratemporal or intertemporal <b>substitution.</b> <b>Vector</b> autoregressions (VARs) show that the 1 % shock to non-traded goods consumption affects traded-goods consumption by − 2 % immediately, reverting to zero only after one year, supporting the intratemporal channel. Real exchange rate (RER) shocks exert considerable macroeconomic fluctuations. The 1 % shock to RER affects traded goods consumption by − 2 % immediately, reaching − 5 % one year later. At the expense of income shocks, RER shocks grow in explanatory power over time: from 20 %– 25 % at 1 quarter to 65 %– 69 % of the variance of traded goods consumption 3 years later. Figures for the current account range from 14 % to 68 %, while income shocks appear less important. In contrast, for non-traded goods, RER shocks roughly match the quantitative importance of income shocks, reinforcing the theoretical analysis.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the theoretical and applied {{aspects of the}} economic policy of import substitution, the imperatives of its effectiveness, institutional conditions and prospects for the policy of import substitution in the Russian economy. Modern approaches to the policy of import substitution, which reflect the real macroeconomic processes and have a scientific and advisory capacity for forward movement of the national economic system and economics allow us to consider import substitution as an element of national economic development strategy, which shows the internal processes of production, consumption and state regulation mechanisms within certain trajectory of economic dynamics. The paper shows {{that the key to}} the implementation of the import substitution policy is to analyze the structural and institutional conditions that will ensure high rates of economic and social growth of the national economy. The main functions of the state policy in the implementation of import substitution are stimulating domestic demand and private investment in the modernization of national import-substitution industries, the formation of conditions for sustainable long-term development of domestic industrial complex as an alternative raw material economy.

Almost all average data are plotted close to the <b>substitution</b> <b>vectors</b> of Fe and Mg cations into T or M sites. Fe-Mg plagioclases are crystallized as Mg-rich plagioclases (An_) in C 3 or CV 3 chondrites, whereas Fe-rich plagioclases (An_) are predominantly crystallized in H 6,L 6 or LL 6 chondrites. The maximum contents of Mg and Fe are 0. 343 (per formula unit in O= 8) in Allende (CV 3) and 0. 126 in Plainview (H 5) chondrites, respectively, though maskelynite has much more Mg and Fe contents with excess total cations. Chemical heterogeneity of plagioclase in eight chondrites and Juvinas eucrite can be shown by the number of regions in An-content vs. Fe/(Fe+Mg) diagram; that is, three distinct regions of Willard (L 6), ALH- 769, 75 (L 6) and Plainview (H 5); two regions of Holbrook (L 6), Y- 74640, 81 (H 6), Allende (CV 3) and ALH- 77307, 85 (C 3); and single region of Y- 75258, 97 (LL 6).

Although several machine learning methods have been reported for predicting protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions, the previous studies did not utilize relevant sequence features representing biological knowledge for classifier construction. Results In this study, a new machine learning method has been developed for sequence feature-based prediction of protein stability changes upon amino acid <b>substitutions.</b> Support <b>vector</b> machines were trained with data from experimental studies on the free energy change of protein stability upon mutations. To construct accurate classifiers, twenty sequence features were examined for input vector encoding. It was shown that classifier performance varied significantly by using different sequence features. The most accurate classifier {{in this study was}} constructed using a combination of six sequence features. This classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 84. 59 % with 70. 29 % sensitivity and 90. 98 % specificity. Conclusions Relevant sequence features can be used to accurately predict protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions. Predictive results at this level of accuracy may provide useful information to distinguish between deleterious and tolerant alterations in disease candidate genes.

Lempel and Ziv proved that the proposed schemes were practical as well as asymptotically optimal for a general source model. Two-dimensional (i. e. images) applications of textual substitution methods have been widely studied in the past.

40|$|HIV- 1 derived vectors {{are among}} the most {{efficient}} for gene transduction in mammalian tissues. As the parent virus, they carry out vector genome insertion into the host cell chromatin. Consequently, their preferential integration in transcribed genes raises several conceptual and safety issues. To address part of these questions, HIV-derived vectors have been engineered to be nonintegrating. This was mainly achieved by mutating HIV- 1 integrase at functional hotspots of the enzyme enabling the development of streamlined nuclear DNA circles functional for transgene expression. Few integrase mutant vectors have been successfully tested so far for gene transfer. They are cleared with time in mitotic cells, but stable within nondividing retina cells or neurons. Here, we compared six HIV vectors carrying different integrases, either wild type or with different mutations (D 64 V, D 167 H, Q 168 A, K 186 Q+Q 214 L+Q 216 L, and RRK 262 - 264 AAH) shown to modify integrase enzymatic activity, oligomerization, or interaction with key cellular cofactor of HIV DNA integration as LEDGF/p 75 or TNPO 3.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{wealth of}} {{information}} on protein structure {{has led to a}} variety of statistical analyses of the role played by individual amino acid types in the protein fold. In particular, the contact propensities between the various amino acids can be converted into folding energies that have proved useful in structure prediction. The present study addresses the relationship of protein folding propensities to the evolutionary relationship between residues. Results The contact preferences of residue types observed in a representative sample of protein structures are converted into a residue similarity matrix or inter-residue distance matrix. Remarkably, these distances correlate excellently with evolutionary <b>substitution</b> costs. Residue <b>vectors</b> are derived from the distance matrix. The residue vectors give a concrete picture of the grouping of residues into families sharing properties crucial for protein folding. Conclusions Inter-residue distances have proved useful in showing the explicit relationship between contact preferences and evolutionary substitution rates. It is proposed that the distance matrix derived from structural analysis may be useful in aligning proteins where remote homologs share structural features. Residue vectors derived from the distance matrix illustrate the spatial arrangement of residues and point to ways in which they can be grouped. </p...|$|R

For many purposes (e. g., cell biological interaction studies) it may be desirable to express more than one protein in a single cell but that is often not feasible when using a single virus vector. Such a co-expression strategy requires the simultaneous delivery by two compatible and non-competitive viruses that can co-exist to each express a separate protein.

Upon co-infiltration of the two vectors co-expression was monitored by: molecular detection of the two slightly differently sized GFPs, suppressor-complementation assays, and using TG in combination with TRBO-RFP. All the results revealed that in N. benthamiana and tomato the TBSV and TMV vectors accumulated and expressed proteins in the same plants, the same leaves, and in the same cells.

The 2005 – 2006 epidemic on Reunion island {{that resulted in}} approximately 266, 000 human cases {{was associated with a}} strain of CHIKV with a mutation in the envelope protein gene (E 1 -A 226 V). To test the hypothesis that this mutation in the epidemic CHIKV (strain LR 2006 OPY 1) might influence fitness for different vector species, viral infectivity, dissemination, and transmission of CHIKV were compared in Aedes albopictus, the species implicated in the epidemic, and the recognized vector Ae. aegypti. Using viral infectious clones of the Reunion strain and a West African strain of CHIKV, into which either the E 1 – 226 A or V mutation was engineered, we demonstrated that the E 1 -A 226 V mutation was directly responsible for a significant increase in CHIKV infectivity for Ae. albopictus, and led to more efficient viral dissemination into mosquito secondary organs and transmission to suckling mice. This mutation caused a marginal decrease in CHIKV Ae. aegypti midgut infectivity, had no effect on viral dissemination, and was associated with a slight increase in transmission by Ae. aegypti to suckling mice in competition experiments. The effect of the E 1 -A 226 V mutation on cholesterol dependence of CHIKV was also analyzed, revealing an association between cholesterol dependence and increased fitness of CHIKV in Ae. albopictus. Our observation that a single amino acid <b>substitution</b> can influence <b>vector</b> specificity provides a plausible explanation of how this mutant virus caused an epidemic in a region lacking the typical vector. This has important implications with respect to how viruses may establish a transmission cycle when introduced into a new area.
