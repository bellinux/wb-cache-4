60|$|Attachment.--All the species, except S. villosum, are {{attached}} to horny corallines: the singular means of attachment in S. vulgare will be described under that species, and is probably common to several of the other species. The larva in most, or in all cases, when it proceeds to attach itself, clings head downwards to the branch, and hence the capitulum comes to be placed upwards, with its orifice fronting the branch and the carina outwards. The sucking disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva, in the five species examined, was a little pointed, and in shape resembled the hinder hoof of a mule: this may perhaps {{be accounted for by}} the narrowness of the branches of the corallines, to which it has to adhere: a large circular disc, as in Lepas, would have been worse than useless: the ultimate segment in most or all the species, has on its inner side (the segment being supposed to be extended straight forward) a notch or <b>step,</b> <b>bearing,</b> I believe, two spines.|$|E
60|$|Peduncle and Attachment.--The {{peduncle}} is short, not equalling the capitulum in length. The whole {{surface is}} most thickly clothed with minute spines, {{which are not}} visible when the specimen is dry; I think it probable that they may sometimes all drop off before a new period of exuviation. The peduncle does not (at least in the specimens which I have examined, which were grouped in a bunch) taper {{at the lower end}} to a point; and after careful examination, I feel sure that the cement does not debouch from several successively formed orifices, as in S. vulgare and as in some Pollicipes, but only from the two original orifices in the prehensile antennæ of the larva. In these latter organs, the sucking disc is hoof-like and pointed, and is narrower than the basal segment. The ultimate segment has on its inner side (supposing this segment stretched straight forwards,) a notch or <b>step</b> <b>bearing</b> at least three spines. The proportions of the different parts differ slightly from those in S. vulgare; but, as I shall hereafter have to give all the measurements, I do not think them worth repeating here. In the one large group of specimens examined by me, in Mr. Cuming's possession, all were attached symmetrically to the coralline, {{as in the case of}} S. vulgare, capitulum upwards, and their carinas outwards.|$|E

In {{the design}} of {{tribology}} pairs, the Rayleigh <b>step</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is known as a}} bearing with the highest load capacity amongst all other possible bearing geometries [1]. This paper mainly discusses a new high-speed bearing with shallow and deep cavities on the inner surface of the bearing, and further the physical phenomena in laminar flow and turbulence regimes was revealed. In doing so, the pressure distribution was calculated first using the continuity equations and then performances in the whole flow domain such as pressure distribution, load-carrying capacity, friction force and friction coefficient were calculated. In addition, a set of optimum geometries are shown to provide the highest load capacity for the Rayleigh <b>step</b> <b>bearing</b> under varied Reynolds number. Finally, associated conclusions were drawn by comparison between results under the coexistence state and under the laminar state...|$|E

In additional reference [14], Allaire, Nicholas, and Bar-rett used an infinite length {{finite element model}} {{to show that the}} magnitude of the pressure drop for step bearings with a constant load is of the order of 10 percent of peak pressures for oil lubrication and Reynolds numbers below 1500. Reference [14] also concludes that the inclusion of turbulence inside the pocket area is necessary to accurately predict the load produced by the step. These points are illustrated in Fig. 10 which is taken from reference [14]. Including inertia effects and turbulence pro-duces the solid line curve with a pressure discontinuity at the step (inertia theory). The pressure drop is small compared to the peak pressure as oil is used as a lubricant and the Reynolds number is 1000. Neglecting the inertia effects at the step but including turbulence is a very good approximation while pure laminar theory greatly underestimates the load.

30|$|It {{has been}} shown before that liquids can slip at a solid boundary, which {{prompted}} the idea that parallel-surfaces bearings can be achieved just by alternating slip and non-slip regions {{in the direction of}} fluid flow. The amount of slip at the wall depends on the surface tension at the liquid–solid interface, which in turn depends on the chemical state of the surface and its roughness. In the present study a heterogeneous surface was obtained by coating half of a circular glass disc with a coating repellant to glycerol. A rotating glass disc was placed at a known/calibrated distance and the gap was filled with glycerol. With the mobile surface moving from the direction of slip to non-slip region it can be theoretically shown that a pressure build up can be achieved. The pressure gradient in the two regions is constant, similar to that in a Rayleigh <b>step</b> <b>bearing,</b> with the maximum pressure at the separation line. The heterogeneous disc was placed on a holder supported by a load cell thus the force generated by this pressure increase can be measured accurately. Tests were carried out at different sliding speeds and gaps and the load carried was measured and subsequently compared with theoretical calculations. This allowed the slip coefficient to be evaluated.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to analyze}} the {{performance}} of a magnetic-fluid-based porous rough <b>step</b> <b>bearing</b> considering slip velocity. The Neuringer-Rosensweig model governs the fluid flow while the velocity slip is modeled by the method of Beavers and Joseph. The bearing surfaces are assumed transversely rough and the transverse surface roughness of the bearing surfaces is characterized by a stochastic random variable with non-zero mean, variance, and skewness. With the usual assumptions of hydrodynamic lubrication, the related stochastically averaged Reynolds’ equation for the fluid pressure is solved with appropriate boundary conditions, which is then used to calculate the load-carrying capacity. It is found that although the bearing suffers owing to transverse surface roughness, the performance of the bearing system can be improved to some extent by the positive effect of magnetization, considering the slip parameter at the minimum; at least in the case of negatively skewed roughness. A comparison of this paper with some established investigations indicates that here, the reduction of load-carrying capacity due to porosity and slip velocity is comparatively less, especially, when negative variance occurs. In augmenting the performance of the bearing system, the step ratio plays a central role, even if the slip parameter is at the minimum...|$|E
40|$|In this licentiate thesis {{we study}} some {{mathematical}} problems in hydrodynamic lubrication theory. It {{is composed of}} two papers (A and B) and a complementary appendix. Lubrication theory is devoted to fluid flow in thin domains. The main purpose of lubrication is to reduce friction and wear between two solid surfaces in relative motion. The mathematical foundations of lubrication theory is given by the Navier [...] Stokes equation which describes the motion of viscous fluids. In thin domains several approximations are possible {{which leads to the}} so called Reynolds equation. This equation is crucial to describe the pressure in the lubricant film. When the pressure is found it is possible to predict different important physical quantities such as friction (stresses on the bounding surfaces), load carrying capacity and velocity field. In many practical situations the surface roughness amplitude and the film thickness are of the same order. Therefore, any realistic model should account for the effect of surface roughness. This implies that the mathematical modelling leads to partial differential equations with coefficients that will oscillate rapidly in space and time due to the relative motion of the surfaces. A direct numerical analysis is very difficult since an extremely fine mesh is required to describe the different scales. One method which has proved successful to handle such problems is to do some averaging (asymptotic analysis). The branch in mathematics which has been developed for this purpose is called homogenization. In Paper A the connection between the Stokes equation and the Reynolds equation is investigated. More precisely, the asymptotic behavior as both the film thickness ε and wavelength μ of the roughness tend to zero is analyzed and described. The results are obtained using the formal method of multiple scale expansion. The limit equation depends on how fast the two small parameters ε and μ go to zero relative to each other. Three different limit equations are derived. Time-dependent equations of Reynolds type are obtained in all three cases (Stokes roughness, Reynolds roughness and high frequency roughness regime). In paper B we present a mathematical model in hydrodynamic lubrication that takes into account cavitation (formation of air bubbles), surface roughness and compressibility of the fluid. We compute the homogenized coefficients in the case of unidirectional roughness. A one-dimensional problem describing a <b>step</b> <b>bearing</b> is also solved explicitly and by numerical methods.

40|$|Gas {{bearings}} enable successful {{applications in}} high speed oil-free microturbomachinery. This thesis presents analysis and experiments {{of the dynamic}} performance of a rotor supported on Rayleigh <b>step</b> gas <b>bearings.</b> Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Rayleigh <b>step</b> hybrid gas <b>bearings</b> exhibit adequate stiffness and damping capability in a narrow range of shaft speeds, up to ~ 20 krpm. Rotor coastdown responses were performed for two test bearing sets with nominal radial clearance of 25. 4 ?m and 38. 1 ?m, respectively. A near-frictionless carbon (NFC) coating was applied on the rotor to reduce friction against its bearings at liftoff and touchdown. However, the rotor still experienced dry friction at low shaft speeds (below ~ 4, 000 rpm). Experiments show that the supply pressure raises the rotor critical speed and decreases the system damping ratio. The geometry of the Rayleigh steps distributed on the rotor surface generates a time varying pressure field and results in a sizable 4 X super synchronous component of bearing transmitted load. The external supply gas pressure affects slightly the onset speed of instability of the rotor-bearing system. The unstable whirl frequencies are nearly fixed at the system natural frequency (~ 120 Hz). Analysis with a finite element model predicts the stiffness and damping force coefficients for the bearing accounting for a purely hydrodynamic operation condition. Predictions show the synchronous stiffness and damping coefficients decrease with shaft speed. Predicted threshold speeds of instability are lower, ~ 50 % or less than the measurement due to the analytical model limitations assuming a grooved stator. The predicted synchronous responses to imbalance correlate well with the measurements, however. The Rayleigh <b>step</b> gas <b>bearing</b> shows similar characteristics to the flexure pivot tilting pad bearing (FPTPB) tested in 2003. However, the test Rayleigh <b>step</b> gas <b>bearings</b> exhibit a much reduced stable operating speed range, below 20 krpm.

40|$|Horizontal rotor {{systems on}} {{lubricated}} journal bearings may incur instability risks {{depending on the}} load and the angular speed. The instability {{is associated with the}} asymmetry of the stiffness matrix of the bearings around the equilibrium position, in like manner as the internal hysteretic instability somehow, where some beneficial effect is indeed obtainable by an anisotropic configuration of the support stiffness. Hence, the idea of the present analysis is to check if similar advantages are also obtainable towards the oil film instability. The instability thresholds are calculated by usual methods, such as the Routh criterion or the direct search for the system eigenvalues. The results indicate that the rotor performances may be improved in the range of low Sommerfeld numbers by softening the support stiffness in the vertical plane, and hardening it on the horizontal one, up to the complete locking, though this advantage has to be paid by rather lower instability thresholds for large Sommerfeld numbers. Nevertheless, a "two-mode" arrangement is conceivable, with some vertical flexibility of the supports for large journal eccentricity, and complete locking for small eccentricity.
