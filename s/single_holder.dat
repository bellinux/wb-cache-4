2500|$|The {{title of}} the Grand Domestic is first {{mentioned}} in the 9th century, and most likely derives from the older office of domestikos tōn scholōn ("Domestic of the Schools"), with the epithet megas added to connote the supreme authority of its holder, following contemporary practice evident in other offices as well. Both titles appear to have co-existed for a time, with the Grand Domestic being a more exalted variant of the plain titles of the Domestics of the East and of the West, until the late 11th century, when it became a distinct office and replaced the ordinary Domestics as commander-in-chief. Nevertheless, the office was still sometimes {{referred to in the}} sources as the [...] "Grand Domestic of the Schools" [...] or [...] "of the army", creating some confusion as to which of the two posts is meant. For most of its existence, the office of Grand Domestic was by its nature confined to a <b>single</b> <b>holder.</b> However, the presence of [...] "Grand Domestics of the East/West" [...] in the late 12th century may indicate the resumption of the well-established practice of dividing supreme field command, as with the Domesticate of the Schools, between east (Asia Minor) and west (Balkans), while in the late 14th century several people appear to hold the office at the same time, perhaps in a collegial manner.|$|E
2500|$|In Philotheos's Klētorologion of 899, {{the dignity}} of the zostē patrikia is placed very high in the {{imperial}} order of precedence, coming before the magistros and after the kouropalatēs. Her exceptional status is further illustrated by {{the fact that she was}} one of only six dignitaries who dined at the imperial table—along with the Patriarch of Constantinople, the Caesar, the nōbelissimos, the kouropalatēs and the basileopatōr—and by the prominent role she played in imperial ceremonies, especially those revolving around the Empress, such as the coronation of an empress or the birth of a child. The zōstē patrikia functioned as the chief attendant to the empress (to whom she was usually related) and the head of the women's court (the sekreton tōn gynaikōn), which consisted mostly of the wives of high-ranking officials. Indeed, hers was the only specifically female dignity: other women bore the feminine versions of their husbands' titles. A zōstē patrikia is therefore, in John B. Bury's words, [...] "the only lady who was πατρικία in her own right", and not to be confused with a simple patrikia, who was the spouse or widow of a patrikios. The French scholar Rodolphe Guilland points out that the title itself appears to be a compound one, with the sources sometimes calling it [...] "the zōstē and patrikia", indicating that the noble title of patrikia was added to the court dignity of zōstē. Although it appears that, in common with the other supreme dignities with which it is associated, there was a <b>single</b> <b>holder</b> of the dignity at each time, at the reception of Olga of Kiev, the plural form zōstai is used, indicating the presence of at least two. This may be accounted for by the fact that at times there were several empresses, and that each one must have had a zōstē in her particular service.|$|E

50|$|Japanese {{insurance}} companies became important leaders in international finance {{in the late}} 1980s.

50|$|Earl of Winchilsea is a {{title in}} the Peerage of England held by the Finch-Hatton family.

The name change came in the 1350s after marriage to an heiress member of the Finch family. A later member of the family, Sir William Finch, was knighted in 1513. His son Sir Thomas Finch (died 1563), was also knighted for his share in suppressing Sir Thomas Wyatt's insurrection against Queen Mary I, and was the son-in-law of Sir Thomas Moyle, some of whose lands Finch's wife inherited. Thomas's eldest son Moyle Finch represented Weymouth, Kent and Winchelsea in the House of Commons. In 1611 he was created a baronet, of Eastwell in the County of Kent.|$|E
