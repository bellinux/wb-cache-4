The canonical microkernel system, Mach, modeled messages as I/O, which has several important side-effects. Primary among these is that the normal task schedulers under Unix-like systems will normally block a client that is waiting on an I/O request, so in this way the actions of pausing and restarting applications waiting on messages was already built into the underlying system. The downside to this approach is that the scheduler is fairly [...] "heavyweight", and calling it was a serious performance bottleneck and led to extensive development efforts to improve its performance. Under the V-System model the message passing overhead is reduced because the process scheduler {{does not have to be}} consulted, there is no question as to who should next be run [...] - [...] it's the server being called. The downside to the V approach is that it requires more work on the server side if the response may take some time to process.|$|E

40|$|Background. This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{relationship}} between diabetes, obesity, and hepatic steatosis in patients undergoing liver resection and to determine if these factors are independent predictors of major complications. Materials and Methods. Analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing liver resection between 2005 and 2012 was undertaken. Background liver was assessed for steatosis and classified as < 33 % and ≥ 33 %. Major complications were defined as Grade III–V complications using the Dindo-Clavien classification. Results. 504 patients underwent liver resection, of whom 56 had diabetes and 61 had steatosis ≥ 33 %. Median BMI was 26 [*]kg/m 2 (16 – 54 [*]kg/m 2). 94 patients developed a major complication (18. 7 %). BMI ≥ 25 [*]kg/m 2 (P= 0. 001) and diabetes (P= 0. 018) were associated with steatosis ≥ 33 %.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundStudies {{reporting}} outcomes following staged/synchronous carotid revascularisation {{prior to}} cardiac surgery have generally concluded that procedural strokes are reduced. However, virtually none have commented {{specifically on the}} risk of stroke in patients with bilateral carotid disease who then undergo their cardiac procedure {{in the presence of}} an unoperated, contralateral stenosis. If carotid disease really was an important cause of peri-operative stroke, these patients should incur a much higher risk of stroke following their cardiac procedure. MethodsRetrospective audit of prospectively acquired data in 132 consecutive patients undergoing synchronous carotid endarterectomy and cardiac surgery. ResultsOverall 30 -day rates of mortality, ipsilateral stroke and any stroke were 5. 3 %, 1. 5 % and 3 % respectively. The 30 -day rate of death/stroke was 6. 8 %. In 51 patients with a prior history of stroke/TIA, the 30 -day rate of death/stroke was 5. 9 %, compared with 7. 4 % in neurologically asymptomatic patients. The majority (57 %) had significant bilateral disease and underwent their combined procedure {{in the presence of a}} significant, non-operated (asymptomatic) contralateral stenosis (50 – 99 % =  75, 60 – 99 % =  54, 70 – 99 % =  32). Only one patient (90 – 99 % stenosis) suffered a post-operative stroke in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the non-operated, contralateral stenosis. ConclusionsPatients undergoing <b>synchronous</b> <b>procedures</b> incurred a low rate of procedural stroke, perhaps justifying this management approach. However, an alternative and more critical analysis suggested that the risk of procedural stroke in patients with significant (non-operated) contralateral asymptomatic carotid disease was extremely low. This challenges the assumption that asymptomatic carotid disease is an important cause of stroke during cardiac surgery...|$|R

However, the procedure may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Methods: We analyzed the outcome of 127 consecutive patients who underwent extended hepatectomy (resection of ≥ 5 liver segments) for hepatobiliary malignancies. Results: The patients underwent extended hepatectomy for colorectal metastases (n = 86; 67. 7 %), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 12; 9. 4 %), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 14; 11. 0 %), and other malignant diseases (n = 15; 11. 5 %). Thirty-two left and ninety-five right extended hepatectomies were performed. Eight patients also underwent caudate lobe resection, and 40 patients underwent a <b>synchronous</b> intraabdominal <b>procedure.</b> Twenty patients underwent radiofrequency ablation, and 31 underwent preoperative portal vein embolization. The median blood loss was 300 mL for right hepatectomy and 600 mL for left hepatectomy (P = 0. 02). Thirty-six patients (28. 3 %) received a blood transfusion. The overall complication rate was 30. 7 % (n = 39), and the operative mortality rate was 0. 8 % (n = 1). Significant liver insufficiency (total bilirubin level > 10 mg/dL or international normalized ratio > 2) occurred in 6 patients (4. 7 %). Multivariate analysis showed that a <b>synchronous</b> intraabdominal <b>procedure</b> was the only factor associated with an increased risk of morbidity (hazard ratio [HR], 4. 9; P = 0. 02).

Conclusions: Extended hepatectomy can be performed with a near-zero operative mortality rate and is associated with long-term survival in a subset of patients with malignant hepatobiliary disease. Combining extended hepatectomy with another intraabdominal procedure increases the risk of postoperative morbidity. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mobile {{agents are}} {{processes}} which can autonomously migrate to new hosts. Despite its many practical benefits, {{mobile agent technology}} results in significant new security threats from malicious agents and hosts. The primary added complication is that, as an agent traverses multiple hosts that are trusted to different degrees, its state can change in ways that adversely impact its functionality. In this paper, we discuss achievable security goals for mobile agents, and we propose an architecture to achieve these goals. The architecture models the trust relations between the principals of mobile agent systems. A unique aspect of the architecture is a &quot;state appraisal &quot; mechanism that protects users and hosts from attacks via state modifications and that provides users with flexible control over the authority of their agents. 1 Introduction Currently, distributed systems employ models in which processes are statically attached to hosts and communicate by asynchronous messages or <b>synchronous</b> remote <b>procedure</b> calls.

Following a well-established convention, the phenomenon is represented as the combined effect of three causes: the loss of coherence of the motion with distance, the wave-passage, and the local site conditions.

A parametric study is carried out on a representative set of bridges subjected to carefully selected combinations of the factors inducing spatial variability. The investigation {{has shown that the}} phenomenon affects the response considerably and, hence, the level of protection of these structures. It is observed that for all bridge types considered, the ductility demands {{at the base of the}} piers in the presence of spatial variability increase in the majority of cases. Further, for a given bridge type, the probabilities of failure vary by more than one order of magnitude depending on the combination of the parameters. Attention has been focu sed on a parameter representing the ratio between the maximum curvature ductility demand and the same quantity for the case of fully synchronous motion. This parameter has been used to correct the conventional <b>synchronous</b> design <b>procedure</b> by increasing the available ductility. The re-analysis of all the cases with a modified ductility capacity shows that the procedure is effective in reducing the fragilities to the values corresponding to synchronous input.

40|$|We update a {{one-dimensional}} {{chain of}} Ising spins of length L with algorithms which are parameterized by the probability p {{for a certain}} site to get updated in one time step. The result of the update event itself {{is determined by the}} energy change due to the local change in the configuration. In this way we interpolate between the Metropolis algorithm at zero temperature for p of the order of 1 /L and for large L, and a <b>synchronous</b> deterministic updating <b>procedure</b> for p= 1. As function of p we observe a phase transition between the stationary states to which the algorithm drives the system. These are non-absorbing stationary states with antiferromagnetic domains for p>p_c, and absorbing states with ferromagnetic domains for p≤ p_c. This means that above this transition the stationary states have lost any remnants to the ferromagnetic Ising interaction. A measurement of the critical exponents shows that this transition belongs to the universality class of parity conservation. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|The nonvisual self-touch rubber hand {{paradigm}} elicits {{the compelling}} illusion {{that one is}} touching one's own hand even though the two hands are not in contact. In four experiments, we investigated spatial limits of distance (15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, 60 cm) and alignment (0 °, 90 ° anti-clockwise) on the nonvisual self-touch illusion and the well-known visual rubber hand illusion. Common <b>procedures</b> (<b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous stimulation administered for 60 s with the prosthetic hand at body midline) and common assessment methods were used. Subjective experience of the illusion was assessed by agreement ratings for statements on a questionnaire and time of illusion onset. The nonvisual self-touch illusion was diminished though never abolished by distance and alignment manipulations, whereas the visual rubber hand illusion was more robust against these manipulations. We assessed proprioceptive drift, and implications of a double dissociation between subjective experience of the illusion and proprioceptive drift are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Traditionally, a staged {{operative}} {{approach has}} been used for patients with synchronous colorectal cancer and liver metastases in the U. K. With improved outcomes from hepatic resection the role of a synchronous operative approach needs re-evaluated. Methods: 32 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases that underwent a synchronous operative approach were individually case matched (according to: age; sex; ASA grade; type of hepatic and colonic resection) with patients that had undergone a staged approach. The following variables were analysed: operative blood loss; in hospital morbidity and mortality; duration of hospital stay; disease free and overall survival. Results: Operative blood losses were: synchronous group, median 475 mL (range 150 - 850 mL) vs median 425 mL (range 50 - 1700 mL), (p > 0. 050). There {{were no significant differences in}} morbidity: (34 % synchronous group vs 59 %, p = 0. 690) with no recorded mortality. Synchronous group had a shorter hospital stay (median 12 days [range 8 - 21] vs 20 [range 7 - 51], p = 0. 008). There were no statistical differences between synchronous and staged patients for disease free and overall survival: 10 months (95 % CI 5. 8 - 13. 7) versus 14 (95 % CI 12. 2 - 16. 3; p = 0. 487) and 21 % versus 24 % at 5 years (p = 0. 838). Conclusion: This present study provides supporting evidence for <b>synchronous</b> operative <b>procedures</b> in patients with colorectal liver metastases.

40|$|This thesis work investigates how to {{represent}} protocols for asynchronous {{communication in the}} Scala programming language and the Akka actor framework, to be run on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Further restrictions from the problem domain - the coexistence of multiple protocol instances sharing the same Java thread - imply that neither an asynchronous call waiting for response nor anything else can block the underlying Java threads. A common way {{to represent}} asynchronous communication protocols is to use state machines. This thesis seeks a way to shrink the size of and to reduce {{the complexity of the}} protocol implementations by representing sequences of asynchronous communication calls (i. e. sequences of sent and received messages) as a type of procedure. The idea is {{find a way to make}} the procedures that contain asynchronous calls look like <b>synchronous</b> communication <b>procedures</b> by hiding the asynchronous details. In other words, the resulting procedure code should show what to do and not so much focus on how to overcome the impediment of the asynchronous calls. With the help of an asynchronous communication protocol toy example, this report shows how such an protocol can be implemented with a combination of a state machine and a procedure representation in Scala and Akka. The procedure representation hides away the asynchronous details by using the Scala capability to use CPS-transformed delimited continuations. As a sub-problem, this thesis also shows how to safely schedule asynchronous communication timeouts with help of Scala and Akka within the restrictions of the thesis problem domain...|$|R
40|$|Projecte final de carrera realitzat en col. laboració amb la Technical University of DenmarkNew {{methods of}} {{measuring}} impulse responses based on carefully designed deterministic signals can further improve the performance o ered by classical methods. In fact, these methods are particularly interesting when measuring long impulse responses {{as the ones}} analyzed in architectural acoustics. However, the e ects of background and impulsive noise, distortion and time-variance are known rather qualitatively. For this reason, the ISO 18233 encourages to develop {{a deeper understanding of}} the theoretical bases of these techniques. In this sense, this project presents an in depth analysis of two di erent methods of measuring impulse responses: the linear convolution of sweep signals with the inverse lter and the circular crosscorrelation of maximum length sequences (MLS) and inverse repeated sequences (IRS). The results of this work reveal that the sweep technique can provide signi cant reduction of distortion compared to MLS/IRS technique but, unlike what is explained in the literature, sweep signals cannot reject all distortion artifacts from the causal part of the impulse response. Besides, it is proved that IRS sequences are immune to distortion of even order. On the other hand, it is con rmed that <b>synchronous</b> averaging <b>procedure</b> improves the SNR at the microphone position by 3 dB per doubling the number of averages. Alternatively, it is also proved that the noise contaminating the measured impulse response is reduced by 3 dB every time that the length of the excitation signal is doubled. In terms of impulsive noise, the sweep technique only contaminates speci c frequency bands of the system's impulse response, whereas the MLS/IRS technique uniformly distributes all impulsive noise artifacts over the entire measured impulse response. Finally, it is also shown that MLS/IRS measurements are more vulnerable to time-varying systems than sweep measurements...|$|R
40|$|Threats on the {{stability}} of a financial system may severely affect {{the functioning of the}} entire economy, and thus considerable emphasis is placed on the analyzing the cause and effect of such threats. The financial crisis in the current and past decade has shown that one important cause of instability in global markets is the so-called financial contagion, namely the spreading of instabilities or failures of individual components of the network to other, perhaps healthier, components. This leads to a natural question of whether the regulatory authorities could have predicted and perhaps mitigated the current economic crisis by effective computations of some stability measure of the banking networks. Motivated by such observations, we consider the problem of defining and evaluating stabilities of both homogeneous and heterogeneous banking networks against propagation of synchronous idiosyncratic shocks given to a subset of banks. We formalize the homogeneous banking network model of Nier et al. and its corresponding heterogeneous version, formalize the <b>synchronous</b> shock propagation <b>procedures,</b> define two appropriate stability measures and investigate the computational complexities of evaluating these measures for various network topologies and parameters of interest. Our results and proofs also shed some light on the properties of topologies and parameters of the network that may lead to higher or lower stabilities. ...|$|R
