The influences of revolving-door treatment experiences, psychopathology, and institutionalization were taken into account. The results showed that supportive rather than transitional, high-expectation environments contributed to the development of emotionally and instrumentally supportive social networks.

40|$|Objectives. Most adult {{residents}} of sheltered-care facilities (board and care, family care, psychosocial rehabilitation, and other supported housing arrangements) for the chronically mentally ill receive neuroleptics. These facilities house over 300 000 mentally ill residents, but neuroleptic prescription practices with this population {{have not been}} studied. Methods. A probability sample (n = 393) of all adult former psychiatric patients in <b>sheltered</b> <b>care</b> in California was surveyed in 1973; 94 % of the located survivors (n = 243) were reinterviewed 12 years later. Results. In 1973, 79 % received neuroleptics; in 1985, 76 %. Polypharmacy decreased, and the elderly remained less medicated than adults. Yet, mean daily neuroleptic doses doubled, more persons received higher doses, and 62 % reported adverse effects. Furthermore, high dosing was attributed to psychiatrists rather than other physicians, even when controlling for residents' clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions. Neuroleptic drugs became the staple pharmacological treatment for mentally ill sheltered-care residents. While physicians more cautiously medicated the elderly, they had not reduced doses by 1985, even {{after a decade of}} treatment.

40|$|Many {{individuals}} with autism have deficits {{in their ability}} to function independently and need extensive instruction to master daily living skills. Further, federal law requires that schools and families work together when planning transitions.

Examples of appropriate skills to teach with each technique are given.

The {{aim of the research}} was to identify residents' perceptions of the social climate in shared housing settings, a non-conventional housing initiative being undertaken by non-profit organisations for the low-income elderly population group in Cape Town, South Africa. A case research study involved 45 participants living in 7 of the 13 shared houses affiliated to the Neighbourhood Old Age Homes (NOAH) organization. Using the <b>Sheltered</b> <b>Care</b> Environmental Scale (SCES), participants answered 63 'Yes / No' questions aimed at revealing their opinions of the social climate in the shared homes. The initial findings detected overall satisfaction amongst most residents regarding interfacing social dynamics, suggesting high levels of perceived independence, self-disclosure and residential influence. Mixed results were generally observed regarding interfacing social dynamics related to levels of physical comfort, organization in the homes, cohesion and conflict resolution. The findings suggest that the shared housing concept advanced by the Neighbourhood Old Age Homes (NOAH) organisation has been able to successfully promote a sense of cohesion, conflict resolution, independence, self-disclosure, organisation, residential influence and physical comfort amongst residents, thereby playing a vital role in residents' experience of residential satisfaction in these homes...|$|E

The purpose of this article is to describe practical methods by which schools and the parents of children with autism can work together to teach these children functional daily living skills. Selecting Daily Living Skills for Instruction The first step in any teaching process in-volves selecting the skills to be taught. When choosing daily living skills for in-struction, the goal should be to increase the independence of the student (Snell & Farlow, 1993). Brown, Nietupski, and Hamre-Nietupski (1976) stated that all educational activity should be directed toward meeting the “criterion of ulti-mate functioning. ” This requires us to ask the question, Will the student be able to function as an adult if he or she does not learn the skill being taught? Other factors to be considered when selecting skills for instruction are the skills the stu-dent currently performs, the demands of the environment in which the student participates, the student’s chronological age, the manner in which peers perform the task, and the typical environment i...|$|E

40|$|As {{a special}} {{education}} major, I have {{a keen interest in}} the welfare of students who have handicaps. The mildly handicapped are those that exhibit a slightly below normal mental capacity to handle the tasks of everyday living. Almost all of these students can master the skills needed to live independent of parental or <b>sheltered</b> <b>care,</b> but they need more individual instruction and an approach to the curriculum which is more concrete and focused. As an educator of handicapped students, I believe that. one of the highest priorities in the instruction of the mildly handicapped is to prepare them to obtain and maintain meaningful employment. Far beyond alleviating the financial stress upon the society in wich they live, meaningful employment can create a purpose and organization for living which their lives often lack. Since it is my belief that this is a priority for the curriculum of this population, I have chosen as my creative project to develop a unit plan consisting of sixteen individual lesson plans named "Getting A Job For The Mildly Handicapped. "This unit can be used in its entirety, or separate lessons can be pulled from it according to the individual needs of students. It consists of sixteen individual lesson plans, teaching aids to accompany teacher-directed instruction, and many activities for the students to use for practice and mastery of the skills taught. The unit was not designed to be self-instructing, but many of the activities are selfcrecking and. can be adapted to individual needs. In addition, the unit was not developed to exhaust the instruction of obtaining employment, but rather as a core of objectives and instructional approaches which can be expanded upon limitlessly.

40|$|The study {{reported}} follows a previous review of resident, relatives' and staff views of five KCHT homes which was {{undertaken in the}} spring of 1993. Focusing on the social environment the earlier study examined both perceptions of the 'ideal home' and how the homes were operating in practice (Lawson, 1993). In order to consider how these changes had affected life for residents KCHT commissioned a further study to explore the current situation in the same five homes. There was particular interest in the residents perspective and in the impact of the approaches being taken to resident activities. The <b>sheltered</b> <b>care</b> environment scale (SCES), completed by both staff and residents, was used to measure the social climate of the homes. This was compared with the measures obtained two years ago. For the most part homes appeared to have moved towards the ideal. From the staff perspective there was a statistically significant increase in levels of Cohesion, Organisation and Physical Comfort and a significant decrease in levels of Conflict. Residents experienced a significant increase in Independence. The only exception to this very positive picture was Resident Influence that appeared to have declined over the period. The measures of Cohesion and Independence had increased more and were at an overall higher level {{at the time of this}} study in the homes which employed individual workers whose primary responsibility was the organisation of activities for residents. The social networks of residents were examined by asking residents who they would turn to in certain situations. Residents turned primarily to supervisory staff and to friends and relatives outside the home when they had a personal worry. Friends and relatives outside the home dominated when there was a social celebration and supervisory staff would usually be approached when them was a concern about the care being provided...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. In {{order to}} meet the needs of a {{changing}} global economy, the collaboration and extension of existing traditional career theories has resulted in career intervention strategies that are contextually and individually relevant. Traditional career counselling interventions in South Africa tend to serve individuals from stable and predictable contexts, where socio-economic, psychological, cultural and racial differences are not considered as significant. Street children have unconventional life experiences, with many more challenges than the average child. Such individuals, whose context does not include traditional schooling with stable home backgrounds and predictable life stages, may not benefit optimally from traditional career intervention strategies. They may not be able to identify with psychometric testing, where self information is integrated with work information and the client is advised on how he can fit into the world of work. Developments in Career Counselling theories in the 21 st century have more potential relevance and benefits for children coming from non-traditional backgrounds. Constructivist Narrative Career Counselling is one of the alternative approaches in which the client and counsellor collaborate to review and create career stories in order to inform career decisions and actions. This study explores how a constructivist career counselling intervention can assist a late adolescent in <b>sheltered</b> <b>care</b> to re-author his life story. The life experiences of the former street child is reviewed, so as to highlight themes that will allow the client and researcher-counsellor to collaboratively create career stories in order to inform career decisions and actions for the participant who comes from a non traditional background. The individual case study was conducted using a constructivist lens to do qualitative research. Data was collected from career intervention activities as recommended by Narrative Career Counselling Theory. These included an intake interview, a lifeline and genogram activity, collages, career mapping, card sorting, a semi structured exit interview and the reflective journal of the researcher.
