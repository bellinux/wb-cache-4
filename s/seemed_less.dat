5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across to the screen in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At {{the same time that the}} British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E
5|$|Voce {{missed the}} fourth Test of the series, being {{replaced}} by a leg spinner, Tommy Mitchell. Larwood continued to use bodyline, {{but he was the}} only bowler in the team using the tactic; even so, he used it less frequently than usual and <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> effective in high temperatures and humidity. England won the game by eight wickets, thanks in part to an innings of 83 by Eddie Paynter who had been admitted to hospital with tonsillitis but left in order to bat when England were struggling in their innings. Voce returned for the final Test, but neither he nor Allen were fully fit, and despite the use of bodyline tactics, Australia scored 435 at a rapid pace, aided by several dropped catches. Australia included a fast bowler for this final game, Harry Alexander who bowled some short deliveries but was not allowed to use many fielders on the leg side by his captain, Woodfull. England built a lead of 19 but their tactics in Australia's second innings were disrupted when Larwood left the field with an injured foot; Hedley Verity, a spinner, claimed five wickets to bowl Australia out; England won by eight wickets and won the series by four Tests to one.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Roman imperial decline <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> serious in North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the Crisis of the Third Century. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.|$|E
25|$|To the ancients, the {{parallel}} postulate <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> obvious than the others. They {{were concerned with}} creating a system which was absolutely rigorous and to them {{it seemed as if}} {{the parallel}} line postulate should have been able to be proven rather than simply accepted as a fact. It is now known that such a proof is impossible. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.|$|E
25|$|The revival {{focused on}} reconstructing and standardising the language, {{including}} coining new words for modern concepts, and creating educational material {{in order to}} teach Cornish to others. In 1929 Robert Morton Nance published his Unified Cornish system, based on the Middle Cornish literature while extending the attested vocabulary with forms based on Celtic roots also found in Breton and Welsh, publishing a dictionary in 1938. Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish {{for most of the}} 20th century. However, as the revival grew in strength and focus shifted from written to spoken Cornish, Nance's stiff, archaic formulation of the language <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> suitable for a spoken revival, and academic research into the traditional literature proved that the Unified system lacked some phonological distinctions.|$|E

25|$|As an {{independent}} {{member of the}} Defence Lands Committee 1971–73, Hargreaves made key contributions to the Nugent Report, 1973, reviewing the use of land held by the country's armed forces for defence purposes. He became even more aware {{that one of the}} best ways to reserve the countryside for its proper purpose was to keep most people out of it. Although agriculture would be preferable, military exercises <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> harmful in their impact on the environment than its use for the recreational choices of a predominantly urban population. This was a conundrum he shared wryly with his audience, gently repeating the point, that the countryside, insofar as it had a purpose for humans, was to grow their food in sustainable ways.|$|E
25|$|The US government's {{attitude}} towards fascism <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> friendly, but President Roosevelt ultimately joined with Britain and France in taking a strictly neutral {{policy in the}} Spanish Civil War, thereby enabling Francisco Franco's victory there. With no serious sanctions on the rising Axis powers until 1941, top US firms like IBM and General Motors were extremely active in Nazi Germany for years, and exchange controls ensured that most of their profits were cycled back into the country, strengthening Hitler's regime; this also meant that Nazi-associated businesses like IG Farben and Thyssen industries did extensive dealings with elite US banks like Brown Brothers Harriman and Union Banking Corporation up through 1942. Franklin Roosevelt also expressed support for the Munich agreement, in spite of it allowing for a partition of Czechoslovakia.|$|E

The CG artwork was described as beautiful and the sprites were also praised for emphasizing the [...] "frailty of the characters and their world." [...] However, Estrada felt that the English translation was [...] "slightly off", with text that <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> poetic than {{what might have been}} intended with its Japanese counterpart.|$|E

500|$|Alex Simmons, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell {{reviewed}} the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance for Amiga Action magazine in 1990, {{giving it a}} 79% overall rating. Mitchell preferred the game Champions of Krynn, which had been released {{by the time the}} Amiga version of Pool of Radiance became available; he felt that Pool of Radiance was [...] "more of the same" [...] when compared to Champions, but was less playable and with more limited actions for players. Simmons felt that Pool of Radiance looked primitive and <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> polished when compared with Champions of Krynn; he felt that although Pool was not up to the standard of Champions, he said it was still [...] "a fine little game". Johns, on the other hand, felt that Pool of Radiance was well worth the wait, considering it very user-friendly despite being less polished than Champions of Krynn.|$|E
500|$|Although Protestant, the MacLeods of Raasay {{supported}} Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745. After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Culloden, the Prince spent 2 days hiding from the British troops on Raasay {{and as a}} consequence of the island's support for the Jacobite cause the original Raasay House and many dwellings were burnt down by government troops. In conversation with Malcolm MacLeod of Raasay during his short stay on the island the Prince confided that although his life on the run was hard, he would rather live that way for ten years than be captured as he feared assassination. He <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> aware of the risks his supporters ran. The atrocities perpetrated in the aftermath of Culloden were a shock to him. Of Cumberland he said: [...] "Surely that man who calls himself a duke and pretends to be so great a general cannot be guilty of such cruelties. I cannot believe it." ...|$|E
500|$|In Chicago, {{he worked}} as an {{associate}} editor of the monthly journal Cooperative Commonwealth, where he met novelist Sherwood Anderson. When St. Louis native Hadley Richardson came to Chicago to visit the sister of Hemingway's roommate, Hemingway became infatuated and later claimed, [...] "I knew she was the girl I was going to marry". Hadley, red-haired, with a [...] "nurturing instinct", was eight years older than Hemingway. Despite being older than Hemingway, Hadley, who had grown up with an overprotective mother, <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> mature than usual for a young woman her age. Bernice Kert, author of The Hemingway Women, claims Hadley was [...] "evocative" [...] of Agnes, but that Hadley had a childishness that Agnes lacked. The two corresponded for a few months and then decided to marry and travel to Europe. They wanted to visit Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to visit Paris instead, writing letters of introduction for the young couple. They were married on September 3, 1921; two months later, Hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star, and the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley, Meyers claims: [...] "With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe." ...|$|E

500|$|New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews {{believed}} the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks—focusing more on enhancing the [...] "imagery of violence"—than real attempts {{to scare the}} audience; he gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of five. Dennis Harvey, from Variety magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities. In contrast, Rossiter Drake of The Examiner applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a [...] "compelling take on the mythology" [...] that managed to be [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] at the same time. In agreement with other critics, Empire magazine's Kim Newman felt that, because Zombie <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film [...] " [...] flat" [...] when it came to delivering suspense or anything [...] "remotely scary"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the [...] "dogged psychiatrist". Ben Walter, of Time Out London, felt Zombie added [...] "surprising realism" [...] to the development of Michael Myers’ psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film’s [...] "suspense and playfulness" [...] with a convincing display of [...] "black-blooded brutality".|$|E
500|$|Once Lowe {{joined the}} {{permanent}} cast, Chris' role changed into {{more of an}} authority figure concerned with integrity and efficiency, although he continued to maintain his positive attitude and personality. Schur said of this second role: [...] "He doesn’t like frayed ends or controversies [...] he wants the body politic to be as clean-running and organic as his own human body. Part of {{the design of the}} character was to give the other characters a true boss [...] an actual authority figure whose rules and regulations meant they had to toe certain lines, even while his endlessly cheery disposition made it hard to argue with him." [...] As a result, Chris Traeger changed in minor ways once he became a regular character. In his earlier episodes, Chris avoided associating himself with anything negative and constantly made Ben report bad news to people. As city manager in later episodes as a regular, however, Chris started imposing rules or changes around the office that were not popular and <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> resistant about enforcing them. For example, Chris began to enforce his strict no-dating policy around city hall. Additionally, in the episode [...] "Jerry's Painting", Chris forcefully orders Leslie to destroy a painting when it proves to be controversial, and becomes angry with her when she tries to resist those orders.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker {{said the}} pairing of Poehler and Posey led to great comedic scenes, {{but that the}} [...] "heart of the episode" [...] was Leslie's celebration of Ron's birthday. Tucker praised the show's optimistic tone, with {{characters}} who genuinely respect and love each other, even while many other comedies remained cynical. Hillary Busis, also of Entertainment Weekly, called Posey's performance [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] and called Leslie's construction of the baseball diamond [...] "a sweet coda to a great, funny episode". Postmedia News writer Alex Strachan praised the episode {{not only for its}} likable and easily relatable characters, but for its willingness to address social issues like the divide between classes in Pawnee and Eagleton. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Eagleton" [...] <b>seemed</b> <b>less</b> story-driven and more over-the-top than usual, but that it works for the series because those episodes are funny and only happen periodically. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic complimented Posey's performance, but especially praised Leslie's birthday surprise for Ron, and claimed {{it was the first time}} since the NBC series Friends that he responded to a television comedy so emotionally. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode handled the rivalry between Pawnee and Eagleton nearly as well as some of the classic Cheers episodes about that bar and its rival, the Old Towne Tavern. He also called Offerman [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] in what Porter described as an excellent B-story.|$|E
