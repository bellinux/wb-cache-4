40|$|There is an {{implicit}} assumption in cited literature on precision agriculture (PA) that <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> is performed perfectly {{in the field}} leading to uniform application, this is not true. Variation can be large and often the actual performance <b>of</b> <b>spreading</b> equipment used has never been measured or verified. In various {{countries around the world}} there are quality assurance (QA) systems designed to achieve a prescribed level of performance. Even within these QA schemes limited testing is undertaken and always under perfect or near perfect conditions. The test methods are designed to establish an acceptable bout width which meets an acceptable evenness <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> if driven accurately. The test {{does not take into account}} wind conditions (except for requiring less than 15 kmhr- 1 for testing), humidity, slope, terrain or the instrumentation to maintain the desired bout width. This paper examines the effect of the farm environment and the physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> on the <b>spread</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in the field. Fertilisers with heterogeneous particle size distributions proved to have more robust spread patterns under field conditions than those with homogeneous particle size distributions...|$|R
40|$|The {{top soil}} of a 14. 5 km(2) region at la Chaux-de-Fonds in the Swiss Jura is {{exceptionally}} rich in cadmium. It contains {{an average of}} 1. 3 mg per kg of soil. The spatial distribution of the metal has no simple pattern that {{could be explained by}} atmospheric deposition or agricultural practices. Thin soil contained most of its Cd at the surface; in thicker soil Cd is mainly concentrated between 60 and 80 cm depth. No specific minerals or soil fractions could account for these accumulation, and the vertical distribution of Cd is best explained by leaching from the topsoil and further adsorption within layers of nearly neutral pH. The local Jurassic sedimentary rocks contained too little Cd to account for the Cd concentrations in the soil. Alpine gravels from glacial till were too sparse in soils to explain such a <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> Cd. Moreover this origin is contradictory with the fact that Cd is concentrated in the sand fraction of soils. The respective distributions of Fe and Cd in soils, and soil fractions, suggested that the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> iron nodules accumulated during the siderolithic period (Eocene) was not the main source of Cd. Atmospheric deposition, and <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> or waste from septic tanks seem the only plausible explanation for the Cd concentrations, but at present few factors allow us to differentiate between them...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman excreta are {{potential}} sources of plant nutrients, but are today usually considered a waste to be disposed of. The requirements on wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove nitrogen and phosphorus are increasing and to meet these requirements, more energy and chemicals are needed by WWTPs. Separating the nutrient-rich wastewater fractions at source and recycling them to agriculture as fertiliser is an alternative to removing them at the WWTP. This study used life cycle assessment methodology to compare {{the environmental impact of}} different scenarios for recycling the nutrients in the human excreta as fertiliser to arable land or removing them in an advanced WWTP. Three scenarios were assessed. In blackwater scenario, blackwater was source-separated and used as fertiliser. In urine scenario, the urine fraction was source-separated and used as fertiliser and the faecal water treated in an advanced WWTP. In NP scenario, chemical fertiliser was used as fertiliser and the toilet water treated in an advanced WWTP. The emissions from the WWTP were the same for all scenarios. This was fulfilled by the enhanced reduction in the WWTP fully removing the nutrients from the excreta that were not source-separated in the NP and urine scenarios. Recycling source-separated wastewater fractions as fertilisers in agriculture proved efficient for conserving energy and decreasing global warming potential (GWP). However, the blackwater and urine scenarios had a higher impact on potential eutrophication and potential acidification than the WWTP-chemical fertiliser scenario, due to large impacts by the ammonia emitted from storage and after <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fertilisers.</b> The cadmium input to the arable soil was very small with urine fertiliser. Source separation and recycling of excreta fractions as fertiliser thus has potential for saving energy and decreasing GWP emissions associated with wastewater management. However, for improved sustainability, the emissions from storage and after <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> these <b>fertilisers</b> must decrease...|$|R
30|$|Industrial {{development}} was therefore {{the time when}} the city/country relationship became conflictual, and generally speaking, we can refer to a contrast between city and countryside in which the latter is the weak link in the chain {{from the point of view}} of both the functional division of labour and the use of resources. As Steel (2008) reminds us, the cause of this contrast was the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> artificial <b>fertilisers,</b> means <b>of</b> transport, and railways. By enabling large quantities of food products that could be transported into city centres to be produced far from inhabited areas, the countryside was inevitably made weaker (Steel 2008). In other words, cities became independent from nearby rural areas because they could also “nourish” themselves with products made elsewhere, and this independence translated into greater power for cities compared with the countryside.|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{fertilisers}} {{contribute to}} greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel use, use of non-renewable phosphate {{rock and a}} flow of reactive nitrogen to the biosphere, exceeding the planetary boundaries. Recycling of plant nutrients from waste and by-products from society would reduce the use <b>of</b> chemical <b>fertilisers.</b> These plant nutrient sources are also of interest for organic farming, where chemical fertilisers are not allowed, especially organic farms without access to manure. This thesis assessed {{the environmental impact of}} systems recycling plant nutrients from slaughterhouse waste, toilet waste fractions, digested food waste and mussels too small to be used in food production. The methodology used was life cycle assessment (LCA) and the functional unit was production of 1 kg plant-available nitrogen. The environmental impact categories studied were primary energy use, global warming potential (GWP), potential eutrophication and potential acidification. Flow of cadmium to arable soil, use of non-renewable phosphate rock and potential carbon sequestration were also assessed. In addition, additional functions such as phosphorus added to arable soil, energy production, removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater streams etc. were considered. The reference scenario for all comparisons was the production and use <b>of</b> chemical <b>fertilisers.</b> In general, storage and <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the organic <b>fertilisers</b> contributed greatly to potential eutrophication and acidification, except in the case <b>of</b> meat meal <b>fertiliser,</b> which was in a pseudo-stable form. All investigated fertilisers gave rise to goal conflicts as none <b>of</b> the <b>fertilisers</b> reduced the impact for all impact categories studied. The urine fertiliser reduced the largest amount of impact categories and added the least amount of cadmium to arable soil. Meat meal reduced, or had similar results as the reference scenario, for all impact categories except primary energy use and potential eutrophication. For digested food waste, chemical fertiliser use was an environmentally better option for all impacts. Composting gave rise to large nitrogen emissions, thus anaerobic storage was a better environmental option for mussel treatment. Due to the large amount of phosphorus per kg nitrogen in the compost, the reference scenario used the largest amount of non-renewable phosphate rock. A need for applicable methods and data for estimating emissions in LCA of agricultural systems was identified...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{fertilisers}} are {{key element}} of modern technology and have {{played an important role}} in agricultural productivity growth in India. However, the demand-supply gap <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in India has increased in recent times, thereby leading to increased dependency on imports.

40|$|The study {{examines}} how {{a combination of}} socio-economic and household factors influences farm household decisions on soil nutrient management and on crop production in two regions of Kenya (Kiambu and Vihiga). It further examines how these decisions impact on household objectives and on productivity. Emphasis {{is given to the}} use <b>of</b> inorganic <b>fertilisers</b> because {{this is one of the}} major sources of nutrients that hold considerable potential for increased productivity. A cross-sectional household level data set collected through a formal survey using pre-tested structured questionnaires is used for the investigations. Various methodological approaches are employed including descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, the dual and primal approach to analysing the farm production, and mathematical programming. Cluster analysis yielded three household types in each of the two regions, and these household types form the basis for further analysis. The most important crops to the households in Kiambu are maize, potatoes and kale, as identified through farmer perception and restricted activity profit ranking. In Vihiga maize and beans remains the sole most important combination. Demand for fertiliser is price elastic with own price elasticity of - 2. 44 in Kiambu and - 1. 88 in Vihiga. Output prices of maize and of kale in Kiambu, and of maize in Vihiga also significantly influence the demand for <b>fertiliser</b> with elasticities <b>of</b> 0. 90, 0. 28 and 1. 58 respectively. In Kiambu, fertiliser price has very low elasticities on crop outputs, particularly of kale, which would seem to imply that fertiliser does not have a big impact on crop production. However, results fiom the primal approach show that currently labour is the constraining factor, particularly in kale production, making the impact <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> obscure. In fact, increasing the level <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use will have a substantial impact on the output of all the crops analysed, in both the regions. The results confirm previous observations that households are using much lower levels <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> than is optimal. If the market price <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and <b>of</b> the outputs is considered, the results show that households could profitably increase their level <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use on all the crops examined. However, the households' shadow price <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> is much higher than the market price implying that households consider other costs that we do not observe e. g. credit constraints.
