Jocelin was one of the bishops in August 1214 who refused to pay a <b>scutage</b> to the king.

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained <b>scutage,</b> feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E

At the same time, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother, is working to raise the ransom through more legal methods: by taxing clergy and laymen for a quarter of the value of their property, confiscating the gold and silver treasures of the churches, and imposing <b>scutage</b> and carucage taxes. Back in the small village of Locksley, Marian is captured and sent to the Sheriff's dungeon, where she is given an ultimatum: marry DeLacey or find herself charged with witchcraft. She is rescued by Robert, who arrives with his friends to free her. Just as they are about to be arrested by a wrathful Prince John, whose money has been stolen by the outlaws, King Richard arrives unexpectedly, allowing Robert and his associates to escape.|$|E
50|$|In {{northern}} France in the 12th and 13th centuries, {{military service}} for fiefs was limited for offensive campaigns to 40 days for a knight. By the 12th century, English and French kings and barons began to commute military service for cash payments (<b>scutages),</b> {{with which they}} could purchase the service of mercenaries.|$|R
5000|$|On {{his return}} to England, Wilson entered the service of Sir Robert Cecil, who leased to him a house {{adjoining}} his own, [...] "Britain's Burse", in Durham Place, Strand, London. He worked on supervising the building of Salisbury's house in Durham Place and also at Hatfield, near which he received from Cecil, now Lord Salisbury, the manor of Hoddesdon. In 1605 he was returned to parliament for Newtown, Isle of Wight; he took notes of its proceedings on matters including <b>scutages</b> and the [...] "post-nati" [...] for the government. He also kept the minutes of {{the proceedings of the}} committee for the Union of England and Scotland, and made a collection of the objections likely to be urged against the union in parliament.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to re-assess the system of {{military}} obligation in England at the earliest time sufficient documents survive to provide an in-depth explanation. It is both an examination of the twelfth-century feudal structure and lordship arrangements as described by these documents, and how they came to be in their twelfth-century forms. This is supplemented by a similar, but briefer, evaluation of the Regno of southern Italy and of the occasional relevant documents from Normandy. An examination of the place of military obligation in the kingdom of England covers three major areas: the assessment of this obligation, the cost of service both to the king and the individual knight, and how the men actually served. These three areas offer insight into how the Normans established the servicium debitum, how knights exempted themselves from their obligation or were compensated for extra service, and various aspects of what their service entailed, such as castle guard. A study of the returns made by tenants-in-chief in 1166 suggests that these have been misinterpreted in the past; their inspiration lay in the desire of the barons to protect themselves from excessive royal demands, rather than in the crown’s desire to update the servicium debitum. The survey conducted in the Regno earlier is unlikely to have served as a prototype for the 1166 inquiry; it was different in purpose and in form. <b>Scutages</b> are examined, to show the complex patterns of payment, and to suggest that under Henry II a significant number of tenants-in-chief performed their service, rather than commuted it. The Pipe Rolls are used to analyse military expenditure at a local level in two counties, Kent and Shropshire; in particular pay rates are reconstructed. A series of appendices provide details of this expenditure, along with evidence of <b>scutages...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{main source}} of income {{recorded}} on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls. <b>Scutage</b> payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} a {{sequence}} of innovative but unpopular financial measures. John levied <b>scutage</b> payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total {{during the reign of}} the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied {{in the absence of any}} actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that <b>scutage</b> was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony. The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; £44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders. John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown. John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the <b>scutage</b> system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E
40|$|The Exchequer {{and some}} of its revenue generating. aspects during the reign of Richard I, king of England 1189 - 1199. On 6 April 1199, Richard I of England died of a wound he {{received}} during the siege of a rebel stronghold at Chalus-Chabrol in the centre of Aquitaine. His death was lamented by the contemporary chroniclers who extolled his virtues, and mentioned his vices in passing. Richard was held to be a model king, brave in battle, noble in spirit, a patron of the arts and a fair judge to his people, even ifhis taxes were considered immoderate. This was Richard I's legacy, he was admired by later generations of English kings a model for them to emulate. However, this ideal was not to remain Richard's legacy in perpetuity. Historians ofthe emerging nation-state ofEngland began to tum against Richard for the limited time he actually spent in England, a little over six months in ten years, and his seeming greater concern for his French territory. Later constitutional historians saw Richard's reign as mere filler between the influential reigns of his father Henry II and his brother John. They saw no true administrative, legal or social innovations in the reign; instead these historians focussed upon Richard's increased demand upon the treasury of England and his English subjects, to fund his continental wars with Philip II ofFrance. Richard and his reputation had run the gamut from respected king to predatory, self-serving adventurer. The focus ofthis thesis is to explore Richard's reign, from the financial standpoint. By utilising the Pipe Rolls, the annual audits of Richard's exchequer, charter evidence, the other surviving bureaucratic records, this research delves into the relatively untapped world ofRichard's government and administration. Were Richard's fiscal policies ruinous to the English economy and therefore to blame for the economic woes ofJohn's reign? How much money was Richard able to extract from England and from which sources? This thesis examines various aspects of Richard's fiscal administration such as the management ofthe royal forests, Richard's legal revenues, the various taxes, aids and <b>scutages</b> levied both in the funding ofthe Third Crusade and after Richard's return, and Richard's system of patronage to answer these questions. To accomplish this,a series of databases were constructed which allowed for the pipe rolls and the transactions which they contain to be studied from a variety of perspectives. The pattern that unfolded ofhuman interaction within the structure of the English exchequer was fascinating. Richard I's administration of England was neither destructive to the economy nor horribly overbearing. Richard may share some of the blame for what occurred in John's reign, but he should not bear the brunt of the criticism for the financial woe that plagued his brother.

The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to the datafiles held in the Leicester database in the directory /orm/*. *. Taken from miscellaneous published and unpublished data, they relate to English revenues, especially those from indirect taxation.

25|$|On 20 May Fitzwalter {{fought in}} the Second Battle of Lincoln, in which the baronial forces were {{thoroughly}} defeated. Fitzwalter himself was taken prisoner along with his son {{and most of the}} leaders of his party. The Londoners still held out until Hubert de Burgh's great naval victory on 24 August. On 11 September the Treaty of Lambeth ended the struggle. But the reissue of the charter {{as the result of the}} treaty showed that Fitzwalter's cause had triumphed in spite of his personal failure. On 8 October 1217 Fitzwalter's release from prison was ordered, and on 24 January 1218 the king granted him his <b>scutage.</b> In July he received the custody of his nephew, Walter Fitzsimon Fitzwalter, whose father had died.|$|E
500|$|Most of the 1215 {{charter and}} later {{versions}} sought {{to govern the}} feudal rights of the Crown over the barons. Under the Angevin kings, and in particular during John's reign, {{the rights of the}} King had frequently been used inconsistently, often in an attempt to maximise the royal income from the barons. Feudal relief was one way that a king could demand money, and clauses 2 and 3 fixed the fees payable when an heir inherited an estate or when a minor came of age and took possession of his lands. <b>Scutage</b> was a form of medieval taxation; all knights and nobles owed military service to the Crown in return for their lands, which theoretically belonged to the King, but many preferred to avoid this service and offer money instead; the Crown [...] often used the cash to pay for mercenaries. The rate of <b>scutage</b> that should be payable, and the circumstances under which it was appropriate for the King to demand it, was uncertain and controversial; clauses 12 and 14 addressed the management of the process.|$|E
500|$|John met {{the rebel}} leaders at Runnymede, near Windsor Castle, on 15 June 1215. Langton's efforts at {{mediation}} created a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; {{it was later}} renamed Magna Carta, or [...] "Great Charter". The charter went beyond simply addressing specific baronial complaints, and formed a wider proposal for political reform, albeit one focusing {{on the rights of}} free men, not serfs and unfree labour. It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, new taxation only with baronial consent and limitations on <b>scutage</b> and other feudal payments. A council of twenty-five barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter, whilst the rebel army would stand down and London would be surrendered to the king.|$|E
500|$|One of John's {{principal}} challenges was {{acquiring the}} {{large sums of}} money needed for his proposed campaigns to reclaim Normandy. The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or demesne; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord; and revenue from taxation. Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest. Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the <b>scutage</b> system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king. He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges. John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, {{to the extent that he}} has been described as [...] "avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded". John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced.|$|E
2500|$|Robert [...] "son of Robert FitzWilliam", who {{following}} his father's death paid in Devon a large feudal relief for his inheritance. In 1194 he was excused <b>scutage</b> on 71 knight's fees, approximately 71 separate manors, which {{were known to}} have been held from the successor of the Count of Mortain. A drawing of his seal, appendant to an undated (during reign of King Richard I) grant of his mill of Cardinam to the Priory of Tywardreath, is reproduced in Lysons, Magna Britannia, Volume 3: Cornwall. It shows an eagle displayed circumscribed by the words: SIGILL(UM) ROBERTI DE CARDINAN ("seal of Robert de Cardinan").|$|E
2500|$|Due to his {{holding of}} a moiety of the barony of Newmarch, Russell became liable to provide one knight {{to the royal}} army for a fixed number of days per annum. Even before this grant it appears Russell held other lands by {{military}} tenure as in a Chancery document he is recorded as proffering knight service in 1213-14, but {{the size of his}} contingent is not legible. He received such a summons in 1218, as one of seven others in Somerset and Devon, one of 115 England-wide, to attend the royal army at Stamford on St John the Baptist's Day (15 July) in the third week of Henry III (1218). The army was to be used for the siege of Newark Castle, which was held against the king by Robert de Gaugy, a Flemish lieutenant of Philip Marc. The <b>scutage</b> roll states: Johannes Russel mittat unum militem pro terra qui fuit Jacobi de Novomercato (John Russell sent one knight in respect of the land which was of James de Newmarch (Latinised to [...] "New-Market")). Below this entry is the record of a summons to John de Bottrel, who held the other moiety of the barony of North Cadbury: Johannes de Botereauls veniat pro eadem terra (John de Bottrel came in respect of the same land).|$|E
2500|$|Edmund de Cornwall, John's grandfather, was {{the eldest}} son of Sir Richard of Cornwall, an illegitimate son of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, a very wealthy brother of Henry III who was also for a time King of the Romans. Hence the entire Cornwall line could justly claim descent from King John. Before the Cornwalls, their chief manor of Kinlet had belonged to Brian Brampton, who died late in 1294. His inquisition post mortem {{revealed}} a considerable portfolio of estates in the counties of Shropshire and Herefordshire in the Welsh Marches. Edmund took custody of the Brampton estates during the minority of Brian de Brampton's daughters and heiresses, Margaret and Elizabeth, under a grant made by Edward I on 2 January 1305, which called him the [...] "king's yeoman and kinsman". However, it seems the grant was only in confirmation, as Cornwall had levied <b>scutage</b> on the Brampton estates in 1300. He acquired Kinlet by marrying Elizabeth, the younger of the two heiresses: she was born on 16 December 1294, probably after her father's death. This Brampton inheritance included other estates, like Ashton in Herefordshire and Idbury in Oxfordshire. Edmund served his cousin the king in the First War of Scottish Independence, perhaps with some distinction and cost to himself, as the fact is mentioned in a royal licence to fell and sell 100 oaks in the Wychwood. After his death in 1354, his estates passed initially to his eldest son, also called Edmund, said variously to be 30 or 40 {{or more years of}} age, whose only son predeceased him sine prole.|$|E

5000|$|Separate levies of <b>scutage</b> {{received}} {{the names of}} the campaigns for which they were raised, as [...] "the <b>scutage</b> of Toulouse" [...] (or [...] "great scutage"), [...] "the <b>scutage</b> of Ireland", and so forth. The levy demanded from each fee one [...] mark (13s. 4d., two thirds of a pound), one pound or two marks, but anything above a pound seemed abnormal till John (reigned 1199-1216) imposed levies of two marks in most years without even the excuse of a war. The irritation caused by these exactions reached a climax in 1214, when John demanded three marks. Taxation through <b>scutage</b> became a prominent cause among the many that led to the rebellion of 1215, which culminated in the proclamation of Magna Carta of 1215. Its provisions prohibited the crown from levying any <b>scutage</b> save by [...] "the common counsel of our realm".|$|E
50|$|As feudal lord, {{the king}} {{had the right to}} collect <b>scutage</b> from the barons who held these honours. <b>Scutage</b> (literally shield money, from escutcheon) was a tax {{collected}} from vassals in lieu of military service. The payment of <b>scutage</b> rendered the crown more independent of the feudal levy and enabled it to pay for troops on its own. Once a tenant-in-chief received a demand for <b>scutage,</b> the cost was passed on to the sub-tenants and thus came to be regarded as a universal land tax. This tax was a development from the taxation system created under the Anglo-Saxon kings to raise money to pay off the invading Danes, the so-called Danegeld.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scutage</b> is {{a medieval}} English tax levied on holders of a knight's fee under the feudal land tenure of knight-service. Under feudalism the king, through his vassals, {{provided}} land to knights for their support. The knights owed the king military service in return. The knights {{were allowed to}} [...] "buy out" [...] of the military service by paying <b>scutage.</b> As time passed the king began to impose a <b>scutage</b> on holders knight's fees, even in time of peace.|$|E
50|$|The reissued Charter of 1217 provided, {{instead of}} this, that <b>scutage</b> levies should {{remain at the}} rate as {{of the reign of}} Henry II. In practice, however, under Henry III (reigned 1216-1272), <b>scutage</b> rates usually {{amounted}} to three marks, but required the assent of the barons, and levies occurred only on adequate occasions.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, a {{practice}} had arisen, possibly {{as early as}} Richard I's reign (1189-1199), of accepting from great barons special [...] "fines" [...] for permission not to serve in a campaign. This practice appears to have rested on the crown's right {{to decide whether to}} exact personal service or to accept <b>scutage</b> in lieu of service. A system of special composition thus arose which largely replaced the old one of <b>scutage.</b> As between the tenants-in-chief, however, and their under-tenants, the payment of <b>scutage</b> continued. The terms of charters of subinfeudation, which specified the quota of <b>scutage</b> due rather than the proportion of a knight's fee granted, often stereotyped <b>scutage.</b> For the purpose of recouping themselves by levying from their under-tenants, the tenants-in-chief received from the crown writs de scutagio habendo. Under Edward I (reigned 1272-1307) the new system developed so completely that the six levies of the reign, each as high as two pounds on the fee, applied in practice only to the under-tenants, their lords compounding with the crown by the payment of large sums, though their nominal assessment, somewhat mysteriously, became much lower (see knight service).|$|E
