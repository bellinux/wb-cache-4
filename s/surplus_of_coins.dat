5000|$|Louis B. Colavecchio (January 1, 1942-present) was an American casino {{counterfeiter}} {{known as}} [...] "The Coin". While residing in Rhode Island, Colavecchio defrauded several Atlantic City and Connecticut casinos until his arrest and initial conviction in 1998. He had led a gang which fabricated numerous slot machine coins using hardened steel dies of the originals, and was revealed when casinos {{began to notice}} a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> on their gaming floors. Sentenced to seven years, Colavecchio was released in 2006. He was arrested by the FBI {{only a few months}} later after having resumed his activities, and released on a $25,000 surety bond. His counterfeiting equipment was auctioned off on eBay following his arrest, and crimes were the subject of a documentary series Breaking Vegas from The History Channel, where he was portrayed by Angelo Fierro. Due to the initial success of his crime, casinos have slowly phased out tokens, replacing them with paper vouchers. Today slot machines will dispense a paper voucher when a play cashes out. The voucher are then redeemed for cash at kiosks located next to the cashier.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{accession}} of King George I (1714 - 1727) the <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>coins</b> was used up, and in 1717 {{a new contract}} was signed and a Royal Warrant issued {{for the production of}} a new halfpenny. The halfpennies struck in 1717 and 1718 looked slightly odd as they were smaller, thicker and somewhat lighter than the previous issues, weighing 9.4 - 10.3 grams with a diameter of 25 - 27 millimetres, but they were well-struck with high-relief features of the right-facing head of King George and the inscription GEORGIVS REX on the obverse, and Britannia with the inscription BRITANNIA and the date in the exergue beneath Britannia. The 1717 - 1718 issue is known as the dump halfpenny. For the 1719 - 1724 issue, the size <b>of</b> the <b>coin</b> was increased to 26 - 29 millimetres, though with the same weight of metal as before.|$|R
5|$|In total, 757,813,744 dollars dated 1979 {{were struck}} for {{circulation}} at the Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco Mints. Demand remained low through 1980, and the circulation strikes {{for that year}} totaled 89,660,708. Due to its persistent unpopularity, production of Anthony dollars for circulation was suspended, and 9,742,000 1981 dollars were struck across all three Mints exclusively for sale to collectors; this mintage {{marked the end of}} production. At the close of production, the Treasury encountered a dilemma: the Mint struck a large number of dollars in anticipation of great public demand, resulting in a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> 520,000,000 <b>coins</b> in 1981. Melting the coins was impractical; the cost of manufacture was approximately 2 cents, and the 98 cents earned from seignorage was applied to the national debt. Had the coins been melted, their seignorage would {{have been added to the}} debt. Accordingly, the coins were placed in government storage, to be dispensed as needed.|$|R

25|$|China needs {{not less}} than 120 million {{hectares}} of arable land for its food security. China has recently reported a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> 15 million hectares. On the other side <b>of</b> the <b>coin,</b> some 4 million hectares of conversion to urban use and 3 million hectares of contaminated land have been reported as well. Furthermore, a survey found that 2.5% of China's arable land is too contaminated to grow food without harm.|$|R
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the five-cent copper-nickel piece greatly decreased the popularity {{and use of the}} three-cent piece. The three-cent piece had debuted in 1865 with a mintage of over eleven million and nearly five million in 1866; thereafter strikings declined, falling to under a million by 1871, a figure the coin would thereafter exceed only twice. The public had preferred small bronze coins to paper money, then the three-cent nickel piece rather than the bronze; they now preferred the five-cent nickel to the three. One reason for this was that the base metal five-cent piece would be redeemed by the government if presented in $100 lots pursuant to a provision in the authorizing legislation. There was no such provision for the three-cent nickel piece; neither was there any for the other base metal coins. Following Pollock's resignation in 1866 over his objections to President Johnson's Reconstruction policies, the new Mint Director was Henry Linderman, who in his first annual report in 1867, described the redemption clause in the nickel's authorizing legislation as [...] "a most wise and just provision", urging its extension to the cent, two-cent piece, and three-cent piece. Postmasters were compelled to take three-cent nickel pieces in exchange for stamps, but had difficulty in depositing them in the Treasury in payment of their obligations, as the government would take no more than sixty cents worth of them in a single transaction. Private individuals and firms similarly refused them beyond the legal tender limit; those with a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> base metal <b>coins</b> often sold them at a discount.|$|R
50|$|By definition, a {{government}} budget deficit must exist so all three net to zero: for example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% of GDP (8.6% of GDP {{of which was}} federal), offsetting a foreign financial <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> 4% of GDP and a private-sector <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> 6% of GDP.|$|R

50|$|Yemen's import {{and export}} values have {{increased}} and decreased {{dramatically in the}} past 10 years owing to shifts in global oil prices. As a result, the country's trade balance has fluctuated significantly from a deficit of almost US$800 million in 1998 to a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> US$1 billion in 2000.

40|$|There {{are some}} {{different}} opinions among Commercial Law, Tax Law and Acoounting Principles concering the revaluation <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> assets and Capital Surplus.

The question is on the revaluation <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> fixed assets. Tax Law has a opinion that the revaluation <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> fixed assets is a profit and charges 6 % tax on it. On the contrary, Acoounting Principles regard it as Capital Surplus.

40|$|The study {{conducted}} during 1994 - 95 in Jalgaon and Kolhapur districts of Maharashtra showed two differing scenarios {{insofar as the}} impact of milk cooperatives on production and marketed surplus is concerned. While milk cooperatives had positive and significant impact on both production and marketed <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> milk in Kolhapur district, such impact could not be ascertained in Jalgaon district. The study also showed lower production and marketed surplus during summer season followed by rainy and winter seasons. However, the percentage marketed surplus was the highest in summer season followed by winter and rainy seasons. The higher percentage <b>of</b> marketed <b>surplus</b> in summer season was due to lower milk production, higher demand and higher prices offered by various agencies compared to other seasons. On an average, nearly three-fourths of milk produced was sold in extension and two-thirds in control area of both the selected districts. However, this proportion differed in different seasons and herd size categories. An analysis drawn from Marketed Surplus Function (MSF) also showed that total milk production in the household was the single most significant factor contributing to marketed <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> milk. The next important variable positively affecting the marketed <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> milk was the education level {{of the head of}} the household, particularly in control area of both the districts. Further, the negative impact of family size on the marketed <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> milk could be ascertained only in Kolhapur district. In general, price of milk had very little influence on the marketed <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> milk. Relatively small variation in price of milk within a season {{could be one of the}} reasons for lack of impact of price on marketed <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> milk. Since in the short run there was no possibility of increasing milk production despite variation in prices, the MSF did not show significant influence of prices on marketed <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> milk. ...|$|R
