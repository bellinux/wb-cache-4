500|$|A split <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> allows {{two players}} to cooperatively play through Halos campaign. The game also {{includes}} five competitive multiplayer modes, which all can be customized, for {{between two and}} 16 players; up to four players may play split-screen on one Xbox, and further players can join using a [...] "System Link" [...] feature that allows up to four Xbox consoles to be connected together into a local area network. Halo lacks artificially intelligent game bots, and was released before {{the launch of the}} Xbox Live online multiplayer service; therefore LAN parties are needed to reach the game's 16-player limit, a setup that was a first for a console game, but was often deemed impractical by critics. Aside from this limitation, Halos multiplayer components were generally well received by critics, and it is widely considered one of the best multiplayer games of all time.|$|E
500|$|As is {{the case}} with the other games in the Half-Life series, Decay is a first-person shooter. Like the {{original}} title it is based on, Decay requires players to engage in combat with hostile non-player characters and complete various puzzle solving tasks to advance through the game. However, Decay differs from Half-Life and its first two expansion packs, [...] and , in that it is designed for cooperative multiplayer gameplay. This requires players to work together to progress through the game's levels and complete puzzles as they arise in-game. Although intended to be played by two people in split <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> Decay can still be played by a single player. In this case, the player can only control one character at a time, and can switch between the two characters quickly. When not in use, a character has sufficient artificial intelligence to defend themselves, but otherwise does not move from where they have been left by the player.|$|E
500|$|A new {{iteration}} of the Start menu {{is used on}} the Windows 10 desktop, with a list {{of places}} and other options on the left side, and tiles representing applications on the right. The menu can be resized, and expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in Tablet mode. A new virtual desktop system was added. A feature known as Task View displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Windows Store apps, which previously could be used only in full <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> can now be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner. When a window is snapped {{to one side of the}} screen, Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of the screen (called [...] "Snap Assist"). Windows' system icons were also changed.|$|E

500|$|Lego Racers {{gameplay}} {{received a}} mixed reaction from critics. Charla called creating and testing cars {{a lot of}} fun, especially because the way a car is built has [...] "a major effect on how it controls", and IGN's reviewer for the PC version found that unlocking new bricks in the circuit mode for use in car customization is addictive. However, Stahl called the game's construction system unfriendly, stating that the player is [...] "better off just sticking {{with one of the}} default vehicles". Imperio said that handling the cars is [...] "surprisingly tight", calling the N64 control scheme intuitive. Conversely, Charla found that most of the cars feel top-heavy, and stated that the racing is awful. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system, calling it pretty cool, as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add [...] "a new strategy to the game", but Stahl called the system [...] "terribly lame". Reviewers also criticised the game's multiplayer features, with IGN's PC reviewer calling the split <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> simple, and an Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer stating that the [...] "lack of multiplayer options" [...] hurts Lego Racers replay value.|$|E
500|$|The delay {{from the}} initial summer time frame was widely {{reported}} as being due to a technical issue in development. David Reeves, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE), stated {{that it was a}} technical problem with the game that they were yet to solve. Reports soon emerged that the game had failed epilepsy testing, and that {{it would have to be}} re-engineered before it could be released. These reports were addressed by a SCEE representative, who stated that the delay was due to numerous improvements and added features, which included the reverse tracks, four extra ships, two new heads-up displays, the addition of two-player offline split <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> and trophy support. Addressing the reports of health issues, they affirmed that they [...] "take consumer safety very seriously and monitor it very carefully". A comparison video between the preview and final builds later showed greatly toned down equaliser visuals in the game's [...] "Zone Mode". The issues were confirmed when the Wipeout HDs director, Tony Buckley, spoke about the tests, saying that although he felt the tests were subjective and the exact issues [...] "difficult to pinpoint", they took them seriously and that the game has [...] "come out the other end alright, with a lot more content", despite their initial fears that the game would [...] "look poorer as a result".|$|E
500|$|There are two ground vehicles, a jeep and a tank, and {{an armored}} {{personnel}} carrier is added by the Operation: Broken Mirror expansion. There are two air vehicles, the Warhawk and Nemesis (which are only cosmetically different), {{both of which}} can use nine weapons, {{an example is the}} AS-3 Tow Missile system. That weapon is the only weapon in the game where the player guides the weapon, the players screen is devoted to guiding the missile and leaving the player open to getting hit. But the upside is that it does massive damage and is the largest explosion in the game. The Omega Dawn expansion adds a dropship, and the Fallen Star expansion adds a jetpack. There are three turrets available to the player (anti-air missile turret, anti-air flak turret, and the [...]50 caliber anti-infantry machine gun). The game uses the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers. The game can be set to make use of these controllers' motion sensing function to allow the players to control aircraft and ground vehicles by tilting the controller in different directions rather than the more conventional methods of using the D-pad or analog sticks. However, a traditional control scheme is the default option. Warhawk offers online and offline multiplayer play. Offline allows for 1-4 players splitscreen (without bots). [...] Online features up to 32-player battles, with the ability to have up to 4 players use one PlayStation 3 in split <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> (on non-ranked servers that permit it). Players 2-4 can enter or exit the game while a match is in progress.|$|E

500|$|The Dreamcast port of Incoming {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics. IGN opened their review by saying that, although the game [...] "is lacking in many areas, there's {{more than enough}} here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action." [...] Though criticizing the graphics' ability to [...] "get in the way at times," [...] the [...] "very vague" [...] mission briefings and the [...] "odd flying model for the planes," [...] the reviewer conceded that [...] "if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're {{looking for a good}} challenge, you'll probably want to look into Incoming." [...] GameSpy's review was harsher, describing the plot as [...] "the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type," [...] the multiplayer split <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> as [...] "lame" [...] and the objectives as [...] "mundane." [...] The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as [...] "a bit dated," [...] the reviewer did acknowledge the [...] "nifty special effects" [...] and admitted that [...] "Incoming may be worth a rental... is only slightly better than mediocre." [...] In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, GameVortex described the visuals as [...] "some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game." [...] Though describing the multiplayer as [...] "fun", it considered [...] "by far, the best [...] Campaign mode." [...] The review concluded by describing the game as [...] "lots of fun and highly recommended." ...|$|E

2500|$|Supreme Commander uses a [...] "strategic zoom" [...] {{system that}} allows the player to {{seamlessly}} zoom from a detailed close up view of an individual unit {{all the way out}} to a view of the entire map, at which point it resembles a fullscreen version of the minimap denoting individual units with icons. The camera also has a free movement mode and can be slaved to track a selected unit and there is a split <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> which also supports multiple monitors. This system allows Supreme Commander to use vast maps up 80km x 80km with players potentially controlling a thousand units each.|$|E
