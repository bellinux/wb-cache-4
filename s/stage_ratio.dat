Sir, Because Helicobacter pylori (HP) {{is widely}} {{accepted as a}} risk factor for gastric carcinoma (Blaser, 1999; Scheiman and Cutler, 1999), mass eradication has been proposed to prevent this common neoplasm (Scheiman and Cutler, 1999; Danesh, 1999). The postulated causal relationship, however, may be distorted by detection bias in which a ‘silent ’ cancer is coincidentally found when dyspeptic symptoms lead to an earlier diagnostic study. Evidence of this effect is an increased <b>stage</b> <b>ratio</b> of invasive/noninvasive gastric cancer in patients without HP. During a search of factors associated with presentation stage in 373 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer in the years between December of 1987 – 1998, we found a higher frequency of HP i...|$|E
40|$|In the {{indomethacin}} responsive headaches (IRHs), chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) and Hemicrania continua (HC), the indomethacin (INDO) {{response is}} swift, absolute, and permanent, with moderate doses. Traditionally, CPH {{has been linked}} to cluster headache (CH) due to clinical similarities: unilaterality, intensity, and some autonomic phenomena. However, other clinical features differ essentially between these two headaches: sex ratio, mean attack frequency (CPH: 13. 6 versus CH: 1. 7 attacks/day), and duration of attacks. The therapeutic profile in CPH (indomethacin effect: ++; triptan effect: generally non-existent) is reversed in CH. The autonomic phenomena also differ clearly, a forehead supersensitivity sweating pattern and Horner-like pupil being present only in CH. The chronic/non-chronic <b>stage</b> <b>ratio</b> is 3. 9 in CPH, against 0. 14 in CH, a > 25 times difference. Conversely, CPH and HC are very similar, clinically speaking.

The coefficient of static torque is independent of the Reynolds number for all the rotors tested. The {{performance of}} two stage and three stage rotors remains the same even after increasing the <b>stage</b> aspect <b>ratio</b> and the rotor aspect ratio by a factor of two and three, respectively. For the same rotor aspect ratio of 1. 0, by increasing the number of <b>stages</b> (<b>stage</b> aspect <b>ratio</b> decreases), the performance deteriorates in terms Cp and Ct.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a set of}} weights appropriate for estimating differences of a given variable of interest between two separate waves of the National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS). The NLTCS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of people aged 65 years old and older. The initial wave of the survey was in 1982 {{and it has been}} conducted every five years since 1984. The survey examines trends in disability, impairment, and mortality. In the cross-sectional weighting of many surveys we use a known set of totals to create second <b>stage</b> <b>ratio</b> adjustment factors, i. e., to post-stratify. This factor helps to correct the estimates for coverage problems and reduces the sampling variance of the resultant estimators. With an estimator of the difference of some value at two different times, it is not obvious how you would use the two sets of known totals that are available. For example, with NLTCS we have known totals for age/sex/race for both 1994 and 1999. Instead of only using one set of known totals, we consider the problem as a calibration problem which leads to a solution for two sets of known totals. This solution adjusts individual sample units who report at both times for both sets of known totals...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} work studies a small-scale biomass combustor (5 – 12 kW) with an underfed fixed bed using low air <b>staging</b> <b>ratios</b> (15 %– 30 %). This document {{focuses on the}} influence of the operative parameters on the combustion process, so gaseous emissions and the distribution and concentration of particulate matter have also been recorded. The facility shows good stability and test repeatability. For the studied airflow ranges, the results show that increasing the total airflow rate does not increase the overall air excess ratio because the burning rate is proportionally enhanced (with some slight differences that depend on the air <b>staging</b> <b>ratio).</b> Consequently, the heterogeneous reactions at the bed remain in the so-called oxygen-limited region, and thus the entire bed operates under sub-stoichiometric conditions with regards of the char content of the biomass. In addition, tests using only primary air (no staging) may increase the fuel consumption, but in a highly incomplete way, approaching a gasification regime. Some measured burning rates are almost 40 % higher than previous results obtained in batch combustors due to the fixed position of the ignition front. The recorded concentration of particulate matter varies between 15 and 75 mg/Nm 3, with a main characteristic diameter between 50 and 100 nm...|$|R

For BINO, we consider the realistic situation that buffer locations are restricted to a limited set of available spaces after cell placement. The objective of BINO is to minimize a weighted sum of wire and buffer costs subject to timing constraints. To achieve this objective, we suggest a greedy algorithm that considers two operations independently: iterative buffer insertion and iterative buffer deletion. Both are conducted simultaneously with nonHanan optimization until the improvement is exhausted. For FAR-DS, we investigate the curvature property of the sink delay {{as a function of}} both connection location and driver <b>stage</b> <b>ratio</b> in a twodimensional space. The objective of FAR-DS is to minimize a weighted sum of wire and driver cost while ensuring that the timing constraints are satisfied.

Insurance and range costs can each cost more than $ 1, 000 per pound if no effort is put into reducing them. Achieving low cost to LEO also requires solving problems associated with the economic limitations of chemical rockets, lack of business planning, and failure to identify a workable path that will take us from an immature to a mature launch industry. A mature launch industry would exhibit low cost to LEO and significant flight rates by reusable vehicles with long lifetimes. When today’s factors, limitations, and reality denials are combined, we believe that they prolong the difficulties of achieving low cost, routine flights to LEO.

The values of the under-detection model parameters were estimated from previously published records of the duration of symptoms prior to presentation and the ratio of early to late stage cases in 760 SS patients presenting at LIRI hospital, Tororo, Uganda during the 1988 – 1990 epidemic of SS. For the observed early to late <b>stage</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 47, we estimate {{that the proportion of}} under-detection in the catchment area of LIRI hospital was 0. 39 (95 % CI 0. 37 – 0. 41) i. e. 39 % of cases are not reported.

The deterministic (subset) model structured on the possible routes of a SS infection to either diagnosis or death through the health system or out of it, showed that of a total of 73 undetected deaths, 62 (CI 60 – 64) (85 %) entered the health care system but were not diagnosed, and 11 (CI 11 – 12) died without seeking health care from a recognized health unit.

40|$|Quacking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is {{an iconic}} species in western United States that offers {{multiple}} ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. A shift in forest cover towards coniferous species due to natural succession, land management practices, or climate change may modify soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and CO 2 emissions. The objectives {{of this study}} were to: (i) assess the effects of overstory composition on SOC storage and stability across the aspen-conifer ecotone, (ii) use Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) to assess whether SOC storage is associated with preferential adsorption of certain organic molecules to the mineral surfaces, and (iii) develop models using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict aspen- and conifer-derived SOC concentration. Mineral soils (0 – 15 cm) were sampled in pure and mixed aspen and conifer stands in Utah and subjected to physical fractionation to characterize SOC stability (i. e., SOC protected against microbial decomposition), long term laboratory incubations (i. e., SOC decomposability), and hot water extractions (i. e., SOC solubility). Vegetation cover had no effect on SOC storage (47. 0 ± 16. 5 Mg C ha− 1), SOC decomposability (cumulative released CO 2 -C of 93. 2 ± 65. 4 g C g− 1 C), SOC solubility (9. 8 ± 7. 2 mg C g− 1 C). Mineral-associated SOC (MoM) content was higher under aspen (31. 2 ± 15. 1 Mg C ha- 1) than under mixed (25. 7 ± 8. 8 Mg C ha− 1) and conifer cover (22. 8 ± 9. 0 Mg C ha− 1), indicating that aspen favors long-term SOC storage. FTIR-ATR spectral analysis indicated that higher MoM content under aspen is not due to higher concentration of recalcitrant compounds (e. g., aliphatic and aromatic C), but rather to stabilization of simple molecules (e. g., polysaccharides) of plant or microbial origin. NIRS models performed well during calibration-validation <b>stage</b> (<b>ratio</b> of standard deviation of reference values to standard error of prediction (RPD) ≥ 2). However, model performance decreased during independent validation (RPD = 1. 2 – 1. 6), probably due to the influence of soil texture, mineralogy, understory vegetation, and land history on SOC spectra. Further improvement of NIRS models could provide insight on SOC dynamics under potential conifer encroachment in semiarid montane forests...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} the effect of some natural factors on the {{suspension}} load of the Trinity River is aimed toward {{a better understanding of the}} general principles of fluvial sediment transport. The Trinity River drains an area of 17, 500 square miles. It discharged about 5, 321, 000 acre feet of water and 2, 740 acre feet of sediment to Trinity delta in 1965. The investigation of the factors controlling sediment transport was accomplished by using both graphical and analytical correlation techniques. Graphic analyses were made on both hydrographs and sediment rating curves to examine the general features of the factors and their variation both in time and in space. Five variables - stream discharge, surface runoff, base flow, air temperature, and water <b>stage</b> <b>ratio</b> - were chosen as independent variables, and two variables - silt discharge and concentration - as dependent variables for the correlation study. Correlation coefficients show high interdependence between independent variables. Those between independent and dependent variables show some variation in significance among seasons. A successive elimination method was used to select the important independent variables. Surface runoff and base flow were both removed from further study because correlation coefficients to the remainder of the independent variables became insignificant after the factor of total stream discharge was eliminated. The remaining three independent variables were used in a model study employing both conventional regression and factor analysis. Combinations of different factors were analyzed to evaluate the net contribution of the predictors to the dependent variables. The percentage of variance of dependent variables accounted for due to regression is smaller for the October to December period than for other periods. Total stream discharge is found to be the most important independent factor in all analyses. This variable alone accounts for up to 92 percent of the variance of silt discharge. Thus it makes all the other factors ineffective. The ratio of water discharge in two successive days representing the rising or falling water stage is found to be important in upstream areas and contributes 10 percent to the silt discharge variance and 28 percent to the concentration variance. Application of the models to an unanalyzed set of data shows better predictability by conventional methods than by factor analysis when the new data were from the same area as previously analyzed. Applications of the models to the data from different areas show large standard errors. The standard error for prediction of concentrations is less than that for silt discharge...|$|E

Larval behaviors such as body wall contractions, developmental time frames, time frame for developmental <b>stages,</b> <b>ratio</b> of pupae development and hatching, and adult survival and lifespan will be used to compare to a group of flies experiencing normal nutrition and conditions. This investigation is not complete as of this time...|$|R
