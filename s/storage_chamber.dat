5|$|Alma is {{nonetheless}} freed when her <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> is opened by ATC researcher {{and leader of}} Project Origin, Harlan Wade (Grant Goodeve), who felt guilty over the company's treatment of Alma and who was actually her father. The player is then called to sabotage the structure's reactor, running a gauntlet against Alma's ghosts before the whole location explodes. In {{the aftermath of the}} detonation, a Delta Force Black Hawk helicopter extracts the Point Man from the rubble, rescuing him. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Jin wonders what happened to Alma. Just then, the helicopter loses power, and Alma is seen pulling herself up into the cabin: the destruction of the Origin facility has not stopped her quest to get closer to her son.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by Ganger Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is suffering, and questions their need to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by Ganger Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E
25|$|Reineboth {{takes all}} the {{personnel}} of the <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> to {{an investigation by}} the Gestapo. Pippig is subject to horrible torture. After seeing his injuries, prisoner August Rose has a nervous breakdown and confesses all. Pippig dies of his wounds. Kluttig raids the barrack, but cannot find the child.|$|E
5000|$|The {{establishment}} of the technical installations for the disposal and <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> started. The conversion will take several years, storage is scheduled to start in 2013. Clustered <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> form a <b>storage</b> depot. In total, up to nine storage depots are projected on the existing main soles on 800, 850, 1000, 1100, 1200 and 1300 m depth. The <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> are created with a diameter of about 40 m² with a bottom width of about 7 meters and a height of about 6 meters. Its length should be - depending on the geological and mining technical conditions - 100 to 1000 meters.|$|R
50|$|The Laboratory covers {{drawing up}} {{documentation}} of genetic resources of crop plants and exchanges information with other genebanks. It also obtains seed samples of crop plants from {{national and international}} breeding centres. As for the long-term conservation, seed samples {{need to be prepared}} and have their viability tested before they are stored in temperature controlled chambers. NCPGR has three long-term <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> (-18 °C) and five medium-term <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> (0 °C).|$|R

25|$|Structure 61 {{is notable}} for a chultun (a {{man-made}} subterranean <b>storage</b> <b>chamber)</b> {{that was found}} carved from the limestone bedrock under the central axis of its stairway. The chaltun was empty and had been carefully sealed prior to the abandonment of the site and {{it is believed that}} it had been created in order to receive a burial but was never used.|$|E
25|$|The RICAS2020 project {{attempts}} {{to use an}} abandoned mine for adiabatic CAES with heat recovery. The compression heat is stored in a tunnel section filled with loose stones, so the compressed air is nearly cool when entering the main pressure <b>storage</b> <b>chamber.</b> The cool compressed air regains the heat stored in the stones when released back through a surface turbine, leading to a higher overall efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Cedar {{wood and}} cedar oil {{are known to}} be a natural {{repellent}} to moths, hence cedar is a popular lining for modern-day cedar chests and closets in which woolens are stored. This specific use of cedar is mentioned in The Iliad (Book 24), referring to the cedar-roofed or lined <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> where Priam goes to fetch treasures to be used as ransom. However, the species typically used for cedar chests and closets in North America is Juniperus virginiana, which is different from the true cedars (note also common confusion with Thuja spp. below). Cedar is also commonly used to make shoe trees as it can absorb moisture and deodorise.|$|E

50|$|The burrow system {{consists}} {{primarily of}} foraging tunnels, which the rats dig {{in search of}} food. While particularly large tubers and bulbs are at least partially eaten where they are found, smaller ones are dragged to food <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> beneath the foraging tunnels. The foraging tunnels are typically only 5 to 25 cm beneath the soil, but are connected to {{a smaller number of}} deep tunnels that lead down to the <b>storage</b> <b>chambers,</b> latrines, and a central nest that may be as much as 2.5 m underground.|$|R
50|$|Group B is {{situated}} 60 m south of Group A. The group {{consists of two}} small clusters of buildings grouped around their respective plazas and contains a number of chultunob (subterranean <b>storage</b> <b>chambers).</b>|$|R
25|$|The large {{majority}} of known organisms use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. One unique use of catalase occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes {{the contents of the}} two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats the mixture to the boiling point.|$|E
2500|$|KV63 is {{the most}} {{recently}} opened chamber in Egypt's Valley of the Kings pharaonic necropolis. Initially {{believed to be a}} royal tomb, it is now believed to have been an ancient <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> for the mummification process. The 2005 discovery of KV63, located about [...] away from King Tut's tomb, is credited to American Egyptologist Dr. Otto Schaden and his team from the University of Memphis.|$|E

50|$|All of the spalacid species dig {{extensive}} underground burrows, {{which may}} include <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> for food, latrine chambers, and breeding nests. They are generally solitary animals, {{and do not}} share their tunnel complexes with other individuals. All the species are herbivores, feeding on roots, bulbs, and tubers.|$|R
50|$|The Royers bridge {{consists}} of a road deck {{on top of the}} gate and a lift bridge on top of the <b>storage</b> <b>chamber.</b> When opening the lower gate, the bridge is lifted to about 15° to allow the gate to slide inside the <b>storage</b> <b>chamber.</b> The original Lefèbvre bridge has been replaced and now {{consists of}} the road deck on top of the gate and a rolling bridge accessible from the sides, to cover the <b>storage</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sixty-five {{chambers}} {{are grouped}} around the tomb, {{most of which}} should be interpreted as ancillary burials, though {{one of them was}} probably a <b>storage</b> <b>chamber.</b> Some of the chambers contained large numbers of ivory carvings.|$|E
50|$|The {{galician}} granary is {{an agricultural}} building intended for drying, curing and storing the corn before threshing and grinding it.

50|$|Tuco-tucos {{get their}} common {{name from the}} calls they make, either issued from the {{entrance}} to the burrow or from underground. They have complex burrows with many tunnels and several food <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> as well as a nesting chamber. They are solitary creatures and feed on roots and grasses.|$|R
50|$|The {{common hamster}} is a nocturnal or crepuscular species. It {{lives in a}} complex burrow system. It eats seeds, legumes, root vegetables, grasses and insects. It {{transports}} its food in its elastic cheek pouches to the food <b>storage</b> <b>chambers.</b> These may be quite large and may consist {{of a total of}} 65kg of food including 5kg of potatoes and 15kg of grain It hibernates between October and March. During this time, it wakes every five to seven days to feed from the <b>storage</b> <b>chambers.</b> The adults reach sexual maturity when they are about 43 days old and breed from early April to August. The gestation period is 18-20 days {{and the size of the}} litter ranges from three to 15 young, which are weaned when aged three weeks. They are usually solitary animals.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the classic}} {{behavioral}} characteristics of hamsters (subfamily Cricetinae) is food hoarding. Hamsters carry food to their underground <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> using their spacious cheek pouches. A hamster [...] "can literally fill its face with food." [...] When full, the pouches can make the hamsters' heads double, or even triple in size.|$|R
50|$|A chultun (plural: chultunob or chultuns) is a bottle-shaped {{underground}} <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> {{built by}} the pre-Columbian Maya in southern Mesoamerica. Their entrances were surrounded by plastered aprons which guided rainwater into them during the rainy seasons. Most of these archaeological features likely functioned as cisterns for potable water.|$|E

50|$|Group B {{is located}} in a lower and flatter area to the south and {{includes}} at least five mounds or platforms. Group C is located further south along the site's main axis and comprises eight structures on a hill, possibly representing temples and palaces. A chultun, a bottle-shaped underground <b>storage</b> <b>chamber,</b> is situated to the west of Group C.|$|E
50|$|The {{activity}} {{cycle is}} a nocturnal. The species feeds on seeds and insects. It constructs shallow tunnels and burrows under boulders, creating <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> where excess food is stored for winter use. Abandoned burrows {{of other animals}} are sometimes used and side-passages are created leading to grass-lined nesting chambers. Breeding starts in March or April and two or more litters of up to nine young are born during the summer.|$|R
