One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E

I have learned a lot by listening to lectures at this conference. I have presented my paper as scheduled. There was a big interest in the paper, reflected by questions. I decided to expand the work and have already submitted another paper on the same subject to another conference. I have discovered a great interest in introducing <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> as a method of education. The subject is being hot research area these days. <b>Serious</b> <b>games</b> are computer games that train, educate and inform while entertaining. The <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> industry has been developing since 2000 but has only gained momentum since 2004. The lucrative games industry promised to bring their advanced technology to <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> and that <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> will not provide for developing skills needed in the workplace, not the rote memorization provided by the edutainment industry. <b>Serious</b> <b>games</b> are geared towards the adult learner, and include games played on computers, handheld devices, arcade games and video <b>games.</b> <b>Serious</b> <b>games</b> will use the best simulations and the lessons learned from the edutainment industry. Adult learners have different needs from children, and <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> should be able to fulfill these needs. The most successful form of teaching is one-on-one tutoring. It is estimated that <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> will be able to mimic this or come closest to the success of this form of teaching. In the corporate world fast, effective training that provides a satisfactory return on investment is required. <b>Serious</b> <b>games</b> will up the latter as it has been proven more effective than other methods of training. The net –generation thinks and behaves differently from other generations. <b>Serious</b> <b>games</b> will provide the stimulus that they require to accommodate their learning. There are challenges ahead though for the <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> industry mostly in changes consumer attitude that regards games in general as frivolous. The <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> industry on the other hand might provide developers with much needed work between contracts, and ensure business of the independent developer. The games industry will bring their very sophisticated technology to <b>serious</b> <b>games.</b> This will include hardware developed for the games industry, complex artificial intelligence algorithms, highly developed middleware and a plethora of peripheral devices. <b>Serious</b> <b>games</b> can also make use of the already developed network technology and especially the internet. <b>Serious</b> <b>games</b> already developed can be divided into categories such as games for military, business, health sector, government, higher education, K- 12 education and non-governmental agencies. The wide variety of games coupled with many examples where <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> proved to be not only successful but provide an acceptable return on investment, the demands of the net-generation and the technology of the games industry indicates a very successful future for the <b>serious</b> <b>games</b> industry.
