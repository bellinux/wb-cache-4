40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} analysis of delimiters for pen gestures. A delimiter is “something different ” in the input stream that a computer {{can use to}} determine the structure of input phrases. We study four techniques for delimiting a selection-action gesture phrase consisting of lasso selection plus marking-menu-based command activation. Pigtail is a new technique that uses a small loop to delimit lasso selection from marking (Fig. 1). Handle adds a box {{to the end of}} the lasso, from which the user makes a second stroke for marking. Timeout uses dwelling with the pen to delimit the lasso from the mark. Button uses a button press to signal when to delimit the gesture. We describe the role of delimiters in our Scriboli pen interaction testbed, and show how Pigtail supports <b>scope</b> <b>selection,</b> command activation, and direct manipulation all in a single fluid pen gesture...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWireless {{reprogramming}} in (WSN) is {{the process}} of inseminating new code or correlated commands to sensor nodes. It enables sensor nodes to self-reprogram so adapting them to unravelling milieu. WSN Applications include geophysical/habitat monitoring, controlling disaster, battlefield information, collection and monitoring, security surveillance and home entry systems. WSN poses security challenges including forgery of sensor data, eavesdropping, DOS attacks, and compromise of sensor nodes. Hence, to avoid pernicious nodes from joining the sensor network, immense security is required in network protocols. The secure and distributed reprogramming protocol is inherent to impersonization and altered/spoofed information attack by which an adversary can impersonate any privileged user to perform re-programming. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to implement new re-programming protocol that is more secure and faster while maintaining all the major functions of re-programming such as version control, <b>scope</b> <b>selection,</b> encoding/decoding, code dissemination.

Due to repeated testing: across different testing levels, over time (test for regression) {{as well as of}} different variants, the risk of double testing is large as well as the risk of overlooking important tests, hidden by the huge amount of possible tests. This paper discusses the need and challenges of providing decision support for test planning and test selection in a product line context, and highlights possible paths towards a pragmatic implementation of context-specific decision support of various levels of automation. With existing regression testing approaches it is possible to provide automated decision support in a few specific cases, while test management in general may be supported through visualization of test execution coverage, the testing space and the delta between the sufficiently tested system and the system under test. A better understanding of the real world context and how to map research results to the same is needed. I...|$|E

40|$|Starting {{out with}} some {{intriguing}} parallels and differences between French beaucoup ‘a lot ’ and souvent ‘often’, this paper develops {{an account of the}} distributional and semantic properties of four classes of adverbial expressions of quantity: frequency adverbs (souvent), relative degree adverbs (beaucoup), absolute degree adverbs (un peu ‘a bit’) and x-times adverbs (trois fois ‘three times’). These four classes are distinguished on the basis of two properties, which are defined in terms of the type of quantity and quantification over ‘times ’ or eventualities respectively. Souvent and beaucoup correspond to relative quantities, while un peu and trois fois are absolute quantities. Souvent and trois fois quantify over times, while beaucoup and un peu do not. The classification can account for a number of properties of the four types of adverbs with respect to <b>scope,</b> <b>selection,</b> iteration, habituality and the possibility of so-called relational readings.

40|$|Context: In large {{software}} {{organizations with}} a product line development approach, system test planning and <b>scope</b> <b>selection</b> {{is a complex}} task. Due to repeated testing: across different testing levels, over time (test for regression) {{as well as of}} different variants, the risk of redundant testing is large as well as the risk of overlooking important tests, hidden by the huge amount of possible tests. Aims: This study assesses the amount and type of overlaid manual test- ing across feature, integration and system test in such context, it explores the causes of potential redundancy and elaborates on how to provide decision sup- port in terms of visualization for the purpose of avoiding redundancy. Method: An in-depth case study was launched including both qualitative and quantitative observations. Results: A high degree of test overlay is identified originating from distributed test responsibilities, poor documentation and structure of test cases, parallel work and insufficient delta analysis. The amount of test overlay depends on which level of abstraction is studied.

40|$|As bird-watching gains popularity, {{there have}} been various {{techniques}} utilized by tourism planners to attract birdwatchers. One method of drawing birders to a specific region is {{through the development of}} a birding trail. Although there are many birding trails with varying levels of success, there was little research as to how birding trails should be designed, implemented and managed. Perhaps, a new and viable approach to birding trail development would be to plan them as tourism product clubs. A product club is an association of tourism service providers working together to deliver an integrated service. Product clubs have been successfully implemented in Barbados with golf tourism and in Spain with winery tourism. However, the concept of a product club has never been applied to bird-watching tourism. Therefore, this research tested the idea of utilizing the product club concept for bird-watching tourism. The methodology had three separate phases. Phase one involved interviewing officials of existing tourism trails, to see how they planned and managed their trails. These interviews illustrated how and what is involved with tourism trail planning and management. Phase two involved the choice of a case study location, the County of Essex and Chatham-Kent in Ontario. Phase three was planning the trail by forming an Advisory Committee consisting of key industry, non-government and government stakeholders. The Advisory Committee assisted with the following key decisions: trail size and <b>scope,</b> <b>selection</b> of birding sites, choosing accessory tourism service institutions, developing a product club oversight organization, marketing the product club, and the management, evaluation and monitoring of the trail.

40|$|Background - We {{investigate}} the <b>scope</b> for <b>selection</b> {{at the level}} of nuclei within fungal individuals (mycelia) of the mutualistic Termitomyces cultivated by fungus-growing termites. Whereas in most basidiomycete fungi the number and kind of nuclei is strictly regulated to be two per cell, in Termitomyces mycelia the number of nuclei per cell is highly variable. We hypothesised that natural selection on these fungi not only occurs between mycelia, but also {{at the level of}} nuclei within the mycelium. We test this hypothesis using in vitro tests with five nuclear haplotypes of a Termitomyces species. Results - First, we studied the transition from a mixture of five homokaryons (mycelia with identical nuclei) each with a different nuclear haplotype to heterokaryons (mycelia with genetically different nuclei). In vitro cultivation of this mixture for multiple asexual transfers {{led to the formation of}} multiple heterokaryotic mycelia, and a reduction of mycelial diversity over time. All heterokaryotic mycelia contained exactly two types of nucleus. The success of a heterokaryon during in vitro cultivation was mainly determined by spore production and to a lesser extent by mycelial growth rate. Second, heterokaryons invariably produced more spores than homokaryons implying that homokaryons will be outcompeted. Third, no homokaryotic ‘escapes’ from a heterokaryon via the formation of homokaryotic spores were found, despite extensive spore genotyping. Fourth, in contrast to most studied basidiomycete fungi, in Termitomyces sp. no nuclear migration occurs during mating, limiting the scope for nuclear competition within the mycelium. Conclusions - Our experiments demonstrate that in this species of Termitomyces the <b>scope</b> for <b>selection</b> at the level of the nucleus within an established mycelium is limited. Although ‘mate choice’ of a particular nuclear haplotype is possible during mating, we infer that selection primarily occurs between mycelia with two types of nucleus (heterokaryons) ...|$|R
