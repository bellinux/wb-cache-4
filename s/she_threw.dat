Miceli immediately began using the Madusa name again, and the company brought in Bull Nakano to feud with her; they battled in a match at Hog Wild in August 1996. Due to pre-match stipulations, Madusa was allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle after the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{penultimate}} {{match on}} the card saw Eve defend the WWE Divas Championship against Maryse.

Eve performed a standing moonsault and a sunset flip for a near-fall. Maryse countered a rolling senton splash attempt by Eve and went for her finishing move, the French Kiss; that was countered by Eve for the pin, who retained her championship.|$|E
5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When she could no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage <b>she</b> <b>threw</b> a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E
