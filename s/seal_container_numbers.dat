40|$|The {{safe storage}} of pure and impure {{plutonium}} oxide materials in <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> is a current Department of Energy (DOE) concern. Plutonium oxides sorb {{moisture from the}} atmosphere, and the subsequent radiolytic and/or chemical decomposition of the water has been thought to generate excessive hydrogen pressures inside <b>sealed</b> <b>containers.</b> Eleven <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> with ten grams each of plutonium oxide materials have been studied for up to four years. The sealed materials were representative materials from the DOE complex and contain less than 0. 5 weight percent water. The samples were kept at ambient conditions. We report the final gas analysis of the headspace gas of these containers using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy. The results show {{that none of the}} containers have pressurized significantly, and that hydrogen was not generated in significant quantities...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion and pitting {{have been}} {{observed}} in headspace regions of stainless steel containers enclosing plutonium oxide/salt mixtures. These observations {{are consistent with the}} formation of a corrosive gas, probably HCl, and transport of that gas to the headspace regions of <b>sealed</b> <b>containers.</b> The NH{sub 4 }Cl films found {{on the walls of the}} <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> is also indicative of the presence of HCl gas. Radiolysis of hydrated alkaline earth salts is the probable source of HCl...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of aerosols and the contamination of surfaces {{arising from the}} use of a number of special purpose centrifuges have been measured. Except when <b>sealed</b> <b>containers</b> were used all the equipment tested generated airborne particles and contaminated surrounding surfaces. The magnitude of this contamination was shown to be associated with several factors, and it could be considerably reduced by the use of <b>sealed</b> <b>containers,</b> and by fitting air filters.

5000|$|If {{a liquid}} in a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> is boiled, the {{pressure}} inside the container increases. As the liquid changes to a gas it expands - this expansion in a vented container {{would cause the}} gas and liquid to take up more space. In a <b>sealed</b> <b>container</b> the gas and liquid {{are not able to}} take up more space and so the pressure rises. Pressurized vessels containing liquids can reach an equilibrium where the liquid stops boiling and the pressure stops rising. This occurs when no more heat is being added to the system (either because it has reached ambient temperature or has had a heat source removed).|$|R
