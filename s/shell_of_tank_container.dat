40|$|Lured by {{the promise}} of bigger sales, {{companies}} are increasingly looking to raise the volume of international trade. Consequently, the amount of bulk products carried in containers and transported overseas exploded because of the flexibility and reliability of this type of transportation. However, minimizing the logistics costs arising from the container flow management across different terminals has emerged asa major problem that companies and affiliated third-party logistics firms face routinely. The empty tankcontainer allocation problem occurs in the context of intermodal distribution systems management and transportation operations carried out by logistic service provider companies. This paper considers the time-evolving supply chain system of an international logistic service provider company that transports bulk products loaded in <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> via road, rail and sea. In such system, unbalanced movements <b>of</b> loaded <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> forces the company to reposition empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to develop a mathematical model that supports tactical decisions for flow management <b>of</b> empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> The problem involves dispatching empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> <b>of</b> various types to the meet on-time delivery requirements and repositioning the other <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> to storage facilities, depots and cleaning stations. To this aim, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) multiperiod optimization model is developed. The model is analyzed and developed step by step, and its functionality is demonstrated by conducting experiments on the network from our case study problem, within the boarders of Europe. The case study constitutes three different scenarios <b>of</b> empty <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> allocation. The computational experiments show that the model finds good quality solutions, and demonstrate that cost and modality improvements can be achieved in the network The sensitivity analysis employs a set of data from our case study and randomly selected data to highlight certain features of the model and provide some insights regarding the model’s behavior...|$|R

40|$|Hazardous and noxious {{substances}} (HNS) {{are widely}} transported in marine vessels to reach {{every part of}} the world. Bulk transportation of hazardous chemicals is carried out in tank container–carrying cargo ships or in designed vessels. Ensuring the safety of HNS containers during maritime transportation is critically important as the accidental release of any substance may be lethal to the on-board crew and marine environment. A general assumption in maritime accidents in open ocean is that it will not create any danger to the coastal population. The case study discussed in this article throws light on the dangers latent in maritime HNS accidents. An accident involving an HNS-carrying marine vessel in the Arabian Sea near the coast of Yemen became a safety issue to the coastal people of Kasargod District of Kerala, India. The ship carried more than 4000 containers, which were lost to the sea in the accident. Six HNS <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> were carried by the waves and shored at the populated coast of Kasargod, more than 650 nautical miles east from the accident spot. The unanticipated sighting <b>of</b> <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> in the coast and the response of the administration to the incident, the hurdles faced by the district administration in handling the case, the need for engaging national agencies and lessons learned from the incident are discussed in the article. This case study has proven that accidents in the open ocean have the potential to put the coastal areas at risk if the on-board cargo contains hazardous chemicals. Littoral nations, especially those close to the international waterlines, must include hazardous chemical spills to their oil spill contingency plans. </p...|$|R

Mobile cryogenics <b>container</b> <b>tank</b> has been designed for transportation of LNG as well as other liquefied cryogenic gases with the temperature down to – 196 °C. The analysis included two types of logistics solutions: one involving the transport full container, which is removable from the vehicle and left in the workplace, and the second solution with reloading from mobile <b>tank</b> into simplified <b>container</b> <b>tank</b> or other mobile tank located in the workplace. Simplified <b>container</b> <b>tank</b> and mobile tank have been designed to storage some cryogenics gases as well as mobile container but without transportation of them.

Simulation results show the long storage times obtained for a simplified container which are close to the times obtained by stationary tanks, however a lot easier to transport without charge.

40|$|The tanks {{used for}} the {{transportation}} of liquid over the road-ways {{is an integral part}} of the Carrier Vehicle. The tank is expected to withstand the unbalanced forces on account of the transit over uneven and irregular surfaces of the road and also due to sudden acceleration or deceleration (due to application of brakes) phenomena. Analysis of the sloshing motion of a contained liquid is of great practical importance. Motion of a fluid can persist beyond application of a direct load to the container; the inertial load exerted by the fluid is time-dependent and can be greater than the load exerted by a solid of the same mass. Hence the associated structural behavior must be investigated in the design <b>of</b> <b>tanks.</b> The <b>container</b> design (shape, materials with elastic, viscoelastic and elastoplastic behavior) can have a considerable effect on the dynamic damping of the sloshing waves.
