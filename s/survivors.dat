5000|$|Ungar's classic {{generation}} scavenger has two generations. It {{divides the}} youngest generation, called [...] "new space", {{into a large}} [...] "eden" [...] in which new objects are created and two smaller [...] "survivor spaces", past <b>survivor</b> space and future <b>survivor</b> space.
