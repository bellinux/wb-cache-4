5000|$|Rule 10.22(a) of the Official Baseball Rules make a <b>single</b> <b>allowance</b> to {{the minimum}} {{requirement}} of 502 plate appearances. If a player {{has less than}} that minimum amount, but if that player would win the batting, slugging or on-base percentage title if he had that minimum amount, then the amount of at bats he is short may be added to his at bat (and hence plate appearance) total so that he may win that title (assuming that his batting average, which {{would have to be}} recalculated after these extra at bats were added, would still be the best in his respective league.) For example, in 2012, Melky Cabrera, then of the San Francisco Giants, finished the season with a league-high [...]346 batting average, but he had only 501 plate appearances, one short of the required 502. Per the rule, an extra at bat should have been added to his total because, after it is added and his batting average recalculated, he still would have won the batting title. Melky's case, however, turned out differently. The reason Melky finished the season with only 501 at bats was because he was suspended in mid-August when he tested positive for illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Melky was still eligible for that extra plate appearance, but he requested that that extra plate appearance not be added to his total, and that he not be considered for the batting crown, because he admitted that his use of performance-enhancing drugs had given him an unfair advantage over other players. As a result, Melky's name is nowhere to be found on the list of 2012 National League batting leaders.|$|E

In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the <b>single</b> personal <b>allowance,</b> marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969–70 and 1970–71. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly. In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.|$|R

Indeed, the government claimed the gains from return to work, {{after a period}} of unemployment, were offset by the reduction of social benefits paid in the previous period. That led to threshold effects and to inactivity trap situations. The National Observatory of Poverty and social exclusion said that the number of excluded people was deteriorating, while the number of working poor's was increasing (1.7 million in 2005).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the 1998 reform of the French <b>single</b> parents <b>allowance</b> on the labor supply of single mothers with very young children. The reform aimed at encouraging participation by allowing eligible single parents to accumulate benefits and labor earnings for a limited period of time. Using data from the French Employment Survey, the analysis shows that single mothers affected by the reform had experienced a significant increase in their employment rate four years after the reform was implemented. During the same period, the employment rate of married mothers with young children did not experience a significant change, suggesting that {{at least part of the}} increase was a consequence of the reform. These results provide some evidence that benefit schedules that provide financial incentives to work can have significant effects in getting single moms back to work, even in the presence of very young children.

25|$|The Third Modification Law (1974) {{extended}} individual entitlements {{to social}} assistance {{by means of}} higher-income limits compatible with receipt of benefits and lowered age limits for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established. Allowances for retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport.

40|$|The vitamin D has {{recently}} {{been the subject of}} many researches, demonstrating new effects, reinforcing the interest for this molecule. The interest to develop products fortified with vitamin D is thus very important. Regarding references values, it is necessary to distinguish the RDAs (Recommended Daily <b>Allowances),</b> <b>single</b> value set up at 5 μg/d for vitamin D at the European level, in order to be a reference and a labeling value, from the nutritional recommendations. These recommendations are defined by groups of population. The values vary according to the countries and the dates on which they were set, the most recent being usually higher. The vitamin D fortification is less constrained in France today than before 2006. To fortify a food with vitamin D, it is necessary to follow the rules set by the Regulation 1925 / 2006 /EC, and use the formulations authorized, demonstrate the nutritional benefit of the fortification, and ensure that the fortification does not lead to a risk for the health of the consumers. In some countries, the vitamin D fortification has been made mandatory for some foods. In France, several products are fortified with vitamin D, especially dairy products, but also some breakfast cereals and vegetable oils. Finally, the communication that can be made on vitamin D in food or advertising is strictly regulated by the Regulation 1924 / 2006 /EC...|$|R

There was determined, by statutory regulation issued in February 1970, the category of persons most seriously disabled “to whom, with regard to maintenance aid, an increased demand (50% of the appropriate rate) is being conceded, and, within the scope of relief in special living conditions: a higher rate of nursing aid.” In 1971, the retirement age for miners was lowered to 50. An April 1972 law providing for [...] "promotion of social aid services" [...] aimed to remedy, through various beneficial measures (particularly in the field of national insurance and working conditions), the staff-shortage suffered by social establishments in their medico-social, educational and other work. A bill to harmonize re-education benefit and another bill relating to severely handicapped persons became law in May and September 1972 respectively. In 1972, winter payments for construction workers were introduced.|$|R
40|$|This book is {{the result}} of a {{workshop}} about emission permit markets in Venice, organized by the editors in collaboration with CESifo. The individual contributions were written independently of each other and differ in topic and methodology, yet they share the underlying theme of theoretical and empirical research in emission permit markets.   The chapters are grouped into four thematic sections: A discussion of the development of the EU ETS since its beginning to the present; political economy considerations; interactions with parallel instruments for climate policy; and firm behavior in this new market.   Although all contributions are economic in nature, they depart from rigorous assumptions often encountered in economics research, or examine to what extent market participants’ action can in fact be explained by neoclassical theory.   The overall findings are that the market appears to work in the sense that there is a <b>single</b> price for <b>allowances,</b> and that emissions have been kept below the cap.   However, several chapters show that the market is not fully efficient due to reasons such as rent seeking, transactions costs, limited information, regulatory uncertainty, over-allocation and interactions with other climate instruments.   Some of these problems have been addressed by the European Commission in the context of rule changes for Phase 3, whereas others have been mitigated by learning on behalf of market participants.   Overall, we view the EU ETS as a successful implementation of market-based environmental policy.   However, in order to improve the ecological efficiency of the scheme, the future emissions cap should be decreased...|$|R
40|$|The article {{intends to}} be a {{screening}} of family benefits in the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) and {{to contribute to the}} research of shared trends with respect to family approach in these countries. Four types of family benefits including eight distinctive categories are analysed: child-benefit, child care allowances, child-raising allowances, and other benefits (birth and adoption grants, <b>allowance</b> for <b>single</b> parents, special <b>allowances</b> for children with disabilities, advance payments for maintenance and other allowances). The paper is based on primary and secondary analysis of 28 sets of national data provided through the European Union's Mutual Information System on Social Protection (MISSOC). Three categories of member states are considered: founder member states of the EU, other “old” member states, and the new Central and Eastern ones. Chronological development of national regulations with impact on family benefits is analysed in connection with the moment of becoming a member state. Various forms of family benefits legislation and their main subjects of interest are further researched. The last part of the article looks at the coverage of family benefits. Seven member states operate in this respect based on regulations adopted before EU accession. Belgium, Finland, and Lithuania have the “most preserved” family regulations per category of member states. The first three topics of family regulations are: child, family, and allowance / benefit. The most frequently provided family benefits are: birth and adoption grants, and special allowance for children with disabilities. All eight family benefits are provided in France, Finland, Hungary, and Slovenia. Only two types of family benefits are available in Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus...|$|R

This {{study examined the}} efficacy of pre-pregnancy supplementation with iron and multivitamins to reduce the prevalence of anemia during the periconceptional period among rural Tanzanian women and adolescent girls. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in which participants were individually randomized to receive daily oral supplements of folic acid alone, folic acid and iron, or folic acid, iron, and vitamins A, B-complex, C, and E at approximately <b>single</b> recommended dietary <b>allowance</b> (RDA) doses for six months. Rural Rufiji District, Tanzania. Non-pregnant women and adolescent girls aged 15 - 29 years (n = 802). The study arms were comparable in demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, food security, {{nutritional status}}, pregnancy history, and compliance with the regimen (p> 0. 05). In total, 561 participants (70 %) completed the study and {{were included in the}} intention-to-treat analysis. Hemoglobin levels were not different across treatments (median: 11. 1 g/dL, Q 1 -Q 3 : 10. 0 - 12. 4 g/dL, p = 0. 65). However, compared with the folic acid arm (28 %), there was a significant reduction in the risk of hypochromic microcytic anemia in the folic acid and iron arm (17 %, RR: 0. 61, 95 % CI: 0. 42 - 0. 90, p = 0. 01) and the folic acid, iron, and multivitamin arm (19 %, RR: 0. 66, 95 % CI: 0. 45 - 0. 96, p = 0. 03). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for potential selection bias due to loss to follow-up did not materially change these results. The effect of the regimens was not modified by frequency of household meat consumption, baseline underweight status, parity, breastfeeding status, or level of compliance (in all cases, p for interaction> 0. 2). Daily oral supplementation with iron and folic acid among women and adolescents prior to pregnancy reduces risk of anemia. The potential benefits of supplementation on the risk of periconceptional anemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes warrant investigation in larger studies. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01183572...|$|R
