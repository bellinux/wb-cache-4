The students are also encouraged not only to participate in student councils but also to actually form the education they desire together with their teachers, choosing which books to read and how to balance practice with theory depending on which the individual student finds most enjoyable to learn from.|$|E

In Chicago, ACORN has advocated for a certified teacher to be in every classroom. In California, ACORN has documented the need for textbooks and school repairs. ACORN works with teachers unions to gain funding for school construction and more funding for schools.

ACORN opposed the privatization of some NYC schools, favoring its own Charter <b>School</b> <b>plan.</b> The ACORN model for schools emphasizes small classes, parent involvement, qualified teachers and [...] "community-oriented curricula".|$|E
2500|$|Partly {{because of}} that enigmatic phrase, but mostly because of self-declared [...] "massive resistance" [...] in the South to the {{desegregation}} decision, integration did not begin in any significant way until the mid-1960s and then only to a small degree. In fact, much of the integration in the 1960s happened in response not to Brown but to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court intervened a handful {{of times in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s, but its next major desegregation decision was not until Green v. School Board of New Kent County (1968), in which Justice William J. Brennan, writing for a unanimous Court, rejected a [...] "freedom-of-choice" [...] <b>school</b> <b>plan</b> as inadequate. This was a significant decision; freedom-of-choice plans had been very common responses to Brown. Under these plans, parents could choose {{to send their children to}} either a formerly white or a formerly black school. Whites almost never opted to attend black-identified schools, however, and blacks rarely attended white-identified schools.|$|E

60|$|Jonas had {{two good}} reasons {{why he wanted}} to have only one writing-book for all his scholars. One was, that he thought it {{uncertain}} how long their <b>school</b> <b>plan</b> would last, and {{he did not want to}} trouble the farmer to look up some paper, and then make a parade of preparing so many writing-books; and then, perhaps, the whole plan might be abandoned, when they had written four or five pages in each. And, therefore, as he found one old writing-book of Oliver's, half full, he determined to make the blank leaves of that answer for all.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between background variables, such as parental education, socio-economic status, family size, and area of residence on the post-secondary <b>school</b> <b>plans</b> of high <b>school</b> youth when mediated through three school-related variables, study programme, self-concept of academic ability and occupational expectations. The relative effects of these school-related variables on post-secondary <b>school</b> <b>plans</b> were also investigated. [...] The conceptual model on which this study is based was derived from a review of literature which indicated significant relationships between post-secondary <b>school</b> <b>plans</b> and the seven variables used in the study, parental education, socio-economic status, family size, area of residence, study programme, self-concept of academic ability and occupational expectations. [...] The sample consisted of 7008 grade eleven high school students in Newfoundland and Labrador, 1973 - 74. The data was collected by a questionnaire which was sent to all the schools in the province. These questionnaires were mailed back to the university when they were answered. The data was coded by the Newfoundland and Labrador Computer Services at Memorial University. [...] The findings of the study were analysed under four main headings; findings related to study programme, findings related to self-concept of academic ability, occupational expectations, and finally, post-secondary <b>school</b> <b>plans.</b> Analyses were conducted for Males and females. Many of the hypotheses in the study were found to be statistically significant at the. 01 level for both males and females, while others were found to be insignificant. [...] the rank ordering of the effects of the predictors of post-secondary <b>school</b> <b>plans</b> for male students were study program, occupational expectations, self-concept of academic ability and family size. Variables which were shown to have modest effects were area of residence, parental education and socio-economic status.
