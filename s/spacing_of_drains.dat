40|$|Recently, many paddy fields-(flooded rice fields) -have been rotated from paddy to {{dry crop}} farms. In order {{to control the}} {{over-production}} of rice, about 20 percent of all paddy fields in Japan, are changed temporarily to dry farming without major changes of the geophysical nature of the land. For these multi-use farm lands, many additional miles of drains are needed. Although many miles of drains are installed each year, they are still based on the trial and error system of the past. This report investigates the planning and use of tile drains for these rotational farms. The {{results of this study}} are as follows;(1) the designed requirement of drainage is theoretically determined,(2) the criteria of whether or not drains are needed,(3) the calculation of <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>drains,</b> and (4) the integrated drainage systems installed are pointed out...|$|E

The stability of slope with rainfall infiltrating under different drain condition is evaluated by the global safety factor, based on the limited equilibrium methods.

40|$|The paravascular pathway, {{also known}} as the “glymphatic” pathway, is a {{recently}} described system for waste clearance in the brain. According to this model, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enters the paravascular spaces surrounding penetrating arteries of the brain, mixes with interstitial fluid (ISF) and solutes in the parenchyma, and exits along paravascular <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>draining</b> veins. Studies have shown that metabolic waste products and solutes, including proteins involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyloid-beta, may be cleared by this pathway. Consequently, {{a growing body of research}} has begun to explore the association between glymphatic dysfunction and various disease states. However, significant controversy exists in the literature regarding both the direction of waste clearance as well as the anatomical space in which the waste-fluid mixture is contained. Some studies have found no evidence of interstitial solute clearance along the paravascular <b>space</b> <b>of</b> veins. Rather, they demonstrate a perivascular pathway in which waste is cleared from the brain along an anatomically distinct perivascular space in a direction opposite to that of paravascular flow. Although possible explanations have been offered, none have been able to fully reconcile the discrepancies in the literature, and many questions remain. Given the therapeutic potential that a comprehensive understanding of brain waste clearance pathways might offer, further research and clarification is highly warranted...|$|R

40|$|Research {{conducted}} for the last 35 years has shown that subsurface drainage has {{a significant impact on}} hydrology and contaminant transport. This can be observed at the field-scale and also at the watershed scale. Impacts are always associated with modifying otherwise natural flow paths. Most computer model representations of drainage have been drawn at the field-scale. These models require relatively precise data that are usually unavailable when simulating hydrology and water quality in large watersheds. We believe that in this case drainage representation should be simplified and yet closely match observations. As a first step towards incorporating drainage systems into large-scale hydrological models, we propose an equivalent representation <b>of</b> <b>drains</b> buried in a soil profile by using a homogeneous anisotropic porous medium without drains. This representation is based on a “self-consistent” approach and on geometrical considerations. Simplification is such that calculating the equivalent hydraulic conductivity requires only information on the main length and <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> the tile <b>drains</b> and not on their precise location. This approach also provides a much simpler discretisation of the domain because of the absence of internal boundary conditions on the drainage pipes. Compared to other methods that have simplified drainage representation in existing watershed models, it requires no parameter fitting. Two alternatives to the method are presented: in the first one, the soil profile equipped with the actual drain pipes is represented by an equivalent, horizontally layered system with no pipes; in the second, the layered system has been replaced with an equivalent homogeneous profile. The efficiency of these approaches was tested against a classical representation <b>of</b> tile <b>drains</b> using the SWMS 3 D code, which solves the Richards equation for a typical drained plot configuration. The equivalent-medium approach appears to give satisfying results for global water outflow and mean water table elevation...|$|R
40|$|Com o aumento do preço da terra e da demanda por álcool/açúcar tem-se buscado o aumento da produtividade da cultura da cana e o aproveitamento de novas áreas para a produção, as quais podem necessitar de drenagem. Com isso, tornam-se importantes estudos de dimensionamento de sistemas de drenagem agrícola e sua avaliação econômica. O trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar economicamente, com o auxílio do modelo SISDRENA, a melhor combinação entre profundidade e espaçamento de valas, implantados em três tipos de solo, com condutividades hidráulicas de 1, 0, 0, 5 e 0, 1 m d- 1. As profundidades simuladas variaram de 0, 20 a 2, 00 m, com intervalos de 0, 05 m, enquanto os espaçamentos oscilaram de 5 a 100 m, com intervalos de 5 m. Para os três tipos de solo obtiveram-se combinações que revelaram viabilidade econômica para implantação dos sistemas de drenagem. Os resultados indicaram que fatores como o déficit hídrico, a perda de área cultivada pela abertura de valetas e o retorno econômico do empreendimento, são aspectos importantes e devem ser considerados no dimensionamento do sistema de drenagem. With the {{increase}} of the agricultural land prices {{and the demand for}} alchol/sugar, there have been a tendency to increase productivity and use of new areas for crop production in which drainage may be needed.

The simulated depths varied from 0. 20 to 2. 0 m, with intervals of 0. 05 m, while the spacings varied from 5 to 100 m, with intervals of 5 m. Combinations for the three soils types showed economic viability for the implementation of drainage system.

40|$|International audienceTile {{drainage}} systems are sometimes {{not sufficient to}} provide favorable unsaturated conditions in the rootzone. These {{drainage systems}} then need to be supplemented with an additional high conductivity material in the trenches above the tiles or by implementing mole drainage. The HYDRUS (2 D/ 3 D) model {{was used to evaluate}} the impact of such additional measures for heavy clay soil. Three types of drainage systems were simulated: (i) tile drains, (ii) tile drains with gravel trenches, and (iii) tile drains with gravel trenches and mole drains, using either two-dimensional (the former two systems) or three-dimensional (the latter one) transport domains. Three scenarios were considered to test the efficiency of each system: (i) time to drain an initially saturated system, (ii) high intensity rainfall, and (iii) a real case scenario. Different horizontal spacings between tile drains with or without gravel trenches were also compared with the system which included mole drainage. The results showed that the drainage system that included mole drains and gravel trenches was the most efficient. This system provided the largest drainage rate, was the first to reach steady-state in the time to drain scenario, and also efficiently reduced surface runoff. Adding mole drains to a system with tile drains and gravel trenches resulted in a large reduction of surface runoff (75 %). Simulations showed that the <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> tile <b>drains</b> with or without gravel trenches would have to be 40 % or 55 % smaller, respectively, in order to reproduce the same water table levels as those observed for the drainage system with mole drains.

40|$|Drains {{are widely}} used in civil {{engineering}} as control works against slope instability in saturated clayey soils. The action <b>of</b> <b>drains</b> reduces pore pressures in the subsoil and consequently increases effective stresses and soil shear strength. Although drains {{are widely used}} in geotechnical design, their effect on slope stability is not fully understood and modeled.
