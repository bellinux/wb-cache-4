5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{was time for me to}} have my own.|$|E

[...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
500|$|The media showed {{concern over}} the film's title, deeming it [...] "odd", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be {{translated}} into English as [...] "mean". However, the makers said that [...] "kaminey" [...] is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment. According to Bhardwaj, {{the idea for the}} title came from a scene from Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), in which the lead actor (Naseeruddin Shah) refers to the actress in a loving manner; {{it was the first time}} that he heard the word used that way. Bhardwaj told Rediff, [...] "when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was an apt title for the film".|$|E
5000|$|On the L-Tracks website, Faderhead stated: [...] "I {{was never}} just a {{dancefloor}} artist.

500|$|On 16 February 2010, Oasis won {{the award}} for Best Brit Album of the Last 30 Years at the 2010 Brit Awards. Liam Gallagher {{collected}} the award alone before presenting his speech, which thanked Bonehead, McGuigan and Alan White but not his brother, Noel. Liam threw his microphone and the band's award into the crowd. On 15 March 2010, Liam defended his actions at the awards ceremony, saying [...] "I'm sick of it all being about me and Noel, {{the last couple of}} months has pretty much been all about me and him <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was only right to mention the other lads who played on the album and the best fans in the world," [...] and [...] "I thought it was a nice gesture to give this to the fans, obviously it was misinterpreted as per usual." [...] about throwing the award.|$|E
500|$|Guest {{stars have}} {{appeared}} on SpongeBob SquarePants since its first season, {{in addition to the}} main cast, consisting of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Carolyn Lawrence and Mr. Lawrence, and supporting cast of Jill Talley, Mary Jo Catlett, Lori Alan, Dee Bradley Baker, Brian Doyle-Murray, Sirena Irwin, Bob Joles, Mark Fite and Thomas F. Wilson. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg in point of fact eschewed appearances by celebrities on the show, stating in an early interview, [...] "Honestly, I deliberately avoided that. The Simpsons is a tough act to follow, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was best not to do what they do," [...] referring to the copious number of The Simpsons guest stars. He added, [...] "But we've had a few exceptions." [...] According to Tom Kenny, main character SpongeBob's voice actor, [...] "One of the things networks always try to push is getting celebrities." [...] He said, [...] "But Steve [...] had no interest in that and let them know that in no uncertain terms." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth it just for the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, I think they were really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a lot of these action things with people dying and never addressing them. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was very interesting to do so".|$|E

2500|$|Chappell's {{childhood}} hero was Keith Miller. [...] Throughout {{his early}} playing career {{he was a}} batsman, although his excellent fielding at cover also brought him attention. [...] "I figured the cover region was {{the area where the}} ball went more often than not, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a good spot to field," [...] he later said. [...] "It keeps you occupied and always in the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film also {{contains}} visual cues, {{such as the}} 1568 painting The Parable of the Blind by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Allusions to other famous artworks are also made. Meirelles described the intent: [...] "It's about image, the film, and vision, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> makes sense to create, not a history of painting, because it's not, but having different ways of seeing things, from Rembrandt to these very contemporary artists. But it's a very subtle thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation was {{incorporated}} in September 1977. At {{the time of}} Beckman's death, the Foundation had given more than 400 million dollars {{to a variety of}} charities and organizations. [...] In 1990, it was considered one of the top ten foundations in California, based on annual gifts. [...] Donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as Beckman's alma maters. He is quoted as saying, [...] "I accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists,... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be appropriate to make contributions to science, and that's been my number one guideline for charity." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 27, 2010 it was {{announced}} by Hamilton during {{an interview that he}} had checked himself into a Psychiatric hospital stating: [...] "My stay here is like identical to my stay in the industry. As far as being the new guy in here having to deal with politics and people trying to control you. The critics would have to be the doctors and the rounds. So you can say this is like an experiment to see if the industry is really like an asylum or if I was the one bugging. Some say the industry is like high school but its just like a [...] All I wanted to do and still want to do is make music, he explained.

2500|$|Glass's {{music for}} his {{ensemble}} {{culminated in the}} four-hour-long Music in Twelve Parts (1971–1974), which began as a single piece with twelve instrumental parts but developed into a cycle that summed up Glass's musical achievement since 1967, and even transcended it – the last part features a twelve-tone theme, sung by the soprano voice of the ensemble. [...] "I had broken the rules of modernism and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was time to break some of my own rules", according to Glass. Though he finds the term minimalist inaccurate to describe his later work, Glass does accept this term for pieces {{up to and including}} Music in 12 Parts, excepting this last part which [...] "was the end of minimalism" [...] for Glass. As he pointed out: [...] "I had worked for eight or nine years inventing a system, and now I'd written through it and come out the other end." [...] He now prefers to describe himself as a composer of [...] "music with repetitive structures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hatfield was {{profiled}} {{in a number}} of girls' magazines at this time and was embraced by many pre-teen and teenage girls as a role model due to the positive way she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. About this period she says: [...] "I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn’t earned it yet." [...] She gained notoriety in 1992 for saying that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties in Interview magazine. In a 1994 interview for the magazine Vox, she said she was surprised by the effect 'outing' herself had: [...] "I {{think there are a lot}} of people out there who don't care about sex, but who you never hear from, so I thought I should say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beef-cake hunky guys and scantily-clad models, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be really funny to say that I didn't care about sex in a magazine that's full of sex and beauty – but no one really got the joke." ...|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>It's</b> not <b>so</b> hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home.
