50|$|The {{chambers}} and caves of Peak Cavern run directly below Cave Dale and any small streams in the dale quickly {{disappear into the}} ground down limestone fissures and into the caverns beneath. Mineral veins {{can also be seen}} within the limestone of the dale. The cliffs at the northern end of Cave Dale are used by rock climbers and there are several routes in the Very Severe category. There are several small caves or old lead mines within the dales limestone walls, with one being larger than the rest with bars preventing access. Cave Dales steep north-facing grassy slopes are damp and bryophyte-rich and are dominated by oat grass (Trisetum flavescent) and <b>Sheeps</b> <b>Fescue</b> (Festuca ovina). Lesser meadow-rue (Thalictrum minus) grows extensively on ledges in the dale.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> or <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina) is {{a species}} of grass. It is {{sometimes}} also known by the common name hard fescue; however, that name may {{also be used to}} refer to Festuca longifolia.|$|R

40|$|Wildlife: <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> {{provides}} {{very little}} cover for hiding or nesting habitat. Erosion control/reclamation: The primary use of <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> is ground cover. It {{is ideal for}} stabilization of disturbed soils because of its dense root system. Its low growth form and low maintenance requirements make it ideal for ground cover purposes. It is commonly used to protect roadsides, airport landing strips, industrial and residential areas, ditch and canal banks, skid trails, clear cuts, ski hills, camp sites and other recreation areas from erosion. It provides excellent cover and erosion control in areas between trees rows of shelterbelts, windbreaks and tree farms. <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> withstands moderate equipment traffic and requires minimal maintenance. This makes it useful in vineyards, orchards, and farm equipment yards. Its good drought tolerance combined with strong bunch type root systems and adaptations {{to a variety of}} soils make this species ideal for reclamation in areas receiving 12 to 24 inches annual precipitation. This grass can be used in areas where irrigation water is limited to provide ground cover. Weed control: <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> is an excellent weed control species because it has an extensive and dense bunch type root system. Once a good stand is established, it excludes the invasion of most weeds...|$|R
50|$|The larva feeds at {{the roots}} of various grasses {{including}} tussock grasses, orchard grass, ryegrass, reed grasses, and <b>fescues</b> such as <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue.</b> This species overwinters as a larva.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to 1) evaluate the establishment and peak standing crop of Berber Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata var. "Berber"), Palestine Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata var. "Palestine"), and <b>Sheep</b> <b>Fescue</b> (Festuca ovina var. "Covar"); 2) to assess establishment and production changes resulting from environmental gradients (elevation, slope, aspect, soil texture, precipitation, and resident annual community) across the foothill landscape; 3) develop a mathematical model that predicts site potential for restoration; and 4) evaluate the utility of Geographic Information Systems for creation and analysis of spatial data which identify site production potential. Sixteen sites were chosen which reflect the general character of the foothill rangelands in southwestern Oregon. A Randomized Complete Block design was used to select treatment arrangement on each site. Seeded treatments received both chemical (Glyphosate, Hoelon, and 2, 4 -D) and mechanical (residue removal) disturbance. Test species were seeded into three replications at each site. Each replication also included a non-treatment control. Standing crop data for test species and resident exotics were collected after three growing seasons. Berber orchardgrass did not establish at most sites and where establishment did take place production was less than 132 kgDM/ha. Palestine orchardgrass established on on {{a majority of the}} study sites and produced most aboveground phytomass at mid-elevations where coarser soil textures and deeper soil depths were common. <b>Sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> was the most successful of the three test species and did best on low elevation high clay sites. There was significantly (P= 0. 001) more phytomass produced by annual exotics on seeded plots than on undisturbed controls at most sites. Both Palestine orchardgrass and <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> treatments significantly suppressed the annual exotics when compared to the Berber treatments. Generally, "Covar" <b>sheep</b> <b>fescue</b> can establish and successfully compete with exotics on heavier textured soils at low elevations. "Palestine orchardgrass is adapted to mid-elevation coarser soils...|$|R
5000|$|The {{small heath}} (Coenonympha pamphilus) is a {{butterfly}} species {{belonging to the}} family Nymphalidae, subfamily Satyrinae (commonly known as [...] "the browns"). It is widespread in Eurasia and north-western Africa, preferring drier habitats than other Coenonympha. The larval host plants are grasses, notably <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> and rough meadow grass Poa trivialis.|$|R
50|$|Like all fescues, {{the leaves}} are narrow and needle like, making it less {{palatable}} to livestock. The swards that it forms are not as tufted as <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina) or wavy hair grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). The tufted nature is what gives the grass its springy characteristic. The leaves are bright green.|$|R
50|$|At {{the edges}} of the site, {{especially}} in the south, acidic grasslands gradually merge with the heather with a range of grass and lichen species present, dominated by <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> grass. There are some areas of chalk soils as well as an area of self-set Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) along the southern edge of the site.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{this site}} is chalk grassland, {{and it has}} areas of chalk heath, a rare habitat in Britain. There is a has a rich variety of {{flowering}} plants, including a nationally rare species listed in the British Red Data Book of threatened species and five nationally uncommon ones.

There is also a population of the locally rare green-winged orchid.|$|R
50|$|The central plateau {{supports}} a short grassland sward (due to stock grazing) with longer vegetation on the steeper slopes. The grassland includes upright brome, tor-grass, <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue,</b> quaking grass and crested dog's-tail.

50|$|The hillsides at {{this site}} have short, herb-rich grassland, and the flatter areas, taller vegetation. The main species in the plant {{communities}} here are upright brome (Bromus erectus), <b>sheep's</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina), quaking-grass (Briza media), and downland herbs such as burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga), salad-burnet (Sanguisorba minor), common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris) and dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule). Other plant species found include squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica).|$|R
50|$|The main {{species of}} grass is upright brome (Bromus erectus), though {{tor-grass}} (Brachypodium pinnatum) is also common.
