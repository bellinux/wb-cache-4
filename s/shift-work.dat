40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{symptoms}} of psychopathology caused by the <b>shift-work</b> and to evaluate {{their impact on the}} quality of life. Method: Forty-two nurses working at daytime and 45 nurses working at the night shift were evaluated with Symptom Checklist- 90 -R (SCL- 90 -R) and Short Form 36 (SF- 36) for assessing general psychiatric symptoms and quality of life. Results: <b>Shift-work</b> nurses reported significantly higher somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, paranoid ideation and global severity index scores than daytime nurses. Significant differences were not found in the depression, hostility, phobic anxiety and psychoticism scores. <b>Shift-work</b> nurses also reported significantly worse scores on pain and physical function compared with daytime nurses. Conclusion: In our study, <b>shift-work</b> was shown to be a potential risk factor for increased psychiatric morbidity and low quality of life among nurses. Therefore, adjusting the work schedule with the potential problems of the workers may improve their life quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Shift-work,</b> {{particularly}} night-work, {{interferes with}} the physiological circadian rhythm and {{has the potential to}} induce psycho-physiological disturbances. A nurse population was investigated to establish whether <b>shift-work</b> can induce changes in a number of immune variables. Lymphocyte immunophenotype and proliferative response, NK cytotoxicity, cytokines and cortisol were determined in 68 shift-working and 28 daytime nurses at baseline and at 12 months. None of the variables studied differed significantly between shift and daytime workers, either at baseline or at 12 months, except IL- 1 β and TNF-α, which were significantly higher among daytime nurses at baseline, but not at follow-up. No effect of <b>shift-work</b> on immune variable and cortisol levels was seen at 12 months after adjustment for baseline values and job seniority. The specific work schedule as well as job type likely influenced our results, suggesting that rotational <b>shift-work</b> does not necessarily affect the immune system adversely. The immune changes reported by other studies in shift-workers should not be generalized...|$|E
40|$|Working {{around the}} clock is common for many occupations, as diverse as nurses, truck drivers, physicians, steel workers, and pilots. Each <b>shift-work</b> {{profession}} is individual in more aspects than just work hours and individual work scenarios, each posing a different impact {{on the health of}} workers. Related health problems in shift workers, therefore, are also diverse and encompass sleep problems, metabolic and cardiovascular system disturbances, as well as cancer. Little is known about how all these individual factors influence a shift worker's health status, partly because many <b>shift-work</b> studies show inconsistent results. In addition, these individual factors create many methodological difficulties for researchers who investigate such work scenarios. This chapter presents examples from our laboratory and field studies of shift workers, which emphasize the importance of taking individual circumstances into account. Both study approaches, laboratory and field based, are needed to fully account for the difficulties that <b>shift-work</b> studies pose on both workers and researchers. Finally, understanding the mechanisms that underpin interindividual differences in response to shift work will advance our understanding of how to design better and healthier <b>shift-work</b> schedules in the future...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStudies on the {{association}} between <b>shift-work</b> and cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular coronary heart disease (CHD), have given conflicting results. In this prospective population-based study we assessed {{the association}} of <b>shift-work</b> with three endpoints: CHD mortality, disability retirement due to CVD, and incident hypertension. A cohort of 20, 142 adults (the Finnish Twin Cohort) was followed from 1982 to 2003. Type of working time (daytime/nighttime/shift-work) was assessed by questionnaires in 1975 (response rate 89 %) and in 1981 (84 %). Causes of death, information on disability retirement and hypertension medication were obtained from nationwide official registers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to obtain hazard ratios (HR) for each endpoint by type of working time. Adjustments were made for 14 socio-demographic and lifestyle covariates. 76. 9 % were daytime workers and 9. 5 % shift-workers both in 1975 and in 1981. During the follow-up, 857 deaths due to CHD, 721 disability retirements due to CVD, and 2, 642 new cases of medicated hypertension were observed. However, HRs for <b>shift-work</b> were not significant (mortality HR men 1. 09 and women 1. 22; retirement 1. 15 and 0. 96; hypertension 1. 15 and 0. 98, respectively).

40|$|Background: Previous studies {{indicated}} that measurement of sleep only by duration and quality may be biased. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} interactive association of self-reported sleep duration, quality and <b>shift-work</b> schedule with hypertension prevalence in Chinese adult males. Methods: A total of 4519 Chinese adult males (≥ 18 years) were enrolled into the cross-sectional survey. Sleep attributes were measured from {{the responses to the}} standard Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and relevant questions in a structured questionnaire survey. The association of sleep duration, quality and <b>shift-work</b> schedule with hypertension prevalence was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression, considering the interaction between them or not. Results: Taking the potential interaction of the three aspects of sleep into consideration, only short sleep duration combined with poor sleep quality was found to be related to hypertension prevalence in Chinese adult males (odds ratio (OR) : 1. 74, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 31 – 2. 31), which could be modified by occasional and frequent <b>shift-work</b> schedule (OR: 1. 43, 95 % CI: 1. 05 – 1. 95; OR: 1. 97, 95 % CI: 1. 40 – 2. 79). Conclusions: Short sleep duration was not associated with the prevalence of hypertension in Chinese adult males unless poor sleep quality exists, which could be further modified by <b>shift-work</b> schedule. Assessment of sleep by measuring sleep duration only was not sufficient when exploring the association of sleep with hypertension...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} associations between exposure to <b>shift-work</b> and {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) and whether the associations are explained by socio-economic circumstances, occupational factors or health behaviours. Biological risk factors for CVD were measured in 7, 839 participants of the 1958 British birth cohort at age 45  years who were in paid employment. Regular (≥ 1 /week) shift-workers included 46 % working evenings (1800 – 2200), 28 % weekends, 13 % nights (2200 – 0400) and 14 % early mornings (0400 – 0700). Adverse levels of several CVD risk factors were found in association with increasing participation in any <b>shift-work.</b> Men regularly working all four <b>shift-work</b> types had increased CVD risk factors of approximately 0. 1 – 0. 2 standard deviations (e. g. 0. 8  kg/m for body mass index; 1. 2  cm for waist circumference) than those not regularly working shifts; for women, there was a positive linear trend for triglyceride levels, but a negative trend for diastolic blood pressure. Separate analyses of <b>shift-work</b> types showed associations primarily for night/morning working rather than evening/weekend working. Men had adverse levels of all CVD risk factors except blood pressure and total-cholesterol in association with night or early morning work and women had adverse triglyceride levels. Adjustment for socioeconomic, occupational factors and health behaviours explained most associations except for adiposity and C-reactive protein. Our results highlight night and early morning working associations with an adverse profile of CVD risk factors, which are partly explained by socioeconomic, other occupational factors and health behaviours...|$|E
40|$|This {{commentary}} {{intends to}} instigate discussions about epidemiologic estimates and {{their interpretation of}} attributable fractions (AFs) and the burden of disease (BOD) of cancers due to factors at workplaces. By examining recent work that aims to estimate the number of cancers attributable to <b>shift-work</b> in Britain, we suggest that (i) causal, (ii) practical and (iii) methodological areas of concern may deter us from attributable caseload estimations of cancers {{at this point in}} time. Regarding (i), such calculations may have to be avoided as long as we lack established causality between <b>shift-work</b> and the development of internal cancers. Regarding (ii), such calculations may have to be avoided {{as long as we can}} neither abandon <b>shift-work</b> nor identify personnel that may be unaffected by <b>shift-work</b> factors. Regarding (iii), there are at least four methodological pitfalls which are likely to make AF calculations uninterpretable at this stage. The four pitfalls are: (1) The use of Levin's 1953 formula in case of adjusted relative risks; (2) The use of broad definitions of exposure in calculations of AFs; (3) The non-additivity of AFs across different levels of exposure and covariables; (4) The fact that excess mortality counts are misleading due to the fact that a human being dies exactly once - a death may occur earlier or later, but a death cannot occur more than once nor can it be avoided altogether for any given individual. Overall, causal, practical and methodological areas of concern should be diligently considered when performing and interpreting AF or BOD computations which - at least at the present time - may not be defensible...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine prospectively whether {{individual}} nighttime sleep characteristics at baseline (prior to <b>shift‐work</b> exposure) {{are related to}} parameters of daytime sleep after commencing shift work. A longitudinal field study was carried out with novice police officers of the Dutch Police Force. A total of 26 subjects were examined at baseline before they entered shift work and re‐examined during follow‐up sessions after four and twelve months of <b>shift‐work</b> exposure. Wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries were used to study nocturnal sleep at baseline and daytime sleep after night shifts during follow‐up sessions. As outcome variables, estimated total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality were analyzed. Daytime total sleep time showed a 66 min decline {{during the first year}} of <b>shift‐work</b> exposure. Systematic inter‐individual differences were observed for daytime total sleep time and subjective sleep quality (explaining 53 % and 38 % of the variance, respectively), suggesting potential predictability of these sleep parameters. Although no predictors were found for daytime total sleep time, the subjective quality of nighttime sleep before the onset of shift work predicted 40 % of the variance in the subjective quality of daytime sleep after commencing shift work. Follow‐up studies may reveal whether the subjective quality of baseline nighttime sleep also predicts long‐term overall tolerance for shift work...|$|E
40|$|Rotating {{night-shift}} work, {{which can}} disrupt circadian rhythm, may adversely affect long-term health. Experimen-tal {{studies indicate that}} circadian rhythm disruption might specifically accelerate brain aging; thus, we prospectively examined <b>shift-work</b> history at midlife as associated with cognitive function among older women in the Nurses’ Health Study. Women reported their history of rotating night-shift work in 1988 and participated in telephone-based cognitive interviews between 1995 and 2001; interviews included 6 cognitive tests that were subsequently repeated 3 times, at 2 -year intervals. We focused on shift work through midlife (here, ages 58 – 68 years) because cognitive decline is thought to begin during this period. Using multivariable-adjusted linear regression, we evaluated mean differences in both “average cognitive status ” at older age (averaging cognitive scores from all 4 interviews) and rates of cognitive decline over time across categories of <b>shift-work</b> duration at midlife (none, 1 – 9, 10 – 19, or ≥ 20 years).

Additionally, mice experiencing the shift increased their food intake, despite having no change in body mass. Circadian wheel-running activity was also altered in phase advanced mice. These results provide further evidence that chronobiological disruptions can lead to alterations in physiology and behavior, and that exercise can alleviate some of those symptoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the occupations of factory workers on their health needs was analyzed by reviewing their health records. The study was carried out on the male workers at a paper factory managed by the national government. Five types of occupations were defined: management personnel, foremen, shift-workers, day-workers {{with the experience of}} shif-twork, and day-workers without any experience of <b>shift-work.</b> The frequency of receiving medical services and medical expenditures was high among the day-workers with <b>shift-work</b> experience, among whom there existed many workers who quit <b>shift-work</b> because of health problems. Among management personnel and foremen, the frequency of receiving medical services, especially those at medical institutions outside the factory, was low. The ratio of medical service provided by an occupational health doctor to that provided by medical institutions outside the plant was high among the management personnel, because they have difficulty in leaving the plant during working time, while other workers are allowed to go out to receive medical service without any salary reduction. Among management personnel and foremen, the frequency of sick leaves was low, but the length of one sick leave tended to be longer. This result shows that the management personnel and foremen have difficulty in taking sick leaves at the early stage of the disease, so that the length of the leave becomes long when they take a sick leave. These results suggest that the consideration of workers' occupations is important, as well as their age and sex pointed out in the first report, to provide adequate health services to the workers...|$|E
