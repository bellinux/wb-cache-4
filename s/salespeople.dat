5|$|Lee was {{met with}} resistance, because the audio {{industry}} at the time didn't believe cables made an audible difference in the sound and wire {{was something that was}} normally provided for free. Lee did demonstrations at retailers comparing Monster cables to zip cord to convince consumers that expensive equipment was wasted on cheap wiring. Sales picked up as retailers saw the wiring as an opportunity for higher profit margins. This led Lee to provide incentives to retail <b>salespeople</b> to sell the cabling, rather than spend money on advertising. This led to criticisms that his business model creates aggressive <b>salespeople.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tests done by audiophile publications, news {{reporters and}} {{academics}} reached conflicting conclusions on whether more expensive audio or video cables like those from Monster {{make a difference}} in audio or video quality when compared to generic cables. Instead of advertising, Monster offers incentives to retailers and their <b>salespeople</b> to sell the cables. Retailers bundle high profit-margin cables with larger purchases that have smaller margins in order to improve profitability.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) has {{returned}} to his old job as regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch and announces that Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Ryan (B. J. Novak) have joined the sales team, retaining their old clients from the Michael Scott Paper Company. Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the <b>salespeople,</b> minus Pam and Ryan, to think of a way to get their clients back.|$|E

Having avoided jail and only been sentenced to community service, Ryan dyes his hair and starts working for a bowling alley. Michael initiates a romance with Holly until she is transferred to the Nashua, New Hampshire branch and the relationship ends. When Andy is made aware of Dwight and Angela's continued affair, both men leave her. Newly hired Vice President Charles Miner implements a rigid managerial style over the branch that causes Michael to resign in protest. Michael opens the Michael Scott Paper Company, enticing Pam and Ryan to join as <b>salespeople,</b> and though his business model is ultimately unsustainable, Dunder Mifflin's profits are immediately threatened. In a buyout of the Michael Scott Paper Company, the three are rehired with Pam promoted to sales and Ryan returning as a temp. During the chaos, new receptionist Erin is hired to fill the vacancy originally left by Pam. The season's finale ends with a cliffhanger ending hinting that Pam might be pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Wax was {{particularly}} involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MCCR). The MCCR {{was formed in}} 1958 {{by a group of}} Memphis city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black <b>salespeople,</b> Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.|$|E
5|$|During a {{brainstorm}} session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight {{decide to}} set up a sting operation to observe Danny's sales techniques. They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and that he is not going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other <b>salespeople</b> uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{large-scale}} multi-level data set, this study introduces to the sales management literature {{the concept of}} sales representatives’ headquarters stereotypes as a negative outcome of social identification. Results suggest that work team identification fosters headquarters stereotyping more strongly when organizational identification is low than when it is high. <b>Salespeople’s</b> physical distance from their corporate headquarters increases work team identification and decreases organizational identification. Competitive intensity, as an external threat to <b>salespeople’s</b> social identity, strengthens stereotyping and social identification. Besides important theoretical implications, this research also provides crucial insights for managers. Headquarters stereotypes are critically important, as they have harmful consequences for sales performance and customer satisfaction. Key managerial implications are that managers should foster organizational identification and that they cannot remedy {{the negative effects of}} stereotypes by using different compensation systems...|$|R

As {{competition}} between retailers and brands grows, it becomes increasingly important to stimulate the sales team's motivation for higher sales performance and stronger commitment to their own organization. In Luxury Sales Force Management, Michaela Merk examines the strategies that allow managers from luxury organizations to win their sales team's hearts and minds, enabling higher sales performance. Based on new research into luxury sales teams worldwide, Merk explores how <b>salespeople's</b> relationships with brands they sell emerge, how they can be characterized and what top management should do to strengthen these in order to use the sales force–brand relationship as a strategic tool. Merk shows that these relationships have the power to increase <b>salespeople's</b> selling motivation, their commitment to both the organization and its brands, and ultimately the success of the company...|$|R
5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price—US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017—and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership <b>salespeople</b> would try to mislead customers to that effect {{in order to try}} to sell more television sets. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E

40|$|S-shaped {{incentive}} schemes and pay caps are fairly common in practice. This paper demonstrates the optimality of s-shaped {{incentive schemes}} and pay caps by incorporating <b>salespeople’s</b> aversion to pay inequity into the standard agency model. Our analysis shows that <b>salespeople’s</b> desire for pay fairness increases the convexity of the optimal incentive scheme at small sales but increases the concavity at large sales. Consequently, the optimal compensation plan is s-shaped. With aversion to pay inequity, the optimal incentive scheme always contains an upper bound for total payment. For practical implementation, we propose a capped quota plan to approximate the optimal s-shaped scheme. Our numerical analysis {{indicates that the}} capped quota plan has an average non-optimality of less than 2 % in parametric spaces studied. The numerical analysis also explores the sources of non-optimality {{and the relationship between}} market characteristics and the optimal size of pay caps...|$|R

The nearest current equivalent to the original meaning {{can be found in}} the Shimano Megarange cogsets, where most of the sprockets have roughly a 15% relative difference, except for the largest sprocket which has roughly a 30% difference; this provides a much lower gear than normal at the cost of a large gearing jump.|$|E
25|$|Street {{performers}} {{existed in}} Japan {{for a long}} time. However, the connection with advertising forming a chindon'ya first appeared in Osaka during the 19th century (Late Edo period and early Meiji period) {{at the beginning of}} industrialization. The first known chindon'ya is generally considered to be a candy seller in Osaka named Amekatsu, who around 1845 used singing and a noise making toy to attract attention to his own portable candy stall, as many other <b>salespeople,</b> especially candy sellers. Due to his strong voice he was well known in Osaka, and hence tried to sell not candy but rather advertise for other stores and a theater, wearing a large hat and straw sandals, and small bells at his belt, and used a wooden hyogoshi noisemaker. He was succeeded by a former bath attendant Isamikame, who also used to shout tozai (Literally East-West, equivalent to Listen up or welcome (come one come all)). Subsequently, such advertising street performers were called tozaiya in Osaka up to World War II. He soon received competition from another advertiser called Matemoto, and they split their business, with one covering the Uemachi region and the other covering the Shinmachi region of Osaka. After Maemoto died in 1891, his brother, also called Maemoto took over the business, and he was soon joined by his son and daughter, probably the first female chindon'ya. Maemoto is also famous as being the first person in Osaka to die from electric shock in 1893. Other well-known performers from this time are Tanbataya Kurimaru, a former Sweet Chestnut seller, and Satsumaya Imosuke, a former bean seller. These two also occasionally added a second performer to their band.|$|E
40|$|The {{upcoming}} laptop refresh for {{our company}} {{is coming up}} in three months, {{and we have an}} opportunity to cut costs by implementing solid state hard drives (SSDs) in each of our salesperson’s new laptops. SSDs have performance and business advantages to our corporation that are too beneficial for our company to not adopt. By investing in SSDs for our <b>salespeople’s</b> laptops, our Sales and Marketing organization can get better performance and reliability from our <b>salespeople’s</b> machines and can save $ 42, 000 in the next three years by eliminating lost work days due to failed hard drives. SSDs are storage mediums that use flash memory, that have no moving parts, as opposed to HDDs which have disks that spin. Because there are no moving parts in an SSD, this allows for better performance, including faster startup times, faster data reading and writing times, and faster application startup time. SSDs also use less power than HDDs because there is no motor to power to spin a disk, which leads to longer battery life. SSDs are also less likely to fail than traditional HDDs, because they have no moving parts that can be damaged, meaning that they need to be replaced less often, and protects the data on laptops even when they are dropped. The speed, power usage, and reliability advantages of SSDs make them a worthwhile investment...|$|R

We extend prior research that investigates the acquisition–retention trade-off below (i. e., customer value approach) or above (i. e., firm portfolio approach) the salesperson's perspective by also incorporating many ‘within-firm’ factors that are critical to capturing the contingent nature of the allocation decision. The results suggest that firms can double their sales gains by implementing a trade-off strategy that customizes the acquisition allocation at the salesperson level. Using matched triadic data gathered from 227 salespersons, 106 supervisors and the seller's database, the authors find an inverted U-shaped linkage between the proportion of time allocated to acquisition activities and sales performance.

40|$|Understanding how {{technology}} usage influences {{performance in}} the inside sales industry has become an important issue for practitioners. Yet, there is a dearth of literature in this area. Inside sales are sales that are performed remotely using the phone or Internet technologies. Leads (i. e., potential customers) are the life-blood of any inside sales setting, and their effective management is crucial for business success. Lead management systems are information technology (IT) tools designed to automate and support effective lead management. This study developed a conceptual model based on the Technology-Task-Fit (TTF) theory, capturing the impact of lead management systems on inside sales performance through the following mediating mechanisms: task characteristics (call productivity and effort on lead follow-up), selling behaviour (adaptive selling) and salesperson characteristics (salesperson’s competency). To validate this model, we conducted an empirical study with 108 responses collected from sales managers and decision makers. Using PLS-SEM for the analysis, our findings show {{that the use of}} lead management systems affects inside sales performance via improving <b>salespeople’s</b> adaptive selling, effort on lead follow-up and competency.
