5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do <b>so,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 riders that {{signed up}} to {{participate}} in the 1912 Giro d'Italia, 54 of them began the race on 19 May. Since the race's general classification was to be based around team points there were no independent riders as in years past. The organizers allowed the participating teams to have up to four riders, with each team needing three riders to finish each stage to remain in the race. There were a total of fourteen teams that started the 1912 Giro d'Italia. A French team was planning on competing in the race, but opted not to and <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> teams that competed were based in Italy. This edition of the Giro d'Italia saw the first teams enter the race that were not sponsored by a bicycle related industry.|$|E
5|$|Plant spirals {{can be seen}} in phyllotaxis, the {{arrangement}} of leaves on a stem, and in {{the arrangement}} (parastichy) of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like the sunflower or fruit structures like the pineapple and snake fruit, {{as well as in the}} pattern of scales in pine cones, where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together. Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from Fibonacci ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In hazel the ratio is 1/3; in apricot it is 2/5; in pear it is 3/8; in almond it is 5/13. In disc phyllotaxis as in the sunflower and daisy, the florets are arranged in Fermat's spiral with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the golden angle, 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the Summer Campaign the Hungarian army had the same problem as the {{imperial}} main armies had {{at the beginning of the}} Spring Campaign: its commanders had not much knowledge about the enemies distribution and where their main forces were stationing. The Hungarian intelligence failed to accomplish this important task. The support from the southern front (around 12 000 men) did not arrived, despite Görgei's hopes, because with the arrival there of Feldzeugmeister Josip Jelačić's troops, in support to the Serbian rebels and Austrian troops stationed there, the military situation changed there in the favor of the imperials, <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian troops were needed there.|$|E
25|$|In 1771, an {{incident}} {{on the field}} of play {{led to the creation of}} a new Law which remains extant. In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action and <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Hambledon players could do was register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game's lawmakers that the maximum width of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the maximum width.|$|E

After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do what they can to make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} blastocyst, this initial, {{imprinted}} X-inactivation is reversed in {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass (which give rise to the embryo), and in these cells both X chromosomes become active again. Each of these cells then independently and randomly inactivates one copy of the X chromosome. This inactivation event is irreversible during the lifetime of the cell, <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> descendants of a cell which inactivated a particular X chromosome will also inactivate that same chromosome. This phenomenon, which can be observed in the coloration of tortoiseshell cats when females are heterozygous for the X-linked gene, {{should not be confused with}} mosaicism, which is a term that specifically refers to differences in the genotype of various cell populations in the same individual; X-inactivation, which is an epigenetic change that results in a different phenotype, is not a change at the genotypic level. For an individual cell or lineage the inactivation is therefore skewed or 'non-random', and this can give rise to mild symptoms in female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders.|$|E
25|$|The 2013–14 season, {{the league}} was split into a two tier system, Group B1 and Group B2 with 8 teams {{participating}} in each division.

The first two teams of Group B1 were promoted to the Cypriot First Division, while the first two teams of Group B2 were promoted to Group B1. The last four teams of Group B1 were relegated to Group B2, while the last four teams of Group B2 were relegated to the Cypriot Third Division. However, {{after the end of}} the season Cyprus Football Association merged the two groups, creating a unified Second Division. <b>So</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> teams that were relegated from B1 to B2 and the teams that promoted from B2 to B1 participated in the new unified Second Division.
