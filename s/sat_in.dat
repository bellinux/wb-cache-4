40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pro-inflammatory {{molecules}} {{produced by}} adipose tissue have {{been implicated in}} the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in obesity. We investigated the expression profile of 19 pro-inflammatory and seven anti-inflammatory genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (<b>SAT)</b> and <b>in</b> visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in 44 severely obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: SAT and VAT expressed an identical series of pro-inflammatory genes. Among these genes, 12 were significantly more expressed <b>in</b> <b>SAT</b> than <b>in</b> VAT while just one (IL 18) was more expressed in VAT. The remaining genes were equally expressed. Among pro-inflammatory cytokines, both IL 6 and IL 8 were about 20 times more intensively expressed <b>in</b> <b>SAT</b> than <b>in</b> VAT. The expression of nine genes was highly associated <b>in</b> <b>SAT</b> and VAT. Only for three pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL 8, IL 18, SAA 1) <b>in</b> <b>SAT</b> the gene expression in adipose tissue associated with the circulating levels of the corresponding gene products while no such an association was found as for VAT. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of critical pro-inflammatory genes is substantially higher <b>in</b> <b>SAT</b> than <b>in</b> VAT in individuals with morbid obesity. The variability in circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines is, in small part and just for three pro-inflammatory cytokines, explained by underlying gene expression <b>in</b> <b>SAT</b> but not <b>in</b> VAT. These results point to a compartment-specific adipose tissue contribution to inflammation in obesity and indicate that abdominal SAT contributes more than VAT to the pro-inflammatory milieu associated with severe obesit...|$|R

Gish had never worked much with guns before joining The X-Files cast, so the producers got a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms.

Surprisingly, further analyses indicated that vast amounts of multiple-sized transcripts are expressed from the SAT loci, which tended to be poly(A) negative, and nuclear localized. The tendency that the SATs are often not polyadenylated is conserved, even in the randomly chosen <b>SAT</b> genes <b>in</b> the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
