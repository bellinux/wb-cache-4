50|$|<b>Survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> {{normally}} {{carried out}} using parametric models, semi-parametric models, non-parametric models {{to estimate the}} survival rate in clinical research.

50|$|An {{important}} {{concept in}} <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> the hazard rate, {{defined as the}} probability that the event will occur at time t conditional on surviving until time t. Another concept related to the hazard rate is the survival function which can be defined as the probability of surviving to time t.|$|E
50|$|Relative {{survival}} of a disease, in <b>survival</b> <b>analysis,</b> <b>is</b> calculated {{by dividing the}} overall survival after diagnosis by the survival as observed in a similar population not diagnosed with that disease.

5000|$|Post-processing and {{statistical}} analysis of longitudinal data usually requires dedicated statistical tools such as repeated measure ANOVA or the more powerful linear mixed effects models. Additionally, it is advantageous to consider the spatial distribution of the signal. For example, cortical thickness measurements will show a correlation within-subject across time and also within a neighborhood on the cortical surface - a fact {{that can be used}} to increase statistical power. Furthermore, time-to-even (aka <b>survival)</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> frequently employed to analyze longitudinal data and determine significant predictors.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch}} of {{statistics}} for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This topic is called reliability theory or reliability analysis in engineering, duration analysis or duration modelling in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. Survival analysis attempts to answer questions such as: what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival? ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{describing}} the survival {{experience of a}} group of people or patients typically the method of overall survival is used, and it presents estimates of the proportion of people or patients alive at a certain point in time. The problem with measuring overall survival by using the Kaplan-Meier or actuarial survival methods is that the estimates include two causes of death: deaths from the disease of interest and deaths from all other causes, which includes old age, other cancers, trauma and any other possible cause of death. In general, <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> interested in the deaths by a disease rather than all causes. Thus, a [...] "cause-specific survival analysis" [...] is employed to measure disease-specific survival. Thus, there are two ways in performing a cause-specific survival analysis [...] "competing risks survival analysis" [...] and [...] "relative survival." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> a core task {{in applied}} statistics, which models time-to-failure or time-to-event data. In the {{clinical}} domain, for example, mean-ingful events {{are defined as}} the onset of different diseases for a given patient. <b>Survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> limited, however, for analyzing modern electronic health records. Patients often have {{a wide range of}} diseases, and there are complex interactions among the relative risks of different events. To this end, we develop the survival filter model, a time-series model for joint survival analysis that models multiple patients and multiple diseases. We develop a scalable variational inference algo-rithm and apply our method to a large data set of longitudinal patient records. The survival fil-ter gives good predictive performance when com-pared to two baselines and identifies clinically meaningful patterns of disease interaction. ...|$|E
