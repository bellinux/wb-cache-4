5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic <b>seizure</b> on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of <b>seizure</b> or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second <b>seizure.</b> It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of <b>seizure</b> is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a <b>seizure</b> incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a <b>seizure</b> incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked <b>seizure</b> in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of <b>seizure</b> for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase <b>seizure</b> risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a <b>seizure,</b> the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic <b>seizure</b> the diagnostic workup results preferably in the <b>seizure</b> itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Neonatal <b>seizures</b> are <b>seizures</b> {{occurring}} {{less than}} 28 days of life. Though neonatal <b>seizures</b> {{have been studied}} in various institutions, reported incidence varies widely because of inconsistent diagnostic criteria and subtle manifestation of neonatal <b>seizures.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a prospective study. All neonates delivered and developed <b>seizures</b> within 28 days of life were enrolled in this study to study the clinical profile of neonatal <b>seizures</b> like aetiology, various types, time of onset of <b>seizures</b> and biochemical abnormalities. The results are analysed using Epi info software. RESULTS Incidence of neonatal <b>seizures</b> was 11. 7 / 1000 livebirths. Neonatal <b>seizures</b> were more common in preterm, LBW and twin deliveries. Also, higher among those delivered by breech and forceps deliveries. CONCLUSION Subtle <b>seizures</b> were more common in preterm neonates and in 24 - 72 hours of life, while multifocal <b>seizures</b> were more common in term neonates and in < 24 hours of life. Mortality was higher in LBW and preterm babies. There {{was no difference in}} the immediate outcome of neonatal <b>seizures</b> with intrauterine nutritional status...|$|R
2500|$|In the mid 1970s, PTS {{was first}} {{classified}} by Bryan Jennett into {{early and late}} <b>seizures,</b> those occurring within {{the first week of}} injury and those occurring after a week, respectively. Though the seven-day cutoff for early <b>seizures</b> is used widely, it is arbitrary; <b>seizures</b> occurring after the first week but within the first month of injury may share characteristics with early <b>seizures.</b> [...] Some studies use a 30‑day cutoff for early <b>seizures</b> instead. Later it became accepted to further divide <b>seizures</b> into immediate PTS, [...] <b>seizures</b> occurring within 24 hours of injury; early PTS, with <b>seizures</b> between a day and a week after trauma; and late PTS, <b>seizures</b> more than one week after trauma. [...] Some consider late PTS to be synonymous with post-traumatic epilepsy.|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, {{or a lack of}} sleep, among others. The term <b>seizure</b> threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a <b>seizure.</b> <b>Seizure</b> threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} <b>seizure</b> (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a <b>seizure</b> is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal <b>seizure.</b> When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the <b>seizure</b> could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the <b>seizure</b> remains.|$|E
5000|$|Absence <b>seizures</b> are one {{of several}} kinds of <b>seizures.</b> These <b>seizures</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as petit mal <b>seizures</b> (from the French for [...] "little illness", a term dating from the late 18th century). Absence <b>seizures</b> are characterized by a brief loss and return of consciousness, generally not followed by a period of lethargy (without a notable postictal state).|$|R
30|$|Generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) <b>seizures</b> {{were the}} most {{frequent}} type of <b>seizures</b> among children (33 %), while absence <b>seizures</b> were recorded in 4 % only. Similarly, Shawki and colleagues [16] demonstrated that generalized tonic-clonic <b>seizures</b> {{were the most}} frequently encountered type of <b>seizures</b> (49.5 %), while absence (1.0 %) was the least frequent type. Furthermore, Granieri and colleagues [30] reported tonic, clonic, and tonic-clonic <b>seizures</b> in 74.9 % and childhood absence in 6.6 % of epileptics. In partial agreement, Kandil and colleagues [21] identified four subtypes of generalized epilepsy, among which the generalized tonic-clonic <b>seizures</b> were the most frequent (72.1 %), followed by absence (14.9 %). Muhammad and colleagues [31] {{also found that the}} most common type of epileptic <b>seizures</b> was generalized tonic-clonic <b>seizures.</b> This low rate of absence epilepsy could be attributed to the fact that absence <b>seizures</b> could pass unnoticed and may not be easily recognized.|$|R
40|$|Falciparum malaria is an {{important}} cause of acute symptomatic <b>seizures</b> in children admitted to hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, and these <b>seizures</b> are associated with neurological disabilities and epilepsy. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine the proportion of <b>seizures</b> attributable to malaria in endemic areas since a significant proportion of asymptomatic children have malaria parasitaemia. We studied children aged 0 – 13 years who had been admitted with a history of <b>seizures</b> to a rural Kenyan hospital between 2002 and 2008. We examined the changes in the incidence of <b>seizures</b> with the reduction of malaria. Logistic regression was used to model malaria-attributable fractions for <b>seizures</b> (the proportion of <b>seizures</b> caused by malaria) to determine if the observed decrease in acute symptomatic <b>seizures</b> was a measure of <b>seizures</b> that are attributable to malaria. The overall incidence of acute symptomatic <b>seizures</b> over the period was 651 / 100 [*] 000 /year (95 % confidence interval 632 – 670) and it was 400 / 100 [*] 000 /year (95 % confidence interval 385 – 415) for acute complex symptomatic <b>seizures</b> (convulsive status epilepticus, repetitive or focal) and 163 / 100 [*] 000 /year (95 % confidence interval 154 – 173) for febrile <b>seizures.</b> From 2002 to 2008, the incidence of all acute symptomatic <b>seizures</b> decreased by 809 / 100 [*] 000 /year (69. 2 %) with 93. 1 % of this decrease in malaria-associated <b>seizures.</b> The decrease in the incidence of acute complex symptomatic <b>seizures</b> during the period was 111 / 100 [*] 000 /year (57. 2 %) for convulsive status epilepticus, 440 / 100 [*] 000 /year (73. 7 %) for repetitive <b>seizures</b> and 153 / 100 [*] 000 /year (80. 5 %) for focal <b>seizures.</b> The adjusted malaria-attributable fractions for <b>seizures</b> with parasitaemia were 92. 9 % (95 % confidence interval 90. 4 – 95. 1 %) for all acute symptomatic <b>seizures,</b> 92. 9 % (95 % confidence interval 89. 4 – 95. 5 %) for convulsive status epilepticus, 93. 6 % (95 % confidence interval 90. 9 – 95. 9 %) for repetitive <b>seizures</b> and 91. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 85. 6 – 95. 5 %) for focal <b>seizures.</b> The adjusted malaria-attributable fractions for <b>seizures</b> in children above 6 months of age decreased with age. The observed decrease in all acute symptomatic <b>seizures</b> (809 / 100 [*] 000 /year) was similar to the predicted decline (794 / 100 [*] 000 /year) estimated by malaria-attributable fractions at the beginning of the study. In endemic areas, falciparum malaria is the most common cause of <b>seizures</b> and the risk for <b>seizures</b> in malaria decreases with age. The reduction in malaria has decreased the burden of <b>seizures</b> that are attributable to malaria and this could lead to reduced neurological disabilities and epilepsy in the area...|$|R

5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving <b>seizure</b> freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite <b>seizure</b> freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a <b>seizure.</b> Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis).

5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile <b>seizure</b> to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain.
