5|$|According to Schumacher, {{during the}} scene in which the costumes of the Riddler and Two-Face are seen, he {{originally}} planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping from Arkham Asylum while many other villains <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> from their cells.

5|$|Bolton Wanderers {{have not}} won a major trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> {{overcome}} Manchester United in the FA Cup final {{in front of}} a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium. The closest they have come to winning a major trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the League Cup, first in 1995 and again in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Blues {{had been}} the only team to finish the pool stage of the Heineken Cup unbeaten during the 2008–09 season, which <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> given top seeding for the quarter-finals. This meant that they would have a home quarter-final against the second-best runners-up from the pool stage, Toulouse. Cardiff won the quarter-final 9–6.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008–09 season, Stockport {{defied the}} odds by {{challenging}} for a play-off place, but their form dipped {{during the final}} months of the season, which <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> slip to mid-table. Gannon was approached by Brighton & Hove Albion and the approach was accepted by Stockport, but after talks with the chairman of Brighton, Gannon rejected the job and stayed at Stockport.|$|E
5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand.

5|$|Peacetime {{football}} resumed in 1946–47, {{with the}} same fixture list as the abandoned 1939–40 season. York endured a midseason run of 10 defeats from 11 matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the last eight matches <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> finish in 15th place in the Third Division North. They were top of the table by mid September 1947, before a run of two wins from 13 matches <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> drop to 18th place. York finished 1947–48 in 13th place, and the club recorded a net profit of £4,914; a balance surplus of £1,843 was carried forward. In September 1948, York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for £4,075. They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948–49 {{at the peak of}} the post-war attendance boom. The team enjoyed a run of eight successive league wins at home spanning September 1948 to January 1949, but failed to win any of their last seven fixtures to finish 1948–49 in 14th place.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{told you}} so,’ said Wisbottle, {{in a most}} knowing whisper. ‘Lord bless you, he has paid her most {{extraordinary}} attention {{for the last two}} months. I <b>saw</b> <b>’em</b> when I was sitting at the piano to-night.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. There {{were but}} {{five in the}} guard. And a lot of us, who {{suspected}} what they were up to, were standing around. When we <b>saw</b> <b>'em</b> come down, we made a rush and had the guard overpowered But Colfax called out to stand back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{got down}} by their holes. <b>Saw</b> <b>'em</b> come out, you know, {{and tried to}} cut 'em off. They lolloped out--like rabbits. We ran down and let fly. They ran about wild after our first shot and {{suddenly}} came at us. Went for us." ...|$|R
5|$|The club's League title win in 1986 <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> {{qualify for}} the European Cup in 198687, where Celtic {{eliminated}} Shamrock Rovers 30 on aggregate in the first round. The next round saw Celtic take on Soviet champions Dynamo Kyiv, a side comprising {{a large number of}} players in their national side. A hard-fought 11 draw in the first leg at Parkhead did not bode well for the return match in Kiev. Oleh Blokhin's free-kick in the second leg gave the Soviet's an early lead, but Mark McGhee levelled the tie shortly after half-time. Dynamo regained the lead later on in the second half, but Celtic continued to press. A late third goal from Dynamo, however, <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> clinch the tie.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a fourth {{straight}} win in the 4 × 100 metres relay with the Jamaica team (Nesta Carter, Asafa Powell, Nickel Ashmeade, Usain Bolt). The Americans initially had a lead, but a poor baton exchange <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> disqualified and Jamaica defend their title in 37.36 seconds – well clear of the Chinese team who took a surprise silver for the host nation.|$|E
5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'It's {{not only}} the Spottletoes either, Tigg,' said Slyme, looking at that gentleman and {{speaking}} at Mr Pecksniff.

5|$|A title {{challenge}} {{emerged during}} the 2001–02 season, and Newcastle's fourth-place finish <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> qualify for the Champions League. The following season, Robson guided the team to another title challenge and {{finished third in the}} League, and the second group stage of the Champions League. Newcastle finished fifth in the league {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season, and exited the Champions League in the qualifying rounds, but despite this Robson was sacked in August 2004 following a series of disagreements with the club.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{left his}} bass and {{amplifier}} at home in Oadby, after {{less than a year}} of studying in London, he decided he wanted to join a band. By 1970, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor had already formed Queen; Deacon <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in October that year but was not immediately impressed. Later in the year, he briefly formed a band called Deacon that made one live appearance at Chelsea College.|$|E
5|$|Benfica's season {{started with}} four {{consecutive}} victories, {{to lead the}} league. In late September, they experienced their first loss and went on a win-less spree that <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> drop to fifth. In November, Benfica won again, but the results remained erratic and after a 7–0 trashing of Paços de Ferreira, they lost to Varzim. A few days later, in the Portuguese Cup, a home loss against Gondomar cost Ferreira his job. Fernando Chalana replaced him for one match, before the appointment of José Antonio Camacho.|$|E
