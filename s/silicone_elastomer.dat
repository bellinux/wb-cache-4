2500|$|The first {{artificial}} heart valve was the caged-ball, which utilizes a metal cage to house a <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomer</b> ball. When {{blood pressure in}} the chamber of the heart exceeds that of {{the pressure on the}} outside of the chamber the ball is pushed against the cage and allows blood to flow. At the completion of the heart's contraction, the pressure inside the chamber drops and is lower than beyond the valve, so the ball moves back against the base of the valve forming a seal. In 1952, Charles A. Hufnagel implanted caged-ball heart valves in ten patients (six survived the operation), marking the first long-term success in prosthetic heart valves. A similar valve was invented by Miles [...] "Lowell" [...] Edwards and Albert Starr in 1960 (commonly referred to as the Starr-Edwards Silastic Ball Valve). The first human implant was on Sept 21, 1960. It consisted of a silicone ball enclosed in a cage formed by wires originating from the valve housing. Caged ball valves have a high tendency to form blood clots, so the patient must have a high degree of anti-coagulation, usually with a target INR of 2.5-3.5. Edwards Lifesciences discontinued production of the Starr-Edwards valve in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Dielectric {{elastomer}} (DE) pre-stretching {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} attaining better actuation performance, as it helps prevent electromechanical instability (EMI) and usually lowers the Young's modulus, thus leading to easier deformation. The pre-stretched {DE} is not only susceptible to {{a high risk of}} tearing and the formation of mechanical defects, but films with sustained and substantial strain may also experience mechanical degradation. In this study a long-term mechanical reliability study of {DE} is performed. Young's moduli, dielectric breakdown strengths and dielectric permittivities of commercial silica-reinforced <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers,</b> with and without an additional 35 (35 phr) of titanium dioxide (TiO 2), were investigated after being subjected to pre-stretching for various timespans at pre-stretches to strains of 60 and 120, respectively. The study shows that mechanical stability when pre-stretching is difficult to achieve with highly filled elastomers. However, despite the negative outlook for metal oxide-filled <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers,</b> the study paves the way for reliable dielectric elastomers by indicating that simply post-curing <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> before use may increase reliability...|$|R

40|$|<b>Silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> are {{becoming}} more and more prevalent for Food Industry. This is because with the fact that the curing systems of organic elastomers often include amines and other additives leading to potential toxic contaminants, such as nitrosamines. On the other hand there are silicone rubbers/elastomers which are amine free and, in most cases, are platinum cured. Such curing systems allow for biocompatibility. Correctly processed parts do not show detectable nitrosamine levels without and after proper post cure. Other favorable properties of <b>silicone</b> <b>elastomers</b> for food contact are sterilisability, steam, heat and chemical resistance. Unlike most organic <b>elastomers,</b> <b>silicone</b> will not only form such harmless combustion products, it will also produce very little smoke and, hence, permit a good degree of visibility in the event of a fire. Further, silicones are capable of forming a stable ash, which in extreme cases will turn into very hard ceramic.

The guide explains the basic manufacturing process that I hope will bring a greater appreciation for the hard work involved in manufacturing high performance silicone hose. 1...|$|R
