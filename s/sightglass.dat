50|$|The {{rocket pack}} could be swapped in around 20 minutes by {{removing}} six bolts. Fuelling the rocket oxidiser was potentially somewhat hazardous {{and so it}} was carried out away from other aircraft, by groundcrew in protective clothing and with a fire crew standing by in order to flush away any spillage. Acid refuelling was carried out above a steel drip tray, with the acid flow and tank vent return through closed pipework with a <b>sightglass</b> to observe full tanks.|$|E
50|$|The area of {{the radiant}} section just before flue gas enters the shield section and into the {{convection}} section called the bridgezone. A crossover is the tube that connects from the convection section outlet to the radiant section inlet. The crossover piping is normally located outside so that the temperature can be monitored and {{the efficiency of the}} convection section can be calculated. The <b>sightglass</b> at the top allows personnel to see the flame shape and pattern from above and visually inspect if flame impingement is occurring. Flame impingement happens when the flame touches the tubes and causes small isolated spots of very high temperature.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cost-effective sensor design {{based on an}} arrangement of light dependent resistors (LDRs) to determine the particle flow velocity and the particle concentration of granular material flow. The sensor is designed for both dense phase and dilute phase flow and can be applied wherever a transparent <b>sightglass</b> is used in material conveying. The measurement setup and its applicability for industrial conveying processes are discussed and measurement results utilising plastic pellets are presented...|$|E
