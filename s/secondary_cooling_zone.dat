40|$|Abstract. This {{paper has}} studied the {{formation}} mechanism of frame-shaped segregation in 40 Cr wire rod rolled from bloom {{by means of the}} composition measurement, the electron microscopic observation and the energy spectrum analysis method. The results show that the frame-shaped segregation in wire rod originated from the positive segregation in columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition zone of bloom. The main influence factors are the solidification behavior of liquid steel in columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition zone, the temperature gradient of different solidification regions in bloom, the diffusion rate of the solute and inclusions in transition zone and so on. It may reduce the frame-shaped segregation by improving the purity of liquid steel, adopting the electromagnetic stirring in <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>zone</b> and enhancing the cooling intensity of the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} 3 D turbulent CFD {{study has}} been carried out to simulate a Low-Head (LH) vertical Direct Chill (DC) rolling ingot caster for the common magnesium alloy AZ 31. The model used in this study takes into account the coupled laminar/turbulent melt flow and solidification aspects of the process and is based on the control-volume finite-difference approach. Following the aluminum/magnesium DC casting industrial practices, the LH mold is taken as 30  mm with a hot top of 60  mm. The previously verified in-house code has been modified to model the present casting process. Important quantitative results are obtained for four casting speeds, for three inlet melt pouring temperatures (superheats) and for three metal-mold contact heat transfer coefficients for the steady state operational phase of the caster.

40|$|Purpose: Solidification of pure {{metal can}} be {{modelled}} by a two-phase Stefan problem, {{in which the}} distribution of temperature in solid and liquid phases is described by a heat conduction equation with initial and boundary conditions. The inverse Stefan problem {{can be applied to}} solve design problems in continuous casting process. Design/methodology/approach: In numerical calculations the alternating phase truncation method, the Tikhonov regularization and the genetic algorithm were used. The featured examples of calculations show a very good approximation of the exact solution and the stability of the procedure. Findings: The paper presents the determination method of cooling conditions in two-dimensional solidification of pure metals. The solution of the problem consisted of selecting a heat transfer coefficient on boundary, so that the temperature in selected points of the boundary of the domain would assumed the given values. Research limitations/implications: The method requires that it must be possible to describe the sought boundary condition by means of a finite number of parameters. It is not necessary, however, that the sought boundary condition should be linearly dependent on those parameters. Practical implications: The presented method can be applied without any problem to solve design problems of different types, e. g. for the design of continuous casting installations (incl. the selection of the length of <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>zones,</b> the number of jets installed in individual zones, etc.).
