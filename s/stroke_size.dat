40|$|A {{handwriting}} {{pattern is}} {{considered as a}} sequence of ballistic strokes. Replications of a pattern may be generated from a single, higher-level memory representation, acting as a motor program. Therefore, those stroke features which show the most invariant pattern are probably related to {{the parameters of the}} higher-level representation, whereas the more noisy features are probably related to the parameters derived at the lower levels (top-down hierarchy). This hierarchy of invariances can be revealed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the between-parameter correlations, and the between-condition correlations. Similarly, at the higher level a sequence of strokes may act as a unit from which individual strokes are derived (sequence hierarchy). This hierarchy of invariances can be revealed by the between-stroke correlation, which forms a weaker criterion than rescalability, which has been rejected mostly. Previous research showed that vertical <b>stroke</b> <b>size</b> has higher SNRs and higher between-condition correlations than stroke duration or peak force, whereas the latter two features were also negatively correlated. This suggested that vertical <b>stroke</b> <b>size</b> is a higher-level parameter than the other two. The present research largely confirmed this top-down hierarchy and even for upstrokes and downstrokes separately. Downstrokes were more invariant than upstrokes in terms of vertical <b>stroke</b> <b>size.</b> However, contrary to the vertical <b>stroke</b> <b>size,</b> the horizontal <b>stroke</b> <b>size</b> was not invariant. Both vertical and horizontal sizes showed substantial between-stroke correlations. In contrast, the stroke durations did not show any between-stroke correlations. This suggests that stroke segmentation is reliable in spite of the discrete sampling of the handwriting movements...|$|E

An adult human head phantom is modeled with a stroke block in one side while the other half is healthy. Two antennas are placed in front of the two halves of human head. The reflection phases of the stroked head side antenna is collected and compared with those of normal side. From this comparison, the existence of stroked cells can be identified. Moreover, antennas facing the hemorrhagic strokes exhibits higher phase difference than those of ischemic strokes, which can be clearly noted from the best matched second resonance.

40|$|Force {{and length}} steps, {{applied to a}} muscle fiber in the {{isometric}} state, are believed to synchronize attached cross-bridges.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system for}} non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) of virtual environments. In real time, it synthesizes imagery of architectural interiors using stroke-based textures. We address the four main challenges of such a system – interactivity, visual detail, controlled <b>stroke</b> <b>size,</b> and frame-to-frame coherence – through image based rendering (IBR) methods. In a preprocessing stage, we capture photos of a real or synthetic environment, map the photos to a coarse model of the environment, and run a series of NPR filters to generate textures. At runtime, the system re-renders the NPR textures over the geometry of the coarse model, and it adds dark lines that emphasize creases and silhouettes. We provide a method for constructing non-photorealistic textures from photographs that largely avoids seams in the resulting imagery. We also offer a new construction, art-maps, to control <b>stroke</b> <b>size</b> across the images. Finally, we show a working system that provides an immersive experience rendered {{in a variety of}} NPR styles.

40|$|Objective Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is frequently}} detected after ischemic stroke {{for the first}} time, and brain regions involved in autonomic control have been suspected to trigger AF. We examined whether specific brain regions are associated with newly detected AF after ischemic stroke. Methods Patients with acute cerebral infarctions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were included in this lesion mapping study. Lesions were mapped and modeled voxelwise using Bayesian Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Modeling to determine differences in infarct locations between stroke patients with new AF, without AF and with AF already known before the stroke. Results 582 patients were included (median age 68 years; 63. 2 % male). AF was present in 109 / 582 patients [(18. 7 %); new AF: 39 / 109 (35. 8 %), known AF: 70 / 109 (64. 2 %) ]. AF patients had larger infarct volumes than patients without AF (mean: 29. 7 ± 45. 8 ml vs. 15. 2 ± 35. 1 ml; p< 0. 001). Lesions in AF patients accumulated in the right central middle cerebral artery territory. Increasing <b>stroke</b> <b>size</b> predicted progressive cortical but not pontine and thalamic involvement. Patients with new AF had more frequently lesions in the right insula compared to patients without AF when <b>stroke</b> <b>size</b> was not accounted for, but no specific brain region was more frequently involved after adjustment for infarct volume. Controlled for <b>stroke</b> <b>size,</b> left parietal involvement was less likely for patients with new AF than for those without AF or with known AF. Conclusions In the search for brain areas potentially triggering cardiac arrhythmias infarct size should be accounted for. After controlling for infarct size, there is currently no evidence that ischemic stroke lesions of specific brain areas are associated with new AF compared to patients without AF. This challenges the neurogenic hypothesis of AF according to which a relevant proportion of new AF is triggered by ischemic brain lesions of particular locations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although free {{radicals}} {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the expansion of ischemic brain lesions, the effect of free radical scavengers is still under debate. In this study, the temporal profile of ischemic <b>stroke</b> lesion <b>sizes</b> was assessed for more than one year to evaluate the effect of edaravone which might reduce ischemic damage. Methods We sequentially enrolled acute ischemic stroke patients, who admitted between April 2003 and March 2004, into the edaravone(-) group (n = 83) and, who admitted between April 2004 and March 2005, into the edaravone(+) group (n = 93). Because, edaravone has been used as the standard treatment after April 2004 in our hospital. To assess the temporal profile of the <b>stroke</b> lesion <b>size,</b> the ratio of the area [T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance images (T 2 WI) /iffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DWI) ] were calculated. Observations on T 2 WI were continued beyond one year, and observational times were classified into subacute (1 - 2 months after the onset), early chronic (3 - 6 month), late chronic (7 - 12 months) and old (≥ 13 months) stages. Neurological deficits were assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale upon admission and at discharge and by the modified Rankin Scale at 1 year following stroke onset. Results <b>Stroke</b> lesion <b>size</b> was significantly attenuated in the edaravone(+) group compared with the edaravone(-) group in the period of early and late chronic observational stages. However, this reduction in lesion size was significant within a year and only for the small-vessel occlusion stroke patients treated with edaravone. Moreover, patients with small-vessel occlusion strokes that were treated with edaravone showed significant neurological improvement during their hospital stay, although there were no significant differences in outcome one year after the stroke. Conclusion Edaravone treatment reduced the volume of the infarct and improved neurological deficits during the subacute period, especially in the small-vessel occlusion strokes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Speckle noise corrupts {{ultrasonic}} data {{by introducing}} sharp changes in an echocardiographic image intensity profile, while attenuation alters {{the intensity of}} equally significant cardiac structures. These properties introduce inhomogeneity in the spatial domain and suggests that measures based on phase information rather than intensity are more appropriate for denoising and cardiac border detection. The present analysis method relies on the expansion of temporal ultrasonic volume data on complex exponential wavelet-like basis functions called Brushlets. These basis functions decompose a signal into distinct patterns of oriented textures. Projected coefficients are associated with distinct 'brush strokes' of a particular size and orientation. 4 D overcomplete brushlet analysis is applied to temporal echocardiographic values. We show that adding the time dimension in the analysis dramatically improves the quality and robustness of the method without adding complexity {{in the design of}} a segmentation tool. We have investigated mathematical and empirical methods for identifying the most 'efficient' brush <b>stroke</b> <b>sizes</b> and orientations for decomposition and reconstruction on both phantom and clinical data.
