Moreover, the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the medium LMI had a better learning achievement in mathematics than that of those <b>with</b> the <b>low</b> LMI. 4) In each of the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the high, medium, and low LMI, TGT gave better learning achievement in mathematics than TAI and the classical learning models. Furthermore, TAI gave better learning achievement in mathematics than the classical learning models...|$|R

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were {{to find out the}} different effect of each categories of learning model, students interpersonal intelligence and their interaction towards students mathematics learning achievement on the subject of plane geometry. The research was quasi experimental with 3 × 3 factorial design. The population was all students of grade VIII State Junior High School in Madiun City on the second semester of 2013 / 2014 academic years. Sampling was done by stratified cluster random sampling technique. The sample of {{this research}} consisted of the students of SMP N 3 Madiun, SMPN 7 Madiun, and SMPN 10 Madiun. The sample consisted of 260 students. The hypothesis test used unbalanced two ways analysis of variance at the significance level of 0, 05. Based on hypothesis test, it can be concluded that: (1) the cooperative learning model of Jigsaw type gives a better mathematics achievement than cooperative learning model of NHT type and direct learning model, and the cooperative learning model of NHT type gives a better mathematics achievement than direct learning model; (2) <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the high interpersonal intelligence had the same achievement as <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the medium interpersonal intelligence, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the high interpersonal intelligence had better achievement than <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the <b>low</b> interpersonal intelligence and the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the medium interpersonal intelligence had the same achievement as <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the <b>low</b> interpersonal intelligence; (3) on the cooperative learning model of Jigsaw type, NHT type and direct learning model, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the high interpersonal intelligence had the same achievement as <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the medium interpersonal intelligence, <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the high interpersonal intelligence had better achievement than <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the <b>low</b> interpersonal intelligence and the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the medium interpersonal intelligence had the same achievement as <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the <b>low</b> interpersonal intelligence; and (4) on students interpersonal intelligence high, medium and low, the cooperative learning model of Jigsaw type gives a better mathematics achievement than cooperative learning model of NHT type and direct learning model, and the cooperative learning model of NHT type gives a better mathematics achievement than direct learning model...|$|R
