These findings were confirmed by conventional histological analysis of the surrounding tissues. They also demonstrated that the hybrid suture promoted faster healing in terms of collagen infiltration between the yarns and individual filaments. This milder inflammatory reaction and improved biocompatibility represent a real advantage in the healing performance of sutures for cardiac and vascular surgery, and support the need for continued research and development of hybrid structures.

One of the earlier attempts, which is still popular today with muzzle loaders and users of black powder rifles, prevents leading and obtains potentially better velocity and performance with cast projectiles involves application of a paper jacket. Patching is the hand process of applying paper jackets. The projectile is cast to a diameter that is usually that of the bore {{and needs to be}} brought up to groove diameter by a uniform number of paper wrappings. Some prefer a relatively strong paper precisely cut to wrap exactly twice around the bullet with no overlap where the ends meet. Others substitute a range of papers from wax doped rice paper used for rolling cigarettes through greased cooking paper, waxed confectionery paper bags and even <b>silicone</b> <b>impregnated</b> baking paper. The width of the piece of paper is slightly longer than the bearing surface of the projectile; so some paper extends past the base and is folded or twisted under. Some projectile have a base cavity into which the twisted end fits. The paper patch is moistened slightly with water to make it more pliable and slightly sticky. The patch is carefully wrapped around the bearing surface of the bullet. The lip of paper extending past the base of the bullet is then twisted together, and may be pushed into a depression cast into the base of the bullet. The lubricant may be allowed to evaporate after the jacket has been applied; and a different lubricant may be applied after the formed paper has dried. Very good accuracy has been obtained with paper-patched bullets, but the assembly procedure is relatively labor-intensive. There is some question about whether the accuracy improvements result from the paper jackets or from the greater uniformity of shooting procedures by people with the patience to apply the patches. A small number of dedicated target shooters still load paper-patched bullets at velocities up to about 2000 ft/s.|$|R

NASA ARC performed aerothermal environment analyses, TPS sizing and thermal response analyses, and arc jet testing to evaluate the MER SIRCA TIRS Cover design and interface to the aeroshell structure. The primary objective of this arc jet test series was to evaluate specific design details of the SIRCA TIRS Cover interface to the MER aeroshell under simulated atmospheric entry heating conditions. Four test articles were tested in an arc jet environment with various sea] configurations. The test condition was designed to match the predicted peak flight heat load at the gap region between the SIRCA and the backshell TPS material, SLA- 561 S, and resulted in an over-test (with respect to heat flux and heat load) for the apex region of the SIRCA TIRS Cover. The resulting pressure differential was as much as twenty times that predicted for the flight case, depending on the location, {{and there was no}} post-test visual evidence of over-heating or damage to the seal, bracket, or backshell structure. The exposed titanium bolts were in good condition at post-test and showed only a small amount of oxidation at the leading edge locations. Repeatable thermocouple data were obtained and SIRCA thermal response analyses were compared to applicable thermocouple data. For the apex region of the SIRCA TIRS Cover, a one-dimensional thermal response prediction proved overly conservative, as there were strong multi-dimensional conduction effects evident from the thermocouple data. The one-dimensional thermal response prediction compared well with the thermocouple data for the leading edge "lip" region at the bolt location.

40|$|In {{support of}} the CA 250 project, this paper details {{the results of a}} test {{campaign}} that was conducted at the Ames Arcjet Facility, wherein several novel low density thermal protection (TPS) materials were evaluated in an entry like environment. The motivation for these tests was to investigate whether novel conformal ablative TPS materials can perform under high heat flux and shear environment as a viable alternative to rigid ablators like PICA or Avcoat for missions like MSL and beyond. A conformable TPS over a rigid aeroshell has the potential to solve a number of challenges faced by traditional rigid TPS materials (such as tiled Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) system on MSL, and honeycomb-based Avcoat on the Orion Multi Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV)). The compliant (high strain to failure) nature of the conformable ablative materials will allow better integration of the TPS with the underlying aeroshell structure and enable monolithic-like configuration and larger segments to be used in fabrication. A novel SPRITE 1 architecture, developed by the researchers at NASA Ames was used for arcjet testing. This small probe like configuration with 450 spherecone, enabled us to test the materials in a combination of high heat flux, pressure and shear environment. The heat flux near the nose were in the range of 500 - 1000 W/sq cm whereas in the flank section of the test article the magnitudes were about 50 of the nose, 250 - 500 W/sq cm range.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Experiments are {{reported}} which demonstrate that a cobalt deficiency in R. meliloti {{results in a}} decreased cytochrome content of bacterial cells. It is concluded {{that the effect of}} cobalt deficiency on cytochrome content of Rhizobium cells and on the leghemoglobin content of nodules possibly may be explained by an effect of cobalt deficiency on the utilization of propionate. Radiotracer experiments have provided evidence that propionate may be utilized for heme synthesis {{as well as for the}} maintenance of the citric acid cycle in nodules. When soybean nodules are incubated with propionate- 2 -C¹⁴, the intermediates of the citric acid cycle not only become labeled with C¹⁴ but also the heme moiety of leghemoglobin becomes labeled. The incorporation of propionate- 2 -C¹⁴ into heme is linear with time and it appears that propionate is utilized without a lag period. The rate of incorporation of propionate- 2 -C¹⁴ into heme is more rapid than the rate of incorporation of succinate- 2 -C¹⁴ and citrate- 1, 5 -C¹⁴, however, these rates of incorporation may be influenced by different endogenous pool sizes of organic acids. It can be concluded from additional radioactive tracer experiments that the supply of succinyl-CoA from propionate is competitive with the supply of succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle. It was observed that when the concentration of propionate was high in the incubation mixture, the rate of succinate- 2 -C¹⁴ incorporation into heme was inhibited. Furthermore, when a large amount of substrate (succinate or acetate) which can be utilized by the citric acid cycle enzymes is added to the incubation mixture using whole nodules, the rate of incorporation of propionate- 2 -C¹⁴ into heme is reduced. The addition of acetate to the incubation mixture reduced the rate of incorporation of propionate- 2 -C¹⁴ into heme by 33 percent, yet it stimulated the citric acid cycle activity and increased the rate of incorporation of succinate- 2 -C¹⁴ into heme by nearly 50 percent. Since C¹⁴-labeled metabolites were incorporated into the heme moiety of leghemoglobin, a method was developed for the isolation of pure heme from nodules. In brief, the heme was extracted with acid acetone and reextracted with chloroform. After separation and evaporation of the chloroform, the pyridine hemochromogen was isolated by column chromatography from a <b>silicone</b> <b>impregnated</b> cellulose column. The fact that propionate is readily utilized by bacteroids suggested that this compound may be a normal metabolite in nodules. No detectable pool size of propionate was found however, in either soybean nodules or in isolated bacteroids. These results indicated that propionate may be utilized as rapidly as it is formed. An investigation was initiated therefore to determine whether or not lactate could be a precursor of propionate in this symbiotic relationship. Tracer experiments have indicated that lactate- 1 -C¹⁴ and lactate- 2 -C¹⁴ are incorporated into the heme moiety of leghemoglobin at approximately equal rates. The rate of incorporation of lactate-C¹⁴ into heme is significantly decreased by the addition of non-radioactive propionate to the reaction mixture, and isolated propionate from this mixture shows that propionate becomes radioactive. Further experiments using a cell-free extract from nodule bacteroids demonstrated the direct conversion of lactate to propionate. The cofactor requirements for this enzymatic conversion are ATP, Mg⁺⁺, NADH and coenzyme A. The rate of C¹⁴ accumulation in propionate from lactate- 1 -C¹⁴ is inhibited by the addition of nonradioactive a. crylate, suggesting but not proving that acrylate may be an intermediate in the reaction...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to test the biological compatibility of the new device in large animals in orthotopic position. METHODS: Ten Sovering rings were implanted in 10 female adult sheep, 7 mitral (3 open, 4 closed) and 3 tricuspid (all open). The size was 23 - 25 mm in the mitral and 28 - 30 mm in the tricuspid position, and the time in place varied from 63 to 110 days (mean = 89 +/- 14) and from 58 to 63 days (mean = 61 +/- 3), respectively. The morphological analysis consisted of gross, histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigations. RESULTS: The prosthetic ring appeared well implanted in the valve atrioventricular (AV) junction, encapsulated by a thin fibrous sheath without any evidence of thrombus deposition, fibrinous lining or exuberant fibrous tissue overgrowth. No adverse inflammatory reaction was observed, but rare lymphocytes, macrophages and foreign body giant cells. At electron microscopy, the fibrous tissue appeared to permeate deeply within the fabric network; reendothelization on the surface was noted and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Sirius red staining at polarized light revealed a higher content of collagen type III in the mitral than in the tricuspid position. CONCLUSIONS: Sovering annuloplasty rings implanted in the AV valves of adult sheep showed excellent biocompatibility, fibrous encapsulation and reendothelization.

Feline herpesvirus- 1 (FHV- 1), {{a member of}} the alphaherpesvirus family, causes respiratory illness and conjunctivitis, and approximately 80 % of domestic cats are latently infected. Oral administration of famciclovir or topical application of cidofovir has been shown in masked, placebo-controlled prospective trials to reduce clinical signs and viral shedding in experimentally inoculated cats. However, to the authors' knowledge, other drugs have not been similarly assessed or were not safe or effective. Likewise, to our knowledge, no drugs have been assessed in a placebo-controlled manner in cats with recrudescent herpetic disease.

We therefore engineered implantable cylindrical devices made from <b>silicone</b> (MED- 4750) <b>impregnated</b> with penciclovir, for long-term, steady-state delivery of this drug. Results: Our data show that these devices release penciclovir with a burst of drug delivery until the tenth day of release, then at an average rate of 5. 063 ± 1. 704 μg per day through the next 50 days with near zero-order kinetics (in comparison to MED- 4750 -acyclovir devices, which show the same burst kinetics and average 2. 236 ± 0. 625 μg/day thereafter). Furthermore, these devices suppress primary infection of FHV- 1 in a cell culture system. Conclusions: The clinical deployment of these silicone-penciclovir devices may allow long-term treatment of FHV- 1 infection with a single intervention that could last the life of the host cat. © 2014 Semenkow et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Crystal structure, {{morphology}} and crystallization kinetics of melt-crystallized polypropylene and poly(propylene-stat-ethylene) fractions with 2. 7 to 11. 0 mol% of ethylene {{were studied}} by differential scanning calorimeter, wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering, polarized light microscopy, {{transmission electron microscopy}} and infrared spectroscopy. With increasing ethylene content the poly(propylene-stat-ethylene) fractions showed unchanged crystallinity, increased unit cell volume and constant crystal thickness in combination with a shortened helix length. This indicated that a fraction of ethylene defects were incorporated into the crystal structure. During the isothermal crystallization both α- and γ-crystals could be formed. The γ-crystal fraction increased with increasing ethylene content and increasing crystallization temperature. For samples with α- and γ-crystal contents, multimodal melting was observed and a noticeable γ- to α-crystal conversion was observed on slow heating. The spherulitic structure of the copolymers was coarser than that for the homopolymer. The crystalline lamellae in copolymers exhibited profound curvature {{in contrast to the}} straighter cross-hatched α-crystals typical to the homopolymer. Area dependence of electrical breakdown strength was studied for thin polypropylene homopolymer films. The measurements were performed with an automatic measurement system equipped with a scanning electrode arm. Five different electrodes having areas between 0. 045 cm 2 and 9. 3 cm 2 were used and typically 40 - 80 breakdowns per sample and electrode area were collected. All measurements were performed on dry samples in air at room temperature. The data was analyzed statistically and the Weibull function parameters α and β, the first one related to 63 % probability for the sample to break down and the second one to the width of the distribution were fitted to the obtained data. Different features concerning the measurement system and conditions, e. g. criteria for the automatic detection of the breakdowns, effect of electrode edge design, partial discharges, DC ramp speed and humidity were critically analyzed. It was concluded that the obtained α-parameter values were stable and repeatable over several years of time. The β-parameter values, however, varied ± 10 - 30 %, more for the large than the small electrodes, and were also sensitive to the changes both in the sample itself and in the measurement conditions. Breakdown strengths of over 50 capacitor grade polypropylene films were analyzed. The obtained α-parameter values were between 450 and 850 V/μm, depending on the film grade and electrode area. In addition to the high breakdown strengths, reflected by the obtained α-values, another, sparse distribution consisting of low breakdown strengths was revealed when the amount of measurement points was high enough. This means that more than one Weibull distribution could be needed to describe the breakdown strength behavior of a polypropylene film. Breakdown values showed decreasing area dependence with decreasing electrode area. Breakdown strengths for larger sample areas were predicted from the small area data by area- and Weibull extrapolation. The area extrapolation led to predicted α-values 50 % higher than measured at 4 m 2 whereas the Weibull extrapolation showed an accuracy of ± 15 % when predicted and measured values were compared. Breakdown strengths were also extrapolated for film areas similar to those in <b>impregnated</b> power <b>capacitors.</b> It turned out that the power capacitors, tested at the factory, performed much better than predicted by the extrapolation. However, a few weak spots with very low breakdown values were also found. For the poly(ethyelene terephtalate) dielectric, which is not swelled by the impregnation liquid, the large area breakdown strength was predictable. This indicates that for polypropylene film processing and impregnation led, in addition to the improved large area breakdown performance, also to sparse weak spots with low breakdown probabilities. Different Weibull distributions were responsible for the breakdown strengths for the processed and impregnated polypropylene than for the dry film samples. QC 2010102...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{abilities}} of various urease-positive species to encrust and block catheters with crystalline biofllm. Experiments were performed in laboratory models of the catheterised bladder infected with a range of urease- producing species. The results of these experiments allowed the classification of the bacteria into three groups: rapid encrusters, slow encrusters and non-encrusters. Rapid encrusters (Pr. mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri) were able to raise the urinary pH to 8 - 9 and cause catheter blockage within 37 h. Slow encrusters (Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophytics) were able to raise the urinary pH moderately (from 6. 1 to 6. 89 - 7. 39 over 96 h) and cause the formation of some encrustation on the catheters. Non- encrusters { Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter koseri) were not able to raise the mean urinary pH above mean levels of 6. 45 and did not form crystalline biofilm. Pr. mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris and Pv. rettgeri were also capable of rapidly encrusting silver-hydrogel coated latex catheters (Bard I. C. catheter) and nitrofurazone <b>impregnated</b> <b>silicone</b> catheters (Rochester NF catheter). There were no significant differences between the times these organisms took to block these catheters compared to all-silicone control catheters. The antimicrobial catheters also had no effect on the urinary pH generated by these organisms. The insensitivity of the three encrusting species to nitrofurazone (MICs 32 - 128 ug/ml) is clearly a major factor in the failure of these catheters to prevent encrustation. The results of experiments in which the balloons of all-silicone catheters were inflated with solutions of triclosan (3 mg/ml in 0. 1 M sodium carbonate) confirmed previous observations that catheter encrustation by Pr. mirabilis was prevented by this strategy. It also proved effective against Pr. vulgaris. In both cases, in contrast to the controls, the numbers of viable cells recovered from the residual urine fell steeply within 24 h, the pH of the urine dropped below its nucleation pH (pH 6. 5) and the catheters drained freely for the seven day experimental period. The effect of triclosan on encrustation by Pv. rettgeri was minimal however, with no significant difference between blockage times or urinary pHs in the test and control models. While the Proteus sp. had MICs of triclosan of Pv. rettgeri was 64 ug/ml. Inflating catheter balloons with a solution which generated nitric oxide proved ineffective as a means of controlling catheter encrustation. Previous studies have shown that a simple cellulose acetate / bromothymol blue sensor is capable of signalling infection by Pr. mirabilis and the early stages of catheter encrustation. Placed in the drainage bag it can give early warnings to patients, carers and nurses that catheters need to be replaced. While the use of the sensor in this way could avoid the clinical crises induced by catheter blockage, it would be of more value if an effective strategy to inhibit encrustation could be deployed when the problem is signalled. In the present study it was demonstrated that strips of the sensor polymer placed in the drainage bags changed from yellow to blue signalling the rise in urinary pH induced by infection with Pr. mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris or Pv. rettgeri. Electron microscopy confirmed that encrustation had started on the catheters at the times the sensors turned blue. Triclosan (3 mg/ml) introduced into the catheter balloons when the signal was observed was found to halt the development of the Proteus crystalline biofilms. It was concluded that an integrated sensor / modulator strategy was feasible for the control of encrustation by these species. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).

40|$|Background: Artificial {{insemination}} is {{an established}} and viable technique {{to accelerate the}} genetic advancement and economic return of the cattle. However, compromises the efficiency of detection of estrus results in low insemination rates. To avoid these problems in beef herd, synchronization protocols have been developed that allow inseminate large number of animals within a set period of time. These treatments are known as protocols for synchronization of ovulation for fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). There are several slow-release progesterone or progestins devices {{on the market for}} use in synchronization of estrus/ovulation programs in cattle, but these devices have a high cost, which results in less use of these protocols by farmers. This study aimed to determine the follicular dynamic of a low cost protocol to synchronize ovulation, which uses vaginal sponges impregnated with medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA; group 1) and compare it with two trade protocols (groups 2 and 3). Materials, Methods & Results: Nine Braford cows, multiparous non-lactating, cyclic and BCS > 3 (BCS = 1 extremely lean cows and BCS = 5 obese cows) where used in these trial. The animals were divided into three treatments, which all animals went for three treatments in four replicates. (Continue 0 Group 1 (n = 14), animals received on day 0, a vaginal sponge impregnated with 250 mg MPA and an intramuscular (i. m.) application of 2 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB); on day 8, the vaginal sponge was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 2 (n = 7), the animals received on day 0, a silicone vaginal implant with 1 g of progesterone and an application i. m. of 2 mg of EB; on day 8, the implant was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 3 (n = 8), the animals received on day 0, a <b>silicone</b> ear implant <b>impregnated</b> with 3 mg norgestomet and an application i. m. of 3 mg norgestomet and 5 mg of estradiol valerate; on the 9 th day the implant was removed. From day 0, animals were examined daily by trans-rectal ultrasound with an 8 MHz linear transducer to monitor follicular and luteal dynamics. After removal of the implant in group 3 and after application of 1 mg EB in the other groups, the animals were evaluated by ultrasound two times per day until ovulation was detected. In group 1, seven animals lost a vaginal sponge impregnated with MPA and the data were removed from analysis. The emergence of follicular wave for groups 1, 2 and 3 occurred, respectively, 3. 7 ± 1. 1, 3. 7 ± 0. 7 and 4. 9 ± 1. 1 days, with a statistical trend (P < 0. 06) to occur earlier in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3. There was no statistical difference between groups in other variables. The interval between wave emergence and ovulation occurred in 7. 4 ± 0. 9, 7. 3 ± 0. 7 and 7. 6 ± 1. 3 days (P = 0. 82); the interval between implant removal and ovulation occurred in 66 ± 12, 66 ± 0 and 70. 5 ± 12. 7 hours (P = 0. 62); the dominant follicle diameter at implant removal was 10. 9 ± 2. 6, 12. 7 ± 2. 1 and 10. 3 ± 2. 1 mm (P = 0. 13); and the larger diameter of the dominant follicle was 15. 3 ± 2. 9, 16. 6 ± 1. 3 and 15. 9 ± 1. 5 mm (P = 0. 49) for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Discussion: In this experiment, the protocols used in groups 1, 2 and 3 were effective in promoting the emergence of a synchronized new follicular wave and promote synchronized ovulation of a follicle with few days of dominance and an appropriate diameter. It was observed that numerical variations on the emergence of the new follicular wave numerically influenced in the timing ovulations. A study with a larger number of animals per group should be performed to confirm these differences between the groups...|$|R
