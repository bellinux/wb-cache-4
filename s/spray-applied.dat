50|$|Eventually, the {{advantages}} of using polyaspartic esters as {{the main component of}} the co-reactant for reaction with an aliphatic polyisocyanate in low to zero volatile organic compound (VOC) coatings has been realized. The rate of reaction of polyaspartic esters can be manipulated, thus extending the pot-life and controlling the cure rate of aliphatic coatings. This allows formulators to create high solids coatings systems which are user-friendly with longer working times and still maintain a fast-cure. Traditional aliphatic polyurea formulations required high-pressure, high-temperature plural component spray systems to be applied due to fast initial reaction rates. Aliphatic polyaspartics can be formulated with slower reaction rates to accommodate batch-mixing and application by roller-applied methods or <b>spray-applied</b> through conventional single components paint sprayers without the use of solvent.

Presently, we evaluated the effect of selected photointensities, sound, and ambient temperature on preening behavior and ingestion of <b>spray-applied</b> biologics on day-of-hatch chicks. Temperature, sound, and especially photointensity, {{play a major role in}} determination of preening behavior in day-of-hatch chicks. Of these environmental factors, increasing photointensity (0 FC to 1 l 5. 5 FC) at the time of spray-application was most useful for markedly and significantly increasing preening and preening-associated ingestion of <b>spray-applied</b> product. Furthermore, changing photointensity from 20 FC before spray application, to 300 FC briefly for 15 sec during spray application (15 sec) and holding chicks at 100 FC after spray application, increased cumulative preening events by more than 2 -fold as compared to the normal hatchery practice of holding chicks at- 20 FC prior to, and during spray application followed by moving chick trays immediately into stacks (- 0. 3 FC). Similar optimization of lighting intensity also resulted in more than 2 -fold increases in cecal propionate concentrations 48 hrs after spray application, a known predictor of CE establishment and efficacy. Data from experiments with colorants suggested that darker colors markedly and significantly improved preening behavior under conditions of constant photointensity, but had lesser effects under more optimal photointensity regimes. Taken together, these data indicate that photointensity, and possibly other environmental <b>spray-applied</b> biologics. Furthermore, coloring of spray solutions preening activity under conditions of constant lighting. However, optimization of for application to neonatal chicks can improve photointensity near the time of spray application negates the need for addition of coloring and, in fact, increases preening activity to levels not observed due to color addition to the spray solution under conditions of constant lighting. These data indicate that environmental conditions at the time of spray-application are critical for optimal ingestion of <b>spray-applied</b> product by chicks and indicate that brief high intensity light exposure at the time of spray application, or subjecting the chicks to complete darkness prior to spray application, may improve CE ingestion and performance...|$|E

The NH 3, which volatilized after application of any of several sulfur-coated ureas (SCU), prilled urea, <b>spray-applied</b> solubilized urea, and two liquid N products was measured by passing the airstream from microecosystems, in which the treated turfs were growing, through an indicating boric acid solution to trap NH 3.

40|$|Although <b>spray-applied</b> fire-resistive {{materials}} (SFRM) are {{the most}} commonly used passive fire protection for steel structures, its performance is often called into question due to their unsatisfactory durability performance. The inherent brittleness, low strength and poor bond with steel lead to delamination and partial loss of fire protection even under service loads, significantly lowering the structural fire resistance. This could be further exaggerated under multi-hazards, such as post-earthquake and post-impact fires, greatly endangering the fire safety of steel structures. To address this critical issue, a new ductile cementitious SFRM, namely <b>spray-applied</b> fire-resistive engineered cementitious composite (SFR-ECC), has been developed that overcomes the aforementioned problem. Following a parallel design process, SFR-ECC has been developed to satisfy multiple performance targets in one material, including low thermal conductivity, high tensile ductility, high adhesion to steel and sprayability. The resultant material possesses tensile strength, strain capacity, interfacial adhesive energy of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional SFRM, yet possesses similar thermal conductivity and sprayability, providing a durable alternative to conventional SFRM. SFR-ECC is also found to exhibit ductile cellular behavior under compression, further enhancing its energy absorption capacity. The micromechanical and microstructural mechanisms underlying the unique tensile and compressive behavior of SFR-ECC are studied.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a <b>spray-applied</b> waterproofing membrane between the primary and secondary lining layers {{is important to the}} behaviour of a composite sprayed concrete lined (SCL) tunnel in soft ground. In order to confirm the feasibility of the composite shell lining concept, the structural adequacy of the concrete-membrane interfaces under the effects experienced in a typical tunnel needs to be investigated. This paper presents a series of laboratory tests on samples cut from composite sprayed concrete panels, to which uniaxial compression, direct tension and direct shear loadings are applied over both short and long-term timeframes under conditions of ambient atmospheric humidity. Test results show that the interfaces are capable of resisting significant compression, tension and shear in both short- and long-term. Failures under these actions should not occur in a typical shallow SCL tunnel, and a degree of composite action between primary and secondary layers should be expected. Influence of substrate roughness and membrane thickness on the measured interface properties has been quantified. Overall, this investigation confirms the existence of composite action for composite sprayed concrete linings in soft ground, and provides parameters based on test results for further research and design...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spray-applied</b> {{membranes}} for waterproofing of {{sprayed concrete}} tunnels {{have led to}} the possibility of shear transfer between primary and secondary linings through the membrane interface, with potential for reducing overall lining thickness. Laboratory tests have shown a reasonable degree of composite action in beam specimens. In this paper, a numerical model previously calibrated against such tests is applied to a whole tunnel, considering soil-structure interaction and staged lining construction. The model shows composite action and load sharing between the lining layers is expected in the tunnel as in the beams. Parametric studies over the practical range of interface stiffnesses show that composite action is maintained, although at high interface stiffness too much bending may be attracted to the secondary lining, requiring additional reinforcement. An efficient composite shell design with minimal additional reinforcement is achievable if the secondary lining thickness is reduced from current practice. Robustness of the system measured in terms of the interface’s ability to transfer stress under unequal loading, causing distortion on the tunnel, is found to be generally adequate. However, adjacent construction in close proximity may give insufficient margin on membrane tensile debonding, especially if membrane conditions are partially or fully saturated. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Standard {{calculation}} methods {{are used in}} current design practice in the United States to determine the fire resistance rating of structural steel elements protected with <b>spray-applied</b> fire resistive materials (SFRMs). These {{calculation methods}} are based on simplified analysis of heat transfer through the SFRM material to the steel substrate. This analysis assumes one-dimensional heat transfer in Cartesian coordinates, i. e., a flat plate. Based on this analysis, {{the ratio of the}} weight per unit length to the surface area per unit length, expressed in terms of the ‘W/D ratio, ’ is the governing parameter for heating of the steel element. For cylindrical rods, such as those used in steel bar joists, and other small structural shapes, this analysis is inappropriate because the surface area of the insulated element increases with increasing insulation thickness, thus increasing the surface area for heat transfer to the insulated assembly. Simplified and detailed numerical heat transfer analyses have been performed in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates that demonstrate the reduced level of fire resistance associated with a given thickness of insulation on a cylindrical rod relative to a wide-flange element with the same W/D ratio.

40|$|Different {{types of}} phase-change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{have been tested}} as dynamic components in buildings during the last four decades. Most historical {{studies have found that}} PCMs enhance building energy performance. Some PCM-enhanced building materials, like PCM-gypsum boards or PCM-impregnated concretes, have already found limited applications in different countries. Today, continued improvements in building envelope technologies suggest that throughout southern and central US climates, residences may soon be routinely constructed with PCM in order to maximize insulation effectiveness and maintain low heating and cooling loads. This paper presents experimental and numerical results from thermal performance studies. These studies focus on blown fiberglass insulation modified with a novel <b>spray-applied</b> microencapsulated PCM. Experimental results are reported for both laboratory-scale and full-sized building elements tested in the field. In order to confirm theoretical predi ctions, PCMenhanced fiberglass insulation was evaluated in a guarded hot-box facility to demonstrate heat flow reductions when one side of a test wall is subjected to a temperature increase. The laboratory work showed reductions in heat flow of 30 % due to the presence of approximately 20 wt % PCM in the insulation. Field testing of residential attics insulated with blown fiberglass and PCM was completed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

40|$|Two Trichoderma {{isolates}} (T. hamatum LU 592 and T. atroviride LU 132) {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to promote the growth and health of commercially grown Pinus radiata seedlings. The colonisation behaviour of the two isolates was investigated to relate rhizosphere competence and root penetration to subsequent effects on plant performance. Trichoderma hamatum LU 592 was shown to enhance several plant health and growth parameters. The isolate significantly reduced seedling mortality by up to 29 %, and promoted the growth of shoots (e. g. height by up to 16 %) and roots (e. g. dry weight by up to 31 %). The introduction of LU 592 as either seed coat or spray application equally improved seedling health and growth demonstrating the suitability of both application methods for pine nursery situations. However, clear differences in rhizosphere colonisation and root penetration between the two application methods highlighted the need for more research on the impact of inoculum densities. When <b>spray-applied,</b> LU 592 was found to be the predominant Trichoderma strain in the plant root system, including bulk potting mix, rhizosphere and endorhizosphere. In contrast, T. atroviride LU 132 was shown to colonise the root system poorly, and no biological impact on P. radiata seedlings was detected. This is the first report to demonstrate rhizosphere competence as a useful indicator for determining Trichoderma bio-inoculants for P. radiata.

Also, urea and AS treated with dicyandiamide (DCD) were compared to the untreated sources. Fertilization rate was 195 kg N ha– 1 yr– 1 split into four applications except SCU which was applied twice. Turfgrass color and clipping production were monitored along with thatch accumulation and soil pH. In a second field experiment, foliar burn potentials of the new N sources were evaluated by comparison to burn potentials from US, UAN, and a liquid 12 - 1. 8 - 3. 3 fertilizer. Turf response to Formolene (solution N source) paralleled that due to US. Turf treated with US received higher color ratings than did that treated with Nitroform or FLUF (suspension N source) during the early growing season but this trend was reversed by late summer. Turf fertilized with FLUF resembled turf fertilized with Nitroform but was inferior to turf fertilized with SCU. There was no benefit from the inclusion of DCD with either AS or urea. Soil pH after 2 yr ranged from 5. 3 to 6. 4 and was lowest with AS treatment; thatch depth ranged from 7. 0 to 19. 3 mm and was greatest with AS treatment. Formolene and FLUF caused less foliar injury than did US, UAN, or the 12 - 1. 8 - 3. 3 fertilizer.

40|$|Desiccating {{winters in}} the Northern Great Plains {{can lead to}} {{widespread}} turf death. This loss of turf results in poor aesthetics and can be financially burdensome. Financial implications include the cost of re-establishing turf {{and the loss of}} potential revenue from poor playing conditions in the spring which can both be devastating for financial success. The winter of 2013 - 2014 was particularly devastating, leaving many golf course superintendents re-evaluating their desiccation prevention management plans. There are many prevention practices available to turf managers that vary greatly in affordability, effectiveness, and labor. These prevention practices aim to prevent excessive water loss and keep plant tissue hydrated. Specifically, the survival of the turf crown, or growing point of the plant, is critical for rapid recovery in the spring. Desiccation prevention treatments include physical protection products such as protective covers and sand topdressing. Additionally, several <b>spray-applied</b> products have potential to reduce desiccation, including anti-transpirants, horticultural spray oils, turf colorants, and wetting agents. Current recommendations for winter desiccation prevention are based on anecdotal observations, rather than scientific explanation. The first objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the effectiveness of desiccation prevention treatments in terms of crown moisture content and spring recovery. A second objective is to evaluate commonly practiced re-establishment techniques which maximize turf re-establishment following winter desiccation to guide future recommendations. The results from this study indicate that protective covers and sand topdressing can sustain crown moisture content in desiccating environments, and these treatments often lead to more rapid spring recovery. Crown moisture contents observed in March ranged from as high 0. 764 g H 2 O g- 1 fresh weight from an impermeable cover treatment to as low as 0. 251 g H 2 O g- 1 fresh weight from the control treatment. Protective covers and sand topdressing consistently sustained crown moisture and recovered in the spring. Results from the winterkill recovery study showed that many of the practices which accelerate recovery may not be as effective as previously believed. Protective covers and aggressive fertilization did not maximize re-establishment in this study; these results may attributed to low solar radiation accumulation typical to the early spring and pre-existing nutrients sources providing adequate fertility.

In experiment 1, spray-applying the two fermentate products did not affect ammonia volatilization; however the methodology was verified, as reductions were observed in the positive control. In experiment 2, spray application of the rice/soy fermentate did not have any impact on litter characteristics or average broiler body weight. However spray application of the rice/soy fermentate significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) observed mortality at the conclusion of the experiment. In experiment 3, spray application of the two fermentate products on fresh pine shavings following two activation times did reduce ammonia volatilization; although significant (p < 0. 05) differences were observed in carbon and nitrogen content on day 43 and nitrogen content on day 35. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of two fermented rice/soy products on volatilization of fecal odor compound volatilization and performance parameters when included in broiler diets. In experiment 1, the addition of fermentate B at 900 g/ton increased (p < 0. 05) d 21 body weight. The inclusion of both fermentates (A and B) resulted in significant decreases (p < 0. 05) in multiple volatile organic compounds, strongly associated with odor related to poultry. In experiment 2, the addition of fermentate B at 900 g/ton resulted in a significant increase (p < 0. 05) in d 14 body weight.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Plant Pathology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. In recent years, {{several studies}} have {{conclusively}} shown that numerous pathogens, including several species in the Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis, Phaeoacremonium, as well as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Eutypa lata, contribute to premature decline and dieback of grapevines. These pathogens {{have the ability to}} infect grapevines through pruning wounds, which leads {{to a wide range of}} symptoms developing that includes stunted growth, cankers and several types of wood necrosis. Pruning wounds stay susceptible for 2 to 16 weeks after pruning and sustained levels of pruning wound protection is therefore required. The aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the ability of several biological agents to protect pruning wounds, (ii) characterise unknown Trichoderma strains and identify their modes of action and (iii) determine the optimal time of season for biological agent application. Several biological agents were initially evaluated in a laboratory for their antagonism against trunk disease pathogens. The best performing control agents were tested in a field trial conducted on Merlot and Chenin blanc vines in the Stellenbosch region. Spurs were pruned to three buds and the fresh pruning wounds were treated with benomyl as a control treatment, Trichoderma-based commercial products, Vinevax® and Eco 77 ®, Bacillus subtilis, and Trichoderma isolates, USPP-T 1 and -T 2. Seven days after treatment the pruning wounds were spray inoculated with spore suspensions of four Botryosphaeriaceae spp. (Neofusicoccum australe, N. parvum, Diplodia seriata and Lasiodiplodia theobromae), Eutypa lata, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phomopsis viticola. After a period of 8 months the treatments were evaluated by isolations onto potato dextrose agar. Trichodermabased products and isolates in most cases showed equal or better efficacy than benomyl, especially USPP-T 1 and -T 2. Moreover, these isolates demonstrated a very good ability to colonise the wound tissue. The two uncharacterised Trichoderma isolates (USPP-T 1 and USPP-T 2), which were shown to be highly antagonistic toward the grapevine trunk disease pathogens, were identified by means of DNA comparison, and their ability to inhibit the mycelium growth of the trunk disease pathogens by means of volatile and non-volatile metabolite production studied. The two gene areas that were used include the internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and 2) and the 5. 8 S ribosomal RNA gene and the translation elongation factor 1  (EF). The ITS and EF sequences were aligned to published Trichoderma sequences and the percentage similarity determined and the two Trichoderma isolates were identified as Trichoderma atroviride. The volatile production of T. atroviride isolates was determined by placing an inverted Petri dish with Trichoderma on top of a dish with a pathogen isolate and then sealed with parafilm. Trichoderma isolates were grown for 2 days on PDA where after they were inverted over PDA plates containing mycelial plugs. The inhibition ranged from 23. 6 % for L. theobromae to 72. 4 % for P. viticola. Inhibition by non-volatile products was less than for the volatile inhibition. Inhibition ranged from 7. 5 % for N. parvum to 20. 6 % for L. theobromae. In the non-volatile inhibition USPP-T 1 caused significantly more mycelial inhibition than USPP-T 2. The timing of pruning wound treatment and subsequent penetration and colonisation of the wound site was also determined. One-year-old canes of the Shiraz and Chenin blanc cultivars were grown in a hydroponic system, pruned and spray treated with a spore suspension of Trichoderma atroviride (USPP-T 1) as well as a fluorescent pigment. On intervals 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after treatment, the distal nodes were removed and dissected longitudinally. From the one half, isolations were made at various distances from the pruning surface, while the other half was observed under ultra-violet light to determine the depth of fluorescent pigment penetration. Shortly after spray-inoculation of a fresh pruning wound, Trichoderma was isolated only from the wound surface and shallow depths into the wound (2 to 5 mm). One week after inoculation, Trichoderma was isolated at 10 mm depths, and after 2 weeks, at 15 mm depths. Fluorescent pigment particles were observed to a mean depth of 6 mm, which suggests that initial isolation of Trichoderma at these depths was resultant of the physical deposition of conidia deeper into the pruning wound tissue, whereas the isolation of Trichoderma from deeper depths might be attributed to colonisation of grapevine tissue. In a vineyard trial, fluorescent pigment was <b>spray-applied</b> to pruning wounds of Shiraz and Chenin blanc grapevines during July and September at intervals 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after pruning. One week after treatment, the distal nodes were removed and dissected longitudinally. Each half was observed under UV light and the pigment penetration measured. For Chenin blanc and Shiraz, July pruning wounds showed significant deeper penetration of the pigment than pruning wounds treated in September. Moreover, pruning wounds made in September showed pigment particles in longitudinal sections up to 1 day after pruning, whereas wounds made in July showed pigment particles up to 3 days in the xylem vessels. These findings suggest that the best time for application of a biological control agent should be within the first 24 hours after pruning...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Dünyanın en büyük buluşlarından biri olan ateş pek çok yerde hayatımızı kolaylaştırdığı gibi kontrol edilmediğinde sonuçları felaketlere neden olan yangınlara yol açabilmektedir. Zamanla medeniyetin ve teknolojinin gelişmesiyle birlikte artan yangınlar, deprem gibi gerek insan hayatı açısından gerekse maddi açıdan ülkenin gelişimini etkiler duruma gelmiştir. Tarih boyunca meydana gelen yangınlar çok büyük can ve mal kayıplarına sebep olmuştur. Bunun nedeni olarak en başta yangın güvenliği bilincinin yeterince yerleşmemiş olması ve yönetmeliklerin tam anlamıyla uygulanmıyor olması gelmektedir. Yangının oluşumu kesin olarak önlenemese de alınacak önlemler ile vereceği zarar en aza indirilebilir. Yangının vereceği zarardan korunmak amacıyla yapının tasarım, yapım, işletme, kullanım süreci ve bakım süreçleri boyunca yangın güvenliği adına tüm önlemler alınmak zorundadır. Yangın da aynı deprem gibi nerde ve ne zaman olacağı belli olmayan ve sonuçları felaketle sonuçlanan ve genellikle ihmaller zinciriyle oluşan bir olaydır. Fakat ülkemizde yangına deprem kadar önem verilmemekte, tedbirler genellikle üstünkörü alınmaktadır. Başta Soma maden faciası olmak üzere ülkemizde son yıllarda görülen felaketler yangın esnasında yapılması gerekenler hakkında yeterli bilgimiz ve tecrübeli elemanımızın olmayışını ortaya koymaktadır. Yönetmeliklerin yangın için uyarlanması ve daha kapsamlı bir yangın yönetmeliği oluşturulması gerekmektedir. Yapılan bu tez çalışmasında; BYKHY (Binalarının Yangından Korunması Hakkında Yönetmelik) kapsamında öncelikle yanma ve yangın kavramlarından bahsedilmiş temel bilgilerin oluşması sağlanmıştır. Dünyada meydana gelmiş olan büyük metro yangınlarının nedenleri ve sonuçlarına değinilmiştir. Metrolarda meydana gelebilecek olan yangın olaylarına karşı alınması gereken önlemlerden söz edilmiştir. Bu bağlamda İstanbul metrosunda kullanılan yangın senaryoları, nasıl oluşturuldukları, istasyon ve vagonlarda kullanılan malzeme özellikleri ve hangi yönetmeliklerden yararlanıldığı anlatılmıştır. Metrolarda yangın güvenliği bilincinin oluşturulması doğrultusunda hazırlanan tez çalışması, beş ana bölümden oluşmaktadır. Birinci bölümde konuya giriş yapılmış, metrolarda yangın güvenliği konusunda yapılmış olan çalışmalar ve tezler araştırılıp konunun geçmişten bugüne gelişimi ele alınmış ve tezin amacı ortaya konulmuştur. İkinci bölümde yanma ve yangın ile ilgili genel kavramlar detayları ile anlatılmıştır. Ayrıca yangın çeşitleri, söndürme yöntemleri, yangın safhasındaki tehlikeler ve yangının insan vücuduna etkileri bu bölümde ele alınmıştır. Üçüncü bölümde taşıyıcı sistem elemanlarının yangın güvenliği kapsamında betonarme ve çelik taşıyıcı sistemlerde yangın güvenliği anlatılarak yangın yalıtımı yöntemleri ortaya konulmuştur. Dördüncü bölümde metrolar başlığı altında metrolarla ilgili genel bilgi verilmiş ve metroların tarihçesinden bahsedilmiştir. Ayrıca metrolarda yangın güvenliği kapsamında alınması gereken önlemler, havalandırma ve duman tahliye sistemleri hesapları, metrolarda simülasyon programı sonucu yapılmış olan senaryolar ve son olarak da dünyada meydana gelen büyük metro yangınlarından bahsedilmiştir. Beşinci ve son bölümde ise metrolarda yangın güvenliği için yapılması gerekenlerden ve ülkemizde bu konudaki yetersizliklerden bahsedilmiştir. Ayrıca büyük felaketlerin devamı gelmemesi için alınması gereken önlemlere değinilmiş ve bulgular tavsiye niteliğinde ele alınarak konu ile ilgili oluşturulacak olan yasal düzenlemelere kaynak teşkil edilmiştir. Fire {{is the one}} of the {{greatest}} inventions in the world that make our lives easier but if it can not be controlled can lead to terrible disaster. Fire, increasing with the development of civilization and technology, such as earthquakes, cause bad effect of development of the country. Fires through the history has been the cause of the huge loss of life and property. The reason for this is the lack of established primarily for fire safety awareness and comes to have not fully implemented the directive. If the damage is prevented, with measures to be taken as conclusive formation of the fire can be minimized. Building design {{in order to avoid the}} damage from the fire, construction, operation, and maintenance of process on behalf of fire safety during use processes must take all precautions. In this thesis study; BYKHY is provided to occur basic information mentioned in the concept of burning and fire. Large underground fires that have occurred in the world,has cause and results. In this context, the Istanbul subway fire scenarios used in, how they are created, and materials used in the station, wagon and was told that benefited from which regulations. Finally, so far rarely been the subject of a thesis in the metro are given information about the studies that have been made about fire safety. Unwanted fire is a destructive force that causes many thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of property loss each year. People around the world expect that their homes and workplaces will be safe from the ravages of an unwanted fire. Unfortunately, fires can occur in almost any kind of building. The safety of occupants depends on many factors in the design and construction of buildings, including the expectation that certain buildings and parts of buildings will not collapse in a fire or allow the fire spread. Fire deaths and property losses could be eliminated if all fires were prevented, or if all fires were extinguished at the flame. Fire can be reduce the probability of occurance, but it is impossible to prevent all major fires. Given that some fires will always occur, there are many strategies for reducing their impact, and some combination of these will generally be used. Although tunnel fires are not a common case, "Ground the public transportation systems" to be used by the crowded masses, requires special measures in this regard. Turned into a disaster of the many results of the causes of fires occurring in Metro reveals the lack of fire safety precautions need to be taken first. The use of smoking materials, such as flammable and toxic plastic lights, and deficiency of help devices and lack of fire resistant of electrical cables used in railway cars are caused a fire disaster. As in most of the disastrous fire occurred in metro is not the cause of death from fire, carbon monoxide and cyanide gas in the smoke are known to be toxic poisoning. The first thing to be done is get rid of toxic fumes. The lack of smoke evacuation systems in case of a fire in the subway tunnel is the most important reason that converts the results of the subway fire disaster occurred in the past. Besides, lack of the active safety fire extinguisher tubes, sprinklers and other fighting equipment occured terrible results. These results clearly indicate that the lack of precautions cause fire in the world in the past year. Many studies have been done in the world on fire, regulations and arranged a separate regulation was made especially for the subway. Compared with the developed countries, subway tunnel in fire safety we have a long way to cross in our country. There are no regulation in Turkey except building of Fire Protection (BYKHY) and TSE Regulation. Especially metro transport network of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality which will spread to every place within the working target of 776 km of metro network will arise due to the underground fire safety and smoke evacuation system should give more importance. For the moment in the subway and other underground structures NFPA and BS (British Standard) was used to as well. Not only in the subway but also all businesses operating underground fire and smoke evacuation systems security is of the most importance. May 13, 2014 date as a result of the fire that occurred in the coal mine in Soma 301 people dead because of smoke poisoning is the most concrete examples. In this case show that the country has not enough precision about safety. As a result of the statistics conducted by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, there are about 10, 000 residential building fires every year. When the fire occures unclear like earthquake. Therefore, it is necessary to take lots of measures to fire as the measures taken for the earthquake. Fire disaster occurs much more frequently then earthquake. Therefore, the fire regulation must be regulated or produce new fire regulations. Thesis prepared in accordance with the creation of fire safety awareness in metro consists of five main sections. In the first part made introduction to the topic, studies and dissertations that have been made about fire safety in underground researched the subject deal with in the past development has been demonstrated to date and purpose of the thesis. General concepts related to the second part, burning and fire is described in detail. In addition, types of fire extinguishing methods, the effects of fire hazards in the fire phase and the human body are discussed in this section. Therefore, the growth rate of fire, high temperature, respiratory distress caused by toxic gases, collapse, electrical and chemical hazard are the other hazards in the fire place. The third chapter in the context of fire safety in concrete and steel structure structural elements explaining fire safety fire insulation methods are put forward. In this section is mention about the fire resistance of reinforced concrete system including the effects of high-temperature in steel and concrete. In addition, fire resistance of steel structural systems and measures to be taken are also included in this section. These measures are; <b>spray-applied</b> systems, plate systems, prefabricated systems, painting with intumescent paint, fill with concrete and fill with water. So that, the supporting elements can provide resistance to fire. Fourth section is mentioned about general information about the underground subways and a short history of the subway. In addition, measures should be taken in context of the subway fire safety, ventilation and smoke extraction systems, accounts, scenarios that have been made as a result of the simulation program in the subway and finally the world were mentioned in a large underground fire occurred. Fire safety measures in the metro are analyzed in three categories; wagons, tunnels and stations. Finally, we focused on large underground fire that occurred in the world in this section. Paris(Couroness), Londra (King’s Cross), Baku, Eurochannel (Mans Tunnel) and Korean underground fires are the most important fires in the world. This fire of the reasons given in detail and describe the measures taken afterwards in this part. The fifth and final section is mentioned about measures to be taken for fire safety in our country. Therefore in our country must have been a new regulations about this issue. As mentioned in the previous section, fire occurs too often and time is not clear. Compared with the earthquake, the incidence of the measures taken are very rare earthquake is much more than measures to fire. This contrasts situation must be resolve and make modifications in the regulations about fire. Outside America, Canada and other developed european country, there is no measures about fire. Moreover, we need to rise above world standard about fire safety in subway tunnels. We will expect legal arrengements and lots of developments about fire safety in our country. Yüksek LisansM.
