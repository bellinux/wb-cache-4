The state is unique in that no Native American tribe in California is the counterparty to a ratified federal treaty.

5|$|After {{the events}} of November 1, the Terminal and Traction Company hired 300 {{professional}} strikebreakers from the Pinkerton Agency in Chicago to operate the streetcars. Todd wrote {{an open letter to}} the city leadership alleging that illegitimate forces from outside the <b>state</b> <b>were</b> behind the events, and that his workers did not truly desire to unionize. He wrote that if his workers could only get adequate police protection, they could resume normal operations.|$|E

With no one to negotiate with, Tureen devoted his energy to assisting the Solicitors Office in researching the legal and historical basis of the claim.|$|E

5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the <b>State</b> <b>were</b> the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, {{and the right to}} tax local areas.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine <b>state</b> <b>were</b> {{directly related to the}} respective progress of Islam.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, as {{a direct}} result of this campaign, Belgium {{formally}} annexed the territory, creating the Belgian Congo.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} qubit channels for which three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> always sufficient to achieve the Holevo capacity. For these channels {{it is known that}} there are cases where two orthogonal <b>states</b> <b>are</b> sufficient, two non-orthogonal <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required, or three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> necessary. Here a systematic theory is given which provides criteria to distinguish cases where two <b>states</b> <b>are</b> sufficient, and determine whether these two <b>states</b> should <b>be</b> orthogonal or non-orthogonal. In addition, we prove a theorem on the form of the optimal ensemble when three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required, and present efficient methods of calculating the Holevo capacity.

5|$|In late 1818, however, {{demand for}} U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe. Land values {{also began to}} fall, {{touching}} off the Panic of 1819. Many persons in the <b>state</b> <b>were</b> unable to repay their loans. A struggle began between creditors seeking to collect money owed to them and debtors seeking relief from obligations they could not meet.

The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD.
