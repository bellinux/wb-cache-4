5|$|The {{wooden core}} gives the bow its shape and {{dimensional}} stability. It is often made of multiple pieces, joined with animal glue in V-splices, so the wood must accept glue well. Pieced construction allows the <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> that many designs require, {{and the use}} of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and nonbending sections.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} decade after {{nationalisation}} services to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies meant {{a wider variety of}} locomotives operating services on the branch. For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight diesel train on the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> and the branch reverted to steam operations.|$|E
5|$|The land, sited at two <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> in the McCloud River, {{was named}} by {{financial}} adviser Edward Clark {{for the local}} Native American tribe of the Wintun people. Beginning as a humble fishing resort, the land was improved {{by a series of}} people, notably San Francisco attorney Charles Stetson Wheeler, his client Phoebe Apperson Hearst, and her son William Randolph Hearst who disputed with his cousin over ownership. Prominent structures, noted for their architecture, have been built on the land, some lost to fire, while other multimillion-dollar buildings were planned, but not built. Famous visitors to Wyntoon include Clark Gable, Charles Lindbergh, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and his son John F. Kennedy.|$|E

25|$|In the {{southern}} South Island, several particularly twisting sections of SH 1S have been rebuilt to remove <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> and to generally improve road conditions. These include stretches at Normanby, near Timaru; Waianakarua; at Tumai, near Palmerston; {{and on the}} Dunedin Northern Motorway near Waitati. An extensive section between Allanton and the Taieri River was realigned during the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|One {{simple way}} to reduce the heat of {{decanting}} is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E
25|$|Mound Bottom is {{situated}} on a horseshoe {{bend of the}} Harpeth River at the river's confluence with Mound Creek, which approaches the riverbank opposite the site from the east. The Mound Bottom bend is {{one in a series}} of <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> found along the lower Harpeth as the river twists and turns through a steep gorge en route to its confluence with the Cumberland River several miles to the north. The Harpeth surrounds Mound Bottom on the north, south, and east, while the entry to the bend from the west is marked by rocky uplands.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{compensated}} instruments {{tended to}} sound stuffy and blow less freely {{due to the}} air being doubled back through the main valves. In early designs, this led to <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> in the tubing and other obstructions of the air-flow. Some manufacturers therefore preferred adding more ‘straight’ valves instead, which for example could be pitched a little lower than the 2nd and 1st valves and were intended to be used instead of these in the respective valve combinations. While no longer featured in euphoniums for decades, many professional tubas are still built like this, with five valves being common on CC- and BB-tubas and five or six valves on F-tubas.|$|E
25|$|NY30A {{continues}} {{north from}} NY162, {{crossing the line}} into Montgomery County {{and the town of}} Charleston. The route through Charleston is rural, passing through open fields and woodlands for several miles, making several <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> at road junctions. Just north of a junction with Reynolds Road (unsigned CR121), the route winds northward into the town of Glen. Just north of the northern terminus of CR121, the route reaches the hamlet of Glen, which is centered around a junction with NY161. Through Glen, NY30A turns several directions before leaving the hamlet to the northwest. A couple miles to the northwest of Glen, NY30A crosses the town line and enters the village of Fultonville.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took control}} of the mine in 1936 urgent repair work was done on both Smith's Shaft and Murray's Shaft. The 150Fathom Level had flooded and needed to be pumped out, and roof falls on other levels needed {{clearing}}. After buying the mine in 1937 the Lucy Tongue Level was refurbished. Roof falls needed clearing and retimbering, the worst of the <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> were straightened out, and some narrow stone-arched sections were rebuilt. All the rails were replaced, as was the nearly fifty-year-old locomotive, and new side-tipping wagons were introduced. At the same time Murray's Shaft was deepened and a new 175Fathom Level was begun from the bottom. A small battery locomotive was installed for tramming on that level. Horses were still used on the other levels, but in time they too were replaced by battery locomotives.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough {{to be used in}} microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes <b>sharp</b> <b>bends</b> and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal is}} said to be of a brownish-gray color with a smooth skin, its size is {{approximately}} that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It {{is said to}} have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; some say it is a horn. A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at <b>sharp</b> <b>bends.</b> It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet {{is said to be}} entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth. The preferred plant was shown to me, {{it is a kind of}} liana with large white blossoms, with a milky sap and applelike fruits. At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path was fresh and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.|$|E

At the time of opening, the strip lighting in the tunnel was commended as [...] "a big improvement" [...] on the standard provided in the original tunnel. In contrast with the Victorian northbound tunnel, the eastern tunnel had no <b>sharp</b> <b>bends,</b> and emergency telephones were provided. Its distinctive ventilation towers were designed in 1964 by GLC architect Terry Farrell. Immediately after opening, the old tunnel was closed for refurbishment. It re-opened on 4 April 1969 with a new electronic system to detect overheight vehicles.|$|E
