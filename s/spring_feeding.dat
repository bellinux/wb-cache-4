50|$|Built of flint and rubble with a tiled and slated roof, the grotto is {{positioned}} {{so that the}} structure {{appears to be the}} source of a <b>spring</b> <b>feeding</b> the ornamental lake. The ante-chamber is lined with flints, fossils and minerals, and the main chamber has walls lined with shells, fossils, coral and stone. Some of the shells were sent from the Caribbean by the father of William Thomas Beckford of Fonthill. Rather than just a shell room, the grotto was an attempt to create a room that felt underwater, and is considered a remarkable example of antique surrealism. After falling into decay, it was restored by the 12th Earl.|$|E
50|$|The {{adults of}} these long-tongued bees {{grow up to}} 14 - 16 mm long and can be {{encountered}} from early <b>Spring,</b> <b>feeding</b> and collecting pollen and nectar on early flowering plants. The body is densely hairy. The middle legs of males are very elongated with long tufts of black hairs on the tarsi facilitating the collection and transport of pollen. Males and females have a different pattern and color so {{that they seem to}} belong to two distinct species (hence the Latin name «dispar»). In the females the brushes for collecting pollen on their hind legs are red and the abdomen shows white stripes, while it is black in males.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} {{has been built}} by cutting two deep terraces vertically {{from the top of}} the rocky limestone slope, forming three superimposed platforms with vertical rear walls. The monument lacks any built structures. Underneath the lower terrace there has been a now-dry <b>spring</b> <b>feeding</b> a pool which overlooked the monument. The terraces are 13.50 m wide. The lower terrace is 3 m above the ground. The upper terrace, which is 4.25 m higher, is linked to the lower one by two rock-cut staircases on the sides. Three rows of five shallow cavities have been cut in rectangular form into the back wall above the upper terrace. Several shallow, hemispherical holes are also cut along the edge of the upper terrace.|$|E

5000|$|Hackberry leaf gall: this gall {{is caused}} by a small (0.1 inch long) aphid-like insect with sucking {{mouthparts}} called a jumping plant louse. The adults spend the winter under bark crevices and can invade houses in large numbers in the fall. Females lay eggs {{over a long period of}} time beginning when leaves begin to unfold from the buds in the <b>spring.</b> <b>Feeding</b> by the nymphs that hatch from these eggs causes abnormal plant growth that forms a pouch. The psyllids remain inside the galIs until they emerge as adults in late summer to early fall. There is one generation each year. Heavy infestations can result in premature leaf drop which over a series of years may affect tree health.|$|E
50|$|Many social {{caterpillars}} are heliotherms, that is, they elevate their temperature by {{basking in}} the sun. Such basking behavior is markedly enhanced {{by the presence of}} siblings. Caterpillars that feed at times of the year when air temperatures are low are particularly likely to benefit from aggregative basking. The <b>spring</b> <b>feeding</b> larvae of the nymphalid butterfly Euphydryas aurinia, a non-shelter building species, bask “en masse” in the open, packing their bodies tightly together to minimize convective heat loss. Under high levels of solar radiation on cold days, gregariousness and the darkness of their cuticle enables the larvae to gain temperature excesses (Tbody − Tambient) as great as 30 °C. The construction of shelters that trap the heat of the sun enables social species to gain even more control over their body temperature. The extensive shelters of the tent caterpillars (Malacosoma) provide a surface large enough to enable the colony to bask “en masse” and the caterpillars oriented their nests {{to take full advantage of}} the sun.|$|E
40|$|For iteroparous {{organisms in}} which {{fecundity}} is {{positively related to}} body size, a trade-off exists between allocation of energy to gonads, thus ensuring some reproductive output, and allocation to somatic growth, thus increasing potential fecundity in the future. This tradeoff can influence several life-history patterns, including when, for organisms that grow after maturity, allocation to gonads begins following the previous reproductive event. White crappie Pomoxis annularis, a spring-spawning freshwater fish, began allocating energy to ovaries in autumn {{at the expense of}} continued somatic growth and higher potential fecundity. Within five populations, the amount of early allocation varied between years. We combined dynamic programming with an individual-based model to determine how summer and <b>spring</b> <b>feeding</b> conditions interact to influence when allocation to reproduction should begin. Model results indicated that autumn allocation to ovaries was in response to future <b>spring</b> <b>feeding</b> conditions rather than recent summer feeding conditions. At least a 10 % probability of poor <b>spring</b> <b>feeding</b> conditions resulted in ovary investment patterns that matched field observations. The model was unable to explain the inter-annual variation in autumn energy observed in the field. Early allocation of energy to ovaries is probably an evolutionary adaptation to the possibility of poor <b>spring</b> <b>feeding</b> conditions...|$|E
