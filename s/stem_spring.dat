50|$|The East Branch of the Mamaroneck River is 3.3 {{miles long}}. The main stem is 1.9 miles long north of its {{junction}} with the east branch. The east branch originates {{from a small}} pond in north Harrison at about 400 {{feet above sea level}} and then flows southeast 0.7 miles into Forest Lake. South of Forest Lake, it flows westerly to its confluence with the main <b>stem.</b> <b>Spring</b> Lake, also known as Croker Pond, is approximately 900 feet above the confluence of the east branch and main stem.|$|E

Presently she dropped on her knees, and opening the grass with her hands, displayed a small, slender bud, on a round, smooth <b>stem,</b> <b>springing</b> without leaves from the soil. [...] "Do you see!" [...] she said, {{looking up at me}} with a bright smile.|$|R
5000|$|It {{can have}} between 3-8 flowers per <b>stem,</b> in <b>spring,</b> (March—April) [...] or summer (in Europe). The lilac-purple {{perianth}} tube is between 3-8 cm in length.|$|R

50|$|Mallee is {{the growth}} habit of certain {{eucalypt}} species that grow with multiple <b>stems</b> <b>springing</b> from an underground lignotuber, usually to {{a height of}} no more than 10 m. It is most common in plants of the genus Eucalyptus, many of which naturally grow in a mallee habit, and some of which grow as single-stemmed trees initially but recover in mallee form if burnt to the ground by bushfire. It also occurs in the closely related genera Corymbia and Angophora. The word mallee may also be used as a noun in reference to species or individual plants with a mallee habit.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{within the}} stem of Polygonum thunbergii. Pupation takes place within the <b>stem</b> in late <b>spring.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{an ideal}} {{ornamental}} plant for areas that are fairly humus rich and do not dry out, for instance alongside ponds, waterfalls and on shaded areas of rock gardens. Propagation is by simple division of the much rooting <b>stems</b> in <b>spring</b> or by seed.|$|R
50|$|Ramonda is a genus {{of three}} species of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Gesneriaceae, native to shady, rocky places in north eastern Spain, the Pyrenees and south eastern Europe. They are evergreen perennials which form rosettes of crinkly leaves with nearly actinomorphic flowers, borne on leafless <b>stems</b> in <b>spring.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 'ava {{beverage}} is {{made from}} the dried roots of the plant Piper methysticum and mixed with water before it is strained for drinking. The plants grow to a maximum height of about seven feet, the majority of specimens being much less. It usually has several <b>stems</b> <b>springing</b> direct from the roots. The stems and roots of the plant are of a loose character, and the roots from which the drink is made are carefully cleaned and scraped. When fully grown, the roots vary considerably in size, and, with {{a section of the}} stem of the plant attached, resemble roughly, a club. The root of the plant is called a'a 'ava, the first word meaning root. The 'ava roots are cleaned and dried in the sun before usage.|$|R
50|$|It has {{one or two}} {{terminal}} (at {{the top of the}} <b>stem)</b> flower, in <b>spring</b> {{to early}} summer, between April, and May.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Triglochin maritima and Triglochin palustris. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant in autumn. The mine has {{the form of a}} broad, transparent, full depth gallery. They overwinter in the rhizome, and bore in the rhizome or <b>stem</b> in <b>spring.</b> Pupation takes place outside of the mine.|$|R
50|$|The stem holds between 1 and 2, {{terminal}} (top of <b>stem)</b> flowers, in <b>spring,</b> blooming between late March to mid-April, {{or between}} March to May.|$|R
50|$|The plant sends up {{evergreen}} basal {{leaves in}} the fall, flower <b>stems</b> in the <b>spring,</b> and goes dormant in late {{spring and early summer}} after the seed ripens.|$|R

50|$|Early {{development}} around Manchaca probably <b>stemmed</b> {{from the}} <b>springs</b> in the area. Manchaca Springs are a stopping place along {{a portion of}} the Old San Antonio Road and later the Chisholm Trail.|$|R
5000|$|The stems have 1 - 2 {{leaves on}} the stem, and between 1 and 2 {{terminal}} (at {{the top of the}} <b>stem)</b> flowers, in <b>spring</b> and summer, between May [...] and June.|$|R
50|$|Gillenia trifoliata (common names Bowman's {{root and}} Indian physic) is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the Rosaceae family, native to eastern North America from Ontario to Georgia. It is an erect herbaceous perennial growing to 100 cm tall by 60 cm wide, with 3-palmate leaves and pale pink flowers with narrow petals and reddish calyces above red coloured <b>stems</b> in <b>spring</b> and summer.|$|R
50|$|Myoporum floribundum, {{commonly}} known as weeping myoporum or slender myoporum, is a sour-smelling glabrous shrub in the family Scrophulariaceae endemic to a small area of New South Wales and Victoria in Australia. It has long, thin, drooping leaves and profuse white flowers in clusters along the <b>stems</b> in <b>spring.</b> Although it is uncommon in nature, {{it has long been}} available as a popular garden plant.|$|R
50|$|Ramonda myconi (Pyrenean-violet or rosette mullein), syn. R. pyrenaica, is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Gesneriaceae, which is a relictual endemite of shady, rocky places in the Pyrenees and north eastern Spain. It is a rosette-forming evergreen perennial growing to 10 cm high by 20 cm broad, with oval, crinkled leaves. Five-petalled purple flowers with prominent yellow anthers appear on leafless <b>stems</b> in <b>spring.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{has a very}} short, slender {{flowering}} stem, only 7 - 10 cm long.It has one terminal (at {{the top of the}} <b>stem)</b> flower, in <b>spring</b> {{to early}} summer, in April or May.|$|R
40|$|Creeping {{buttercup}} {{is a short}} perennial plant (about 6 - {{12 inches}} tall) with bright yellow flowers that shoot up to 24 inches high. The long stems grow along the ground and take root at the leaf nodes. The three-part leaves are dark green, often with pale spots, and have deeply toothed margins. Both the leaves and stems are hairy. The flowers, usually with 5 petals, are born on long erect <b>stems</b> <b>spring</b> through summer. Though creeping buttercup {{is capable of surviving}} in many soil types and exposures, it is notably problematic in wet, acidic soils with poor drainage. Impacts: Creeping buttercup spreads easily from seed and by their long stems which root and form new plants at every leaf joint. It commonly invades areas where the vegetation has been removed and wet pastures, where it displaces more desirable forage. The sap of creeping buttercup contains a toxic compound that can taint milk or cause cattle to become ill. Most often, livestock will try to avoid eating buttercup because the sap is ver...|$|R
50|$|Plumeria {{species may}} be {{propagated}} easily by cutting leafless <b>stem</b> tips in <b>spring.</b> Cuttings {{are allowed to}} dry at the base before planting in well-drained soil. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to rot in moist soil.|$|R
50|$|The stems have 2-5, green spathes, (leaves of {{the flower}} bud), that are 6-12 cm long, with {{membranous}} margins.The stems or peduncle hold 2-5, terminal (top of <b>stem)</b> flowers, between <b>spring</b> and summer, in April-May.|$|R
30|$|The <b>spring</b> <b>stem</b> bending {{treatment}} was applied in late September 2007, after {{the commencement of}} new shoot growth. Soil conditions at the Balmoral forest site were dry {{at the time of}} the <b>spring</b> <b>stem</b> bending treatment (Table  2), with little rainfall having occurred during the preceding winter and early spring. The ten trees were bent using a winch to 30 % of the predicted failure load of the trees (Table  1), to simulate strong winds, while staying within the elastic limits of the stem. This was done to prevent structural damage to the stem and roots that might affect the tree diameter growth during the subsequent growth season.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} {{with the first}} GSX engines was the move from direct overhead cam actuation of the valve by shim and bucket of the GS engines, to valve actuation via short forked rocker arms in the GSX -the valves <b>stems</b> and <b>springs</b> being located inboard from the camshafts due to the reduced included angle between inlet and exhaust valves. Apart from the heads the GS/GSX engines were of a common design.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on plants}} in the {{subgenus}} Esula of the genus Euphorbia. The larvae mine the stem and move into the pith area. They overwinter in the roots and migrate to the <b>stem</b> base in <b>spring</b> where pupation occurs.|$|R
6000|$|Presently we {{fell into}} and ascended the great Wady 'Afár, which {{begins in the}} Hismá, or Red Region, east of the double coast-range. After {{receiving}} a network of Secondary valleys that enable it to flow a torrent, as in France, every ten to twelve years, it falls into the Mínat el-'Ayánát, a little port for native craft, which will presently be visited. We left this Wady at a bend, some two hundred metres wide, called the [...] "Broad of the Jujube," [...] {{from one of the}} splendid secular trees that characterize North Midian. Near the camping-ground we shall find another veteran Zizyphus, whose three huge <b>stems,</b> <b>springing</b> from a single base, argue a green old age. Here both banks of the Fiumara are lined with courses of rough stone, mostly rounded and rolled boulders, evidently the ruins of the water-conduits which served to feed the rich growth of the lower 'Afa'l. The vegetation of the gorge-mouth developed itself to dates and Daums, tamarisks and salsolaceæ, out of which scuttled a troop of startled gazelles. We turned the right-hand jamb of the [...] "Gate," [...] and found ourselves at the water and camping-ground of Magháir Shu'ayb.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{in earlier}} forms {{there is no}} attempt at realism; no {{particular}} species of plant is being imitated, and the forms are often botanically impossible or implausible. [...] "Leaf" [...] forms typically spring sideways from the stem, in what is often called a [...] "half-palmette" [...] form, named after its distant and very different looking ancestor in Ancient Egyptian and Greek ornament. New <b>stems</b> <b>spring</b> from leaf-tips, a type often called honeysuckle, and the stems often have no tips, winding endlessly out of the space. The early Mshatta Facade is recognisably some sort of vine, with conventional leaves {{on the end of}} short stalks and bunches of grapes or berries, but later forms usually lack these. Flowers are rare until about 1500, after which they appear more often, especially in Ottoman art, and are often identifiable by species. In Ottoman art the large and feathery leaves called saz became very popular, and were elaborated in drawings showing just one or more large leaves. Eventually floral decoration mostly derived from Chinese styles, especially those of Chinese porcelain, replaces the arabesque in many types of work, such as pottery, textiles and miniatures.|$|R
50|$|The {{species has}} few pests or {{diseases}} outside its native range and is widely naturalised and classified as an invasive species {{in parts of}} North America. Invasion can be restricted by removal of rooting <b>stems</b> in <b>spring.</b> Once established, {{it is difficult to}} eradicate, as its waxy leaves shed most water-based herbicide sprays. Removal involves cutting, followed by immediate application of concentrated glyphosate or triclopyr to the cut stems. Repeated chemical treatments may be necessary, along with digging up the roots where feasible.|$|R
50|$|The water {{horsetail}} {{has historically been}} used by both Europeans and Native Americans for scouring, sanding, and filing {{because of the high}} silica content in the <b>stems.</b> Early <b>spring</b> shoots were eaten. Medically it was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to stop bleeding and treat kidney ailments, ulcers, and tuberculosis, and by the ancient Chinese to treat superficial visual obstructions. Rootstocks and stems are sometimes eaten by waterfowl. Horsetails absorb heavy metals from the soil, and are often used in bioassays for metals.|$|R
50|$|Flowers are 0.75 in long, borne in racemes on short, branched, leafy <b>stems</b> {{from late}} <b>spring</b> to autumn. They have 4 petals, {{the top and}} bottom ones crested, the top one with a short, rounded spur curved downwards, the 2 inner ones {{connected}} at the tip.|$|R
50|$|High-lift {{safety valves}} are direct-loaded spring types, {{although}} the spring does not bear {{directly on the}} valve, but on a guide-rod valve stem. The valve is beneath {{the base of the}} <b>stem,</b> the <b>spring</b> rests on a flange some height above this. The increased space between the valve itself and the spring seat allows the valve to lift higher, further clear of the seat. This gives a steam flow through the valve equivalent to a valve one and a half or twice as large (depending on detail design).|$|R
30|$|<b>Stem</b> bending in <b>spring</b> {{or summer}} {{was found to}} {{increase}} the number of Type 1 resin pockets, but had no effect on the number of Type 2 resin pockets. The soil moisture conditions at the time of stem bending had no effect on the number of Type 1 or 2 resin pockets.|$|R
