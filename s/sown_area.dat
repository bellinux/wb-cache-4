25|$|The {{official}} {{numbers for}} collectivized area (the column with percent of <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> in collective {{use in the}} table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935-1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of kolkhoz members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) {{are included in the}} land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of sown areas.|$|E

The results showed that the degree of intensity and the <b>sowing</b> <b>area</b> of the land use in China during 1980 - 2000 had a total trend to increase, but there were three times to decline. And when the degree of intensity declined obviously during the period of 1984 - 1986, 1992 - 1993 and 1997 - 1999, the <b>sowing</b> <b>area</b> of the crop shrank evidently and the abandonment of land use began to increase notably almost in the same time. The ultimate cause to result in these changes had a tightness relation with the change of the net return for the cost factor and land factor in {{the progress of}} the land use.

50|$|After World War II, Mongolia {{intensified}} {{efforts to}} expand crop production by establishing more state farms, by reclaiming virgin lands for crop raising, by mechanizing farm operations, and by developing irrigation systems for farmlands. When Mongolia began to report statistics on arable land in 1960, there were 532,000 hectares of arable land, and sown crops covered 265,000 hectares of the 477,000 hectares of plow land. Mongolia's 25 state farms accounted for 77.5 percent of <b>sown</b> <b>areas,</b> and cooperatives, for 22.5 percent. In 1985 when 52 state farms and 17 fodder supply farms existed, {{there were about}} 1.2 million hectares of arable land, and sown crops covered 789,600 hectares of the approximately 1 million hectares of plow land. The state sector accounted for 80.6 percent of <b>sown</b> <b>areas,</b> and cooperatives, for 19.4 percent. Development of virgin lands by state farms was {{responsible for most of}} the expansion of arable land and <b>sown</b> <b>areas.</b> Land reclamation started in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when 530,000 hectares were developed, and it continued throughout each five-year plan. During the Seventh Plan, 250,000 hectares were assimilated, and the Eighth Plan called for an additional 120,000 to 130,000 hectares to be reclaimed.|$|R

25|$|The year 1953 {{was a major}} {{turning point}} for {{agriculture}} in the district. Prior to 1953, cultivation was monsoon-dependent. In 1953, the irrigation projects of Damodar Valley Corporation were implemented. Irrigation and intensive cropping pattern provided the real momentum to agriculture. The undivided Bardhaman district topped the state with maximum irrigated land. The district utilises both surface water and groundwater for irrigation. In 2003-04, 27.07% of the gross cropped area was under irrigation. 65.51% of the reported area was net <b>sown</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Chhattisgarh, rice, {{the main}} crop, is grown on about 77% {{of the net}} <b>sown</b> <b>area.</b> Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three {{agroclimatic}} zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{crops are}} rice, maize, kodo-kutki {{and other small}} millets and pulses (tuar and kulthi); oilseeds, such as {{groundnuts}} (peanuts), soybeans and sunflowers, are also grown. In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt. Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the <b>sown</b> <b>area</b> was double-cropped. When a very {{substantial portion of the}} population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed. Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so {{there is a need to}} diversify the agriculture produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops.

40|$|With rapid {{economic}} development in China, crops have undergone remarkable changes in both their type and spatial pattern. Timely and accurate information of crop type distribution will help government and agricultural producers quickly understand regional agricultural production conditions to better facilitate appropriate adjustments in planting patterns and policies. Another benefit of acquiring such knowledge of crops is that it should enhance regional agricultural competitiveness, optimize resource allocations, and further guarantee national food security. Towards this end, and using the Zhangye City in the Heihe River Basin as a study area, the present research elaborated upon a methodology to classify crop type distribution based on multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) images. Using this methodology we achieved the spatial distributions of crop types in Zhangye City in 2007 and 2012, and analyzed changes in their distributions over this period. In addition, some landscape indices were calculated to clarify the landscape pattern of crops. The crop conversion potentials in 2017 were modeled using four conversion sub-models of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Generally, the overall accuracy of crop classification in Zhangye was high, at 89. 38 %. From 2007 to 2012, the cultivated land area in Zhangye increased from 463. 81 x 10 (3) ha to 493. 89 x 10 (3) ha. The <b>sowing</b> <b>area</b> of corn and oilseed rape increased by 39. 21 x 10 (3) ha and 5. 99 x 10 (3) ha, respectively, while for wheat and barley the <b>sowing</b> <b>area</b> decreased by 3. 61 x 10 (3) ha and 9. 14 x 10 (3) ha, respectively. Considering other crop types as a group, their <b>sowing</b> <b>area</b> decreased by only 2. 37 x 10 (3) ha. The increase in corn <b>sowing</b> <b>area</b> mainly came from the conversion of other crops to corn, which accounted for 43. 09 % of its total <b>sowing</b> <b>area</b> in 2012. Furthermore, corn and oilseed rape showed a tendency of intensive sowing, whereas for wheat and barley the tendency was towards scattered sowing. For the future, corn has high conversion potential in Linze and Gaotai counties of Zhangye, while wheat, barley and oilseed rape have high conversion potentials in Minle and Shandan counties.

50|$|Crop {{production}} initially {{concentrated on}} raising cereals; in 1941 cereals covered 95.1 percent of <b>sown</b> <b>areas,</b> while 3.4 percent {{was devoted to}} potatoes and 1.5 percent to vegetables. In 1960, Mongolia became self-sufficient as far as cereals were concerned. Cultivation of fodder crops began in the 1950s. In 1985 cereals covered 80.6 percent of <b>sown</b> <b>areas,</b> fodder crops 17.7 percent, potatoes 1.3 percent, and vegetables 0.4 percent. Mongolia's staple crops were wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, vegetables, hay, and silage crops. Since 1960 agricultural performance as measured by gross output, per capita output, and crop yields was uneven. Although sown acreage expanded dramatically between 1960 and 1980, output and crop yields remained stagnant and, in some cases, fell because of natural disasters and poor management. In addition to the staple crops mentioned, Mongolia also produced small quantities of oil-yielding crops, such as sunflower and grape, and fruits and vegetables, such as sea buckthorn, apples, European black currants, watermelons, muskmelons, onions, and garlic. Small amounts of alfalfa, soybean, millet, and peas also were grown to provide protein fodder.|$|R
