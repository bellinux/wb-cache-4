5|$|Yamashita {{was born}} in Kanazawa, then {{the capital of the}} {{powerful}} Kaga Domain. His father was of the samurai class. As a boy, Yamashita trained in the traditional (koryū) Japanese martial arts schools of Yōshin-ryū and Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū jujutsu. In August 1884, he joined the Kodokan judo dojo of his childhood friend Kano Jigoro as its nineteenth member. He advanced to first degree black belt (shodan) rank in three months, fourth degree (yondan) ranking in two years, and sixth degree (rokudan) in fourteen years. He was prone to discuss the philosophy of judo with Kano, as Yamashita initially believed power <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> before technique.|$|E

25|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate equity from efficiency. This implies that all emitters, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, should pay the full social costs of their actions. From this perspective, corrective (Pigouvian) taxes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> uniformly (see carbon tax#Economic theory).|$|E
25|$|Conflict of {{marriage}} laws is {{the conflict of}} laws with respect to marriage in different jurisdictions.

50|$|The sub-categories in opera, however, <b>should</b> never <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> to a non-classical singer, {{for they}} are too closely {{associated}} with classical vocal technique. Words like lyric, dramatic, coloratura, and other defining qualities <b>should</b> never <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> to a non-classical singer. Also specific kinds of voices like soubrette and spinto <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> used outside of classical singing. The main categories, however, can be, {{as long as they}} refer solely to range.

25|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is that this {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium should be a KMS state. This almost goes without saying; for a quantum system, the KMS condition is just the concrete definition of thermodynamic equilibrium. The hard part is identifying the quantum system to which the condition <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied,</b> which is not done in this paper.|$|E

Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|July 1, 2008: The {{trial court}} granted Addison's request to {{bifurcate}} the sentencing {{portion of the}} trial, assuming a finding of guilt. Essentially, the determination by the jury regarding the death penalty will be made in two stages: first, whether the death penalty may be applied and, second, whether the death penalty <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied,</b> or if life without parole is the proper sentence. The court made numerous decisions throughout the year that allowed the death penalty to {{be presented to the}} jury.|$|E

25|$|The Court overrules him, {{stating that}} more torture <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> until {{the truth is}} spoken. Again, Filippo changes his mind and {{supports}} the Court's decision. Agnese pleads with Filppo for Beatrice and Orombello, confessing her own behaviour in defaming them. The couple is led away, with Filippo and Agnese, full of remorse, left alone. She realises that things have gone much further than she had expected and begs Filippo to drop all the charges. However, not wishing to look weak, he dismisses the idea and orders her to leave.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is extremely}} {{detrimental to the}} lungs, and pulmonary exposure to zinc chloride smoke resulted in ten fatalities. Inhalation of fumes of zinc, zinc oxide, or zinc chloride leads to pulmonary edema and metal fume fever. Onset occurs within 4–6 h and may be delayed up to 8 h. Symptoms include rapid breathing, dyspnea, cough, fever, shivering, sweating, chest and leg pain, myalgias, fatigue, metallic taste, salivation, thirst, and leukocytosis, which can last from 24 to 48 h. In cases of fume inhalation, cortisone preparations <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> immediately (e.g., by inhalation of Auxiloson) to avoid development of lung edema.|$|E
25|$|Witchcraft or witchery broadly {{means the}} {{practice}} of and belief in magical skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups known as covens. Witchcraft is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus {{can be difficult to}} define with precision, therefore cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious divinatory or medicinal role, and is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view. Witchcraft involves the use of intent (and often physical objects) to manipulate environmental energy in order to effect change in favor of the practitioners.|$|E

25|$|A magical {{record is}} a journal or other source of {{documentation}} containing magical events, experiences, ideas, {{and any other}} information that the magician may see fit to add. There can be many purposes for such a record, such as recording evidence to verify the effectiveness of specific procedures (per the scientific method that Aleister Crowley claimed <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> {{to the practice of}} Magick) or to ensure that data may propagate beyond the lifetime of the magician. Benefits of this process vary, but usually include future analysis and further education by the individual and/or associates with whom the magician feels comfortable in revealing such intrinsically private information.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland teinds {{were the}} tenths of certain produce {{of the land}} {{appropriated}} {{to the maintenance of}} the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the Privy Council of Scotland provided that a third of the revenues of lands <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> to paying the clergy of the reformed Church of Scotland. In 1925 the system was recast by statute and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The Court of Session acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.|$|E
25|$|Hassan al-Banna {{founded the}} Muslim Brotherhood {{in the city}} of Ismailia in March 1928 along with six workers of the Suez Canal Company, as a Pan-Islamic, religious, political, and social movement. The Suez Canal Company helped Banna build the mosque in Ismailia that would serve as the Brotherhood's headquarters, {{according}} to Richard Mitchell's The Society of Muslim Brothers. According to al-Banna, contemporary Islam had lost its social dominance, because most Muslims had been corrupted by Western influences.
