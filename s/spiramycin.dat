5000|$|<b>Spiramycin</b> is a 16-membered ring macrolide. It was {{discovered}} in 1952 {{as a product of}} Streptomyces ambofaciens. As a preparation for oral administration it has been used since 1955, in 1987 also the parenteral form was introduced into practice. The antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to <b>spiramycin</b> can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium species. Enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic moulds are resistant. Its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of <b>spiramycin</b> to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. An important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect. Its great advantage is the exceptionally favourable tolerance-gastrointestinal and general. It is available for parenteral and oral administration ...|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Desmonts and Couvreur {{showed that}} {{infection}} {{during the first}} two trimesters produces most harm to the fetus, that transmission depended on when mothers were infected during pregnancy, that mothers with antibodies before pregnancy did not transmit the infection to the fetus, and that <b>spiramycin</b> lowered the transmission to the fetus.|$|E
50|$|If the {{parasite}} {{has not yet}} reached the fetus, <b>spiramycin</b> can help to prevent placental transmission. If the fetus has been infected, the pregnant woman can be treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, with folinic acid, after the first trimester. They are treated after the first trimester because pyrimethamine has an antifolate effect, and lack of folic acid can interfere with fetal brain formation and cause thrombocytopaenia. Infection in earlier gestational stages correlates with poorer fetal and neonatal outcomes, particularly when the infection is untreated.|$|E
40|$|During its {{stationary}} phase, Streptomyces ambofaciens {{produces the}} macrolide antibiotic <b>spiramycin,</b> {{and has to}} protect itself against this antibiotic. Young mycelia, not yet producing <b>spiramycin,</b> are sensitive to it, but they become fully resistant when production begins. In a sensitive mycelium, resistance could be induced by exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>spiramycin,</b> and these induced mycelia, like producing mycelia were resistant not only to <b>spiramycin</b> but also to several other macrolide antibiotics. Ribosomes extracted from these resistant mycelia were shown in vitro to be more resistant to <b>spiramycin</b> than ribosomes extracted from sensitive mycelium, indicating that S. ambofaciens possesses a spiramycin-inducible ribosomal resistance to <b>spiramycin</b> and to macrolide antibiotics. Studies with <b>spiramycin</b> non-producing mutants showed that, in these mutants, resistance to <b>spiramycin</b> also varies during cultivation, in that an old culture was much more resistant than a young one. But with these non-producing mutants, the spectrum of resistance was narrower, and in vitro data showed that resistance was not due to ribosomal modification. These results suggest that S. ambofaciens presents at least two distinct mechanisms for <b>spiramycin</b> resistance; a spiramycin-inducible ribosomal resistance, and a second resistance mechanism which might be temporally regulated and which could involve decreased permeability to, or export of, the antibiotic. The two mechanisms are probably at work simultaneously in the producing mycelium, the spiramycin-inducible resistance being induced by endogenous <b>spiramycin.</b> In non-producing mutants, {{in the absence of}} self-induction by <b>spiramycin,</b> only the second mechanism is observed...|$|E

To further investigate the pharmacological effects of <b>spiramycin</b> in vivo, we examined several obesity-related parameters in HFD-induced obese mice. <b>Spiramycin</b> significantly inhibited preadipocyte differentiation by attenuating intracellular lipid accumulation. <b>Spiramycin</b> also reduced the expression of adipogenic master regulators (PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP 1 c) and their downstream target genes (FAS, aP 2, and GLUT 4) in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. In addition, AMPK phosphorylation was increased by <b>spiramycin</b> treatment in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells during early differentiation. Notably, HFD-induced obese mice administered <b>spiramycin</b> showed substantial decreases in body weight gain, serum leptin levels, adipose tissue mass, and hepatic lipid accumulation.

40|$|The multidrug {{resistance}} proteins P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp), and {{multidrug resistance}}-associated protein 2 (Mrp 2) {{are the three}} major canalicular transport proteins responsible for the biliary excretion of most drugs and metabolites.

Bcrp was proposed {{to be the primary}} pathway for <b>spiramycin</b> secretion into breast milk. In the present study, the contributions of P-gp, Bcrp, and Mrp 2 to the biliary excretion of <b>spiramycin</b> were examined in single-pass perfused livers of male C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type, Bcrp-knockout, and Mrp 2 -knockout mice in {{the presence or absence of}} GF 120918 (GW 918), a P-gp and Bcrp inhibitor. <b>Spiramycin</b> was infused to achieve steady-state conditions, followed by a washout period, and parameters governing <b>spiramycin</b> hepatobiliary disposition were recovered by using pharmacokinetic modeling. In the absence of GW 918, the rate constant governing <b>spiramycin</b> biliary excretion was decreased in Mrp 2 − knockout mice (0. 0013 ± 0. 0009 min− 1) relative to wild-type mice (0. 0124 ± 0. 0096 min− 1). These data are consistent with the ∼ 8 -fold decrease in the recovery of <b>spiramycin</b> in the bile of Mrp 2 -knockout mice and suggest that Mrp 2 is the major canalicular transport protein responsible for <b>spiramycin</b> biliary excretion. Interestingly, biliary recovery of <b>spiramycin</b> in Bcrp-knockout mice was increased in both the absence and presence of GW 918 compared to wild-type mice.

The in-vivo study was performed in patients receiving 500 or 1000 mg <b>spiramycin</b> every 8 h as a l-h infusion on day 1.
