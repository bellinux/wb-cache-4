25|$|On 26 July 1941, the Italians {{launched}} a seaborne {{attack on the}} Grand Harbour with two human torpedoes, four MAS boats and six MT boats. The force was detected early on by a British radar facility, and the coastal artillery at Saint Elmo opened fire when the Italians approached to close range. In the attack, 15 men were killed and 18 captured, and all the human torpedoes and MT boats, along {{with two of the}} MAS boats were lost. One of the MT boats hit Saint Elmo Bridge, which linked the breakwater with the tip of the peninsula near the fort, and the bridge collapsed. The bridge was never restored, and it was only in 2012 that a new one was built in its place with a <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>different</b> design.|$|E

2500|$|Accounts of Adam and Eve in Islamic texts, {{which include}} the Quran and the books of Sunnah, are <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>different</b> {{to that of the}} Torah and Bible. There is no Quranic basis for the view that Eve was created from Adam's rib; instead the Quran relates a {{gender-neutral}} account in which God created [...] "one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women" [...] (Surah Al-Nisa 4:1), but there are hadiths that support the creation of woman [...] "from a rib" [...] (Sahih Bukhari 4:55:548, Sahih Bukhari 7:62:114, Sahih Muslim 8:3467, Sahih Muslim 8:3468). Eve is not blamed for enticing Adam to eat the forbidden fruit (nor is there the concept of original sin). On the contrary, the Quran indicates that [...] "they ate of it" [...] and were both to blame for that transgression (Quran 20:121-122).|$|E
2500|$|A few of {{the core}} {{characters}} from Chrono Cross originate from an earlier game titled Radical Dreamers. Chrono series writer Masato Kato felt that the first game in the series, Chrono Trigger, did not wrap up all its story arcs, and as such, wrote the story of Radical Dreamers to conclude some aspects of it. However, due to the rushed nature of the development schedule, it being a short, text based visual novel, and being released on an obscure add-on for the Super Famicom, the Satellaview, Kato would label the game [...] "unfinished", leading to the conception of a more complete game, which would be Chrono Cross. Serge, Kid, Lynx, Viper, Radius, and Riddel all originate from the game. Additionally, the Radical Dreamers character Magil, who is an amnesiac Magus from Chrono Trigger, was originally {{going to be the}} character Guile in Chrono Cross, before Kato wrote him out of the script, fearing he could not do the character justice in the massive scope of Chrono Cross. While Radical Dreamers characters were used as a base for the characters of Chrono Cross, Kato made changes as well. In Radical Dreamers, Serge acted as the game's narrator, rather than a silent protagonist, and Lynx, is just a regular human, rather than an anthropomorphic cat. With the release of Chrono Cross, the characters and events of Radical Dreamers were retconned as being from a <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>different</b> alternate reality.Kid:...
