40|$|Morphological {{variation}} among 78 local {{races of}} sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) in the Nordic Gene Bank's Prunus clone archive in Pälkäne in Southwestern Finland was examined. Each tree was described using 42 characteristics. On {{the basis of}} fruit characteristics, 32 samples were classified as morellos, 40 samples as amarelles, and 5 samples distinct from the other amarelles are proposed to be called Rymättylä-type cherries. One sample {{was found to be}} Prunus avium. Amarelle <b>type</b> <b>cherries</b> proved to be more self compatible than morello <b>type</b> <b>cherries.</b> In order to find hardy sour cherry cultivars with fruits of good flavour and fit for cultivation in Nordic conditions, the most promising local races from each group were selected for a comparative trial. Additionally, some local races were selected for further use in plant breeding. In 1994 - 1996, an increasing amount of severe bacterial canker symptoms was observed in the clone achive...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} attempt of improving hydrodynamic efficiency of the propulsion mechanism by installing a spring to the wing so that the opening angle of the wing in one stroke can be changed automatically, compared to the existing method of fixed maximum opening angle in Weis-Fogh type ship propulsion mechanism. Average thrust coefficient was almost fixed with all velocity ratio with the prototype, but with the <b>spring</b> <b>type,</b> thrust coefficient increased sharply as velocity ratio increased. Average propulsive efficiency was larger with bigger opening angle in the prototype, but in the <b>spring</b> <b>type,</b> the one with smaller spring coefficient had larger value. In the range over 1. 0 in velocity ratio where big thrust can be generated, <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> had more than twice of propulsive efficiency increase compared to the prototype...|$|R
50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>types</b> in {{the front}} and rear can be transverse, {{parallel}} or coil setups—parallel is not used as frequently as the more common single-spring transverse setup and coil springs are still occasionally seen even though this <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> is less popular for aesthetic reasons. Rat rods will often be built with airbag suspension, thereby allowing the driver to raise and lower the car; this can be a useful feature due to the extremely low ground clearance of many rat rods.|$|R
40|$|The {{tensioning}} device {{is designed to}} pull the contact wire straight at all times. Pulling a contact wire straight ensures that smooth contact is maintained at all times between the contact wire and pantograph of an electric train, and this {{makes it possible to}} ensure a stable supply of electricity to the train. Normally, {{tensioning device}} are installed at two positions over a distance of 1 to 1. 6 km per line. Fig. 1 shows a conceptual view {{of the relationship between the}} contact wire and pulley type balancer. The tensioning device can be broadly classified into the two types; the wheel type tensioning device that pulls the contact wire by concrete or iron weights and the <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> tensioning device that use the force of a spring to pull it. Fig. 2 shows the wheel type balancer, while Fig. 3 represents the <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> balancer. The <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> tensioning device comprises a spring and a sleeve for accommodating the spring. Only the sleeve portion is visible to the outside. The wheel depends on gravity acting on the weight to produce tension, so it is possible to pull the contact wire at an almost uniform force, regardless of the height of the weight. In the <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> The wheel type tensioning device used in the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines of JR East requires much time and labor for maintenance including wire replacement and oil application. Further, parts become superannuated and in need of periodic replacement very quickly. So we found it necessary to develop a new type of maintenance-free tensioning device. To accomplish this, we have been making efforts since 1999 to develop a new <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> tensioning device for Shinkansen, making effective use of the <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> balancer technologies used in the narrow gauge lines, where the major target is to develop a maintenance-free tensioning device. Thus, fairly satisfactory development results have been attained. This paper introduces and discusses this development...|$|R

40|$|Predictions of {{the draw}} ratio versus {{spinning}} force for two <b>spring</b> <b>types</b> are presented. An idealized fibre-spinning experiment is considered for ascertaining the influence of model parameters; this {{is found to be}} independent of <b>spring</b> <b>type.</b> The unusual prediction is that the graph of draw ratio against spinning force may be S-shaped, so that in some circumstances three different values of the spinning force are possible for one draw ratio. This arises from when the competing effects of solvent viscosity, polymer elasticity and finite extensibility are of comparable magnitudes. This can have important implications for the interpretation of fibre-spinning experiments and the deduction of elongational flow properties...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{dynamics}} of naturally occurring prokaryotes, viruses, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates in two hydro-geologically contrasting alpine karst springs were monitored over three annual cycles. To our knowledge, {{this study is}} the first to shed light on the occurrence and possible interrelationships between these three groups in karstic groundwater. Hydrological and microbiological standard indicators were recovered simultaneously in order to estimate surface influence, especially during rainfall events. Data revealed a strong dependence of the microbial communities on the prevailing hydrological situation. Prokaryotic numbers averaged 5. 1 × 107 and 1. 3 × 107 cells L− 1, and heterotrophic nanoflagellate abundance averaged 1. 1 × 104 and 3 × 103 cells L− 1 in the limestone <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> (LKAS 2) and the dolomitic <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> (DKAS 1), respectively. Viral abundance in LKAS 2 and DKAS 1 averaged 9. 4 × 108 and 1. 1 × 108 viruses L− 1. Unlike in DKAS 1, the dynamic <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> LKAS 2 revealed a clear difference between base flow and high discharge conditions. The virus-to-prokaryotes ratio was generally lower by a factor of 2 - 3, at higher average water residence times. Furthermore, the high prokaryotes-to-heterotrophic nanoflagellate ratios, namely about 4700 and 5400 for LKAS 2 and DKAS 1, respectively, pointed toward an uncoupling of these two groups in the planktonic fraction of alpine karstic aquifers...|$|R
