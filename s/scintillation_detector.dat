2500|$|The {{same issue}} occurs with {{radiation}} protection instruments, where a reading from an instrument {{may be affected}} by the background radiation. An example of this is a <b>scintillation</b> <b>detector</b> used for surface contamination monitoring. In an elevated gamma background the scintillator material will {{be affected by the}} background gamma, which will add to the reading obtained from any contamination which is being monitored. In extreme cases it will make the instrument unusable as the background swamps the lower level of radiation from the contamination. In such instruments the background can be continually monitored in the [...] "Ready" [...] state, and subtracted from any reading obtained when being used in [...] "Measuring" [...] mode.|$|E
2500|$|Regular Radiation {{measurement}} {{is carried}} out at multiple levels. [...] Government agencies compile radiation readings as part of environmental monitoring mandates, often making the readings {{available to the public}} and sometimes in near-real-time. [...] Collaborative groups and private individuals may also make real-time readings available to the public. [...] Instruments used for radiation measurement include the Geiger–Müller tube and the <b>Scintillation</b> <b>detector.</b> [...] The former is usually more compact and affordable and reacts to several radiation types, while the latter is more complex and can detect specific radiation energies and types. [...] Readings indicate radiation levels from all sources including background, and real-time readings are in general unvalidated, but correlation between independent detectors increases confidence in measured levels.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental method-independent {{limits on}} the timing {{performance}} of <b>scintillation</b> <b>detectors</b> are useful for identifying regimes in which either present timing methods are nearly optimal or where a considerable performance gain might be realized using better pulse processing techniques. Several types of lower bounds on mean-squared timing error (MSE) performance have been developed and applied to <b>scintillation</b> <b>detectors.</b> The simple Cramer-Rao (CR) bound {{can be useful in}} determining the limiting MSE for scintillators having a relatively high rate of photon production such as BaF 2 and NaI(Tl); however, it tends to overestimate the achievable performance for scintillators with lower rates such as BGO. For this reason, alternative bounds have been developed using rate-distortion theory [1, 2] or by assuming that the conversion of energy to scintillation light must pass through excited states which have exponential lifetime densities [3]. The bounds are functions of the mean scintillation pulse shape, the scintillation intensity, and photodetector characteristics; they are simple to evaluate and can be used to conveniently assess the limiting timing performance of <b>scintillation</b> <b>detectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Scintillation</b> <b>detectors</b> offer a single-step {{detection}} method for fast neutrons and necessitate real-time acquisition, whereas this is redundant in two-stage thermal detection systems using helium- 3 and lithium- 6, where the fast neutrons {{need to be}} thermalized prior to detection. The relative affordability of <b>scintillation</b> <b>detectors</b> and the associated fast digital acquisition systems have enabled entirely new measurement setups that can consist of sizeable detector arrays. These detectors in most cases rely on photo-multiplier tubes which have significant tolerances and result in variations in detector response functions. The detector tolerances and other environmental instabilities must be accounted for in measurements that depend on matched detector performance. This paper presents recent advances made to a high-speed FPGA-based digitizer. The technology described offers a complete solution for fast-neutron <b>scintillation</b> <b>detectors</b> by integrating multichannel high-speed data acquisition technology with dedicated detector high-voltage supplies. This configuration has significant advantages for large detector arrays that require uniform detector responses.

50|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{facilitated by}} higher incoming neutron energies, neutron detection is generally a difficult task, {{for all the}} reasons stated earlier. Thus, better scintillator design {{is also in the}} foreground and has been the topic of pursuit ever since the invention of <b>scintillation</b> <b>detectors.</b> <b>Scintillation</b> <b>detectors</b> were invented in 1903 by Crookes but were not very efficient until the PMT (photomultiplier tube) was developed by Curran and Baker in 1944. The PMT gives a reliable and efficient method of detection since it multiplies the detection signal tenfold. Even so, scintillation design has room for improvement as do other options for neutron detection besides scintillation.|$|R
