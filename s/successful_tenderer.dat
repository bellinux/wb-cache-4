25|$|Initially, the Australian {{government}} {{promised that}} the government-owned ASC, the company responsible for building the Collins class, would build the new submarines. In a May 2009 announcement about plans to release a request for tender, the Labor government indicated that if a company other than ASC was the <b>successful</b> <b>tenderer,</b> that company would be granted access to ASC's shipyard in Osborne, South Australia. Despite ongoing support for the submarines {{to be built in}} South Australia by successive Coalition and Labor governments, in July 2014, the Abbott-led Coalition government abandoned their pre-election commitment to ASC-based construction and opened up the likely possibility of building the submarines at a foreign shipyard. In February 2015 the Abbott Government in announcing a 'competitive evaluation process' noted that the government would not approach the submarine decision with an 'open cheque book', but would rather allow a competitive process in which various construction options would be explored, including construction in Australia, overseas, or a 'hybrid approach' of foreign and local construction, along with estimated costs and schedules.|$|E

2500|$|Planning of {{the airport}} link started in the 1980s. In 1993 the Government of Sweden issued a tender for a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) to build the Arlanda Line.

The <b>successful</b> <b>tenderer</b> would receive a monopoly on traffic between the airport and Stockholm until 2040. The line and the services were inaugurated on 25 November 1999. The PPP contract has since been criticized for being unclear, uneconomical for the state and leading to a low utilization of the service.|$|E

[...] Despite this progress, there was unease within Nelson province with regard to the fact that contracts had yet to be awarded for work on the line. [...] When it was announced on 10 August that nine contracts had been let for railway construction but that the Nelson line was not among them, Nelsonians were left to wonder if the government had broken its promises. [...] As it turned out, the problem for the authorities was in deciding on a route out of Nelson. [...] While Austin was tasked with investigating the matter further, tenders were called for the [...] section from Stoke to Foxhill and steps were taken to acquire the necessary land. [...] The <b>successful</b> <b>tenderer</b> for the Waimea contract was a local firm by the name of Scott and Robinson.|$|E
