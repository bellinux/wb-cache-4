30|$|Figure  4 b {{shows the}} {{estimated}} maximum storage pressure (Pmax) vs. {{the number of}} stories for different column spacing, in which the inner diameters for the pile (di) was set to be 300  mm for all the cases. As mentioned previously, the maximum storage pressures (Pmax) were calculated using the energy demand pattern 4. The building with more number of stories and larger column spacing have more energy consumption, which results in more energy demands for the storage (win) to keep the total energy demand and supply equal for the 24  h period. However, at the same time, the taller building and larger column spacing requires more number of piles and longer pile length, which consequently results in more available <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> (<b>V).</b> Therefore, as shown in Fig.  4 b, {{it appeared that the}} maximum storage pressure (Pmax) is not sensitive depending on the number of stories and column spacing.|$|E
40|$|A CSHPSS (central {{solar heating}} plant with {{seasonal}} storage), which {{is under construction}} in Korea, is simulated with TRNSYS 14. 2 to predict thermal performances and economic merits. The system is located in Cheju Island, a far southern part of Korea, and consists of two arrays of collectors, a medium-sized storage tank, and 2 thermal loads. The loads are an office building and a greenhouse for agricultural research. Simulation results clearly reveal that Cheju Island is climatically best suited for solar heating in Korea showing 70 to 100 % more solar fractions than other inland areas. The main reason for the better thermal performance for Cheju is its warmer winter climate. The system under construction is a small-sized and has 184 m 2 collector area (A) and 600 m 3 of <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> (<b>V).</b> TRNSYS prediction for the system is that about 39 % of the total heating load of 897, 000 MJ/year can be provided from the sun. The estimated ROIs (return of investment) range from 25 to 30 years. The validity of the design is checked through a what-if test around the design point of A- 184 m 2 and V- 600 m 3. Also calculated a re the solar fraction contour and the virtual solar self-sufficiency conditions. Even though the actual system is not economically viable with that small size, the authors expect that only if system sized is sufficiently large, low-cost CSHPSS systems could be constructed in Korea...|$|E
40|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> of {{internet}} data center {{is one of}} the classical time series. It is very valuable to predict the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> of a data center for the business value. However, the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series from a data center is always “dirty,” which contains the noise, missing data, and outliers, so it is necessary to extract the main trend of <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series for the future prediction processing. In this paper, we propose an irregular sampling estimation method to extract the main trend of the time series, in which the Kalman filter is used to remove the “dirty” data; then the cubic spline interpolation and average method are used to reconstruct the main trend. The developed method is applied in the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series {{of internet}} data center. The experiment results show that the developed method can estimate the main trend of <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series accurately and make great contribution to predict the future volume value...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{methodology}} is proposed {{to determine the}} design space for synthesis, analysis, and optimization of solar water heating systems. The proposed methodology incorporates different design constraints to identify all possible designs or a design space on a collector area <b>vs.</b> <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> diagram. The design space is represented by tracing constant solar fraction lines on a collector area <b>vs.</b> <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> diagram. It has been observed that there exists a minimum {{as well as a}} maximum <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> for a given solar fraction and collector area. Similarly existence of a minimum and a maximum collector area is also observed for a fixed solar fraction and <b>storage</b> <b>volume.</b> For multi-objective optimization, a Pareto optimal region is also identified. Based on the identified design space, the solar water heating system is optimized by minimizing annual life cycle cost. Due to uncertainty in solar insolation, system parameters and cost data, global optimization may not be utilized to represent a meaningful design. To overcome this, a region of possible design configurations is also identified in this paper. (c) 200...|$|R
