25|$|During production, {{the cast}} {{attempted}} to make Lucas laugh or <b>smile,</b> <b>as</b> he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level. Post-production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover, Mark Hamill's car accident left his face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Miklós finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a <b>smile.</b> <b>As</b> the boy runs away, guards run past {{in the direction of the}} shed. Gunfire echoes as the camera follows the boy into the woods.|$|E

[...] Waddle personally directed the maneuvers. [...] According to Waddle, the DVs [...] "were loving it." [...] Waddle adds, [...] "I could barely suppress a <b>smile</b> <b>as</b> I watched the expressions of joy and amazement {{on the faces of}} our distinguished visitors."

500|$|In {{his book}} about {{psychedelic}} music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>as</b> {{a work of}} the [...] "ultimate psychedelic rock library". Conversely, Stylus Magazines Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album [...] "embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It {{is for this reason}} Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album [...] "can {{be thought of as a}} kind of protomiminal rock music". He continues: ...|$|E
500|$|Journalist Nick Kent {{maintained}} that the album [...] "undersold the worth" [...] of Smile with [...] "dumb pot-head skits, so-called healing chants and even some weird 'loony tunes' items straight out of a cut-rate Walt Disney soundtrack". The Guardians Geoffrey Cannon viewed Parks' lyrics as [...] "pretentious", believing that Parks [...] "messed Brian up" [...] during Smiley Smile. Pastes Bryan Rolli ranked it at number 2 in {{a list of the}} [...] "10 Most Disappointing Follow-Up Albums", calling it a [...] "disjointed collection of minimalist recordings and a capella bits that are not so much songs as fragments of a shattered psyche". In the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the reviewer described Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>as</b> [...] "inconsistent" [...] and said that, given the context of its release in September 1967, [...] "the album was like a strange throwback – it highlighted how out of touch these suburban California surfers had become with the psychedelic times." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a mixed review, {{giving the}} film {{three out of}} four stars despite {{complaining}} that the film [...] "recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was very critical of the film, calling it insipid. He wrote, [...] "Anne Fletcher directs Peter Chiarelli's script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion." [...] New York Times writer Manohla Dargis felt that Bullock's character was awkward in comparison to her previous work. She continued: [...] "She’s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel [...] and take the spotlight , an independence that persists {{all the way through the}} last-act coupling. She can <b>smile</b> <b>as</b> brightly at a man as well as the next leading lady, though, like all genuinely big female stars, she’s really more of a solo act." [...] The Telegraph Tim Robey expressed disappointment towards the film, giving it a two out of five stars.|$|E

Mulder grabs [...] "Scully" [...] and kisses her, [...] "in case they never meet again". [...] "Scully" [...] punches him, and he jumps overboard. Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital, {{surrounded}} by Scully, the Lone Gunmen and Skinner. Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939, and of his encounter with Nazis, and tells Scully that she was there with him, but they all think he is delirious. After Skinner and the Gunmen leave, Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her. Scully thinks his confession is an effect of the drugs he has been given, rolls her eyes and leaves. As he lies down, Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow; the spot where [...] "Scully" [...] punched him in 1939 is still sore and visibly bruised. Mulder feels his eye-socket and breaks into a knowing <b>smile,</b> <b>as</b> the screen fades to black.|$|E
500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going to answer it honestly with a wink and a <b>smile.</b> <b>As</b> cliché as it might be, I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E

500|$|The Beach Boys' album Pet Sounds, {{issued on}} May 16, 1966, was massively {{influential}} upon its release, containing lush and sophisticated orchestral arrangements that raised the band's prestige {{to the top}} level of rock innovators. Early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive, but the reception from music journalists in the UK was very favorable. The group had recently employed the Beatles' former press officer Derek Taylor as their publicist. Bothered by the popular view of the Beach Boys as outdated surfers, leader and songwriter Brian Wilson requested that Taylor establish a new image for the band as fashionable counterculture icons, and so a promotional campaign with the tagline [...] "Brian Wilson is a genius" [...] was created and coordinated by Taylor. In October 1966, the group followed up Pet Sounds with [...] "Good Vibrations", a laboriously produced single that achieved major international success. By then, an album titled Smile had been conceived {{as an extension of}} that song's recording approach, with Wilson composing music in collaboration with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. Wilson envisioned <b>Smile</b> <b>as</b> an outlet for all of his intellectual occupations, such as his fascination with spirituality and its relationship to humor and laughter. He told Melody Maker: [...] "Our new album will be better than Pet Sounds. It will be as much an improvement over Sounds as that was over [...] Summer Days." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but <b>smile</b> <b>as</b> Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E
