5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, <b>shrubby</b> cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The cane cholla (or {{walking stick}} cholla, tree cholla, chainlink cactus, etc.) (Cylindropuntia imbricata) is a cactus {{found in the}} Southwestern United States and {{northern}} Mexico, including some cooler regions in comparison to many other cacti. It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its <b>shrubby</b> or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its long-lasting yellowish fruits.|$|E
5|$|The rim of {{the central}} plain is vegetated by a dense shrubland of Rhagodia baccata (berry saltbush), Atriplex paludosa and Threlkeldia diffusa (coast bonefruit). Nearer the centre, the {{vegetation}} consists of Frankenia pauciflora (seaheath), Muellerolimon salicorniaceum and Tecticornia arbuscula (bulli bulli), although T.arbuscula is replaced by Tecticornia halocnemoides (<b>shrubby</b> samphire) where the soil is shallow. The most low-lying area of the central plain, south of the salt lake, is water-logged in winter; it is vegetated by a dense mat of Sarcocornia quinqueflora (beaded samphire), Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) and Suaeda australis (seablite).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Shrubbies</b> (mid-‘90s [...] "psychedelic acoustic" [...] band led by Craig and Sharron Fortnam and {{featuring}} a post-Cardiacs Sarah Smith and Dominic Luckman) ...|$|R
50|$|Herbaceous peonies such as Paeonia lactiflora, {{will die}} back to ground level each autumn. Their stems will {{reappear}} the following spring. However tree peonies, such as Paeonia suffruticosa, are <b>shrubbier.</b> They produce permanent woody stems that {{will lose their}} leaves in winter but the stem itself remains intact above ground level.|$|R
50|$|Like {{some other}} spindles, this plant is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental for its fall foliage, {{which can be}} many bright shades of red, pink, and yellow. The fruits and large seeds are also considered attractive. Cultivars include 'Coral Charm', which has light pink fruit capsules containing seeds with red arils, and 'Red Elf', a <b>shrubbier</b> breed with dark pink fruits and seeds with orange-red arils.|$|R
5|$|Cacti show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genus Pereskia, the branches are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as <b>shrubby,</b> with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E
5|$|Most of North Island is {{dominated}} by chenopod shrubs, generally less than a metre (3ft) high. The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (prickly saltwort), Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (sea rocket). Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), the last of these being the only plant on the island to grow over m (5ft) high. In areas where limestone {{is close to the}} surface, the vegetation consists of Pimelea microcephala (<b>shrubby</b> rice-flower), Spyridium globulosum (basket bush) and Acanthocarpus preissii.|$|E
5|$|The site is {{characterized}} by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units: grassy open areas, <b>shrubby</b> areas and wooded areas. Of these, three are listed in the Habitats Directive. The calcareous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation Cystopterido fragilis-Asplenietum scolopendrii are considered as exceptional, with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also exceptional. The herbaceous fringe with red campion (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The wood-fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli is also regionally interesting.|$|E
50|$|The Monsoon Bassoon were, by now, at the {{epicentre}} of the loosely defined London math-rock scene. Centred around {{relatively small}} venues {{such as the}} Dublin Castle and Upstairs at the Garage, this featured London-based bands such as Billy Mahonie, Guapo, Rothko, Nub, Delicate AWOL, Geiger Counter (later Foe) and The <b>Shrubbies,</b> plus affiliated acts such as the Oxford-based Nought and developing indie acts such as Seafood.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the early}} nineties Smith has {{produced}} recordings {{for a variety}} of musicians and musical groups, many of whom belong to the so-called [...] "Cardiacs family". These include Levitation, Sidi Bou Said, Eat, The Monsoon Bassoon, Wildhearts frontman Ginger (including his Silver Ginger 5 and Howling Willie Cunt projects), Stars In Battledress, Oceansize, William D. Drake, The <b>Shrubbies,</b> The Scaramanga Six and The Trudy.|$|R
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} climax forests {{dominated}} by redwood, white fir, western hemlock, and Shasta red fir, or mixes of tree types. It {{may be an}} understory shrub, or it may codominate the canopy as a tree. Habitat types where the tree may be found include coastal forests, woodlands, and chaparral. In the western Cascade Mountains it grows in western hemlock forests. In the southern Cascades it grows at higher elevations but takes on a smaller, <b>shrubbier</b> form.|$|R
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows <b>shrubby</b> and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E
25|$|From an {{ecological}} point of view, <b>shrubby</b> borders are fundamental in forest ecosystems {{to guarantee the}} natural regeneration of the woods, {{as well as to}} provide food and refuge for the associated fauna.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{small tree}} usually 30 through 80 feet (10 through 24 meters) in height, with a short, slender trunk and spreading, often {{pendulous}} branches, which form a broad or narrow, round-topped canopy. The roots are thick, fleshy and stoloniferous. This species as has a <b>shrubby</b> growth form.|$|E
50|$|While in London, Podsdarapomuk drew {{attention}} {{from the body of}} music fans surrounding the cult British band Cardiacs, and played regularly with bands such as Billy Mahonie, The Pets, The <b>Shrubbies</b> and The Monsoon Bassoon. However, the band remained unable to move beyond being a cult act playing small venues and in terms of press coverage were predominantly written about by small-press magazines and fanzines specializing in diverse rock music (such as Expose, Organ Audion, Tarkus and Misfit City).|$|R
25|$|Despite this {{crippling}} blow, {{the band}} soldiered on, but by July 1993 yet another long-term member – drummer Dominic Luckman – {{had decided to}} quit. He played his last concert as a Cardiac member on 20 July at Camden Palace, London (and would later join The <b>Shrubbies).</b> In December 1993, Cardiacs revealed their new drummer, Jon Poole's former Ad Nauseam bandmate, Bob Leith. However, the following year proved to be Cardiacs' quietest year for a long time, with only four concerts played in total.|$|R
50|$|Heathland and {{chaparral}} {{are found}} between 3200 m and 3800 m. Heathland {{is found in}} the wetter areas, and chaparral {{is found in the}} drier areas. Most of the plants in these areas are shrubs with small leaves. The dominant plants in the heathland areas are Erica and Phillipia, which can grow to over 10 m tall. In chaparral the plants are often <b>shrubbier</b> and more aromatic, such as African sage (Artemisia afra) and sugarbush (Protea kilimanjaro). These habitats may be prone to fire.|$|R
25|$|The natural {{vegetation}} of the Faroe Islands {{is dominated by}} arctic-alpine plants, wildflowers, grasses, moss and lichen. Most of the lowland area is grassland and some is heath, dominated by <b>shrubby</b> heathers, mainly Calluna vulgaris. Among the herbaceous flora {{that occur in the}} Faroe Islands is the cosmopolitan marsh thistle, Cirsium palustre.|$|E
25|$|Quercus agrifolia, the California live oak, or coast live oak, is an {{evergreen}} oak (highly {{variable and}} often <b>shrubby),</b> {{native to the}} California Floristic Province. It grows west of the Sierra Nevada from Mendocino County, California, south to northern Baja California in Mexico. It is classified in the red oak section (Quercus sect. Lobatae).|$|E
25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} around Bisbee has a semi-desert appearance with <b>shrubby</b> acacia, oak and the like, {{along with}} cacti, grass, ocotillo and yucca. The town itself {{is much more}} luxuriant with native trees such as cypress, sycamore and cottonwood plus the introduced ailanthus and Old World cypresses, cedars and pines. Palms are capable of large size, but are not reliably hardy. A few higher-elevation trees such as blue spruce and white fir are growing fairly well in Bisbee.|$|E
50|$|Craig Fortnam (born September 1967, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England) is an English composer, {{conductor}} and musician. Fortnam is {{a skilled}} guitarist and bass guitarist, specialising in nylon-string acoustic guitar (which he {{plays in a}} style drawing both on classical techniques {{and the work of}} Nick Drake) and also sings. He is best known as the leader, conductor and principal composer of the North Sea Radio Orchestra, but also leads the smaller band Arch Garrison and was previously a key member of several other bands, most notably The <b>Shrubbies</b> and Lake of Puppies.|$|R
5000|$|By this time, Delicate AWOL {{had also}} {{established}} {{themselves as a}} significant band within the London math rock scene, sharing stages and audiences with bands such as The Monsoon Bassoon, Rothko, The <b>Shrubbies</b> (featuring future North Sea Radio Orchestra members), Geiger Counter, Billy Mahonie and others. For a while, they also ran their own club night, [...] "Everywhere Is Mouse", {{in the basement of}} Helter Skelter music bookstore in Denmark Street. The event attracted performers including The Monsoon Bassoon, Stewart Lee and Al Murray (performing as part of a band), Keith Burstein and others.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2004, Torabi officially {{replaced}} Poole as Cardiacs' second guitarist, and made his formal debut as a full group member at the annual London Astoria concert on 12 November (Poole {{would go on to}} concentrate on , various Wildhearts-related projects, Crayola Lectern and others). A number of other new members were drafted into the Cardiacs line-up at the same time – [...] three backing singers (Claire Lemmon and Melanie Woods of Sidi Bou Said, plus former <b>Shrubbies</b> and current North Sea Radio Orchestra singer Sharron Fortnam) and two percussionists – Cathy Harabaras and Dawn Staple – playing mostly bass drums. (The official status of most of these additional members remains unclear, although Sharron Fortnam is known to have left the band.) ...|$|R
25|$|Highway529A is a {{short route}} with travels between Bayfield Inlet and Highway529 at Manbert. The route begins at the {{entrance}} to Bayfield Lodge in the middle of Bayfield Inlet. It travels east along the north shore of the inlet before penetrating briefly into the forest, then emerging into a grassy knoll. Shortly thereafter it enters a <b>shrubby</b> grassland and zig-zags northeast and southeast, eventually transitioning into a thick forest. Occasionally, large granite outcroppings of the Canadian Shield create breaks in the growth.|$|E
25|$|The eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) was {{introduced}} to New England in the late 1800s and has expanded its range {{at the expense of}} the native New England cottontail. The species originally came from the south. By the 1930s, New England cottontails were still considered more numerous than the eastern cottontail, but both species were declining as farms reverted to forests; found in <b>shrubby</b> and open areas, often in disturbed areas. Hammonasset Beach State Park has many of them; in the early evening, 30 to 40 can be found along the entrance road.|$|E
25|$|They are {{adapted to}} an {{exceptionally}} harsh continental climate, where practically no {{other species of}} tree is a rival; except for the Holm oak, which occupies some of the old, deforested juniper groves, and the European black pine (Pinus nigra) which can accompany it with a certain frequency. The common juniper (Juniperus communis subsp. hemisphaerica) is habitually a secondary species of these groves. At high altitudes, they {{come in contact with}} forests of Scots pine and with the Savin juniper; the latter sometimes forming part of the <b>shrubby</b> stratum.|$|E
50|$|A potted Kentia palm sold in modern-day {{garden centers}} {{generally}} does not consist of one palm but 2 to 5, planted in clusters as seedlings {{to give the}} plant a <b>shrubbier</b> look. They remain relatively expensive to purchase, because the export of seeds from Lord Howe Island is strictly controlled, the germination rate for seeds is low, and the plant is a slow grower, requiring years of nurturing to reach salable size. In Europe Kentias are primarily nursery-grown in Holland and then sold throughout the continent. They are more popular, less expensive, and easier to purchase in European countries {{than they are in}} the United States, where much of the commercial growing is done in Hawaii before plants are brought to the mainland.|$|R

5000|$|Moving to London, Richard formed {{rock band}} Magnilda with himself on lead vocals and guitar - other members {{included}} future {{television and radio}} presenter Iain Lee (bass, vocals) and Cardiacs roadie [...] "Captain" [...] John Hook (drums). Magnilda displayed Richard’s taste for complex and witty songs using advanced harmony (at this point, in a more straightforward indie-rock context) and tongue-in-cheek humour. Sometimes compared to mid-period XTC, they produced one cassette demo (Clocks Are Like People) and played concerts alongside (among others) The Monsoon Bassoon and The <b>Shrubbies</b> (the latter featuring various ex-Cardiacs and future North Sea Radio Orchestra members). The band {{came to an end}} in late 1998/early 1999, partly due to Lee’s increasing commitment to The 11 O'Clock Show.|$|R
25|$|New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) — native but now {{relatively}} uncommon {{since in}} most places the eastern cottontail has replaced it; {{it appears to be}} more common in the west-central and southeastern parts of the state; generally found in <b>shrubby</b> wetlands and forests with dense plant life near the ground. Another possible reason for the decline of this species could be the loss of areas with suitable ground cover, which protects the animals from predators. Loss of farmland to forests is thought to have reduced the population since the 1930s, when New England cottontails were still thought to outnumber eastern cottontails.|$|E
25|$|Unique in {{sense of}} not fitting {{into any of}} the above categories. The {{parentage}} of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from P.fulgidum, but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique’, also known as or ‘Rollinson’s Crimson’, in the mid-19th century is also claimed. Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being <b>shrubby</b> and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, {{as a result of this}} cross, are much more floriferous.|$|E
25|$|The Mendocino cypress differs {{little from}} C. goveniana in morphology, {{with the most}} {{conspicuous}} difference in herbarium material being the usually glossy black seeds, unlike the dull brown seeds of C. goveniana, but even this character is not constant, with dull brown seeds found in the southernmost populations of C. pigmaea near Point Arena. Preliminary genetic studies have shown some differences, with notably some plastid sequences (matK, rbcL, and trnL) suggesting a possible closer relationship to C. macrocarpa, though other sequences confirm its close relationship to C. goveniana. In cultivation together with C. goveniana, it retains a very different crown shape, with a tall slender crown, contrasting with the broad, <b>shrubby</b> crown of C. goveniana; it also has darker green foliage (paler, yellow-green in C. goveniana).|$|E
40|$|The Middle Rio Grande of New Mexico is {{the most}} extensive, {{remaining}} bosque, or cottonwood forest in the southwest. Alterations caused by humans—damming and channeling the river, controlling floods, and planting non-native trees—have disrupted the cycles of the earlier ecosystem. Without periodic flooding, native cottonwoods cannot regenerate. Invasive exotic plants such as Tamarisk, also known as salt cedar, and Russian olive have filled in the gaps and open spaces, increased fuel loads, and continue to replace native trees and shrubs after wildfires. Cottonwoods, not a fire-adapted species, are now at risk from wildfire and replacement by invasive plants. An array of fuel treatments applied to study sites reduced invasive woody plants in the bosque. Resprout rates for exotic trees were low overall. Survival rates of transplanted native plant species were high. Restoration had various effects on birds, animals, amphibians, and reptiles of the bosque. Species that prefer a more open, less-cluttered habitat benefited, and their numbers increased. Species that prefer a closed, <b>shrubbier</b> habitat altered by invasives declined. By applying treatments, the team worked to restore New Mexico’s Middle Rio Grande bosque, the most extensive...|$|R
50|$|Guitarists (and {{principal}} composers) Dan Chudley and Kavus Torabi have sporadically {{worked together}} on several projects sharing much of the sound and spirit of their previous band. The first of these was Miss Helsinki, a 2003 band with Richard Larcombe (bass, from Stars In Battledress) and with James Keddie drumming when available: {{the sound of the}} group was similar to that of The Monsoon Bassoon, but minus the woodwind/reeds and with considerably simpler song structures. Miss Helsinki only ever played one short gig and released only one song ("I Felt Your Arms Around Me", which appeared on the Useless In Bed Volume 1 released by the tiny independent label House of Stairs) as well as having been released on Soundcloud. https://m.soundcloud.com/chudleylecorre/miss-helsinki-i-felt-your-arms. In 2005 Chudley, Torabi and Jamie Keddie reunited in a new rock band called Authority, this time with Craig Fortnam (North Sea Radio Orchestra), The <b>Shrubbies,</b> Lake Of Puppies playing bass. The band played several London concerts {{over the next two years}} and recorded several songs (available on their MySpace and Soundcloud http://www.soundcloud.com/chudleylecorre pages), but folded amicably in 2007 due to the members’ other commitments. Chudley and Torabi have continued an occasional musical collaboration via the mainly acoustic psychedelic project Hatchjaw and Bassett https://m.soundcloud.com/chudleylecorre/blinkered-hatchjaw-and-bassett.|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was thirty}} quid {{to hire a}} church in the City of London, so I thought, I know, we'll just do gigs in city churches, and it'll be like this weird thing, this funny band who play in churches. And the music I wrote, I was really aware of the {{acoustic}} potential, so some songs were definitely written so I could have this amazing piano chord that just goes 'ching!' and just let it ring for a bit. It's {{just a way of}} creating your own world, isn't it? Nobody else is doing that, so that's half the battle — doing something different." [...] Craig Fortnam on the early City of London church concerts Members of NSRO for the first concert included the Fortnams, percussionist Hugh Wilkinson, cellist/composer Harry Escott and organist/composer James Larcombe (of Stars In Battledress), all of whom would continue in the ensemble long-term. Other performers included Nick Hayes (clarinet). Inspired by the success of the first few concerts, the NSRO began to expand (ultimately becoming a twenty-person ensemble). While the instrumentalists were mostly drawn from the classical world, the vocal chorus contained former <b>Shrubbies</b> concert-mates and collaborators from the Fortnams’ time on the London art rock circuit. These included current and former members of Stars In Battledress, The Monsoon Bassoon and Sidi Bou Said. Stars In Battledress frontman Richard Larcombe (brother of James) also shared some lead vocal parts with Sharron Fortnam. Later on, the Fortnam's former Lake Of Puppies bandmate William D. Drake joined the ensemble as chorus singer and occasional solo pianist.|$|R
