5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of <b>suspended</b> <b>solids,</b> measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} alum and glutinous rice flour as dual {{coagulant}} on the removals of colour and <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> from stabilized leachate were investigated. A series of jar test {{were conducted by}} optimizing the dose and pH of single coagulant (alum and glutinous rice flour) and its combination.

40|$|Forest {{harvesting}} activities, if not carefully carried out, can {{disturb the}} forest soils {{and can cause}} significant <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> concentration increases in receiving water. This study examined how harvesting, following forestry guidelines, influenced <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations and loads in the receiving water of a blanket peat salmonid catchment. The study site comprised of two forest coupes of 34 -year-old conifers drained by a first-order stream. The upper coupe was not felled and acted as a baseline ‘control’ catchment; the downstream coupe was completely harvested in summer 2005 and served as the ‘experimental’ catchment. Good management practices such as {{the proper use of}} brash mats and harvesting only in dry weather were implemented to minimize soil surface disturbance and streambank erosion. Stream flow and <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> measurements at an upstream station (US) and a downstream station (DS) in the study stream commenced over a year before felling took place. The <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations, yields and release patterns at US and DS were compared before and after harvesting. These showed that post-guideline harvesting of upland blanket peat forest did not significantly increase the <b>suspended</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations in the receiving water and the aquatic zone need not be adversely affected by soil releases from sites without a buffer strip.

25|$|Usually the pressed juice {{will require}} some {{additional}} treatment, {{which can be}} done separately to the pressed juice alone or to the entire batch of wine if the pressed juice is blended with the free-run. These treatments may include acid adjustments to lower pH, extended settling periods for clarification and additional racking to remove the extra <b>suspended</b> <b>solids</b> {{and the use of}} fining agents to remove extra solids or excess tannins. Grape pulp contains a lot of pectins that create colloid coagulation with these solids that will make the wine difficult to stabilize. Some winemakers will use pectolytic enzymes during the maceration process to help break down the cell walls to allow the release of more juice freely. These enzymes are also used with white wines to assist in clarification.
