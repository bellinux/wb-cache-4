2500|$|In general, {{atrial flutter}} should be managed {{the same as}} atrial fibrillation. [...] Because both rhythms {{can lead to the}} {{formation}} of a blood clot in the atrium, individuals with atrial flutter usually require some form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agent. [...] Both rhythms can be associated with dangerously fast heart rates and thus require medication to control the heart rate (such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers) and/or rhythm control (such as ibutilide or dofetilide). However, atrial flutter is more resistant to correction with such medications than atrial fibrillation. For example, although the class III antiarrhythmic agent ibutilide is an effective treatment for atrial flutter, rates of recurrence after treatment are quite high (70-90%). [...] Additionally, there are some <b>specific</b> <b>considerations</b> particular to treatment of atrial flutter.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Court of Appeal {{rejected}} Vellama's appeal on {{the preliminary}} ground {{of a lack}} of standing, it went on to consider the substantive issues raised. Disagreeing with the High Court's judgment, the Court of Appeal interpreted Article 49(1) of the Constitution as providing that the Prime Minister does not have unfettered discretion in deciding whether or not to call a by-election when a casual vacancy in an SMC arises. Noting the absence in Article 49(1) of a specific time frame within which a parliamentary vacancy must be filled, the Court held that the Prime Minister must do so with [...] "all convenient speed" [...] in line with the common law concept of reasonable time. However, given the polycentric nature of the decision, the Court felt it was undesirable to lay down <b>specific</b> <b>considerations</b> or factors which would determine whether the Prime Minister had or had not called a by-election in reasonable time.|$|E

2500|$|Cancers are {{generally}} considered {{a class of}} abnormal, fast growing and disordered cells which {{have the potential to}} spread {{to other parts of the}} body. They may occur in virtually any organ or tissue. The effect of a cancer on fitness to dive can vary considerably, and will depend on several factors. If the cancer or the treatment compromise the diver's ability to perform the normal activities associated with diving, including the necessary physical fitness, and particularly cancers or treatments which compromise fitness to withstand the pressure changes, then the diver should abstain from diving until passed as fit by a diving medical practitioner who is aware of the condition. <b>Specific</b> <b>considerations</b> include whether the tumour or treatment affects organs which are directly affected by pressure changes, whether the person's capacity to manage themself in and emergency is compromised, including mental awareness and judgement, and that diving should not aggravate the disease. Some cancers, such as lung cancer would be an absolute contraindication.|$|E
2500|$|The Court drew a {{parallel}} between the common law concept of a reasonable time with that of [...] "all convenient speed" [...] in section 52 of the IA, {{and concluded that the}} Prime Minister is required to take into account all circumstances relevant to the act to be carried out, and this is not limited to logistical factors but also other policy matters including the physical well-being of the country. Two examples of such relevant considerations were the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in Singapore and the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which was affecting Singapore at the time the vacancy arose. However, the Court did not wish to lay down <b>specific</b> <b>considerations</b> or factors that the Prime Minister is entitled to take into account. This was because it felt that the timing for the holding of an by-election is a dynamic issue and no predetermination of such considerations would be warranted.|$|E
2500|$|This, the Court of Appeal said, {{means that}} a {{by-election}} must be called within a reasonable time, taking into account all relevant circumstances. However, it is [...] "impossible to lay down the <b>specific</b> <b>considerations</b> or factors which would have a bearing on {{the question as to}} whether the Prime Minister has acted reasonably for not... calling a by-election to fill a vacancy", because when a by-election should be held is a [...] "polycentric matter which would involve considerations which go well beyond mere practicality and the Prime Minister could justifiably take into account matters relating to policy, including the physical well-being of the country". Therefore, although [...] "the Prime Minister's discretion as to the timing of an election to fill a casual vacancy is subject to judicial review, it is in the nature of such a fact-sensitive discretion that judicial intervention would only be warranted in exceptional cases". The Court also mentioned it is unnecessary to hold a by-election if the Prime Minister intends to call for a general election [...] "in the near future".|$|E
