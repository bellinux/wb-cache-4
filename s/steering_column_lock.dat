40|$|Many {{automotive}} {{electronic systems}} {{must be developed}} using a safety process. A preliminary hazard analysis is a first and {{an important step in}} such a process. This experimental study evaluates two methods for hazard identification using an electrical <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> <b>lock</b> system. Both methods are found to be applicable for hazard identification in an automotive context. It is also concluded that the induction with the failure modes method is less time consuming and easier to use than the method based on induction with generic low level hazards. Further, two proposals are presented to improve efficiency and consistency, reuse of generic hazards by component profiles and a domain specific catalogue of vehicle phases...|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has successfully collaborated {{to release the}} ISO 26262 standard for developing safe software for cars. The standard describes in detail how to conduct hazard analysis and risk assessments to determine the necessary safety measures for each feature. However, the standard does not concern threat analysis for malicious attackers or how to select appropriate security countermeasures. We propose the application of ISO 27001 for this purpose and show {{how it can be}} applied together with ISO 26262. We show how ISO 26262 documentation can be re-used and enhanced to satisfy the analysis and documentation demands of the ISO 27001 standard.

40|$|Abstract: The fitting of {{security}} devices to motor vehicles {{has become an}} important approach to the prevention of motor vehicle crime. In cars, manu-facturers have focused primarily on improving perimeter security to prevent breaking-in to the vehicle, and installing devices to prevent parked vehicles from being unlawfully driven away. The <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> <b>lock</b> Is an Important example of this approach, being {{the outcome of the}} first and only regulations requiring vehicles to befitted with anti-theft devices. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first country to Introduce such regulations, In 1961, followed nearly ten years later by the U. S. and Britain. This paper examines the effect of these regulations on motor vehicle crime In each of these countries. The evidence from all three countries is that steering column locks have helped to bring vehicle theft, particularly theftfor temporary use, under control for lengthy periods. The paper provides evidence that the speed with which the vehicle population has been protected by steering column locks, and the availability of other types of vehicles notprotected by such anti-theft devices, are Important issues in explaining theft patterns...|$|E

50|$|The vehicle {{name was}} {{introduced}} in 1955 and applied to Mercury's premium automobile line. Ford historians are at a loss as to where the name originated; {{the consensus is that}} it's taken from the upper class community of Montclair, New Jersey. For 1955 and 1956, Montclairs featured Mercury's best appointments, extra chrome trim, and different two-tone paint combinations to set them apart from other Mercury products. 1956 was the year that Ford introduced its Lifeguard safety program, and the Mercury Montclair came standard with a deep-dish steering wheel to help protect the driver from the <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> safety door <b>locks,</b> a breakaway rear view mirror, and optional seat belts and padded dashboards.

There was also a stripped-down Polara Special available as either a 4-door sedan or station wagon. 1970 was the last year that the Polara would be available in a convertible body style (with a scant 842 produced, making it extremely rare today), and Dodge would never again offer a full-sized convertible. Also exceptionally rare for 1970 was the [...] "medallion" [...] rear bumper. This bumper featured in all of the sales literature was discontinued after late August or early September 1969 production and replaced with a plain bumper lacking the center Fratzog medallion. Despite the fanfare, Dodge dropped the [...] "Super-Lite" [...] option {{at the end of the}} 1970 model year because of lack of consumer interest and various challenges to its legality in certain states. 1970s also received a new <b>locking</b> <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> which <b>locked</b> the <b>steering</b> wheel and <b>column</b> shift lever when the key was removed.The Polara Special disappeared for 1971, but a new sub-series was the Polara Brougham positioned above the Polara Custom, but still a step below the Monaco, the Polara Brougham was available only as a hardtop coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan.|$|R
2500|$|The 1969 Caprice {{and other}} {{full-sized}} Chevrolets were restyled with new body lines and front bumpers that {{wrapped around the}} grille (again with optional concealed headlights, for which headlight washers could be added as a new [...] "one year only" [...] option) along with ventless front windows on all models. The [...] wheelbase, inner bodyshell and framework were carried over from the 1965 model. The station wagon was renamed the Kingswood Estate and continued to use exterior wood grain trim along with [...] the interior trim of the Caprice sedans and coupes. Front seat headrests were now standard equipment to meet federal safety standards and the ignition switch moved from the dashboard to the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> and also <b>locked</b> the steering wheel when the key was removed.

50|$|The Dart was {{refreshed}} for 1970 with {{front and}} rear changes designed to bring the car closer to the design themes found in Dodge’s full-size vehicles through grille and contour changes. In the rear, the Dart’s new rectangular tail lights were set into a wedge-shaped rear bumper design continuing the angled trailing edge of the new deck lid and quarter panels. The revised rear styling did not change the 14.1 cubic ft trunk space of the 1969 model. 14-inch wheels became standard equipment, and the 170 cuin L slant-6 {{was replaced by a}} larger 198 cuin L version for improved base-model performance and greater manufacturing economy—the 198 used the same block as the 225, while the 170 had used a different block. Changes to the fuel system improved drivability, economy and emission control. Part-throttle downshift was added to the 8-cylinder automatic transmissions. In compliance with FMVSS 108, side marker lights and reflectors were installed at all four corners. 1970 Darts for the US and Canadian markets were built in Canada at the Windsor, Ontario or Los Angeles, California assembly plant. All 1970 Darts got the federally mandated <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> and ignition <b>lock.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial ful lment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering. Johannesburg, May 2014 Race vehicles depend mainly on passive safety systems, such as the steel collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> investigated in this report. There is no existing literature that investigates alternate impact testing methods that meet the F ed eration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) requirements. In this study, the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were statically crushed to determine the e ect of residual stresses. The <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were observed to collapse on themselves, as the top surface deformed, the 90 bends unfolded, and the 50 bends folded further on the side supports. The reduced residual stresses in the 90 bends after stress relief annealing, resulted in a strengthening e ect and therefore a larger bending moment was required to unfold the bend. The residual stresses did not greatly a ect the overall strength and energy absorption characteristics of the <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> because the deformation of the 90 bends only contributed a small percentage towards the energy absorption ability of the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> In conclusion, zero residual stresses in cold bent steel plates are desired if the plate is being unfolded as the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> collapses, however residual stresses can be useful if the plate is being bent further. The quasi-static approximation {{has been reported to}} be suitable if the impact mass is much larger than the impact structure. The quasi-static approximation was used to calculate the acceleration-time history of each tested specimen from the static compression tests. Numerical simulation of the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> impact test illustrated that the impact mass and <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> experienced a series of high frequency collisions. This phenomenon was due to the momentum transfer between the impact mass and <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> i. e. the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> locally accelerated away from the impact mass, it then slowed down as the energy was absorbed which allowed the impact mass to again collide with the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> The numerical simulation and experimental results showed good correlation after having been digitally ltered using a low pass digital lter with a cuto frequency of 1000 Hz as per Le Mans regulations. The quasi-static approximation was found to give excellent agreement with the digitally ltered results, however due to its nature it could not replicate the high speed oscillatory behaviour. In conclusion, the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> under investigation was found to be inertia sensitive, and the quasi-static approximation may only be used to evaluate the energy absorption characteristics of the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> on its own according to the FIA requirements...|$|R

40|$|Several {{parts of}} {{automotive}} <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> are fixed by both dimensional interference and mechanical-plastic sticking of one part to another. To determine {{the effect of}} these fixing procedures on the joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> pull-out tests were performed. Samples with and without sticking were tested. The influence of the sticking and interference procedures on the integrity of the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> was experimentally determined by force-distance curves. The results suggested that the sticking increases more than twice the pull-out force and augments about 24 % the absorbed energy in the whole pull-out process. Statistical fitting tests show that pull-out forces obey a log-normal distribution. From these data were possible to estimate the structural reliability of joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> which results indicate that the fail probability is close to zero for a minimum pull-out force of 2000 N. This work allows for knowing the importance of the sticking procedure in the fixation of automotive pieces, and establishing new standards for the assembly of <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> in mechanical and statistical basis...|$|R
