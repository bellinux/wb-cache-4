5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein <b>structure</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{homology}} model {{is dependent on the}} {{quality of the}} sequence alignment and template structure. The approach can be complicated by the presence of alignment gaps (commonly called indels) that indicate a structural region present in the target but not in the template, and by structure gaps in the template that arise from poor resolution in the experimental procedure (usually X-ray crystallography) used to solve the <b>structure.</b> <b>Model</b> quality declines with decreasing sequence identity; a typical model has ~1–2 Å root mean square deviation between the matched Cα atoms at 70% sequence identity but only 2–4 Å agreement at 25% sequence identity. However, the errors are significantly higher in the loop regions, where the amino acid sequences of the target and template proteins may be completely different.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a model management system to support combat <b>modeling</b> is discussed. <b>Structured</b> <b>modeling</b> is introduced as a formalism for representing mathematical models. A relational information resource dictionary system is developed which can accommodate <b>structured</b> <b>models.</b> An implementation is described. <b>Structured</b> <b>modeling</b> is then compared to Jackson System Development (JSD) as a methodology for facilitating discrete event simulation. JSD is currently better at representing the dynamic aspects of simulation whereas <b>structured</b> <b>modeling</b> excels in representing the static aspects. A <b>structured</b> <b>model</b> of an existing combat model is presented. Finally, recommendations are made to strengthen <b>structured</b> <b>modeling</b> {{as a tool for}} discrete event simulation.

Density <b>structure</b> <b>models</b> {{are required}} in some geophysical applications, such as geodynamic modeling (e.g., Hager et al., 1985). In such applications, because of uncertainties in the available density <b>structure</b> <b>models,</b> the density heterogeneities {{have often been}} derived by scaling (multiplying some constants as functions of depth) the velocity heterogeneities in tomography models. I have followed this procedure here.|$|R
2500|$|Proteins {{are often}} thought of as {{relatively}} stable structures that have a set tertiary structure and experience conformational changes {{as a result of}} being modified by other proteins or as part of enzymatic activity. However proteins have varying degrees of stability and some of the less stable variants are intrinsically disordered proteins. These proteins exist and function in a relatively 'disordered' state lacking a stable tertiary structure. As a result, they are difficult to describe in a standard protein <b>structure</b> <b>model</b> that was designed for proteins with a fixed tertiary structure. Conformational ensembles have been devised as a way to provide a more accurate and 'dynamic' representation of the conformational state of intrinsically disordered proteins. Conformational ensembles function by attempting to represent the various conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins within an ensemble file (the type found at the [...] ).|$|E

Traditionally, bond graphs have always been used to describe continuous [...] time physical processes with a fixed structure.
