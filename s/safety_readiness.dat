Prior to 11 September 2001 or 9 / 11, {{much of the}} public <b>safety</b> <b>readiness</b> responsibility was limited to a few government officials. Today, public safety is much more widely managed. For this effort, we developed a strategic partnership between state and local government and Purdue University that provides an improved environment for learning and for public health and safety. By using an exercise deployment Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in a Point of Distribution (POD) exercise, our efforts with partnering between state and local government and the university provide benefits and opportunities to each. Simultaneously, we tested a full scale POD mass prophylaxis response to an anthrax attack through teaching and training university students who also gain valuable internship-like experience. The ongoing relationship between government and the university's student talent can benefit all in developing paths for future research and data analysis expected of academia and of improving public safety and responsiveness of government...|$|E
40|$|According to the Advanced Life Support (ALS) Program Plan, the Systems Modeling and Analysis Project (SMAP) has two {{important}} tasks: 1) prioritizing investments in ALS Research and Technology Development (R&TD), and 2) guiding {{the evolution of}} ALS systems. Investments could be prioritized simply by independently ranking different technologies, but we should also consider a technology's impact on system design. Guiding future ALS systems will require SMAP to consider many aspects of systems engineering. R&TD investments can be prioritized using familiar methods for ranking technology. The first step is gathering data on technology performance, <b>safety,</b> <b>readiness</b> level, and cost. Then the technologies are ranked using metrics or by decision analysis using net present economic value. The R&TD portfolio can be optimized to provide the maximum expected payoff {{in the face of}} uncertain future events. But more is needed. The optimum ALS system can not be designed simply by selecting the best technology for each predefined subsystem. Incorporating a new technology, such as food plants, can change the specifications of other subsystems, such as air regeneration. Systems must be designed top-down starting from system objectives, not bottom-up from selected technologies. The familiar top-down systems engineering process includes defining mission objectives, mission design, system specification, technology analysis, preliminary design, and detail design. Technology selection is only one part of systems analysis and engineering, and it is strongly related to the subsystem definitions. ALS systems should be designed using top-down systems engineering. R&TD technology selection should consider how the technology affects ALS system design. Technology ranking is useful but it is {{only a small part of}} systems engineering...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to analyse the technical and human reliability in the man-vehicle system. The reliability of the whole system is given by the individual reliabilities of technical subsystems and human operators. In the analysis of <b>safety</b> and <b>readiness</b> of technical systems, {{it is necessary to}} monitor human effects on the reliability, <b>safety</b> and <b>readiness</b> of these systems, which directly put people’s lives at risk. The human operator influences the safety and reliability of the whole system by his actions and operation of the device. The quantitative evaluation of human reliability is based on an overall probabilistic safety analysis. Since drivers directly control the means of transport, the human operator’s reliability is entirely determining for the overall reliability of the system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{rationale}} behind {{this study is}} the increasing research on relationships between patient safety, evidence based practice and person centered care, and the growing interest in outcomes of surgical patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the <b>safety</b> climate and <b>readiness</b> to implement evidence-based and person centered care as perceived by registered nurses in Swedish surgical care. METHODS: The design was an exploratory, cross-sectional survey carried out in a national Swedish context. Data were collected through the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ - Short form) and the Context Assessment Index (CAI). RESULTS: In total, 1570 questionnaires were distributed, of which 727 were returned, giving a response rate of 46. 3  %. The results revealed that in general, the safety climate in Swedish surgical care is positively related to readiness for evidence-based and person centered care, although specific management and cultural factors may be more sensitive and represent targets for improvement. CONCLUSION: This study presents new knowledge regarding the <b>safety</b> climate and <b>readiness</b> to implement evidence based practice and person centered care in general surgical wards in university hospitals and indicates important associations between these two areas. While RNs generally reported positive job satisfaction and a good team work culture in their units, there were indications that improvements in organizational management are needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe some of the factors that are being considered by NASA in the selection of the Space Station Propulsion System. The paper describes briefly several design alternatives under consideration. The emphasis of this paper is on understanding the criteria being used by NASA, rather than a quantitative evaluation of the design alternatives. Four system evaluation criteria are suggested: cost, <b>safety,</b> technical <b>readiness,</b> and opportunities for station evolution. Within the cost criteria, the impact of the design alternatives on maintenance and resupply costs is discussed. Safety is suggested to be determined more by the nature of the propellants than the possible loss of the propulsion function. Technical readiness is primarily an evaluation of the risk of schedule delay, more than a concern over a showstopper in the development of any of the systems. Finally, the opportunity for station evolution is described in terms of the development of an oxygen/hydrogen economy for the Space Station...|$|R

30|$|At present, {{the overall}} {{coordination}} {{of the disaster}} management system in Cameroon lies with the DDES at the MINATD. This is the only nodal agency for disaster management in Cameroon. The intervention strategy of the DDES is expected to focus on three main complementary approaches. Before disasters, {{it is expected to}} promote disaster preparedness, prevention, and mitigation mainly through information, awareness-raising, sensitization, and education and other activities that would promote a culture of <b>safety</b> and <b>readiness</b> in the community—hence the establishment of contingency plans during the predisaster phase (Bang 2013). It is expected to initiate an emergency intervention plan during the crisis phase and coordinate the implementation of emergency response programs (sectoral contingency plans) for efficient and effective disaster management. Such activities include the on-the-spot coordination of emergency responses, search and rescue operations, and the supervision of the activities of local crisis commission. After disasters they are charged with performing activities relating to compensation and rehabilitation of affected populations, disaster and hazard risk assessment, reconstruction through the crisis commission, and the communication of risk zones. The approach so far indicates a marked disregard for the first phase, which unfortunately should be the one emphasized as it involves DRR.|$|R
40|$|Personnel aboard U. S. Naval vessels face risk of {{occupational}} injury and illness.

Due {{to the nature of}} this type of risk, there are many opportunities to improve <b>safety</b> and <b>readiness</b> and {{to reduce the number of}} workdays lost to injury. For the period from CY 94 - CY 98 there are 627 HAZMAT mishaps involving 820 personnel onboard U. S. Navy surface ships. HAZMAT root causal factors are identified through the evaluation of Special Case Mishap Reports maintained by the Naval Safety Center. 89 % of these mishaps are attributable to human error. Failure to use personal protective equipment (30. 0 %) and failure to recognize a hazardous situation (24. 6 %) are the primary reasons given for the mishaps. Comparisons are made between HAZMAT, electrical shock and back injury mishaps. While minor differences exist between these types of mishaps, overall there are many commonalities that may be observed. Most are relatively minor as classified by severity, occur aboard Carriers, and involve personnel in the E- 3 to E- 5 rank range. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

In safety messaging vehicles will message each other over wireless media, updating each other on traffic conditions and hazards. Security is an important aspect of safety messaging, that aims to prevent participants spreading wrong information in the network that are likely to cause mishaps. Equally important is the fact that secure communication protocols should satisfy the communication constraints of VANETs. VANETs are delay intolerant. Features like high speeds, large network size, constant mobility etc. induce certain limitations in the way messaging can be carried out in VANETs.

Records of class A, B and C afloat mishaps during March 1997 - March 2002 from the NSC were the primary data source for this study. Our major objectives in analyzing this data were to identify: (1) METOC related mishaps (MRMs); (2) the costs of these mishaps; and (3) the phenomenological and operational conditions under which these mishaps occurredWe identified 166 MRMs during the study period. The major average costs of these mishaps were: (1) 1. 5 deaths per year; (2) 16 days of lost duty per MRM; (3) 11 days of light duty per MRM; (4) 150 days of lost or light duty per year due to MRMs involving small boat operations; and (5) $ 54, 000 in equipment damage per MRM.

As a result of corrosion, millions of dollars of valuable assets are lost every year and the need for war readiness is jeopardized. Many different preservation products have been evaluated over the years and consequently utilized. This last initiative was for the evaluation of Vapor Corrosion Inhibitor (VCI) products and systems in deep storage 1 and preservation for war readiness materials (WRM). VCIs are chemical compounds having significant vapor pressures that allow vaporization of the molecules and subsequent adsorption of these on metallic surfaces 2. The advantage of VCIs is that the vaporized molecules can reach inaccessible areas commonly found in electronic enclosures, between metal junctures and similar other systems including fluid reservoirs. VCIs have the ability to effectively prevent corrosion of dissimilar metals and provide a desirable effect in protecting metals from corrosive atmospheric elements. The USAF criteria and requirements, test details itself and the results obtained will be described in this paper.

40|$|Because the International Space Station is {{a closed}} {{environment}} with rotations of astronauts and equipment that each introduce their own microbial flora, {{it is necessary}} to monitor the air, surfaces, and water for microbial contamination. Current microbial monitoring includes labor- and time-intensive methods to enumerate total bacterial and fungal cells, with limited characterization, during in-flight testing. Although this culture-based method is sufficient for monitoring the International Space Station, on future long-duration missions more detailed characterization will need to be performed during flight, as sample return and ground characterization may not be available. At a workshop held in 2011 at NASA's Johnson Space Center to discuss alternative methodologies and technologies suitable for microbial monitoring for these long-term exploration missions, molecular-based methodologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were recommended. In response, a multi-center (Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Kennedy Space Center) collaborative research effort was initiated to explore novel commercial-off-the-shelf hardware options for space flight environmental monitoring. The goal was to evaluate quantitative or semi-quantitative PCR approaches for low-cost in-flight rapid identification of microorganisms that could affect crew safety. The initial phase of this project identified commercially available platforms that could be minimally modified to perform nominally in microgravity. This phase was followed by proof-of-concept testing of the highest qualifying candidates with a universally available challenge organism, Salmonella enterica.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFor Naval aircraft, the largest portion of Operating and Support (O&S) costs is consumed by maintenance. The {{effort to reduce}} O&S costs {{is part of a}} Naval Air Systems Command initiative termed Affordable Readiness. Innovative programs are being implemented under Affordable <b>Readiness</b> to maintain <b>safety,</b> sustain <b>readiness,</b> and reduce costs. One program, Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC), is being developed for the Navy H- 60 helicopter. IMC calls for depot-level artisans to be collocated at each squadron facility rather than at a central facility. Integrating appropriate organizational level maintenance tasks with germane subsets of the depot level tasks is the essence of the H- 60 IMC. Reduced aircraft maintenance costs and out-of-service time are the major benefits of IMC. As part of the transition to IMC, current organizational, intermediate and depot maintenance requirements are being reviewed for applicability and effectiveness. The result of this review will be a new listing of justified preventive maintenance tasks. The tasks will then be grouped into admissible maintenance evolutions that attempt to minimize total aircraft out- of-service time. This thesis explores the potential synergism inherent to certain preventive maintenance task groupings that can lead to an overall reduction in aircraft out-of-service time. A prototypic optimization-based decision support model is developed. The solution presented is in terms of total cost in hours to perform all required tasks over a given time horizon. Additionally, the optimal task groupings are identified. Together, these results are insightful for developing a preventive maintenance program[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|In 2008, {{when food}} prices rose precipitously to record highs, {{international}} attention and local policy {{in many countries}} focused on safety nets {{as part of the}} response. Now that food prices are high again, the issue of appropriate responses is again on the policy agenda. This note sets out a framework for making quick, qualitative assessments of how well countries'safety nets prepare them for a rapid policy response to rising food prices should the situation warrant. The framework is applied using data from spring 2011, presenting a snap?shot analysis of what is a dynamically changing situation. Based on this data <b>safety</b> net <b>readiness</b> is assessed in 13 vulnerable countries based on the following criteria: the presence of safety net programs, program coverage, administrative capacity, and to a lesser degree, targeting effectiveness. It is argued that these criteria will remain the same throughout time, even if the sample countries affected will be expected to vary. Based on thisanalysis the note highlights that though a number of countries are more prepared than they were in 2008, there is still a significant medium term agenda on safety net preparedness in the face of crisis. In this context, strategic lessons from the 2008 food crisis response are presented to better understand the response options and challenges facing governments and policy makers.

This paradigm refocuses traditional, process-based approaches to assurance on demonstrating explicitly stated assurance goals, emphasizing the use of structured rationale, and concrete product-based evidence as the means for providing justified confidence that systems and software are fit for purpose in safely achieving mission objectives. NASA has also been embracing assurance cases through the concepts of Risk Informed Safety Cases (RISCs), as documented in the NASA System Safety Handbook, and Objective Hierarchies (OHs) as put forth by the Agency's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA).
