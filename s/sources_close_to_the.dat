5|$|Nagarjuna's {{younger son}} Akkineni Akhil was rumoured {{to be making}} a cameo {{appearance}} following Nageswara Rao's request. <b>Sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film's unit initially denied those reports. Samantha later tweeted that Akhil appeared for shooting his portions in the film. When his health conditions worsened, Nageswara Rao asked Nagarjuna to bring the dubbing equipment to dub for his role fifteen days before his surgery as he did not want any other artist to do it if his voice worsened. He completed those activities just before he died on 22 January 2014. Only an appearance in a song remained incomplete.|$|E

Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing Winehouse in her home or the homes of her friends and relatives. According to a newspaper report, <b>sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> singer said legal action {{was taken out of}} concern for the safety of Winehouse and those close to her.|$|E

The selection earned praise from the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations, but was not well received by business groups and the anti-union group Center for Union Facts. The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19. Solis's successor was chosen in a special election in California's 32nd congressional district; she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary (from which her past mentee Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election).|$|E

5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million for the delay of the production start date. <b>Sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> director insist that the budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E
5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. <b>Sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E

25|$|In February 2005, {{the results}} from the {{administrative}} inquiry were published. The experts pointed out that there was no single fault, but rather a number of causes for the collapse, in a design that had little margin for safety. The inquiry found the concrete vaulted roof was not resilient enough and had been pierced by metallic pillars and some openings weakened the structure. <b>Sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inquiry also disclosed that the whole building chain had worked as close to the limits as possible, so as to reduce costs. Paul Andreu denounced the building companies for having not correctly prepared the reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|One issue {{treated as}} {{secondary}} at the inquiry was the {{presence in the}} flight deck observer's seat of Captain Collins. The Lane report recommended greater caution in allowing off-duty flight crew members to occupy flight deck seats, and aired speculation that Collins might have been distracting his colleagues. The report noted that Collins' body {{was found to be}} holding a can of aerosol air freshener in its right hand. <b>Sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> events of the time suggest that Collins played an altogether more positive role by attempting to lower the leading-edge devices in the final seconds of the flight; Eric Pritchard, a Trident captain who happened to be the first airman at the accident site, recalled that a fireman had stated that Collins was lying across the centre pedestal and noted himself that his earphones had fallen into the right-hand-side footwell of the flight deck, diagonally across from the observer's seat, as might be expected if he had attempted to intervene as a last resort.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} able to secure the rights to allow the [...] "This Too Shall Pass" [...] Rube Goldberg video to be {{distributed}} via embedding prior to its premiere, {{in part due to}} funding support from State Farm Insurance, which helped to settle issues with EMI; in exchange, State Farm had some say in the creative process, and the video includes elements with the State Farm logo, including a toy truck that is used to start the machine. The video was completed a week later than expected; according to <b>sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band, Capitol Records considered the window of opportunity for promoting the single to radio to be closed due to the delay, and would not be available again until June 2010. [...] The band has since decided to break away from the EMI label on amiable terms, due to a combination of the issues of video embedding and radio promotions, and has become its own independent recording label, Paracadute Recordings.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary chroniclers of {{the events}} in the revolt have formed an {{important}} source for historians. The chroniclers were biased against the rebel cause and typically portrayed the rebels, {{in the words of the}} historian Susan Crane, as [...] "beasts, monstrosities or misguided fools". London chroniclers were also unwilling to admit the role of ordinary Londoners in the revolt, preferring to place the blame entirely on rural peasants from the south-east. Among the key accounts was the anonymous Anonimalle Chronicle, whose author appears to have been part of the royal court and an eye-witness to many {{of the events}} in London. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham was present for much of the revolt, but focused his account on the terror of the social unrest and was extremely biased against the rebels. The events were recorded in France by Jean Froissart, the author of the Chronicles. He had well-placed <b>sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> revolt, but was inclined to elaborate the known facts with colourful stories. No sympathetic accounts of the rebels survive.|$|E

500|$|Music {{supervisor}} Ivan Pavlovich said [...] " [...] to {{pick the}} songs that make New York today what it is, but make sure they won't feel dated {{by the time the}} game comes out." [...] The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights. They even hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band's song [...] "Walk the Night". Citing <b>sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deals, Billboard reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per master recording per track. Developers originally considered letting players purchase music by going to an in-game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player, but both ideas were cut. DJ Green Lantern produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7. Record label owner and record producer Bobby Konders, who hosts the in-game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96.9, went through the extra effort of flying to Jamaica to get dancehall artists to re-record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City.|$|E
500|$|Six {{months after}} Martínez Pérez's slaying, the Veracruz {{authorities}} stated that her murder {{was also a}} crime of passion. According to the reports, Domínguez was the alleged boyfriend of the journalist. On April 2013, Proceso stated that it had received classified information that its senior editor who was covering the investigation, Jorge Carrasco, was a possible target by corrupt Veracruz officials. Reportedly, members of the administration of Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa were allowed to carry out [...] "hostile actions against the reporter {{in response to his}} most recent publication on the Regina Martínez case." [...] <b>Sources</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> news magazine alleged that officials were plotting to kill the reporter {{while he was in the}} nation's capital, Mexico City. The Veracruz authorities responded by stating that the accusations were false and asked Proceso to provide evidence for its claims. The governor promised that he would investigate the threats, and the journalist went into hiding with several armed bodyguards. That same month, Silva was sentenced to 38 years and 2 months in prison for the murder. The judge also ordered the murderer to pay roughly $8,000 USD in reparations for her death and the stolen possessions. Proceso, however, expressed its doubt on the murder case and trial once again, stating that they did not believe the court was sentencing the right man.|$|E
