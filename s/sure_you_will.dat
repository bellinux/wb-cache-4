25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>will</b> readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
2500|$|The general low {{tone and}} sordid flavor {{of this story}} makes it, in our judgment, {{thoroughly}} unacceptable for screen presentation before mixed audiences in the theater. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> {{agree that it is}} most important…to avoid what the code calls [...] "the hardening of audiences," [...] especially those who are young and impressionable, to the thought and fact of crime.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the Emperor tells Virgil of the {{disastrous}} end to several similar matches {{he has seen}} in his long life, and makes him an offer: He will endorse the gramophone—which will lead to enormous sales and profits for Virgil—only if he breaks up with Johanna. Virgil refuses, highly insulted, but the Emperor asks him one more question: Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be enough for her? ...|$|E

I have not completed my inspection yet, but I am almost certain as to the kind of a report I will make; and I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be satisfied with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The attack did {{not change}} Britain's stance toward an Anglo-American {{agreement}} on Palestine, which was then in its concluding phase. In a letter dated July 25, 1946, Prime Minister Attlee wrote to American President Harry S. Truman: [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> agree that the inhuman crime committed in Jerusalem on 22 July calls for the strongest action against terrorism but having regard to the sufferings of the innocent Jewish victims of Nazism this should not deter us from introducing a policy designed {{to bring peace to}} Palestine with the least possible delay." ...|$|E
2500|$|I am {{well aware}} that American {{enterprise}} has made available reprints of the official papers relating to the present European war; but the original British prints of these publications may not be accessible to those persons of influence who would study them for a true history of the conflict. [...] I am venturing to send to you under another cover several of these official documents. [...] I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not consider this an impertinence, but will realize that Britishers are deeply anxious that their cause may be judged from authoritative evidence.|$|E

2500|$|The 3rd Olympic Festival {{took place}} in the Zoological Gardens on 9 July 1864, having been {{postponed}} from a week earlier due to bad weather, and was formally opened by Sir John Jones. In his address he said inter alia [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> excuse me if I bring to your notice the name of an individual who has exerted himself on behalf of the Athletic Club in a manner not to be exceeded – I mean Mr. John Hulley. (Loud cheers.) You are indebted to him for the club which has been established at Liverpool; you are indebted to him for these festivals, and as far as my knowledge goes, the most indefatigable exertions for the promotion of physical education have been displayed by him".

2500|$|The album {{has been}} noted for still {{standing}} up today as a [...] "varied and highly entertaining listen" [...] and the band themselves remain proud of the album. Both drummer Don Powell and Holder rate it as their favourite Slade long player. In a 1987 interview, Holder said: [...] "That {{is the only one}} I can really sit down at home and listen to from start to finish." [...] In a 1976 interview, Lea said: [...] "I am really proud of the album and believe it is the best album we have ever done. I have no especial favourite track on the album - I love them all. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> see quite an American influence on a lot of the tracks and we believe the hard work we put in, in America had paid dividends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coles ran for {{governor}} in the election of 1822. To his great surprise, he won the election by a very tight margin, defeating Chief Justice Joseph Philips (an ally of Judge Jesse Thomas and prominent slavery advocate {{in his own right}} who eventually returned to Kentucky), Associate Justice Thomas C. Browne(the eventual candidate of the Ninian Edwards faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, [...] "As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|While she was {{studying}} English and American literature at Cornell University, Maud {{first met her}} future husband L. Frank Baum at 678 W. Onondaga St., the house of his sister Harriet Baum Neal, and her husband, William Neal. Her roommate, Josie Baum, was Frank's cousin and urged her to meet Frank. During an 1881 Christmas party, Josie's mother, Josephine, walked {{hand in hand with}} Maud to Frank and introduced them to each other, saying, [...] "This is my nephew, Frank. Frank, I want you to know Maud Gage. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> love her." [...] Frank replied, [...] "Consider yourself loved Miss Gage", whereupon Maud countered, [...] "Thank you, Mr. Baum. That's a promise. Please see that you live up to it." [...] Not a week elapsed before Frank was certain he was drawn to her; however, she had other beaus. The two were merely friends when she continued her second year in college and Frank went back to working in the theater. On May 15, 1882, Maud traveled to Syracuse to watch Frank perform in The Maid of Arran. In the summer of that year, Frank paid frequent visits to Maud by using his father's horse and buggy to travel eight miles from his theater company in Syracuse to Maud's house in Fayetteville. Not only in awe of Maud's beauty, Frank was also captivated by her poise and sagacity. For Maud, as she {{wrote in a letter to}} a friend, Frank was [...] "very handsome and attractive".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>will,</b> it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E

[...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E
