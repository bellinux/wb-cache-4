5|$|It was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend's first self-developed game. The game idea came from <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and Wohlwend applied a grayscale color palette from {{his first year in}} art school. When Flash game sites did not purchase the title, he open sourced the code. Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad, which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company's Adam Saltsman, who became the primary puzzle designer.|$|E
2500|$|Gleeson {{also played}} senior {{football}} at 16, only {{for his life}} to change inexorably two years later when his back was crushed by a hydraulic door at a Warrnambool abattoir. He subsequently spent six weeks in hospital. Gleeson said of that time, [...] "I spent six weeks in hospital <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> That was pretty much my sporting career done. Sport was {{a huge part of}} my life and that was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through." [...] That accident was the coaching catalyst for Gleeson. In 1990 at just 22, Gleeson became the coach of the Warrnambool Mermaids in the Country Victorian Invitational Basketball League (CVIBL). In his first season as coach, he guided the Mermaids to the championship. In 1992, he was appointed Head Coach of the Warrnambool Seahawks, a position he held for two years. In 1993, he earned the role of Head Coach of the Victorian Basketball All Star Team.|$|E

6000|$|There was one {{of those}} you-could-have-heard-a-pin-drop silences. Psmith was <b>staring</b> reflectively <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Mr. Downing was looking as if at any moment he might say, [...] "Thwarted to me face, ha, ha! And by a very stripling!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Though unsatisfactory, my {{research}} {{has not been}} entirely barren," [...] he observed, <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. [...] "Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Verloc, on her back, and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> made a remark.|$|E
60|$|My {{stricken}} employer {{was lying}} on his back, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and our entrance did not at first cause him to change this position.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was silent}} for a time, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> She held some water to his lips and he drank eagerly. Finally he said in a faint voice: ...|$|E
60|$|Betty {{had looked}} so wild and pale <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{announcement}} of her husband's approaching visit, that Mrs. Dornell, somewhat uneasy, {{could not leave}} her to herself. She peeped through the keyhole an hour later. Betty lay on <b>the</b> sofa, <b>staring</b> listlessly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
60|$|Some seconds he {{remained}} on his back, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> whitewashed <b>ceiling</b> {{and listening to}} the patter of the rain against his window. Then, as his mind gathered up the threads of recollection, he leapt from his bed and made haste to assume a garment or two.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, me boy?" [...] {{the major}} asked, with languid curiosity, puffing at his weed and <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smoke-blackened <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ann Veronica {{was lying}} on her bed in a darkling room <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> She {{reflected}} before answering. She was frightfully hungry. She had eaten little or no tea, and her mid-day meal had been worse than nothing.|$|E
60|$|The well mouth {{cleared away}} its mist again, {{and he saw}} more clearly. Part {{of the time he}} knew he was in bed <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Part of the time the well mouth {{remained}} closed in with clouds.|$|E
60|$|The red-haired {{girl was}} lying {{down in her}} own room, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The {{footsteps}} {{of people on the}} pavement sounded, as they grew indistinct in the distance, like a many-times-repeated kiss that was all one long kiss. Her hands were by her side, and they opened and shut savagely from time to time.|$|E
50|$|Later that day, 24 {{years after}} his crime, Hill was {{executed}} through lethal injection {{by the state of}} Florida, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida. He did not reply when asked if he had a last statement, <b>staring</b> straight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> awaiting start of the lethal injection.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} struck at Lincoln's face, and incontinently a negro had him by collar and arm. He {{wrenched}} himself away, his sleeve tore noisily, and he stumbled back, to be tripped {{by the other}} attendant. Then he struck the ground heavily and he was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> hall.|$|R
60|$|On {{the floor}} {{against the wall}} {{was a pair of}} Indian clubs. He picked these up and {{examined}} them owlishly. He gave them little tentative jerks. Finally, with the air of a man carrying out a great resolution, he began to swing them. He swung them in slow, irregular sweeps, his eyes the while, still glassy, <b>staring</b> fixedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly honour is {{more than}} life," [...] replied Mermes, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> perhaps to hide the look upon his face, [...] "and {{for a little while}} Rames seems to be in the way of it. But those who are set high have far to fall, O Queen, and--forgive me--he is my only child. Now when Pharaoh recovers----" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lavender {{passed his}} three days, therefore, in perfect repose, feeding Blink, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and conversing with Joe. An uneasy {{sense that he}} had been lacking in {{restraint}} caused his mind to dwell on life as seen by the monthly rather than the daily papers, and to hold with his chauffeur discussions of a somewhat philosophical character.|$|E
60|$|I {{think at}} this moment poor old Tuppy must have got a sudden touch of cramp. He had been sitting hard by, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and he now gave a sharp leap like a gaffed salmon and upset a small table {{containing}} a vase, a bowl of potpourri, two china dogs, {{and a copy of}} Omar Khayy√°m bound in limp leather.|$|E
60|$|Dea Flavia {{had thrown}} {{herself on the}} couch on her back; her arms were folded behind her head, her fair hair lay in heavy masses on the {{embroidered}} coverlet. She was <b>staring</b> straight up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> her blue eyes wide open, and a puzzled frown across her brow.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> name Pico started, {{and there}} was a {{movement}} as of fear from the three grooms who followed him. The Count looked down at that splendid, blood-spattered figure lying there so still, its sightless eyes <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> frescoed <b>ceiling,</b> so brave and so pitiful in his gold-broidered suit of white satin, with the richly jewelled girdle carrying gloves and purse and a jewelled dagger that had been so useless in that extremity.|$|R
60|$|He went {{straight}} to Roderick's apartment, deeming this, at an early hour, the safest place to seek him. He found him in his sitting-room, which had been closely darkened {{to keep out the}} heat. The carpets and rugs had been removed, the floor of speckled concrete was bare and lightly sprinkled with water. Here and there, over it, certain strongly perfumed flowers had been scattered. Roderick was lying on his divan in a white dressing-gown, <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> frescoed <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> room was deliciously cool, and filled with the moist, sweet odor of the circumjacent roses and violets. All this seemed highly fantastic, and yet Rowland hardly felt surprised.|$|R
60|$|She looked {{round at}} him, and as fortune would have it, his {{appearance}} {{at that moment}} quite confirmed my assertion. He was lounging {{back in his chair}} with an air of indolence rather too marked for a drawing-room, and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with the expression {{of a man who has}} just been asked a conundrum. Madame Scarabelli seemed struck with his attitude.|$|E
6000|$|Sherlock Holmes {{had pushed}} away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe {{which was the}} {{companion}} of his deepest meditations. [...] "I wonder!" [...] said he, leaning back and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> [...] "Perhaps there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let us consider {{the problem in the}} light of pure reason. This man's reference is to a book. That is our point of departure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, sir!" [...] cried Mr. Lavender, {{running his}} hands {{through his hair}} and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> [...] "I feared this might seem {{inconsistent}} to your logical German mind. But {{there are many things}} we public men would never do if we could see them being done. Fortunately, as a rule we cannot. Believe me, when I leave you I shall do my best to save you from a fate which I perceive to be unnecessary." ...|$|E
50|$|Mr. Jaffee then tells Thomas {{that one}} of the real reasons he came to the bathhouse is that it is the first anniversary of his 16-year-old son's death. Mr. Jaffee {{delivers}} a disturbing monologue about his son who drowned while swimming in an upstate lake which led to the disintegration of his marriage. Mr. Jaffee spooks Thomas even more when he tells him that his appearance reminds him of his young son. Just then, Miss Parrish and Mavis, and Taffy and Thumbelina, burst into the room looking for a party, when Thomas angrily tells them to leave, which they do. Mr. Jaffee then tells Thomas that he wants to give him a gift and tells him not to leave for he will return soon. After Mr. Jaffee leaves the room again, Thomas sits on his bed for seemingly a long time, smoking a cigarette, and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> black <b>ceiling,</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> steam vapors in <b>the</b> room, and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> obscene and vulgar graffiti on the walls. Just then, the two couples return to the room with a wrapped package in which Thomas again tells them to leave and asks the whereabouts of Mr. Jaffee. The four men tell Thomas that Mr. Jaffee got dressed and left, but he asked them to deliver the package to him. Thomas opens it up to find a paper sunflower. Thomas tells the guys to leave him alone, and he sits on his bed and cries over his seemingly abandonment.|$|R
60|$|All {{these details}} I {{observed}} afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discoloured <b>ceiling.</b> It {{was that of}} a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.|$|R

60|$|A {{short time}} {{afterwards}} Rowland saw {{the young man}} whom she had rejected leaning against a doorway. He was ugly, but what is called distinguished-looking. He had a heavy black eye, a sallow complexion, a long, thin neck; his hair was cropped en brosse. He looked very young, yet extremely bored. He was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and stroking an imperceptible moustache. Rowland espied the Cavaliere Giacosa hard by, and, having joined him, asked him the young man's name.|$|E
60|$|At {{sight of}} this Sue's nerves utterly gave way, an awful {{conviction}} that her discourse {{with the boy}} had been {{the main cause of}} the tragedy, throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no abatement. They carried her away against her wish to a room on the lower floor; and there she lay, her slight figure shaken with her gasps, and her eyes <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> the woman of the house vainly trying to soothe her.|$|E
60|$|They were a {{battered}} and a draggled company, some with dark circles beneath their eyes, others blooming with the unnatural scarlet of the make-up {{which they had}} been too tired to take off. The Duchess, haughty to the last, had fallen asleep with her head on the table. The red-headed Babe was lying back in her chair, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The Southern girl blinked like an owl at the morning sunshine out on the boardwalk.|$|E
