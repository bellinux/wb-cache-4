Totalai Game Reserve has a {{peculiar}} combination of avian fauna. A survevy of avian fauna at Totalai Game Reserve was conducted during November to April (2012 - 2013). In this survey 4 avian species were identified, all these 4 species belong to order Galliformes and family phasianidae. These 4 <b>species</b> are, <b>Grey</b> partridge (Francolinus pondicerianus), Black partridge (Francolinus francolinus), Chukar partridge (Alectores chukar), Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix). Among these 4 <b>species</b> <b>Grey</b> partridge (Francolinus pondicerianus) is the richest species of the Game Reserve, and Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) found in low number. The elevation of Totalai Game Reserve ranges from 2500 ft- 6000 ft and Alectoris chukar is found mostly at elevation of 2500 ft or higher than 2500 ft, but other three species are mostly found in plain areas of Totalai Game Reserve...|$|R

50|$|The western {{coastline}} of the island, {{including the}} cliffs, {{has been identified}} as a 360 ha Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it is home to one of the largest colonies of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses in the world, with about 19,000 pairs constituting some 20% of the world population, and about 240 pairs of sooty albatrosses. There is also a large colony of northern rockhopper penguins, with 25,000 pairs. Two <b>species,</b> <b>grey</b> and soft-plumaged petrels, which have become rare on the island due to predation by rats and cats, are thought to breed in the IBA. There is a large rookery of subantarctic fur seals in the IBA. Ten endemic arthropods have been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>species</b> has <b>grey</b> {{forewings}} with bold black dagger-shaped markings. (The Latin {{specific name}} also refers to these markings, as resembling the Greek letter psi ψ.)

This moth {{is very similar}} to the dark dagger (Acronicta tridens) and identification is generally only possible by minute examination of the genitalia. However, in general this moth is generally darker in colour than the dark dagger and always lacks the white hindwings often present in the male of that <b>species.</b> The <b>grey</b> dagger flies at night from June to August [...] and is attracted to light and sometimes to sugar.|$|R
