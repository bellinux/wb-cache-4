40|$|We publish 16 Doppler imaging {{temperature}} {{maps for}} the years 1994 - 2002 of the active RS CVn star II Peg. The six maps from 1999 - 2002 are based on previously unpublished observations. Through Doppler imaging we want to study the spot evolution of the star and in particular compare this with previous results showing a cyclic spot behaviour and persistent active longitudes. The observations were collected with the SOFIN spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. The temperature maps were calculated using a Doppler imaging code based on Tikhonov regularization. During 1994 - 2001, our results show a consistent trend in the derived longitudes of the principal and secondary temperature minima over time such that the magnetic structure appears to rotate somewhat more rapidly than the orbital period of this close binary. A <b>sudden</b> <b>phase</b> <b>jump</b> of the active region occured between the observing seasons of 2001 and 2002. No clear trend over time is detected in the derived latitudes of the spots, indicating that the systematic motion {{could be related to}} the drift of the spot generating mechanism rather than to differential rotation. The derived temperature maps are quite similar to the ones obtained earlier with a different methods, the main differences occurring in the spot latitudes and relative strength of the spot structures. We observe both longitude and latitude shifts in the spot activity of II Peg. However, our results are not consistent with the periodic behaviour presented in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|A {{very fast}} phase angle {{estimation}} algorithm for a single-phase system under a <b>sudden</b> <b>phase</b> angle <b>jump</b> condition is proposed in this work.

In this work, a method of estimating the fundamental component and the phase angle of the source voltage without a significant delay is presented, by using the weighted least-squares estimation (WLSE) method with the covariance resetting technique.

40|$|Abstract. Wavelet {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} analyze polar motion spanning the years 1890 - 1997. First, the wavelet ransform is used to identify the components (prograde and retrograde) present in the data. This wavelet transform is subsequently used to filter and reconstruct each component. Then we define the ridge of the wavelet transform and show {{how it can be}} used to detect rapid <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> in a signal. This technique is applied to the reconstructed prograde Chandler wobble component, and several features characteristic of <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> are identified. Synthetic signals with adjustable <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> (in terms of their dates, durations, and amplitudes) are constructed to produce ridge functions similar to the one obtained for the Chandler wobble. We find that less than 10 <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> are necessary to reproduce the observed features. All but one <b>phase</b> <b>jump</b> have durations between I and 2 years, and their dates are found to remarkably follow those of geomagnetic jerks with a delay not exceeding 3 years. Elementary statistical tests assign a high probability to the correlation between the dates of the <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> and those of the jerks.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a free-electron laser {{can be enhanced}} by sustaining {{the growth of the}} radiation power beyond the initial saturation. One notable method is undulator tapering, which involves the variation of the gap height and/or the period along the undulator. Another method is the introduction of <b>phase</b> <b>jumps,</b> using phase-shifting chicanes in the drift sections separating the undulator segments. In this article, we develop a physics model of this <b>phase</b> <b>jump</b> method, and verify it with numerical simulations.

A sudden change in active load will cause both a <b>phase</b> <b>jump</b> and a magnitude fluctuation in the bus voltage, whereas reactive load changes mainly affect the voltage magnitude.

Simulation and experimental results verify the compensation schemes by showing that a StatCom with energy storage can significantly reduce <b>phase</b> <b>jumps</b> and magnitude deviations of the bus voltage.
