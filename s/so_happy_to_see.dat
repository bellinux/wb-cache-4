2500|$|Balachander and {{his unit}} could not trace Sulakshana who {{disappeared}} from the film scene 12 years ago. So they decided to kill Bhairavi's character and keep her as a photograph in the serial. As it transpired, Sulakshana {{found out about the}} sequel from the newspapers and contacted Balachander.

I am happy to act as Bhairavi. She is still the same soft person. The only difference is she is older and the mother of two children. There is more understanding between JKB and Bhairavi now -- she doesn't fight with him". Carnatic singer Anuradha Krishnamoorthy, who has never acted before, will play Sindhu. When contacted by Minbimangal, a surprised Anuradha was reluctant to accept the offer. [...] "My initial reaction was I am not interested in acting. I am a professional singer. I had absolutely no plans to act. I told them I needed time to think. It was my husband's gentle persuasion that made me meet K Balachander. Once I met him, I was struck by his simplicity.

40|$|In this issue, we {{lead off}} {{with a look at}} how water {{softener}} backwash affects the performance of onsite wastewater treatment systems (page 7). There have been some scientific studies done, {{and there are plenty of}} people with years of field experience in observing and working with these effects, including engineers and system manufacturers. We have pulled these together to create a picture of a controversial subject about which much is not known. I grew up in a hard water situation, and I’m glad we had a water softener. I am also a proponent of onsite wastewater treatment, and <b>so</b> I’m <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the two technologies can work together. The fact that the two technologies don’t always work together is something that concerns me. If we are going to successfully manage decentralized onsite wastewater treatment, we need to be able to identify the combinations of soil and system types that work in conjunction with water softener backwash. People are searching for alternatives to fossil fuels as sources of energy in a number of industries, from home heating to fueling cars. Wastewater treatment is no exception, and in this issue (page 12), we are offering a few examples of treatment technologies that have put the power of the sun and wind to use. We are also offering the example of Sedgwick County, Kansas, as an excellent model to consider for any community that is faced with the interrelated problems of failing septic systems and changing land use (page 15), and a look into the current status and future of national water and wastewater infrastructure security and emergency response planning (page 20). We’re covering a lot of ground, so have a good read...|$|R

50|$|Terry {{arrives in}} Albert Square in October 1996, {{looking for his}} children, Tiffany and Simon (Martine McCutcheon and Andrew Lynford). Terry was once a {{successful}} estate agent, but lost his fortune when the housing market collapsed in the 80s. He began drinking heavily and his behaviour towards his family became abusive and violent. His marriage to Tiffany and Simon's mother deteriorated. Eventually she left him and her children. Prior to his arrival, Terry tries writing to his children, telling them that his alcohol abuse has resulted in him being hospitalised with pancreatitis. Tiffany is unsympathetic and refuses <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. Terry's alcoholism and abusive behaviour meant his children had severed their ties with him long before his arrival. In the past, he had beaten Simon and had pushed Tiffany down the stairs when she was pregnant, causing her to miscarry, <b>so</b> neither are <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Terry on his arrival in Walford. Terry is furious to discover that his daughter is pregnant and disgusted {{to find out that}} his son is gay. After much rowing, Tiffany's boyfriend, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), frightens him away. Terry continues to drink heavily and is warned by doctors that if he doesn't stop, he will soon be dead. He decides to make another attempt at a reconciliation with his children and returns to Walford in August 1997; arriving on the day Tiffany and Grant are having their marriage blessed. After getting completely drunk, and making a scene, Terry is sent packing once again.|$|R
60|$|Our friend Brock, or Wood (whose actions {{we love to}} {{illustrate}} by the very handsomest similes), possessed this genius in common with his Grace; and was never <b>so</b> <b>happy,</b> or <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>so</b> much advantage, as when he was employed in setting people by the ears. His spirits, usually dull, then rose into the utmost gaiety and good-humour. When the doubtful battle flagged, he by his art would instantly restore it. When, for instance, Tom's repulsed battalions of rhetoric fled from his mamma's fire, {{a few words of}} apt sneer or encouragement on Wood's part would bring the fight round again; or when Mr. Hayes's fainting squadrons of abuse broke upon the stubborn squares of Tom's bristling obstinacy, it was Wood's delight to rally the former, and bring him once more to the charge. A great share had this man in making those bad people worse. Many fierce words and bad passions, many falsehoods and knaveries on Tom's part, much bitterness, scorn, and jealousy on the part of Hayes and Catherine, might be attributed to this hoary old tempter, whose joy and occupation it was to raise and direct the domestic storms and whirlwinds of the family of which he was a member. And do not let us be accused of an undue propensity to use sounding words, because we compare three scoundrels in the Tyburn Road to so many armies, and Mr. Wood to a mighty field-marshal. My dear sir, when you have well studied the world--how supremely great the meanest thing in this world is, and how infinitely mean the greatest--I am mistaken if you do not make a strange and proper jumble of the sublime and the ridiculous, the lofty and the low. I have looked at the world, for my part, and {{come to the conclusion that}} I know not which is which.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps {{you think}} that Captain Wybrow, who {{knew that it would}} be ridiculous to dream of his marrying Caterina, must have been a {{reckless}} libertine to win her affections in this manner! Not at all. He was a young man of calm passions, who was rarely led into any conduct of which he could not give a plausible account to himself; and the tiny fragile Caterina was a woman who touched the imagination and the affections rather than the senses. He really felt very kindly towards her, and would very likely have loved her--if {{he had been able to}} love any one. But nature had not endowed him with that capability. She had given him an admirable figure, the whitest of hands, the most delicate of nostrils, and a large amount of serene self-satisfaction; but, as if to save such a delicate piece of work from any risk of being shattered, she had guarded him from the liability to a strong emotion. There was no list of youthful misdemeanours on record against him, and Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel thought him the best of nephews, the most satisfactory of heirs, full of grateful deference to themselves, and, above all things, guided by a sense of duty. Captain Wybrow always did the thing easiest and most agreeable to him from a sense of duty: he dressed expensively, because it was a duty he owed to his position; from a sense of duty he adapted himself to Sir Christopher's inflexible will, which it would have been troublesome as well as useless to resist; and, being of a delicate constitution, he took care of his health from a sense of duty. His health was the only point on which he gave anxiety to his friends; and it was owing to this that Sir Christopher wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his nephew early married, the more so as a match after the Baronet's own heart appeared immediately attainable. Anthony had seen and admired Miss Assher, the only child of a lady who had been Sir Christopher's earliest love, but who, as things will happen in this world, had married another baronet instead of him. Miss Assher's father was now dead, and she was in possession of a pretty estate. If, as was probable, she should prove susceptible to the merits of Anthony's person and character, nothing could make Sir Christopher <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> as <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a marriage which might be expected to secure the inheritance of Cheverel Manor from getting into the wrong hands. Anthony had already been kindly received by Lady Assher as the nephew of her early friend; why should he not go to Bath, where she and her daughter were then residing, follow up the acquaintance, and win a handsome, well-born, and sufficiently wealthy bride? ...|$|R
