5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's <b>stories</b> <b>and</b> his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care.
