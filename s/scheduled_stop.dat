5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a <b>scheduled</b> <b>stop</b> and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
5|$|The Duke's train had {{run more}} slowly through {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and North Star, had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for almost an hour, and the water stop at Parkside was the only <b>scheduled</b> <b>stop</b> on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterházy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race on Sunday, Hamilton got away slowly but was able to keep both Pérez and Räikkönen behind him while Rosberg {{retained}} the lead. Further back, Fernando Alonso made contact with Felipe Nasr and then crashed into Pastor Maldonado, who was forced to retire. Alonso needed to pit for a new front wing and was later given a drive-through penalty, dropping him {{to the end of the}} field. Meanwhile, Nico Hülkenberg and Sebastian Vettel made up places, sitting in fifth and twelfth respectively after the first lap. Valtteri Bottas on the other hand lost positions, finding himself in tenth. Rosberg soon built a lead of over one second, giving Hamilton no chance to deploy DRS for an overtake manoeuvre. By lap 5, both Kvyat and Nasr had come into the pits for the harder compound tyre, followed by Ricciardo, Massa and Pérez one lap later. On lap seven, both Hülkenberg and Sainz Jr. made pit stops. While Hülkenberg was able to stay ahead of Massa, Sainz's stop was unfortunate and he lost time due to a problem with the tyre change. Another two laps later, Valtteri Bottas pitted and was sent out into the path of Button, damaging his front wing, which he needed to replace the following lap. He also received a five-second penalty to be served at his next <b>scheduled</b> <b>stop.</b> The leaders pitted for new tyres around laps ten and eleven, with the order now being Rosberg ahead of Vettel, who was yet to stop, Hamilton, and Räikkönen. Romain Grosjean, who started on the harder tyres just as Vettel, was up to sixth.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher lapped {{consistently}} in the 1:26 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to extend his lead over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who in turn was 9.9 seconds in front of Zonta. Verstappen in fourth was a further 2.9 seconds behind, but was drawing ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 23, Zonta became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop and emerged in eleventh position. Salo continued {{to move up the}} field when he passed Wurz for sixth on lap 25. Three laps later, Zonta moved into ninth position after he overtook Mazzacane and Diniz. Salo made a pit stop for the second time on lap 29 and emerged in tenth place. Verstappen took his pit stop three laps later and came out in seventh position. Zonta made his third and final pit stop of the race on lap 36 and dropped to eighth position. Michael Schumacher took his pit stop on lap 39 and rejoined 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who now led the race. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a pit stop and rejoined behind Michael Schumacher with a deficit on eleven seconds. Fisichella was the final driver to make a <b>scheduled</b> <b>stop</b> on lap 44. Fisichella's pit stop was problematic: he stalled when he encountered a problem with his clutch system and his mechanics push-started his Benetton and he rejoined in eleventh.|$|E
5|$|Vettel and Alonso traded fastest laps as {{they pushed}} hard {{in their efforts}} to build up a {{sufficient}} lead over Webber to maintain first and second positions after their pit stops. Massa, Petrov, Buemi and Alguersuari all passed Glock on lap 17 thus eliminating the queue of cars. By lap20, Alonso was leading Vettel by 3.2 seconds; he in turn was a further 11 seconds in front of Hamilton. Button was in fourth, 20 seconds behind Alonso, with Rosberg 3.3 seconds behind the World Champion in fifth. Webber changed his engine settings to give him a higher top speed in an attempt to get past Barrichello and decrease the time gap to Hamilton on lap 22. He avoided colliding with an Armco barrier at the entry of turn eighteen one lap later. Hamilton was told to increase his pace on the 24th lap to try to stay ahead of Webber after the pit stop phase. But his car had a large amount of oversteer, as his rear, super-soft, compound tyres began to deteriorate, causing his lap times to drop off the leader's pace. Trulli drove to the pit lane and was pushed by his mechanics into the Lotus garage to retire with an hydraulic issue on lap28. Hamilton made the first <b>scheduled</b> <b>stop</b> for tyres on lap29 and re-emerged in eighth position behind Webber. Alonso and Vettel made simultaneous pit stops on the following lap; Alonso retained his lead despite Vettel's pit crew completing their pit stop first; Vettel avoided stalling and drove away in second gear. With newer tyres which provided more grip, Vettel recorded faster lap times than Alonso to close the time gap as the two came across slower cars.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 supercapacitors enabled LRV's {{to operate}} in the {{historical}} city area of Heidelberg without catenary overhead wires preserving the city's architectural heritage. The SC equipment cost an additional €270,000 per vehicle, which was expected to be recovered over the first 15 years of operation. The supercapacitors are charged at stop-over stations when the vehicle is at a <b>scheduled</b> <b>stop.</b> This approach may allow many LRV city lines to serve catenary overhead wires that are too expensive to fully route installation. In April 2011 German regional transport operator Rhein-Neckar, responsible for Heidelberg, ordered a further 11 units.|$|E
25|$|The West Japan Railway Company is {{very strict}} {{when it comes}} to punctuality, and commuters often depend on near-perfect timing on the part of trains to commute to and from work on time. This is because at {{stations}} (including the derailed train's next <b>scheduled</b> <b>stop</b> at Amagasaki Station) trains meet {{on both sides of the}} same platform to allow people to transfer between rapid and local trains running on the same line. As a result, a small delay in one train can significantly cascade through the timetable for the rest of the day due to the tightness of the schedule. Immediately after the rail crash occurred, some of the mass media pointed to the congested schedule of the Fukuchiyama Line as an indirect factor. In fact, cumulative changes over the previous three years had reduced the leeway in the train's schedule from 71 to 28 seconds over the 15minutes between Takarazuka and Amagasaki stations.|$|E
