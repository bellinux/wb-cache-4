However, in recent years, the authors of this paper have seen substantial turbine motorization projects completed or being planned in the refineries. This paper discusses the key aspects that should be considered in evaluating the feasibility of motorization projects. Based on the literature review and a refinery survey conducted by the authors, the key factors include the critical level of the related equipment, the potential energy savings and capital cost, the steam and power balance in the related area, and the reliability in the refinery's power supply. Based on the authors' experience, the utilities' energy efficiency incentive programs in California also influence the decision-making process for turbine motorization projects. Therefore, this paper includes a description of the utilities' guidelines for fuel substitution projects. In particular, the utilities' three-prong requirements on net source-BTU energy savings, cost effectiveness, and avoidance of adverse impacts to the environment are discussed. Two real life case studies are presented to demonstrate how the above criteria should be applied for determining if a motorization opportunity is economically viable.

40|$|Steam {{is highly}} used {{in most of}} the industries. There are many {{occasions}} where low pressure steam is used. Most of the times, relatively higher pressure is generated, transported and finally the pressure is reduced before use. Throttling devices are used for reducing pressure. Throttling valves or pressure reducing valves have been used for this work {{in most of the}} instances. There is a huge potential of utilizing this energy by introducing <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines.</b> If the <b>turbine</b> exhaust <b>pressure</b> can be further dropped, power generation through the steam turbine can be increased. This research project was created to cover these areas. There is no literature which can be used to calculate the power output of a turbine with known flow rates and input and output conditions. This project is aimed to give the information how much power is generated under the given conditions. This can be used for selecting a suitable <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> for the particular requirement. Giving the capital investment for such project also was an objective. It can be decided whether the selected project on retrofitting pressure reducing valves with the steam turbines is viable. There is no sufficient information on performance of thermo-compressors which can be used for increasing steam pressure. There is an objective of finding out the motive flow required for the known suction flow at known input and output conditions. As the title of the research shows, ultimate objective {{of this study was to}} see whether combining thermo-compressors to reduce <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> is feasible or not. This research project was done for five input steam conditions and six output steam conditions of the turbines. For a selected turbine, performance at known pressures was calculated. This information was graphically represented to give a clear picture. Similarly performance of thermo-compressors was calculated for known input and conditions. This information also was graphically represented. Finally the performance of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>turbines</b> were calculated when the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> dropped further by introducing thermo-compressors. Calculated values were graphically represented to check whether this was a viable option. As per the outcome of this project, guide lines were made for <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> with different input and output conditions. As the input, superheated steam varying from 10 barg at 350 deg. C up to 50 barg at 450 deg.

Guide lines were extended to show the cost of investment to retrofit pressure reducing valves with <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>turbines.</b> Guide lines were made on the amount of motive pressure consumed to increase the pressure of steam at different input and output conditions. These guidelines also were extended to show the capital investment of the installing thermo-compressors. Process steam pressures varying from 2 bara to 6 bara have been discussed against <b>turbine</b> exhaust <b>pressures</b> varying from 1 bara to 6 bara under the study of the behavior of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> combined with thermo-compressors. Further study was done to ensure whether there is any effect of the isentropic efficiency and the generator efficiency on this behavior. Finally, it was proved that there was no benefit of operating the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> at lower exhaust pressure by introducing thermocompressors and increasing the pressure before giving to the process for the pressure and temperature ranges covered in this study. Retrofitting of PRV with steam turbines seems to be an attractive option. This study discussed only the application of superheated steam. Further studies can be extended to saturated steam to use single stage steam turbines. Introducing of thermo-compressors for specific industries also can be done as a further study.

40|$|There is a {{projected}} shortage of water supply for evaporative cooling in electric power industry {{by the end}} of this century, Thus, dry and wet/dry cooling tower systems are going to be the solution for this problem. This study has determined the cost of dry cooling compared to the conventional cooling methods. Also, the savings by using wet/dry instead of all-dry cooling has been determined. A total optimization has been performed for power plants with dry cooling tower systems using metal-finned-tube heat exchangers and surface condensers. The optimization minimizes the power production cost. The program does not use pre-designed heat exchanger modules. Rather, it optimizes the heat exchanger and its air and water flow rates. In the base case study, the-method of replacing lost capacity assumes the use of gas turbines. As a result of using dry cooling towers in an 800 MWe fossil plant, the incremental costs with the use of high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> and conventional turbine over all-wet cooling are 11 % and 15 %, respectively. For a 1200 MWe nuclear plant, these are 22 % and 25 %, respectively. Since the method of making up lost capacity depends on the situation of a utility, considerable effort has been placed on testing the effects of using different methods of replacing lost capacity at high ambient temperatures by purchased energy. The results indicate that the optimization is very sensitive to the method of making up lost capacity. It is, there- fore, important to do an accurate representation of all possible methods of making up capacity loss when optimizating power plants with dry cooling towers. A solution for the problem of losing generation capability by a power plant due to the use of a dry cooling tower is to supplement the dry tower during the hours of peak ambient temperatures by a wet tower. A separate wet/dry cooling tower system with series tower arrangement has been considered in this study. In this cooling system, the physical separation of the dry and wet towers protects the dry tower airside heat transfer surface from the corrosion problem. It also allows complete freedom of design and operation of the dry and wet towers. A wet/dry cooling system can be tailored to meet any amount of water available for cooling. The results of the optimization show that wet/dry cooling towers have significant savings over all-dry cooling, For example, in either fossil or nuclear plant, the dry tower heat transfer surface of 30 % makeup water wet/dry cooling system is only about fifty percent of that in all-dry cooling using high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>turbines.</b> This results in a reduction of 27 % and 37 % of the incremental cost in the fossil and nuclear plant, respectively, over all-wet cooling. Even the availability of a small percentage of makeup water reduces the incremental cost significantly. Thus, wet/dry cooling is an economic choice over all-dry cooling where some water is available but supplies are insufficient for a totally evaporative cooling towers. On the other hand, the advantage of wet/dry cooling over evaporative towers is conservation of water consumption. Originally issued as the author's thesis (M. S.), M. I.

40|$|Post-combustion capture {{retrofits}} {{are expected}} to a near-term option for mitigating CO 2 emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. Much of the literature proposes using power from the existing coal plant and thermal integration of its supercritical steam cycle with the stripper reboiler to supply the energy needed for solvent regeneration and CO 2 compression. This study finds that using an auxiliary natural gas turbine plant to meet the energetic demands of carbon capture and compression may make retrofits more attractive compared to using thermal integration in some circumstances. Natural gas auxiliary plants increase the power output of the base plant and reduce technological risk associated with CCS, but require favorable natural gas prices and regional electricity demand for excess electricity to make using an auxiliary plant more desirable. Three different auxiliary plant technologies were compared to integration for 90 % capture from an existing, 500 MW supercritical coal plant. CO 2 capture and compression is simulated using Aspen Plus and a monoethylamine (MEA) absorption process. Thermoflow software is used to simulate three gas plant technologies. The three technologies assessed are the gas turbine (GT) with {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG), gas turbine with HRSG and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine,</b> and natural gas boiler with <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine.</b> The capital cost of the MEA unit is estimated using the Aspen Icarus Process Evaluator, and the capital cost of the external GT plants are estimated using the Thermoflow Plant Engineering and Cost Estimator. The gas turbine options are found to lead to electricity costs similar to integration, but their performance is highly sensitive to the price of natural gas and the economic impact of integration. Using a GT with a HRSG only has a lower capital cost but generates less excess electricity than the GT with HRSG and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine.</b> In order to generate enough steam for the reboiler, a significant amount of excess power was produced using both gas turbine configurations. This excess power could be attractive for coal plants located in regions with increasing electricity demand. An alternate capture plant scenario where a greater demand for power exists relative to steam is also considered. The economics of using auxiliary plant power improve slightly under this alternate energy profile scenario, but the most important factors affecting desirability of the auxiliary plant retrofit remain the cost of natural gas, the full cost of integration, and the potential for sale of excess electricity. by Sarah Bashadi.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate how the use of the 2 nd Law can help an engineer make intelligent process design decisions in a relatively simple and straightforward manner. A sensitivity to 2 nd Law inefficiencies, when used with common sense, can lead to alternative design improvements. Looking at a process from a 2 nd Law viewpoint gives the engineer a better insight into the process. As a hypothetical example we will examine a conceptual design of an industrial utility plant that generates steam used to provide process steam and power needs. A flowsheet for this plant, with energy and mass flows as well as steam conditions, is shown in Figure 1. The average manufacturing plant power requirement is projected to be 10 Mw; the interconnect with a public utility provides power for manufacturing when the requirements exceed the capacity of the plant in Figure 1. Conversely, when the capacity exceeds the manufacturing needs, the excess can be sold to the utility. For the case study at hand it is to be assumed that the cost of electricity per kwh is four times that of fuel (based on higher heating value). The plant uses a coal-fired furnace to produce steam at 100 bars pressure and 500 ?C (1450 psia and 930 ?F), and provides steam to headers for process users at 80, 40 and 4 bars (1160, 580 and 58 psia).

The implementation of biorefinery concepts is not only interesting from a diminishing fossil feedstock perspective but also as a way of creating new revenue streams for the {{pulp and paper}} industry. Production of dissolving pulp would be beneficial both due to the higher market price of the pulp but also since the hemicellulose extracted could be upgraded to value-added by-products. The conversion from Kraft to dissolving pulp production has been evaluated in a case study of Södra Cell Värö pulp mill. An energy analysis has been performed with pinch technology and the potentials for steam savings and electricity production have been quantified for different levels of process integration. It has been shown that the softwood Kraft pulp mill at Värö can be converted to a dissolving pulp mill by introducing extraction of hemicelluloses prior to the digestion step. The proposed dissolving pulp plant would not only be self sufficient energy wise but in fact be able to produce both more electricity and excess steam than today.

The same applies for the power load and the wind generation, allowing us to obtain realistic results and make better conclusions regarding the integration of wind power with the help of DH systems. Finally, one more contribution is the simulation of the DH operation with 15 -min period data in the case study and the comparison with the hourly operation. Such study has not been conducted in the previous works.|$|R
40|$|The cooling {{efficiency}} of natural draft dry cooling system (NDDCS) {{are vulnerable to}} ambient winds, so the implementation of measures against the wind effects is of great importance. This work presents the combined air leading strategies to recover the flow and heat transfer performances of NDDCS. Following the energy balance among the exhaust steam, circulating water, and cooling air, numerical models of natural draft dry cooling systems with the combined air leading strategies are developed. The cooling air streamlines, volume effectiveness, thermal efficiency and outlet water temperature for each cooling delta of the large-scale heat exchanger are obtained. The overall volume effectiveness, average outlet water temperature of NDDCS and <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> are calculated. The results show that with the air leading strategies inside or outside the dry-cooling tower, the thermo-flow performances of natural draft dry cooling system are improved under all wind conditions. The combined inner and outer air leading strategies are superior to other single strategy in the performance recovery, thus can be recommended for NDDCS in power generating units...|$|R
40|$|Cogeneration systems fired with coal {{or other}} solid fuels and {{containing}} conventional extracting-condensing or <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> {{can be found}} throughout the world. A potentially more economical plant of higher output per unit thermal energy is presented that employs a pressurized fluidized bed (PFB) and coal carbonizer. The carbonizer produces a char that is fed to the PFB and a low heating value fuel gas that is utilized in a topping combustion system. The topping combustor provides the means for achieving state-of-the-art turbine inlet temperatures and is the main contributor to enhancing the plant performance. An alternative to this fully coal-fired system is the partially coal, partially natural gas-fired air heater topping com-bustion cycle. In this cycle compressed air is preheated in an atmospheric pressure coal-fired boiler and its temperature raised further by burning natural gas in a topping gas turbine combustor. The coal fired boiler also generates steam {{for use in a}} cogeneration combined cycle. The conceptual design of the combustion turbine is presented with special emphasis on the low-emissions multiannular swirl burner topping combustion system and its special requirements and features. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCogeneration {{for power}} and {{desalination}} could not only improve the economic benefit of the power plant, but also afford the high quality water to solve the freshwater shortage. Considering the demand of power and water, a detailed mathematical model of the cogeneration system targeting the minimum total annual cost (TAC), which includes the power plant, multistage flash (MSF) and reverse osmosis (RO), is proposed and described as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The modified genetic algorithm (MGA) with mixed coding is put forward to solve the model developed by us. A case study, {{which is supposed to}} supply 250 MW of power and 12, 000 m 3 /h of water for Huangdao District of Qingdao City, is analyzed in order to illustrate the model capabilities. The results show that the operation pattern of the cogeneration system could be varied in terms of the water demand. When the water demand is lower than 8000 m 3 /h, the combination of power plant associated with MSF is adopted and the condensing-extraction steam turbine is selected. When the water demand of water is higher than 8000 m 3 /h, the tri-combination of power plant, MSF and RO is the optimal choice, in which <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> is selected...|$|R
40|$|A second law {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis of}} a natural gas-fired steam boiler and cogeneration plant at Rice University was conducted. The analysis included many components of the plant including piping, valves, boilers, turbines, piping specialties and various other pieces of equipment. Typical steady state plant operating conditions were determined based on available trending data and the resulting conditions {{are representative of the}} bulk of the plant’s operating hours. The exergy destruction from individual components in the plant was calculated based on these operating conditions to determine the true system losses. The largest source of exergy destruction within the plant was found to be the gas turbine system under typical operating conditions. Recommendations for efficiency improvement based on the analysis are discussed. The addition of a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> to the system is shown to improve the overall system efficiency from 21 % to 22. 4 % while increasing the plant power generation capacity by 9. 8 %. A reduction in the plant steam header pressure in conjunction with the addition of the steam turbine improved the overall system efficiency to 23 %, while increasing plant power generation by 12 %. In addition, a first law thermodynamic analysis was performed and first and second law efficiencies are compared for several components. Mechanical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|The {{majority}} of large scale desalination {{plants in the}} Arab Gulf Region (AGR) employ thermal desalination processes. Around 2345 MIGD of desalinated water that accounts for 77 % of the total water production in the AGR, was produced by thermal desalination processes in 2002. Due to its simplicity, reliability and huge capacity, the multistage flash (MSF) distillation process was the most dominant and frequently used process. It produced 94 % of the total production of thermal desalination processes in the Gulf region. The multi-effect distillation (MED) coupled with thermal vapor compression (TVC) accounted for 6 %. The basic evolutionary developments which were introduced in the MSF process during {{the last four decades}} such as successful scale and corrosion control techniques and increase of distiller production capacity will be reviewed. The outstanding design and operating features of MED/TVC desalination plants that are responsible for their recent market emergence and competition to the MSF desalination plants will also be reported. Thermal desalination plants are normally associated with power generation cycles. The evolutionary developments of the power/water cogeneration cycles will be discussed at length. Salient features of conventional power water cogeneration cycles in which the MSF distillation plant operates in association with either extraction or condensing or <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines,</b> or in association with combined gas /vapor power generation cycles, will be reviewed.

50|$|On June 9, 1985, a 30 in hot reheat line, under 600 {{pounds per}} square inch of pressure, burst open. The reheat line cycles <b>steam</b> <b>back</b> through the boiler stack after it has {{expanded}} through the high <b>pressure</b> (HP) <b>turbine</b> and before it reached the low <b>pressure</b> (LP) <b>turbine.</b> A 1,000-degree steam cloud blew down a door leading to the control room of the station, fatally scalding six workers: Michael Bowman, John Dolan, Ernest Hernandez, Terry Leroy, Danny Norman and Howard Turner. Ten others were injured. The station was out of service for six months while all the steam piping was replaced.|$|R
40|$|Energy use at a Kraft {{pulp mill}} in the United States is {{analyzed}} in detail. Annual average process steam and electricity demands {{in the existing}} mill are 19. 3 MMBtu per ADST and 687 kWh per ADST, respectively. This is relatively high by industry standards. The mill meets nearly all its electricity needs with a back-pressure steam turbine. Higher electricity to heat ratios is an industry wide trend and anticipated at the mill. The potential for self-sufficiency in energy using only black liquor and bark available on-site is assessed based on {{the analysis of the}} present energy situation and potential process changes. The analysis here suggests that steam and electricity demand could be reduced by 89 % by operating consistently at high production rates. Process modifications and retrofits using commercially proven technologies could reduce steam and electricity demand to as low as 9. 7 MMBtu per ADST, a 50 % reduction, and 556 kWh per ADST, a 19 % reduction, respectively. Electricity demand could increase to about 640 kWh per ADST due to closed-cycle operation of the bleach plant and other efforts to improve environmental performance. The retrofitted energy efficient mill with low environmental impact could be self-sufficient in steam and electricity using conventional technology, such as a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> or a condensing extraction steam turbine. In addition to meeting mill energy demand, about 1, 000 kWh per ADST would be available for export from the mill if gasification/combined cycle technology were used instead...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{air cooled}} {{condensers}} {{in power generation}} is increasing in many arid regions of the world. The classical A-frame condenser design is implemented in most new installations despite significant empirical evidence that such designs suffer from poor efficiencies and weather effects, and therefore provide significant scope for improvements. An inefficient condenser results in higher <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> on the <b>turbine,</b> over-sized condensers and increased fan power. This paper addresses the flow distribution from an air cooled condenser for a ∼ 400 MW gas and steam power plant. The {{results indicate that the}} flow patterns from the large scale fans results in a severe inhomogeneous distribution of cooling on the condenser fins. These region of high and low velocity are closely related to the outlet flow pattern from the fans, where in the hub region the air mass flow rate is reduced, while in the tip region it is increased. These measurements provide an excellent basis for both understanding the existing deficiencies of the A-frame designs and moreover provide direction for improved designs in the future.
