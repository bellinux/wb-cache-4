5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the Thought That We Hate as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. <b>She</b> <b>observed</b> that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E
5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago <b>she</b> <b>observed</b> that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. <b>She</b> <b>observed</b> that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, <b>she</b> <b>observed</b> that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when <b>she</b> <b>observed</b> Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because <b>she</b> <b>observed</b> cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>observed</b> {{the effects}} of the {{transposition}} of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E

25|$|Catherine Forster {{argued that}} there was no {{satisfactory}} evidence for sexual dimorphism in ceratopsids. She also joined the growing consensus that Triceratops should be classified among the long-frilled ceratopsids. Forster performed a cladistic analysis of the ceratopsids. She argued against the idea that ceratopsid frills served as attachment sites for large jaw muscles. <b>She</b> <b>observed</b> that the opening in the skull above the animal's temple seems to show the physical location extent of the jaw muscle attachment point. She supported the hypothesis that ceratopsids used their horns and frills in competition over mates.|$|E
25|$|After {{a week of}} {{exercises}} I-58 took on fuel, provisions and torpedoes, and embarked four Kaiten and their crews, before departing Kure with I-36 on 31 December 1944. Between 03:10 and 03:27 on 12 January 1945, eleven miles west of Apra, she launched all four Kaiten. The last Kaiten detonated immediately after launching, but at 05:30, as I-58 was leaving the area, <b>she</b> <b>observed</b> two pillars of smoke. She arrived at back at Kure on 22 January 1945 and was credited with sinking an escort carrier and a large oiler, but the attack was not successful.|$|E
