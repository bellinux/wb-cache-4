Cattle are also produced <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> and, in recent years, <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> to feedlots <b>for</b> fattening. [...] In irrigated areas, crops such as lettuce, pumpkins, tomatoes, garlic, corn, rockmelons, watermelons and broccoli are grown, picked and packaged in the area.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the level of reproductive performance of the Wallachian sheep in the flock of sheep bred by Jan Vejčík. At first the following parameters were evaluated in 457 ewes during the period 2007 - 2011 : fertilization, fertility, reproduction intensity, total rearing, infertility, rearing of lambs born and total mortality of lambs. Then, using statistical methods, frequency of litters and effect of age on fertility of ewes were evaluated and the identified parametres were compared with the flocks originating from the Union of sheep and goats of the Czech Republic. Finally, the economy <b>sales</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> lambs depending on fertility was assessed. The mean fertility of the flock of sheep reached 171, 77 % {{and the percentage of}} fertilization was 92, 54 %. Total breeding flock was 143, 19 %. Seven percent of the sheep was infertile, which is directly influenced by the intensity of reproduction (158, 93 %). Mortality of lambs was 10, 03 % and thus survival rate of lambs was 89, 97 %. The study shows that the longer the period of existence of a farm is, the higher the fertility of ewes is (almost 179 % in 2011). Also an increasing tendency of the number of sheep twins was recorded during the study (59 twins in 2011). This indicates good welfare of the animals and generally good health of the flock. Ewes reached the highest fertility at the age of 5 to 7 years. The indicators of fertility, reproduction and total intensity of rearing showed significant differences when compared with the flocks originating from the Union of sheep and goats of the Czech Republic. Significantly higher fertility, reproduction and overall intensity was achieved in the monitored flock The difference was not statistically significant (p > 0, 05) except for the fertilization parameter. <b>Sales</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> lambs per ewe were affected by the share of reactive sheep and total lamb mortality, this effect was, however, only about 20 % of the total dependency. Disregarding the overall mortality of lambs and reactive sheep, it would be true that higher fertility is in direct proportion with <b>sales</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> lambs...|$|R
5|$|The Sable Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Sable Island pony, is a type of small feral horse found on Sable Island, an island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first horses were released on the island in the late eighteenth century, and soon became feral. Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and <b>sale</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter,</b> which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|R

30|$|In organic farming, {{the animals}} {{have to be}} {{slaughtered}} in abattoirs which fulfil the regulations of organic farming and are certified (Leu 2014). Traditionally, the nomads consumed more milk in their diets than meat. In fact, they often express a dislike for killing and trading animals. Animals were sold to certified abattoirs or butchers directly either for cash needed for income or for culling unwanted livestock. Meat production was almost exclusively <b>for</b> <b>sale.</b> Home <b>slaughtering</b> <b>for</b> own consumption and sale to neighbours or relatives occurred only occasionally. The proportion of nomads buying animals was very low; the reason was that they usually depend on their existing animals to reproduce and increase their herd size.|$|R

50|$|Until the mid 18th century, {{economic}} development in Wales was restricted by its peripheral location, predominantly upland topography, bad communications and sparse population. Commerce was most advanced in the small coastal ports that had regular commerce with Bristol or Liverpool; the other major sources of external trading contact were the drovers, who drove cattle from Mid Wales along Drovers roads <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> and <b>slaughter</b> in the English Midlands and London's Smithfield Market from the 14th century onwards. The drovers were instrumental in establishing the first banks in Wales, such as Banc Y Ddafad Ddu ("Black Sheep Bank") in Aberystwyth.|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} environmental sites commonly contaminat-ed by avian infl uenza virus A (H 5 N 1) in live-bird {{markets in}} Indonesia, we investigated 83 markets in 3 provinces in Indonesia. At each market, {{samples were collected}} from up to 27 poultry-related sites to assess the extent of con-tamination. Samples were tested by using real-time reverse transcription–PCR and virus isolation. A questionnaire was used to ascertain types of birds in the market, general in-frastructure, and work practices. Thirty-nine (47 %) markets showed contamination with avian infl uenza virus in> 1 of the sites sampled. Risk factors were slaughtering birds {{in the market and}} being located in West Java province. Protective factors included daily removal of waste and zoning that seg-regated poultry-related work fl ow areas. These results can aid in the design of evidence-based programs concerning environmental sanitation, food safety, and surveillance to reduce the risk for avian infl uenza virus A (H 5 N 1) transmis-sion in live-bird markets. Food markets that offer both poultry meat and live birds either <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> or <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> are collectively referred to as live-bird markets (LBMs). LBMs are part of the sup-ply chain and are essential for maintaining the health and nutritional status of rural and urban populations, especially in developing countries (1, 2). However, LBMs provide op-timal conditions for the zoonotic transfer and evolution of infectious disease pathogens because they provide major contact points between humans and live animals (3, 4) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{appraisal}} of goat production in a small-holder rural farming area of Zimbabwe. A survey {{was carried out}} to evaluate goat production in a crop-livestock farming area {{in the north of}} Zimbabwe. The objectives of the study were to determine goat production systems and productivity. Qualitative information was obtained using participatory rural appraisal techniques (PRA) while quantitative data was obtained through administration of a structured questionnaire to 317 households. The major finding of the survey indicated that the predominant goat breed found was the “small” indigenous Mashona goat. The goats were reared exclusively through extensive foraging during the dry season but were herded, tethered or a combination was used during the cropping season. Flock sizes were small, averaging 12 goats/household resulting in few goats available <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> or <b>slaughter.</b> All goat sales were informal. Ninety one percent of farmers indicated interest in cross breeding Mashona does with Boer bucks to improve the size of the Mashona...|$|R
