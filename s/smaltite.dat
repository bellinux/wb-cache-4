5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral <b>smaltite,</b> quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E
25|$|The name of {{the element}} cobalt comes from the creature's name, because medieval miners blamed the sprite for the {{poisonous}} and troublesome nature of the typical arsenical ores of this metal (cobaltite and <b>smaltite)</b> which polluted other mined elements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smaltite</b> {{occurs in}} veins with ores of cobalt, nickel, copper and silver. The best known localities are Cobalt, Ontario and Schneeberg in Saxony, Germany. The name <b>smaltite</b> {{was given by}} F. S. Beudant in 1832 because the mineral {{was used in the}} {{preparation}} of smalt for producing a blue color in porcelain and glass.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smaltite</b> is {{a variety}} of the mineral skutterudite {{consisting}} of cobalt iron nickel arsenide: (Co,Fe,Ni)As2.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized zones of copper deposits. Associated minerals include: bismutite, <b>smaltite,</b> native bismuth, atelestite, erythrite, malachite and barite.|$|E

50|$|It was {{discovered}} in Skuterud Mines, Modum, Buskerud, Norway, in 1845. <b>Smaltite</b> is a synonym for the mineral. Notable occurrences include Cobalt, Ontario, Skuterud, Norway, and Franklin, New Jersey in the United States. The rare arsenide minerals are classified in Dana's sulfide mineral group, even though it contains no sulfur.|$|E
50|$|It {{is formed}} by the {{alteration}} of <b>smaltite</b> (Co,Fe,Ni)As2 and sphalerite ZnS. in oxidized zones of arsenical ores containing zinc. The type locality is the Daniel Mine (St. Daniel Mine), Neustädtel, Schneeberg District, Erzgebirge, Saxony, Germany, where it occurs in oxidized veins in a hydrothermal sulfide ore deposit, associated with roselite Ca2(Co2+,Mg)(AsO4)2·2H2O.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smaltite</b> {{crystallizes}} in the {{cubic system}} with the same hemihedral symmetry as pyrite; crystals have usually the form of cubes or cubo-octahedra, but are imperfectly developed and of somewhat rare occurrence. More often the mineral is found as compact or granular masses. The color is tin-white to steel-grey, with a metallic luster; the streak is greyish black. Hardness is 5.5 and the specific gravity is 6.5. The cobalt is partly replaced by iron and nickel, and as the latter increases in amount there is a passage to the isomorphous species chloanthite (NiAs2).|$|E
5000|$|The {{discovery}} in the Fall of 1907, involved {{the finding of}} a <b>smaltite</b> vein 2-6 inches wide containing 11,000 ounces of [...] "wire silver" [...] per ton. [...] "Wood's vein" [...] was discovered the next year. The original vein {{was developed by the}} No. 1 shaft and by 1911, Keeley Mine Limited had produced about 24,337 ounces of silver. Associated Gold Mines of Western Australia , Limited, acquired an option on the property in 1913, and a transfer of the property by 1919. The mine produced 12,154,353 ounces of silver and 1,617,784 ounces of cobalt from 1908 to 1942. No production took place between 1943 and 1963. Keeley-Frontier Mines Limited was incorporated in 1959 and reorganized as Kelley-Frontier in 1964.|$|E

30|$|Another {{dark blue}} painted layer from an {{architecture}} {{part of the}} western mural in the main hall was thicker than others. Some larger pigment grains have been detached from the painting. It might be attributed to either mechanical friction of the wooden planks or aging of the binding medium. This blue sample was found as conchoidal glassy fragments in singly polarized fields with a low refractive index (n[*]<[*] 1.662), suggesting a characterization of smalt (Figure  7 c). Smalt is an artificial, glass-like potash silicate pigment, which is strongly coloured with cobalt oxide. Concerning smalt identification, besides the optical microscopy, the elemental micro-analysis by EDX is the best method. This blue sample contains several elements, including Si (58.0 %wt), Co (4.7 %wt), K (13.4 %wt), As (11.6 %wt), Fe (4.2 %wt), Bi (4.5 %wt) and Ni (1.5 %wt). K is the trace of the manufacturing process. Elements such as As and Fe indicate the origin of CoO from the mineral cobaltite (Co, Fe)AsS, and Ni should come from the mineral <b>smaltite</b> (Co,Ni)As 3 - 2. Bi exists in line with using the cobalt ore, which is coexisted with bismutite Bi 2 (CO 3)O 2, as an original material to produce smalt in Europe [15]. Furthermore, the Raman spectrum of sample zx 1 – 8 (Figure  8 b) shows weak peaks (not sharp) at 461, 788, 1093  cm- 1, which proved the presence of smalt.|$|E
