The {{gap between}} a behaviour {{described in terms}} of Statecharts and its implementation, however, is still very large due to its intricate semantics and its main purpose as specification language.

Despite all the theoretical assessments and manufacturer’s claimed efficiency and emissions records of current vehicles, {{there is a lack of}} data concerning real life comparisons of Electric Vehicles (EV) against Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars. A test program comparing the energy consumption of an EV and a diesel powered (ICE) car was carried out. Both short (at levelled ground and 6 % up hill) and long distance tests were performed for several fixed vehicle speeds. Measurements enabling the assessment of average energy consumption, required power and energy <b>suplied</b> were performed for both vehicles. Results indicate that in terms of vehicle use (Tank to Wheel perspective) the electric powertrain is significantly more energy efficient than the Diesel powertrain, although the difference between the two is less pronounced for higher power events.

40|$|A {{distinct}} {{low energy}} cosmic-ray component {{has been proposed}} to explain the essentially constant Be/Fe ratio at low metallicities. Atomic collisions of such low energy ions produce characteristic nonthermal X-ray emission. In this paper, we study the possible contribution of such X-rays to the Galactic ridge emission. We show that they would account for < 10 % of the 10 - 60 keV luminosity of the thin Galactic disk component detected with RXTE. They could make a more significant contribution in the 0. 5 - 10 keV energy range, provided that the nonthermal ion population extends down to about 1 MeV/nucleon and delivers about 10 $^{ 42 }$ erg s$^{- 1 }$ to the interstellar medium, comparable to the total power <b>suplied</b> by the Galactic supernovae. But since the nonthermal X-rays in this energy range are essentially produced below the thresholds of the Be-producing cross sections, their detection does not necessarily imply a low energy cosmic-ray origin for the spallogenic light elements.

The biggest problem is construction of bogies - it is common, that in the height of classical shaft is the floor, {{so it is not}} possible to use classical mounted axle and it is necessary to use free wheels. The characteristics of classical mounted axle in the rail is quite well known for many years, nor the the characteristics of free wheels, so there is lot of space for research, and more - there is lot of space, how to use features of free wheels, that should be better in the curves, than features of mounted axle. This - and the fact, that Skoda Transportation now manufactures tram-cars type 15 T called ForCity, that are using free-wheels driven by low speed gear-less PMSM - let us to start research project with cooperation with Skoda Electric a VUKV. The project is focused on optimization of control algorithms for upper control system for such a this vehicles. The project has three steps. The first step is simulation of free-wheel driven tram-car in the rail and developement of control algorithms on this simulation. The second step is project and construction of special narrow-track experimental rail car, that would be used for experiments and verification of the algorithms. The last step should be implementation of developed algorithms to control systems of real tram. The experimental rail car is projected as a accumulator powered vehicle with four free wheels driven by four gear-less PMSM <b>suplied</b> from four voltage inverters. These inverters are controled in current, velocity and torque loop by DSPs. The upper control system is realized by National Instruments Compact RIO system, which was chosen because of its good mechanical construction and possibility of graphical programming.

The petioles and the shoots were sampled each growth season (150 days) and dry matter was evaluated for yield and macronutrient contents (N, P, K, Ca and Mg). Results show that the spray of growth regulators induced alteration in the macronutrient patterns due to the decrease of shoot rate growth and increase in fruitfull shoots. Com o objetivo de avaliar a variação no teor de macronutrientes como resposta ao uso de reguladores de crescimento em videiras ‘Thompson Seedless’ e ‘Italia’, realizaram-se dois experimentos em casa-de-vegetação testando quatro (04) retardadores: chlormequat - 1. 500 mg L- 1; daminozide - 3. 000 mg L- 1; uniconazole - 30 mg L- 1; cloreto de mepiquat - 300 mg L- 1. As mudas das cultivares produtoras enxertadas sobre ‘Tropical’ foram transplantadas para vasos com 35 L de uma mistura 1 : 1 : 1 em volume de areia, solo e composto orgânico. Após a poda, realizada a cada 150 dias, as videiras receberam 1 L de solução com micronutrientes e 1 L de composto orgânico. No correr de cada ciclo, adubou-se dez vezes as plantas com: 1, 45 g de MAP; 3, 42 g de nitrato de cálcio; 1, 61 g de uréia; 3, 53 g de cloreto de potássio e 1, 94 g de sulfato de magnésio. No fim de cada ciclo, podou-se o sistema aéreo, coletando-se os pecíolos das folhas e os ramos, que foram secos e pesados para determinação da massa de matéria seca. Após moagem, as amostras foram analisadas quanto ao teor de macronutrientes. As experiências realizadas com retardadores de crescimento, permitem concluir que não só é possível reduzir o ritmo de crescimento dos ramos nas plantas de videira das cultivares Thompson Seedless e Italia, bem como favorecer a alteração nos teores de nutrientes de modo a induzir a formação de gemas férteis, prerrogativas exploradas no presente trabalho...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clear the effect on {{household}} movement by new housing <b>suply</b> considering relation betweem house type shift and household movement in Yamaguchi Pre. Most of moving into owned house are from internal area. New owned house supply is the most effective at household movement. On the other hand, moving into rental houses is high rate of households from externer area. From externer area, new rental house supply is more effective than new owned house supply...|$|R

Our scenarios assess the feasibility of a completely renewable energy supply on the archipelago. By including an optimization of the power capacity we assess least cost options for the power sector and assess the matching of <b>suply</b> and demand with high shares of variable renewable. Our transition pathway identifies the necessary deployment of renewable energy technologies in the heat, power and transport sectors...|$|R
