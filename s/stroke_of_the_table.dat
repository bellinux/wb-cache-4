40|$|AbstractThe {{reasoning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diamond {{electrochemical grinding}} (DECMG) method of machining of rectangular ceramic metal - tungsten base plates (the surface 80 - 500 mm 2) with their vacuum fastening on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine-tool is stated. The optimal grinding conditions using the cup diamond wheel bonded by the Cu-Al-Zn {{base in the}} electrolyte an aqueous solution of Na 2 HPO 4 and Na 2 CO 3 with additives are given. Depending on <b>the</b> relative position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work- piece and the grinding wheel the electrode voltage was variable from 2. 5 V up to 5 V, and the electrolyte flow rate supplied through two nozzles was variable too. <b>The</b> characteristics <b>of</b> DECMG in various processing zones as well as components that make stock removal during the double, forward and backward <b>strokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine-tool <b>table</b> are shown. Due to <b>the</b> machining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plates using delicate grinding conditions they managed to have their predeter- mined sizes, surface roughness, <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface layers, the reflection power, <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> defects and service life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plates. Plates were machined following <b>the</b> request <b>of</b> a research organization for applications in the nuclear and thermonuclear technology. Information can be useful for researchers and developers of physical, chemi- cal and combined methods of machining...|$|R
30|$|However, on {{the other}} hand, {{measurement}} of roll error motion requires a long precision mirror, which has the same length as <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slide. Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slide <b>table</b> becomes longer, a disturbance of refractive index in the long optical path influences measurement results. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} a laser autocollimator to carry out measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roll error motion of a linear slide having a long stroke. Meanwhile, a clinometer is another candidate for measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roll error motion. There are three major types <b>of</b> clinometers; <b>the</b> mechanical pendulum-based type [22, 23], the accelerometer-based type [24], and the fluid-based type [25, 26]. The mechanical pendulum-based clinometers and the accelerometer-based clinometers have advantages of high resolution, large measurement range and small size. Some of those mechanical gravity-based clinometers are designed in a compact size of smaller than 75  mm[*]×[*] 40  mm[*]×[*] 45  mm, while achieving high resolution up to 0.1 arc-second with a good stability [27]. However, they are not suitable for measurement in <b>the</b> manufacturing process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear slides since these pendulum-based clinometers have <b>the</b> disadvantages <b>of</b> high cost, and heavy weight owing to its complex mechanism. Meanwhile, {{on the other}} hand, the fluid-type clinometers, which detect <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravity with a liquid surface [28], has <b>the</b> advantages <b>of</b> low cost, small size, and light weight compared with other types of clinometers. In addition, fluid-based type clinometers are robust against external vibration because of its non-mechanical structure. Therefore, the fluid-based type clinometers are suitable to be applied for <b>the</b> manufacturing process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear slides. Differing from the autocollimators, the fluid-based type clinometer does not require a mirror reflector because its angle reference is <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> liquid enclosed inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensor body [27, 28]. By utilizing <b>the</b> feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinometer, a setup for measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roll error motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slide <b>table</b> in a long-stroke linear slide can therefore be established in a compact size; this is a great advantage from <b>the</b> viewpoint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear slides.|$|R
