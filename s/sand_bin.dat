40|$|For {{optimizing}} wheel {{configuration of}} planetary rover, the effect analysis of straight grousers on motion {{performance of a}} small rigid wheel was conducted in loose <b>sand</b> <b>bin.</b> All tests were done at a free wheel sinkage and 0 to 60 % slip in a single-wheel test bed. By the qualitative analysis and comparisons of tractive and steering performance between smooth wheel and the wheels with different straight grousers, {{the results show that}} the grouser height and slip more significantly influence the motion performance than grouser spacing and thickness. Through applying the evaluation indexes of tractive and steering performance to the experimental results, the preferable grouser parameters for actual applications are 15 Â° grouser spacing, 10 mm grouser height and 1. 5 mm grouser thickness; the optimum value of wheel slip is 13 % for the similar sand used in the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Many ancient towers are {{affected}} by stability problems. The main part of this thesis is physical modeling of tower. Model test is very appropriate for the stability assessment of tower foundations, which is related to: bearing capacity failure, {{due to lack of}} soil strength, instability of equilibrium, due to lack of soil stiffness, and buckling failure of column. The main objective is to measure maximum horizontal displacement at top of a tower before it is permanently failing and to measure the horizontal force to make the tower fall. The results are analyzed with three approaches. One is from pure elastic soil assumption which is not always true. Soil behavior is not elastic. The second approach is stability related to bearing capacity and the third one is buckling failure. The test has been done in the 4 mX 4 mX 3 m large scale model testing facility at the Geotechnical Division, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU. A set of electrical instrument are used to perform the test. For analyzing the result {{it is very important to}} know about soil behavior. Hokksund sand was used in the <b>sand</b> <b>bin.</b> Three triaxial tests with high confining are done for this thesis. But there are many tests were carried out in the past on Hokksund sand. Results from the past studied carefully and used extensively in this thesis. Another part of this thesis is numerical modeling of tower. Different friction and dilatancy angles were used in the numerical analysis to understand their effect. The results from the model test compared with classical elasticity theory and bearing capacity theory. Some back calculations are also done to compare the results. Conclusions and recommendations for further studies are given at the last of thesis. </p...|$|E

50|$|McMillan Sand Filtration Site is a twenty-five acre {{decommissioned}} {{water treatment}} plant in northwest Washington, D.C., built {{as part of the}} historic McMillan Reservoir Park. It is bound on the north by Michigan Avenue, on the east by North Capitol Street, on the south by Channing Street and on the west by McMillan Drive; which runs {{along the edge of the}} reservoir, to which it was formerly attached. Two paved courts lined by regulator houses, tower-like <b>sand</b> <b>bins,</b> <b>sand</b> washers and the gated entrances to the underground filter cells provided a promenade for citizens taking the air in the park before it was fenced off in WWII.|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} and investigates {{a general}} method {{for measuring the}} flow of granular material through orifices. During {{the last decade or}} so, the phenomenon of the mechanization of material handling in modern industry has developed into immense proportions. But the problem of the handling of granular material through orifices lies, obviously, at the very root of this tremendous development. The present study is an attempt to contribute to the solution of this problem. Laboratory investigations were conducted with Ottawa <b>Sand,</b> glass <b>bins,</b> sand-paper bins and circular orifices. The effect of head, diameter of bin, diameter of orifice, roughness of bin walls and vibrations on the flow were studied. Graphs were plotted and the flow constants ascertained...|$|R
40|$|A {{great many}} {{industrial}} processes involve interaction between solids and fluids (i. e. gases or liquids). Combustion, gasification of solid fuels, shales or solid wastes, drying of particles, calcining, particle heating, regenerative heat exchangers, oxidation or reduction of ores, metal surface treatments and catalytic and thermal cracking {{are some of}} such processes. Solids and fluids serve different roles and several combinations of solids and fluids can arise in a practical situation. Thus, when considering processes or plants {{it is necessary to}} be clear as to the particular purpose served by the fluids and the solids. Heating and drying of solids, for example, involve heat and mass transfer only, whereas combustors, gasifiers etc. have the additional complication of chemical reactions which have to be carried out simultaneously with heat and mass transfer. Again, there are many processes where just the flow of granular particles take place, for example, the flow of food grain, coal or <b>sand</b> particles through <b>bin,</b> silo, hoppers, chutes, conveyor belts, inclined planes etc. In most of these cases, a theoretical modeling of the process requires a complete and thorough understanding of the phenomena involved and constitutive modeling of the constituents along with the usual balance laws. In a process, where both a fluid and a solid constituents are involved, it is essential to model both the constituents such that the models accurately describes the characteristics of the constituent concerned. While there are many different models available for fluids, the models for granular materials lack from an understanding of the material parameters...|$|R
