5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems {{one of the}} stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These <b>shrunken</b> white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E
5|$|Amrish Puri as Mola Ram: A Thuggee {{priest who}} {{performs}} rituals of human sacrifices. The character {{is named after}} a 17th-century Indian painter. Lucas wanted Mola Ram to be terrifying, so the screenwriters added elements of Aztec and Hawaiian human sacrificers, and European devil worship to the character. To create his headdress, make-up artist Tom Smith based the skull on a cow (as this would be sacrilegious), and used a latex <b>shrunken</b> head.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{joined a}} <b>shrunken</b> and {{demoralized}} Conservative caucus in the House of Commons. The Conservative leader, Robert Manion, {{failed to win}} {{a place in the}} Commons in the election, which saw the Liberals take 181 seats. The Tories sought to be included in a wartime coalition government, but Mackenzie King refused. The House of Commons had only a slight role in the war effort; under the state of emergency, most business was accomplished through the Cabinet issuing Orders in Council.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} {{versions of the}} game developed for the NES. The first port was handled and published by Jaleco only in Japan. Released on June 23, 1988, it featured characters redrawn in a cute art style and generally <b>shrunken</b> rooms. No scrolling is present, leading to rooms larger than a single screen to be displayed via flip-screens. Many of the background details are missing, and instead of a save feature an over 100 character long password is required to save progress.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit {{their love}} for each other, yet he distrusts her {{intentions}} (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the Queen Anne's Revenge and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the Revenge. He reclaims the <b>shrunken</b> Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, hoping to revert the Black Pearl to its original size and continue living the pirates life.|$|E
5|$|Doris calls Mulder, {{believing that}} Chaco {{wants to kill}} her; after she hangs up, she is {{attacked}} by the masked figure. Scully goes to help Doris while Mulder searches for Chaco at his mansion. There, he finds the <b>shrunken</b> heads of Kearns and other victims in a cabinet. Mulder calls Scully {{on the phone and}} hears her being knocked out by Chaco. She is taken to a secluded field, where Harold has started a bonfire and led the townsfolk in consuming Doris. Chaco berates them for killing one of their own, but Harold chastises him for allowing the Creutzfeldt–Jakob epidemic to occur and has Chaco executed by the masked figure. Scully herself is about to be killed when Mulder arrives and shoots the figure; he is revealed to be Sheriff Arens. Harold tries to shoot Mulder, but is trampled to death by the fleeing townsfolk.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{was first}} {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 as Agaricus vietus in his Systema Mycologicum. In his 1838 work Epicrisis systematis mycologici, Fries reclassified the species as a Lactarius, giving it its current name. |publisher=CAB International |work=Index Fungorum |accessdate=27 December 2010}} Subsequent attempts to reclassify the {{species have been}} unsuccessful. In his 1871 work Der Führer in die Pilzkunde, Paul Kummer reclassified the species {{as a member of}} Galorrheus, and in Otto Kuntze's 1891 Revisio generum plantarum, the species was placed in the genus Lactifluus. Both Galorrheus vietus and Lactifluus vietus are now considered obligate synonyms (different names for the same species based on one type) of Lactarius vietus. The specific epithet is from the Latin , meaning <b>shrunken.</b> It is commonly known as the grey milkcap.|$|E

25|$|The Glutton (February 21, 1971) – An {{incredibly}} fat {{man called}} The Glutton (performed by Jim Henson and assisted by Frank Oz) kept eating things, before being <b>shrunken</b> {{by a small}} purple creature and then eaten by a duplicate of himself. After the sketch was over, the Glutton attempted to swallow Ed Sullivan's hand after giving him a handshake.|$|E
25|$|The Knight Bus segment when Harry {{is being}} taken to The Leaky Cauldron uses the {{technique}} known as bullet time, popularised in The Matrix series of films. This segment takes humorous advantage of the magic quality of the Harry Potter world by having the Muggle world go into bullet time while inside the Knight Bus, Harry, Stan Shunpike and Ernie Prang (and the talking <b>shrunken</b> head) keep moving in real time.|$|E
25|$|A 16-year-old youth, {{whose parents}} were friends of Gein and who {{attended}} ball games and movies with him, reported that Gein kept <b>shrunken</b> heads in his house, which Gein had described as relics from the Philippines, sent by a cousin who had served on the islands during World War II. Upon investigation by the police, these were determined to be human facial skins, carefully peeled from corpses and used by Gein as masks.|$|E
25|$|Oslo International School was {{established}} in 1963, but has not been located at Nadderud all the time, and got its current name in 1989. It is both a primary school, lower secondary school and upper secondary school with the International Baccalaureate program. A lower secondary school not far from Nadderud farm {{was established}} on 18 September 1968, under the name Bekkestua. Its size has <b>shrunken</b> from 662 students in 1970 to 372 students in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} aid policy, proportionally, aid given to improve {{maternal}} mortality rates has <b>shrunken</b> as other public health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, have become major international concerns. Maternal health aid contributions {{tend to be}} lumped together with newborn and child health, so {{it is difficult to}} assess how much aid is given directly to maternal health to help lower the rates of maternal mortality. Regardless, there has been progress in reducing maternal mortality rates internationally.|$|E
25|$|The Lower East Side is {{also home}} to many live music venues.

There are also bars that offer performance space, such as Pianos on Ludlow Street and Arlene's Grocery on Stanton Street.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{in severe}} droughts, crops can fail as the soil {{does not contain}} {{sufficient}} moisture to keep them alive and this is usually the largest economic impact with £500 million ($830 million) worth of damage from failed crops in 1976. Another, more subtle impact is the insurance claims from damage to houses and businesses from fire and subsidence (caused by the dry and <b>shrunken</b> soil), sometimes amounting to over £50 million ($83 million) in severe droughts.|$|E
25|$|Economically {{significant}} {{stocks of}} fish have returned, and observers {{who had written}} off the North Aral Sea as an environmental disaster were surprised by unexpected reports that, in 2006, its returning waters were already partly reviving the fishing industry and producing catches for export as far as Ukraine. The restoration reportedly gave rise to long-absent rain clouds and possible microclimate changes, bringing tentative hope to an agricultural sector swallowed by a regional dustbowl, and some expansion of the <b>shrunken</b> sea.|$|E
25|$|LNS is {{characterized}} by three major hallmarks: neurologic dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral disturbances including self-mutilation, and uric acid overproduction (hyperuricemia). Damage to the basal ganglia causes sufferers to adopt a characteristic fencing stance {{due to the nature}} of the lesion. Some may also be afflicted with macrocytic anemia. Virtually all patients are male; males suffer delayed growth and puberty, and most develop <b>shrunken</b> testicles or testicular atrophy. Female carriers are at an increased risk for gouty arthritis but are usually otherwise unaffected.|$|E
25|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} of the medieval settlement. Earthwork remains indicating a settlement and agricultural use exist near south of the church; earthwork remnants of a former <b>shrunken</b> village exist {{to the north of}} the church. Archaeological evidence of saltmaking has been found north of the village (formerly in the parish of Harbrough, now within the dock estate), references to a saltmaking site here exist from the Domesday book, and in a late 12th century document describing the gift of land including the saltpan to Newhouse Abbey.|$|E
25|$|Techno's {{impersonation}} of Ogre {{ended when}} Scourge of the Underworld stowed away inside him, <b>shrunken,</b> and destroyed his {{body from the}} inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again {{to allow him to}} construct a new body. However, his backup plan worked, and his consciousness was returned to his original human body—mostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage—and the human Ebersol, initially amnesiac of the robot's exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{experiencing}} hemimicropsia often {{complain that}} objects in their {{left or right}} visual field appear to be <b>shrunken</b> or compressed. They may also have difficulty appreciating the symmetry of pictures. When drawing, patients often {{have a tendency to}} compensate for their perceptual asymmetry by drawing the left or right half of objects slightly larger than the other. In a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects, the size of the picture on the left half was on average 16% larger than the corresponding right half.|$|E
25|$|The base of skull {{was found}} intact. The {{back of the}} skull cavity {{contains}} the <b>shrunken</b> and desiccated brain and dura mater of the Lady. There {{is no evidence of}} embalming material within the cranial cavity. Researchers located an oval defect in the skull. It is located in {{the central part of the}} frontal bone, in front of the coronal suture. The defect has sharp, beveled, and festooned edges. The lack of evidence for attempted healing or sclerosis indicate that the defect was caused by a postmortem alteration of the body, probably during the embalming process. The embalmers likely used a sharp instrument on the skull.|$|E
25|$|The human {{appendix}} {{had been}} proposed to be a vestigial structure, {{a structure that}} has lost {{all or most of}} its original function, or that has evolved to take on a new function. The suggestion was that it is the <b>shrunken</b> remnant of the cecum thought to have been present in a remote ancestor of humans. This notion is still widely held. A 2013 study, however, refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence. Ceca, which occur in the digestive tracts of many herbivores (e.g. ox, horse), house mutualistic bacteria and ingested small stones that help animals digest the cellulose molecules found in plants.|$|E
25|$|Dodd showed {{through his}} {{evidence}} that Ukrainian Overlord Erich Koch and defendant Polish Overlord Hans Frank {{were responsible for}} the plan to deport one million Poles for slave labor. Dodd also showed evidence that defendant Walther Funk turned the Reichsbank into a depository for gold teeth and other valuables seized from the concentration camp victims. Dodd showed a motion picture of the vaults in Frankfurt where Allied troops found cases of these valuables, containing dentures, earrings, silverware and candelabra. Dodd showed many gruesome items of evidence, such as a <b>shrunken,</b> stuffed and preserved human head of one of the concentration camp victims that had been used as a paperweight by the commandant of Buchenwald Concentration Camp.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania in Sibiu {{decided to}} back {{him as a}} {{candidate}} for mayor. Despite the fact that Sibiu's German minority had <b>shrunken</b> to a mere 1.6%, Iohannis was elected with 69.18% of the votes and has won three re-elections in a row, getting some of the largest electoral scores in the country: 88.7% of the vote in 2004, and 87.4% in 2008. He is the first ethnic German mayor of a Romanian city since Albert Dörr, who served from 1940 to 1945. The small German minority is popular in Romania, where they are often viewed as hard-working, precise and uncompromising. Many Romanians also remember that the country experienced some of its best moments under German kings over a century ago.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, Disney's {{involvement}} during production had <b>shrunken</b> noticeably. As Walt was occupied with trains and {{the filming of}} Treasure Island, the directors were left to exercise their own judgment more on details. Although Walt no longer held daily story meetings, the three directors still communicated with him by mailing him memoranda, scripts, Photostats of storyboards, and acetates of soundtrack recordings {{while he was in}} England {{for two and a half}} months during the summer of 1949. When Walt did not respond, work resumed and then had to be undone when he did. In one instance when Walt returned to the studio on August 29, he reviewed Luske's animation sequences and ordered numerous minor changes, as well as a significant reworking of the film's climax. Production was finished by October 13, 1949.|$|E
25|$|An autopsy was {{performed}} on 27 March 1827 by Dr. Johann Wagner. While it is unclear who ordered the autopsy, a specific request by Beethoven in his Heiligenstadt Testament {{may have played a}} role in the decision. The autopsy revealed a severely cirrhotic and <b>shrunken</b> liver, of which ascites is a common consequence. Scholars disagree over whether Beethoven's liver damage was the result of heavy alcohol consumption, hepatic infection, or both. Hepatitis B and C are causes of cirrhosis, but they spread from contact with contaminated body fluids and were extremely rare in Beethoven's day. Hepatitis A on the other hand can be contracted from food and water that were not handled properly and was very common in the 19th century, although it does not cause liver cirrhosis or permanent organ damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{leading cause}} of death still remains lead {{poisoning}} however. M. H. Stevens and his team have concluded that high levels of lead deep in the bone sampled from Beethoven's skull suggest repeated exposure {{over a long period of}} time rather than limited exposure prior to the time of death. Among other evidence, the finding of <b>shrunken</b> cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead, therefore Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the Tyrolese people rose in revolt. Under leaders such as Andreas Hofer they started attacking the Bavarian garrisons. Hoping to aid the rebellion, Austrian {{commander-in-chief}} Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen ordered John to detach Chasteler and 10,000 Austrian troops to assist the Tyrolese. Chasteler's replacement as the commander of the <b>shrunken</b> VIII Armeekorps was Albert Gyulai, Ignaz Gyulai's brother. Suspecting that Austria planned to initiate a war, Napoleon built up the French part of the Army of Italy to six infantry and three cavalry divisions. Actually, a good many of the so-called French soldiers were Italians, because Napoleon had annexed parts of northwest Italy to the First French Empire. In addition, Eugène assembled three Italian infantry divisions so that the Franco-Italian army numbered 70,000 troops. However, the army was dispersed across northern Italy.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Hunter toured North America with Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band {{as part of}} a line-up which {{included}} Ringo Starr, Sheila E., Greg Lake, Howard Jones, Roger Hodgson, and Mark Rivera. Hunter's studio album Rant, released the same year, received wide critical acclaim, and was followed by two live albums: 2004's Strings Attached with a 20-piece orchestra, and 2005's The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nuthin' But The Truth with Mick Ralphs (and Brian May of Queen and Joe Elliott of Def Leppard on one song). Hunter won Classic Rock Magazine's Songwriter Award in October 2005. His studio album <b>Shrunken</b> Heads was accompanied by a three-song bonus CD, and was released in May 2007 by Jerkin' Crocus promotions in Europe and Yep Roc Records in the US. Man Overboard, was released on 21 July 2009, by New West Records to critical success, further bolstering his return to public acclaim.|$|E
