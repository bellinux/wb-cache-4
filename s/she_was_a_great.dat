25|$|Early {{information}} of Charlotte Charke {{can be found}} in the autobiography called a Narrative of The Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke by Charlotte Charke herself, she wrote this and published it as a male author. In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, they talk to us about her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but she also felt as though she had been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens dirt. With the absence of her father due to business endeavours and the lack of a mother figure due to constant illnesses, Charlotte became as independent as a young child her age could be, only to put up with nagging maids that watched over her every once and while.|$|E

2500|$|Carolee Schneemann (born October 12, 1939) is an American visual artist, {{known for}} her discourses on the body, {{sexuality}} and gender. [...] She received a B.A. from Bard College and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Illinois. [...] Her work is primarily characterized by research into visual traditions, taboos, and {{the body of the}} individual in relation to social bodies. [...] Her works have been shown at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the London National Film Theatre, and many other venues. [...] Schneemann has taught at several universities, including the California Institute of the Arts, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Hunter College, and Rutgers University. [...] Additionally, she has published widely, producing works such as Cézanne, <b>She</b> <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> Painter (1976) and More than Meat Joy: Performance Works and Selected Writings (1997).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike much other feminist art, Schneemann's {{revolves}} around sexual expression and liberation, rather than referring to victimization or repression of women. [...] According to artist and lecturer Johannes Birringer, Schneemann's work resists the political correctness enforced by some branches of feminism {{as well as}} ideologies that some feminists claim are misogynist, such as psychoanalysis. [...] He also asserts that Schneemann's work is difficult to classify and analyze as it combines constructivist and painterly concepts with her physical body and energy. [...] In her 1976 book Cézanne, <b>She</b> <b>Was</b> <b>A</b> <b>Great</b> Painter, Schneemann wrote that she used nudity in her artwork to break taboos associated with the kinetic human body and to show that [...] "the life {{of the body is}} more variously expressive than a sex-negative society can admit." [...] She also stated, [...] "In some sense I made a gift of my body to other women; giving our bodies back to ourselves." [...] According to Kristine Stiles, Scheeman read several written works exploring the body’s relationship with “sexuality, culture, and freedom,” such as The Theater and Its Double by Antonin Araud, The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir, and The Sexual Revolution by Wilhelm Reich. These written works may have influenced her belief that women must represent themselves through writing about their experiences if they wished to gain equality. She preferred her term [...] "art istorical" [...] (without the h), so as to reject the [...] "his" [...] in history.|$|E

2500|$|Evans played Shakespeare's Cleopatra for {{the last}} time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her {{performance}} divided the critics: opinions varied from [...] "an agonising disaster" [...] to [...] "a joy to watch". Kenneth Tynan said, [...] "Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal". Evans had never been classically good looking, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> enough actress to [...] "convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful". What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, [...] "I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality", which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character's [...] "explicit admission of evil". Evans once remarked, [...] "I don't think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth", a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, but [...] "isn't she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her." [...] This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, [...] "I know those sort of women. They ring the bell and tell you to put a lump of coal on the fire." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Schneemann {{performed}} Interior Scroll in East Hampton, New York {{and later}} that year, at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado. This was a notable Fluxus-influenced piece featuring {{her use of}} text and body. [...] In her performance, Schneemann entered wrapped in a sheet, under which she wore an apron. [...] She disrobed and then got on a table where she outlined her body with dark paint. [...] Several times, she would take [...] "action poses", {{similar to those in}} figure drawing classes. [...] Concurrently, she read from her book Cézanne, <b>She</b> <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> Painter. [...] Following this, she dropped the book and slowly extracted from her vagina a scroll from which she read. Scheeman’s speech described a parody version of an encounter where she received criticism on her films for their “persistence of feelings” and “personal clutter”. Art Historian David Hopkins suggests that this performance was a comment on both “internalized criticism”, and possibly “feminist interest” in female writing. Schneemann's feminist scroll speech, according to performance theorist Jeanie Forte, made it seem as if [...] "'s vagina itself is reporting [...] sexism". [...] Art critic Robert C. Morgan states {{that it is necessary to}} acknowledge the period during which Interior Scroll was produced in order to understand it. [...] He argues that by placing the source of artistic creativity at the female genitals, Schneemann is changing the masculine overtones of minimalist art and conceptual art into a feminist exploration of her body. [...] Interior Scroll, along with Judy Chicago's Dinner Party, helped pioneer many of the ideas later popularized by the off-broadway show The Vagina Monologues.|$|E
