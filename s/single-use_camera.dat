50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Dakota Digital, a number of similar <b>single-use</b> digital <b>cameras</b> have appeared. Most <b>single-use</b> digital <b>cameras</b> are nearly identical to the original Dakota Digital in specifications and function, though a few include superior specifications and more advanced functions (such as higher image resolutions and LCD screens). Most, if not all these <b>single-use</b> digital <b>cameras</b> cost less than $20 (USD), not including processing. However, the huge demand for complex digital cameras at competitive prices has often caused manufacturing shortcuts, evidenced by a large increase in customer complaints over camera malfunctions, high parts prices, and short service life. Some digital cameras offer only a 90-day warranty.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Polaroid {{tried to}} reinvent itself without Land at its helm by {{shifting}} {{away from a}} dependence on consumer photography, a market which was in steady decline. Polaroid was forced to make wholesale changes that included having to fire thousands of workers and close many factories. The 1990s saw the advent of new technologies that profoundly changed the world of photography — one-hour color film processing, <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras</b> from competitors, videotape camcorders, and digital cameras.|$|R
50|$|A {{company called}} Photo-Pac {{produced}} a cardboard camera beginning in 1949 which shot eight exposures {{and which was}} mailed-in for processing. Cameras were expensive, and would often have been left safely at home when lovely scenes presented themselves. Frustrated with missing photo opportunities, H. M. Stiles had invented a way to enclose 35mm film in an inexpensive enclosure without the expensive precision film transport mechanism. It cost $1.29. Though incredibly similar to the familiar <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras</b> today, Photo-Pac failed to make a permanent impression on the market.|$|R
50|$|Disposable or <b>single-use</b> <b>camera</b> is {{a simple}} box camera meant to be used once. Most use {{fixed-focus}} lenses. Some are equipped with an integrated flash unit, and there are even waterproof versions for underwater photography. Internally, the cameras use a 135 film or an APS cartridge.|$|E
50|$|Public {{announcement}} {{of how to}} transform the <b>single-use</b> <b>camera</b> into a reusable camera, paired with the very low camera price, immediately created high demand for the Dakota Digital as people started buying them so they could acquire their own reusable digital camera at low cost. Along with the increased demand, Ritz began pulling the Dakota Digital out of its stores after learning of the hack. Because of these two factors, it very rapidly became difficult to find the original Dakota Digital camera.|$|E
5000|$|When introduced, the Dakota Digital sparked massive interest, {{primarily}} due to {{its price}} tag: $10.99 (US Dollars). At the time, a digital camera of similar resolution and functionality was in the $40-$70 range. The reason for the low price was because the Dakota Digital was a <b>single-use</b> <b>camera,</b> i.e. the consumer takes the pictures, returns the camera to the store, and the pictures are returned to the consumer in print and CD-ROM format (after an additional $11 processing fee) while the camera is refurbished and resold. Although the Dakota Digital wasn't the very first digital camera introduced under the single-use concept (Pentax and Sanyo introduced the world's first single-use digital camera in Japan two years prior http://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1002669755.html), {{it was the first}} single-use digital camera to be mass-marketed (the Pentax/Sanyo camera was only a three-month trial run), as well as the first single-use digital camera sold in the United States. http://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1059636915.html ...|$|E

Refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing, and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade. Works like [...] "The Waste Makers" [...] by Vance Packard explain some of the criticism of exports of working product, for example, the ban on import of tested working Pentium 4 laptops to China, or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by Japan.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the optical}} {{properties}} of photographic lenses, only objects within a {{limited range of}} distances from the camera will be reproduced clearly. The process of adjusting this range is known as changing the camera's focus. There are various ways of focusing a camera accurately. The simplest cameras have fixed focus and use a small aperture and wide-angle lens to ensure that everything within a certain range of distance from the lens, usually around 3 metres (10 ft) to infinity, is in reasonable focus. Fixed focus cameras are usually inexpensive types, such as <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras.</b> The camera can also have a limited focusing range or scale-focus that is indicated on the camera body. The user will guess or calculate {{the distance to the}} subject and adjust the focus accordingly. On some cameras this is indicated by symbols (head-and-shoulders; two people standing upright; one tree; mountains).|$|R
50|$|While {{they have}} shifted the vast {{majority}} of their product lines to digital, major camera manufacturers such as Canon and Nikon continue to make expensive professional-grade 35 mm film SLRs (such as the Canon EOS-1v and the Nikon F6). Introductory 35 mm SLRs, compact film point-and-shoot <b>cameras,</b> and <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras</b> continue to be built and sold by a number of makers. Leica finally introduced the digital Leica M8 rangefinder in 2007, but continues to make its M series rangefinder film cameras and lenses. A digital camera back for the Leica R9 SLR camera was discontinued in 2007. On March 25, 2009, Leica discontinued the R9 SLR and R-series lenses.|$|R

First generation AF SLRs had {{a single}} central AF sensor. However, composition rules generally say {{it is wrong to}} have dead center subjects and most compositions have off-center subjects. Multiple AF sensor arrays covering a wide area can more easily focus on these compositions. In 2007, the number of AF sensors reached 51 in the Nikon D3 and D300 (Japan) digital SLRs. In 1990, the 7000i and a sister camera, the Minolta Maxxum 8000i (Japan, 1990), were also the first 35 mm SLRs with available [...] "panoramic" [...] format film gate mask and focusing screen accessory.

40|$|Undergraduate {{engineering}} {{institutions are}} currently seeking to improve recruiting practices and to retain engineering majors particularly by addressing what many studies document {{as a major}} challenge of poor instruction. There is an undisputed need for instructional practices that motivate students in addition to facilitating the transfer of learning beyond the classroom. Reverse engineering and product dissection, more broadly termed Disassemble/Analyze/Assemble (DAA) activities, have shown potential to address these concerns, based on the reviews of students and professors alike. DAA activities involve the systematic deconstruction of an artifact, the subsequent analysis and possible reconstruction of its components {{for the purpose of}} understanding the embodied fundamental concepts, design principles and developmental processes. These activities have been part of regular industry practice for some time; however, the systematic analysis of their benefits for learning and instruction is a relatively recent phenomenon. A number of studies have provided highly descriptive accounts of curricula and possible outcomes of DAA activities; but, relatively few have compared participants doing DAA activities to a control group doing more traditional activities. In this respect, two quasi-experiments were conducted as part of a first-year engineering laboratory, and it was hypothesized that students who engaged in the DAA activity would be more motivated and would demonstrate higher frequencies of transfer than the control. A DAA activity that required students to disassemble a <b>single-use</b> <b>camera</b> and analyze its components to discover how it works was compared to a step-by-step laboratory activity in the first experiment and a lecture method of instruction in the second experiment. In both experiments, over forty percent of the students that engaged in the DAA activity demonstrated the ability to transfer the knowledge gained about the functions of the camera 2 ̆ 7 s components and their interconnectedness and describe an approach for modifying the camera that involved the adaptation of a current mechanism to add new functionality. This exhibition of transfer was significantly greater than the frequency of transfer yielded by the comparative traditional activities. In addition, the post laboratory surveys indicated that the DAA activities elicited significantly higher levels of motivation than the step-by-step laboratory and the direct instructional method. ...|$|E
50|$|Colour films improved, {{both for}} print negatives and {{reversal}} slides, while black-and-white films offered smoother grain and faster speeds than previously available. Since 35 mm was preferred by both amateur and professional photographers, makers of film stock have long offered {{the widest range}} of different film speeds and types in the format. The DX film-speed encoding system {{was introduced in the}} 1980s, as were <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras</b> pre-loaded with 35 mm film and using plastic lenses of reasonable enough quality to produce acceptable snapshots. Automated all-in-one processing and printing machines made 35 mm developing easier and less expensive, so that quality colour prints became available not only from photographic specialty stores, but also from supermarkets, drugstores, and big box retailers, often in less than an hour.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{involved}} reuse {{organizations are}} [...] "repair and overhaul" [...] industries which take valuable parts, such as engine blocks, office furniture, toner cartridges, <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras,</b> aircraft hulls, and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and refurbish {{them in a}} factory environment {{in order to meet}} the same/similar specifications as new products. Xerox (copy machines), and Cummins Engine are examples of refurbishing factories in the USA. Rolls Royce has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore; Caterpillar recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China. Some factories operate in competition with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).

5000|$|Other {{currently}} available films {{are designed to}} produce color negatives for use in creating enlarged positive prints on color photographic paper. Color negatives may also be digitally scanned and then printed by non-photographic means or viewed as positives electronically. Unlike reversal-film transparency processes, negative-positive processes are, within limits, forgiving of incorrect exposure and poor color lighting, because a considerable degree of correction is possible {{at the time of}} printing. Negative film is therefore more suitable for casual use by amateurs. Virtually all <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras</b> employ negative film. Photographic transparencies can be made from negatives by printing them on special [...] "positive film," [...] but this has always been unusual outside of the motion picture industry and commercial service to do it for still images may no longer be available.

40|$|International audienceThe {{competitiveness}} in today's {{market forces}} many companies {{to rethink the}} way they design products. Instead of developing one product at a time, many manufacturing companies are developing families of products to provide enough variety for the marketplace while keeping costs relatively low. Although the benefits of commonality are widely known, many companies are still not taking full advantage of it when developing new products or redesigning existing ones. One reason {{is the lack of}} appropriate methods and useful indices to assess a product family based on commonality and diversity. Although many component-based commonality indices have been proposed in the literature, they emphasize commonality at the expense of diversity in a product family. In this study, the design for commonality and diversity method based on two new commonality indices — the commonality diversity index and the comprehensive metric for commonality — is introduced to help designers manage the inherent tradeoff between commonality and diversity during the product family design process. To illustrate the proposed method, an example application involving a family of <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras</b> is presented. The proposed method provides useful recommendations at both the functional and component levels during product family design...|$|R
40|$|The {{economical}} {{and environmental}} benefits of product remanufacturing {{have been widely}} recognized in the literature and in practice. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} interaction between a manufacturer's reverse channel choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive. To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e. g., print and copy cartridges) and an indirect product collection system, in which the retailers act as product return points (e. g., <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras,</b> cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer faces while choosing an optimal reverse channel structure. When a direct collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect reverse channel, supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction between the retailers. Subsequently, we show that the buy-back payments transfered to the retailers for postconsumer goods provide a wholesale pricing flexibility {{that can be used to}} price discriminate between retailers of different profitability. reverse logistics, product remanufacturing, supply chain coordination, distribution channels...|$|R
50|$|Hope in Shadows is a {{photography}} contest {{organized by}} Pivot Legal Society, for {{residents of the}} Downtown Eastside since 2003. Every summer, up to 200 residents are given <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras</b> and encouraged to capture their community and their lives through images. The contest is designed to raise awareness {{about life in the}} Downtown Eastside, presenting reality from a distinctly personal point of view. Forty photographs are chosen by a panel of Vancouver artists and photographers, which are put on display on the street outside the Carnegie Community Centre. Here, local residents can vote to select the winning entries, which are compiled in an annual calendar, sold by residents on the streets of Vancouver. In 2010 216 local residents received job training to sell the 2011 Hope in Shadows calendar. More than $130,000 was earned by licensed street vendors selling 2011 calendars. The calendar sales were a 10% increase over the previous year. The Hope in Shadows book which won the 2008 City of Vancouver Book Award in October 2008 and has now sold more than 5,000 copies on the streets (if they had been sold in bookstores it would be an official B.C. Best Seller). Many of the calendar and book sellers are photographers in the competition. The 2011 contest will be held June 1-4. The top 40 pictures will be exhibited in the Pendulum Gallery in October, and the 2012 calendar will become available on October 4, 2011.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{presents}} {{case studies}} of selected remanufacturing operations in Japan. It investigates Japanese companies' motives and incentives for remanufacturing, clarifies the requirements and obstacles facing remanufacturers, itemizes what measures companies take to address them, and discusses the influence of Japanese laws related to remanufacturing. Methods: This study involves {{case studies of}} four product areas: photocopiers, <b>single-use</b> <b>cameras,</b> auto parts, and ink and toner cartridges for printers. Results and conclusions {{are based on the}} authors' discussions and interviews with 11 remanufacturers [...] four original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and seven independent remanufacturers (IRs). In the discussions and the interviews, we asked the companies their motives for remanufacturing and asked the measures they take to overcome the obstacles of remanufacturing. This study highlighted three requirements for remanufacturing: (1) collection of used products, (2) efficient remanufacturing processes, and (3) demand for remanufactured products. Results: Where OEMs are the main remanufacturers of products covered by this study, their motives are long-term economic and environmental incentives. Where IRs are the main remanufacturers, it is often because OEMs shun remanufacturing, fearing to cannibalize new product sales. Companies' efforts to meet the above mentioned three requirements were observed and documented: (1) establishing a new collection channel; (2) developing reverse logistics to collect used products; (3) designing products for remanufacturing (DfReman); (4) accumulating know-how to establish remanufacturing processes; and (5) controlling product quality to stimulate demand for remanufactured products. This study also notes that (6) OEMs who engage in remanufacturing build consumer demand by incorporating remanufactured components into new products. This point has not been particularly noted in previous studies, but it has an important implication for OEMs' remanufacturing. The authors found that Japan's Home Appliances Recycling Law and End-of-Life Vehicle Law have promoted material recycling but have been insufficient to stimulate remanufacturing within the country. Conclusions: This study clarified the differences between OEMs' and IRs' remanufacturing. Both IRs and OEMs are important for remanufacturing. Institutional measures to encourage appropriate competition between OEMs and IRs and to enhance consumers' acceptance of remanufactured products is important to promote remanufacturing...|$|R
5000|$|The book {{is built}} upon one what it terms {{one of the}} largest {{participatory}} photography programs ever undertaken, which the editors brought to the New York City Housing Authority in 2010 on behalf of the 501(c)(3) non-profit Seeing for Ourselves. Participants recruited from the projects were given <b>single-use</b> film <b>cameras</b> and trained in a twelve-week lecture/workshop course in photography. In between sessions, the participants would put into practice the lesson learned at the previous class. As Davis would tell CUNY-TV, [...] "We talked a little bit about photography technique, such as light and shadow, or camera language, or composition. And we talked {{a little bit about the}} history of photography, and offered some inspirational photographers. And then the latter half was the photographers sharing their own work." [...] According to the book, cameras were donated by Kodak and computers by Dell Computers, while film was processed at cost by Duggal Visual Solutions. Beginning in a project in West Harlem that fall with 15 participants, the program is said by the book to have mushroomed to serving hundreds of residents of 16 projects by the time it ended in the spring of 2013. The program was covered by a New York City tabloid early on.|$|R
40|$|Impacts {{caused by}} {{recreational}} scuba diving on coralreefs vary widely among different dive locations and individual divers. Linear modelling {{was used to}} explore a range of individual and situational risk factors associated with divers who damaged corals in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Recreational divers were followed for 10 – 15 min, and all contacts with, and damage to corals were recorded. Information on the divesite, diving experience, gender, and use of an underwater camera were recorded. Thirty-two out of 214 divers (15 %) damaged or broke corals, mostly by fin kicks (95 %). Impacts {{were most likely to}} be caused by male divers, in the first 10 min of the dive, at sites with a large abundance of branching corals. Specialist underwaterphotographers caused more damage on average (1. 6 breaks per 10 min) than divers without cameras (0. 3 breaks per 10 min). To explore the effects of gender and use of a camera further, we issued <b>single-use</b> underwater <b>cameras</b> to 31 randomly chosen divers and compared their behaviour to a control group. Use of a camera had no influence on the rate or amount of damage caused by these naive photographers, but male divers were more likely to break corals and caused significantly more damage, on average, (1. 4 breaks per 15 min) than female divers (0. 3 breaks per 15 min). Variability in the amount of damage caused by divers in our sample reflected the very different underwater behaviours exhibited by specialist and non-specialist photographers, and male and female divers. Greater understanding of the causes of harmful behaviours by these groups will allow better targeting of on-site interpretative and cautionary information and may prove to be a more palatable management strategy than regulation of site use...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry recognises that recycling worn-out products {{is a major}} contribution to conserving natural resources and solving landfill problems, but for recycling to {{be as effective as}} possible, as well as economical, the disassembly of reused products is critical (Garcia 2000). An appropriate disassembly sequence generation can maximise the gain from recycling and minimize the waste dumped to land fill. In this thesis, two new methods are developed for optimal disassembly sequence generation. The first method is called Combined AND/OR and Petri Net. The second method is called Category Sequence which consists of Direct Disassembly, Level Disassembly and Group Disassembly. The Combined AND/OR and Petri Net method is based on the fundamental theories of AND/OR and Petri Net, and then uses part accessibility and end-of-life strategy to obtain the optimal disassembly sequence. Firstly, all the feasible disassembly sequences are obtained using AND/OR graphs. Secondly, AND/OR graphs are converted into Petri Net models. Finally, by adding all the accessibility values and life span values to the Petri Net model as the conditions to execute the transitions, the optimal disassembly sequence, possessing the maximum combination of part accessibility and life span value, is obtained. The accessibility values and end-of-life values are obtained by analysing the structure of the liaison among each of the subassemblies and parts. The different life spans of reusable parts affect the disassembly order in the sequence generation. When the AND/OR theory is applied to disassemble the reused products consisting {{of a large number of}} parts, the processes to obtain all the possible disassembly sequences become very complicated. A new method, Category Sequence, is applied to classify the reused products into three categories in terms of the number of parts, which makes the process less complicated in generating all the possible disassembly sequences. For products consisting of a small number (n Several disassembling examples are given. In chapter 4, a case study of disassembling a Cclamp consisting of 4 parts is illustrated by using Combined AND/OR and Petri Net together with Directly Disassembly. In chapter 5, a case study of dismounting a Kodak MX <b>single-use</b> outdoor <b>camera</b> consisting of 19 parts is illustrated by using Combined AND/OR and Petri Net together with Level Disassembly. In chapter 6, a case study of a two-shaft helical gearbox consisting of 103 parts is taken apart to demonstrate how to apply Group Disassembly to a product consisting of a large number of parts. These two new methods - Combined AND/OR and Petri Net, and Category Sequence – are suitable for all used products and make it possible to maximise the gain from the disassembly process and, at the same time, simplify the disassembly process...|$|R
