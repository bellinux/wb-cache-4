40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to compare and unveil efficiency of electro-hydraulic control (EHR) system to mechanical three point hitch regulation in mouldboard ploughing. Increase of working velocity and three point hitch automatic regulation activity decreased depth of ploughing at both <b>regulation</b> <b>systems</b> but electro-hydraulic system done it more accurately since deviation from default value was 10 % less than at mechanical <b>regulation</b> <b>system.</b> Electro-hydraulic three point hitch control system decreased wheel slip up to 30 % in comparison to mechanical <b>regulation</b> <b>system.</b> Net energy requirement at mechanical three point hitch <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> spent 3 % more energy than electro-hydraulic control system. If wheel slip reduction influenced by electro-hydraulic control system would be added one could account on greater energy savings than previously mentioned value. The greatest working rates were achieved at the greatest working velocity (8, 0 km h- 1), while exactly at that velocity the greatest working rate increase of 3, 8 % influenced by electro-hydraulic three point hitch control was noticed...|$|R

The <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> of efficiency management for labour productivity set on a base determination of productivity for different kinds of labour (direct labour, embodied labour and cumulative labour). This research shows that direct labour expenses are subject to reduce, when enterprise increases it’s antomation level. But expenses for embodied labour are subject to increase in the same conditions. In such case, existing expense consept of labour productivity measurement is obsolet, because is based on direct labour expenses only. So, developed <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> of efficiency management gives the opportunity to measure productivity quite easily and economically effective with high level of reliability.

A small-scale spatial price equilibrium model is formulated and used to perform a number of numerical simulations, and to investigate market-based versus environmentally sound spatioeconomic configurations with first-best and second-best policies, and with endogenous environmental technologies. We thus present a modelling framework capable of dealing with complexities associated with the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>regulation,</b> first-best and second-best, of multiple interdependent sectors in a spatial setting. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{research}} it {{was examined}} state of organism <b>regulation</b> <b>systems</b> by {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) analysis. It was hypothesized that various psychological types, defense mechanisms and healthy habits have specific relations with <b>regulation</b> <b>systems.</b> The purpose was to study <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> state in connection with different psychological types, ego-defense mechanisms and healthy behavior of youth {{taking into account the}} gender. It is known that <b>regulation</b> <b>systems</b> disbalance and low HRV bring to decrease of life quality and longevity. At the sample of 217 university students (112 men) were measured HRV indexes, personality types by MMPI, defense mechanisms by Life Style Index and healthy habits by Health Style: A Self Test. It was found that men and women mostly have different correlations between HRV and psychological features. Only two general correlations were revealed: positive connection between lie scale and stress index (SI of HRV) and negative connection between psychological defense mechanism “projection” and sympathetic regulation. We conclude that men’s and women’s psychological features are differently connected with <b>regulation</b> <b>systems.</b> It can be explained by different adaptation strategies of men and women which were designed during evolution time. This fact should be taken into account at designing interventions for changing non-healthy behavior...|$|R

With {{the growing}} {{interest}} in clean energy, and the natural gas market maturity in China, {{there is a strong}} need to introduce as soon as possible a <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> covering the mid- and downstream natural gas business to ensure a harmonized approach to gas industry development. Adopting a consistent <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> for the mid- and downstream natural gas industry that establishes the fundamental rights, obligations and regulatory principles would provide a clear legal expression of the government’s policy and strategy for gas industry development and the ground rules for the operation of the gas industry. Such a <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> would, therefore, help create a more stable investment and operating environment, reduce uncertainty and investment risk, and consequently lower the cost of capital...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} the 20 th century, banking {{systems of}} the {{developed}} countries have undergone multiple changes, where the basic dimensions of those changes were integration, deregulation and globalisation of activities. The resultant of these factors' actions was the creation of highly risky banking environment, which acted as a catalyst of the world economic crisis effects. These effects brought to the forefront weaknesses of the banking sector and of the banking <b>regulation</b> <b>system,</b> while emphasizing the need for their redefining. Hence this work examines in detail concrete models of the banking <b>regulation</b> <b>systems</b> in the European Union area and in the United States of America. In addition, directions of redefining <b>regulation</b> <b>system</b> were highlighted, and also the relevant differences between banking business regulation in the European Union and in the United States of America...|$|R

Optimal yardstick competition reduces distortion of both effort and quality.
