Methods 　Twenty-one SD rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups (7 each) : ΔlasRΔrhlR-treated group, PAO 1 -treated group and <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> group. Biofilms (BF) were cultured in vitro, and the BF coated tube (infected respectively with Ps. aer PAO 1 strain, ΔlasRΔrhlR strain, or with asepsis) was inserted into the trachea to establish the rat model. The rats were sacrificed on the 7 th day after intubation. Colony count of lung tissue homogenate (cfu) and lung HE staining were performed, and IL- 10 content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), TGF-β 1 in lung tissue, and the expression of Foxp 3 mRNA in lung cells were determined. Results 　The bacterial counts were significantly higher in PAO 1 and ΔlasRΔrhlR groups than that in <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> group, and the counts were obviously higher in PAO 1 group (10 400. 00 ± 6313. 70 /g lung tissue) than that in ΔlasRΔrhlR group (975. 00 ± 559. 97 /g lung tissue, P< 0. 05). There was no significant pathological changes in lung tissue in <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> group, while the bronchi and blood vessels in PAO 1 group were infiltrated by {{a large number of}} inflammatory cells and complicated with alveolar septum thickening and local abscess and necrosis. The pathological changes were milder in ΔlasRΔrhlR group than in PAO 1 group; the expression of Foxp 3 mRNA was higher in the two Ps. aer infected groups than that in <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> group (0. 65 ± 0. 32), and it was significantly higher in PAO 1 group (4. 62 ± 1. 07) than in ΔlasRΔrhlR group (2. 15 ± 1. 43, P< 0. 05). The accumulated optical density value of TGF-β 1 was significantly higher in the two Ps. aer infected groups than in <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> group (3721. 66 ± 1412. 95), and significantly higher in PAO 1 group (65 090. 56 ± 33 956. 54) than that in ΔlasRΔrhlR group (28 861. 99 ± 10 826. 96, P< 0. 05); the level of IL- 10 was significantly higher in the two Ps. aer infected groups than in that of <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> group (57. 43 ± 22. 13 ng/ ml), and significantly higher in PAO 1 group (188. 07 ± 57. 01 ng/ml) than in ΔlasRΔrhlR group (93. 31 ± 17. 26 ng/ml, P< 0. 05). Conclusion 　Ps. aer QS system lasR/rhlR gene may promote inflammation, up-regulate the Foxp 3 expression and increase the TGF-β 1 and IL- 10 levels in lung tissue, which may prompt the protraction and persistence of infection.

Microbial transformation of trinitrotoluene (TNT) in phics. contaminated soil was investigated in this research. A Bacillus sp., isolated from soil obtained from an army ammunition facility, was used to enhance the rate of TNT removal over a 360 day test period. The soil treatments in this study included: (1) the Bacillus sp., (2) the existing indigenous microorganisms, and (3) a <b>sterile</b> <b>control.</b> The disappearance of TNT, as measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), was compared to the reduction in mutagenic activity of hexane:acetone solvent extracts, as measured in the Salmonella/microsome assay with the histidine requiring TA 98 tester strain. The results indicated a similar TNT removal rate in all three treatments. The TNT in the microbial treatments started at approximately 47 [] 13 mg g[] soil. By day 360, this concentration was reduced to 28 [] 10 mg g soil in the Bacillus sp the indigenous microbial treatment. The <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> treatment and 26 [] 8 mg g[] which was reduced to 22 [] 2 started with a day 0 TNT concentration of 31 [] 6 mg g [] day 360.

40|$|High {{levels of}} heavy metals {{have been found}} in the {{surroundings}} of the closed uranium (U) mine in Ranstad in southern Sweden. These findings cannot be explained entirely by abiotic processes. It was not until recently that biology was taken into account in the discussion about mobilization of metals at this site. It is well known that bacteria produce short-chain organic acids and element-specific ligands (siderophores) that are able to change pH and enhance chelation, which results in increased mobilization of many trace elements. Other (nonessential) elements, such as thallium (Tl), lanthanides, and actinides, may also be mobilized as a result of such bacterial action. This paper describes the mobilization of U and other elements from U ores by bacteria. Three common siderophore-producing bacterial species, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, were incubated in a chemically defined medium supplemented with tailings material with a content of 0. 0013 % U by weight, which had been exposed to natural weathering for 30 years. Nonleached U ore (0. 61 % U by weight) from the same area was incubated with P. fluorescens and S. putrefaciens for comparison. P. fluorescens grown with ore caused a change in pH in the growth medium from 4. 7 to 9. 3, which was significantly higher than for the other two species, for which pH was about 5. 2. P. fluorescens was the only species that thrived and mobilized measurable amounts of U from the two ores, leaching out 0. 001  0. 005 % of the total amount of U from both. The release of U is attributed to the production of pyoverdine chelators, since U could not be detected either in <b>sterile</b> <b>controls</b> or in the experiments with the other two bacteria. P. fluorescens also doubled the chromium (Cr) concentration in solution as compared with the <b>sterile</b> <b>controls,</b> whereas P. stutzeri and S. putrefaciens caused a five to sixfold increase in Cr concentration. Thallium, cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and vanadium (V) concentrations initially resembled those in the <b>sterile</b> <b>controls,</b> but from day 2 of the experiment, a decrease was observed. The difference in leaching behavior between the bacteria used in this study is likely to have been due to the production of different chelators rather than being an effect of pH, since many metals have low solubility at neutral to alkaline pH. This study using laboratory incubations shows that mobilization of U from ore can occur aerobically at neutral to alkaline conditions, which may be an important process behind the high content of heavy metals in the surroundings of the closed U mine at Ranstad...|$|R

The secretion of a 20 amino acid polyaspartate pep-tide by an engineered Bacillus subtilis WB 600 /pBE 92 -Asp biofilm slightly reduced the corrosion rate of the pas-sive aluminum alloy at pH 6. 5; however, the secretion of γ-polyglutamate by a Bacillus licheniformis biofilm re-duced the corrosion rate by 90 % (compared to the B. sub-tilis WB 600 /pBE 92 biofilm which did not secrete polyas-partate or γ-polyglutamate).

40|$|Bioleaching of a marmatite {{flotation}} concentrate by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans {{was carried out}} at 35 degreesC and an initial pH of 2. 0 on an orbital shaker at 160 min(- 1). Experimental {{results indicated that the}} adapted strains markedly increased the dissolution rate of marmatite when compared with the <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> and the original strains. The fact that Fe 3 + ions {{played a key role in}} the dissolution of marmatite was demonstrated by the chemical leaching of the concentrate with different concentrations of Fe 3 + ions. The main role of the microorganisms was to oxidize Fe 2 + ions into Fe 3 + ions during the bioleaching process. S. E. M. observations showed the morphological features of the mineral sample and leach residues. The cross-section image of residue particles revealed two different regions, a periphery consisting of reaction products and an undissolved core. It was shown by X-ray diffraction and EDX analysis that the leach residues were composed of elemental sulfur, precipitate of jarosite and undissolved mineral impurities. These facts suggested that the elemental sulfur formed was not completely oxidized and dissolved only partially in the marmatite bioleaching even in the presence of bacterial strains. The sulfur product coated the residue particles and negatively affected the dissolution of marmatite. The marmatite was dissolved preferentially during the bioleaching process by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, as compared with other sulfide minerals such as pyrite and galena in the concentrate.

However, benzene, ethylbenzene, meta- and para-xylene concentrations were not significantly reduced after 42 days of operation. Following this experiment, low dissolved oxygen (90 %), and more than 25 % of the benzene, 40 % of the ethylbenzene, 50 % of the meta- plus para-xylenes and 60 % of the ortho-xylene were removed after several months of operation...|$|R

Seedlings of wild- harvested C. cujete were established in vitro and used as the starting material {{for the establishment of}} axenic cultures. Shoots were proliferated from nodal segments and were maintained over a period of more than 2 years by sequential subculture on a medium containing 1. 0 mu mol l(- 1) kinetin. De novo regeneration was induced on petiole sections cultured onto a medium containing thidiazuron in combination with 2, 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Axenic cultures were also used to test the efficiency of three different cultivation systems for production of biomass of C. cujete. Growth of plantlets in a temporary immersion bioreactor resulted in significant increases in biomass, leaf number, shoot height and transplant efficiency. Plantlets grown in the bioreactors were acclimatized under greenhouse conditions. Together, these experiments have established optimized parameters for propagation and growth of C. cujete plantlets in a <b>sterile</b> <b>controlled</b> environment for biochemical characterization and production of high- quality medicinal products.

40|$|The role of microorganisms, e. g. bacteria, {{algae and}} fungi, in {{corrosion}} is a well-established field known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) 1. MIC {{can lead to}} localized material degradation with corrosion rates of orders of magnitude higher than would normally be expected from standard abiotic corrosion. MIC {{has been found to}} affect a wide range of industries such as maritime, oil and gas production and fire sprinkler water systems. The existing literature on MIC is somewhat complex and confusing because bacterial activity at metal surfaces has been shown to both increase and in some cases reduce corrosion rates 2 - 4. Many theories about possible mechanisms of MIC exist, with the process depending on both the type of microorganisms involved and the environmental conditions experienced. Metallurgical features have also been shown {{to play an important role}} in the initial attachment of microorganisms to metal surfaces and subsequent corrosion. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of different host media on the initial attachment of Escherichia coli bacteria and subsequent corrosion of 1010 carbon steel coupons. Nutrient broth and minimal media with different carbon sources and phosphate concentrations were used as test solutions in aerobic conditions. The results showed that initial bacterial attachment (60 min) to carbon steel coupons increased with time in all media tested. However, the rate and magnitude of attachment was medium dependent. Both short term (up to 12 h) and relatively longer term (up to 4 weeks) immersion studies showed accelerated corrosion of carbon steel coupons in all minimal media inoculated with E. coli compared to the <b>sterile</b> <b>controls.</b> In contrast, corrosion inhibition was observed in E. coli inoculated nutrient broth medium compared to the <b>sterile</b> <b>controls.</b> These trends were consistent in corresponding cell-free spent media. Mass-loss measurements were also consistent with microscopic observations of the metal surface at different time intervals, indicating that uniform corrosion had occurred. Overall, the results suggest that the host medium play a critical role in the ability of a single type of bacteria to either accelerate or inhibit corrosion of carbon steel...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of several field and {{greenhouse}} projects designed to improve understanding of native plants and their association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a restoration context. At a site near Los Olivos, California, we tested the erosion control benefits of two live mycorrhizal amendments and a <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> on a filled embankment. We also evaluated whether the responses vary by the method of application. After three years of field data, {{we find that the}} native inoculum cultured from a nearby donor site outperformed a commercially available product in reducing soil erosion. We also tested the utility of applying of a commercial mycorrhizal inoculant as specified by the vendor for use in restoring a cut slope lacking topsoil. We find no evidence for such a benefit, and conclude that other soil amendments and restoration practices should be employed when a cut slope restoration is necessary. We used an area in San Mateo County, California to investigate some of the biophysical changes that occur when native topsoil is excavated and stockpiled, and to identify whether topsoil can be managed to maintain or improve its viability as a growth medium for native plants whil...|$|E

This study proposed coupling two different treatment technologies, chemical dehalogenation using potassium polyethylene glycol (KPEG) and bioremediation, to optimize the destruction and detoxification of PCB-contaminated soil. Changes in toxicity over time were monitored through the use of the Salmonella/microsome assay and the E. coli prophage induction assay. In order to examine the efficacy of integrating chemical dehalogenation and bioremediation, a greenhouse (microcosm) study was conducted. Three different treatment conditions were examined in the study: (1) chemical dehalogenation by KPEG; (2) inoculation with PCB-degrading bacteria (Alcaligenes eutrophus H 850); and (3) chemical dehalogenation with inoculation of PCB-degrading bacteria. Samples were taken at day 0, 90, and 180. Changes in the composition of specific PCB congeners (one trichlorobiphenyl, two tetrachlorobiphenyls, two pentachlorobiphenyls, and one heptachlorobiphenyl) were monitored by gas chromatograph-electron capture detection following treatment. The toxicity of residual PCB congeners following treatment was monitored using the Salmonella/microsome and E. coli prophage induction bioassays. Data collected in this study include solvent extractable organics for untreated and treated soils, biological test data for the two microbial genotoxicity assays, and PCB concentrations for the six congeners being monitored. Results indicated that KPEG was not appreciably degraded in the soil as 69 % more residue was extracted from the samples treated with KPEG than from the <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> soils at day 0 and day 180. There was no decline in total solvent extractable organics in the <b>sterile</b> <b>control</b> soils or the KPEG treated soils over the study period. The soils receiving bacterial treatment alone did show decreases in extractable organics over time, with the exogenous bacterial treatments showing a decrease in extractable organics of 29 % and the indigenous treatment showing a decrease of 43 % over the study period. The genotoxicity of the soil for all treatment conditions was unchanged over the study period. All samples from treated soils were non-genotoxic in both bioassays at all sampling times. The PCB concentrations in the KPEG treated boxes did show a slightly higher level of PCB degradation than their non-KPEG treated counterparts. No decrease in the concentrations of the two pentachlorinated biphenyls was seen in the soils treated with bacteria only. Based on these results, KPEG did not appreciably enhance the degradation of PCBs under the conditions used in this study. Further research on the optimal parameters for KPEG dehalogenation are needed in order to make this a feasible method for the destruction of PCBs in soil...|$|E
40|$|Background: Microbial {{ecology of}} phlebotomine sand flies {{is not well}} {{understood}} although bacteria likely {{play an important role}} in the sand fly biology and vector capacity for Leishmania parasites. In this study, we assessed the significance of the microbial community of rabbit feces in oviposition and larval development of Lutzomyia longipalpis as well as bacterial colonization of the gut of freshly emerged flies. Methods: Sterile (by autoclaving) and non-sterile (control) rabbit feces were used in the two-choice assay to determine their oviposition attractiveness to sand fly females. Bacteria were identified by amplification and sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene with universal eubacterial primers. <b>Sterile,</b> <b>control</b> (non-sterile), and sterilized and inoculated rabbit feces were used to assess the significance of bacteria in L. longipalpis development. Newly emerged adult flies were surface-sterilized and screened for the bacterial population size and diversity by the culturing approach. The digestive tract of L 4 sterile and control larvae was incubated with Phalloidin to visualize muscle tissues and DAPI to visualize nuclei. Results: Two-choice behavioural assays revealed a great preference of L. longipalpis to lay eggs on rabbit feces with an active complex bacterial community (control) (85. 8 % of eggs) in comparison to that of sterile (autoclaved) rabbit feces (14. 2 %). Bioassays demonstrated that L. longipalpis larvae can develop in sterile rabbit feces althoug...|$|E

A current of approximately 11 uA cm-z {{was applied for}} 72 h while bacteria were allowed to colonize the electrode in a closed system, in artificial seawater under anaerobic conditions. Once the applied current was removed, the resultant galvanic urrent was monitored and a flow of nutrients resumed to an open system. Only a co-culture ofS RB and Vibrio sp. maintained a current of approximately 3 ~A cm 2 for> 2110 h. No current was maintained with purc axenic ultures or in <b>sterile</b> <b>controls.</b> Bacterial counts revealed that the resultant current was dependent on the number and type of bacteria on both the anode and cathode. Itwould appear that SRB are necessary on the cathode, leading to high charge transfer resistance above 100 kl ~ cm ~,while a mixed consortium is necessary on the anodc giving low charge transfer resistance below 1 k[~ cm:. These results would appear to give further cvidence for the previously proposed cathodic depolarization theory as a mechanism for MIC and for another anodic reaction involving amixed consortium...|$|R
