In the study, steckling weight (main-plot) in three levels including 100, 100 - 200 and 200 - 300 g and planting density (sub-plot) in three levels including 40, 50 and 60 cm were used in a split-plot experiment based on the RCBD (Randomized Complete Blocks Design) with 5 replications. The measured characteristics were morphological and qualitative (velocity and uniformity of germination) characters, seed size distribution and monogerm seed percentage. According to the results of the experiment, the effect of planting density on the auxiliary branches No. and seed yield was significant at the probability levels of 1 and 5 %, respectively.

Further attempts at turning on a non-zero Hawking temperature by introducing additional matter have proved unsuccessful. This suggests that one must remove the null Killing vector in order to obtain a horizon. We provide a perturbative argument indicating that this is in fact possible...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{formation}} of non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) in the chick embryo infected with influenza virus have been analyzed. It was shown by the use of combined in ovo-deembryonation technics that little or no NIHA is released following infection with small doses of standard virus during the most active and constant growth periods of the virus extending to about the 36 th hour of incubation {{in spite of the fact}} that multiple infection of cells must have taken place in the latter half of that period. A slight decrease in the ID 50 /HA ratios of the yields obtained after the 36 th hour, coinciding with the falling off of virus production and release may possibly be explained in terms of inactivation of completed virus or leakage of as yet incompleted virus from damaged cells. Exposure of the entodermal cells of the allantois of eggs deembryonated shortiy after injection of saturation or near saturation inocula of <b>standard</b> <b>seed</b> to large quantities of infectious virus added to the media at various times after infection and not extending over more than 2 hours resulted in a decrease of the ID 50 /HA ratios of the progenies only during the first 2 or possibly 4 hours after the primary inoculation. Later addition did not influence the yields. As discussed, such sudden and heavy exposures of cells are not expected to occur during the infectious process induced by small inocula of <b>standard</b> <b>seed.</b> The possible role of destruction of cell receptors in NIHA production has been analyzed in several ways. The addition of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) to the media of deembryonated eggs after near saturation inocula of standard seeds, if anything, increased the ID 50 /HA ratios of the progenies, and that only when added during the first few hours following infection, presumably by reducing the changes for high multiplicity of infection of cells. In contrast, ultraviolet-inactivated virus, which retains its enzymatic activity, lowered, if anything, the ID 50 /HA ratios of the progenies, when present in the media of deembryonated eggs from the 2 nd to 4 th or possibly 6 th hour after infection. Excessive amounts of irradiated virus may still cause some degree of interference under these conditions. Later addition of irradiated viruses were without effect with respect to NIHA production or interference. In attempts to alter the cell receptors prior to infection by potassium periodate (KIO 4), it was noted that the addition of glycerol led to the appearance and partial retention for at least 24 hours of substances in the allantoic fluids which were capable of inactivating considerable proportions of standard virus. These data indicate that destruction of external cell receptors plays little if any role in NIHA production. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E

One of the key risks of projected climate change is its effect on Eastern Australian rainforests. The interaction of climate change with other threats, such as weeds and habitat fragmentation, is thus likely to impact on already vulnerable environments such as the World Heritage listed Gondwana Rainforests of S.

30|$|The {{utilization}} of inoculants containing Azospirillum {{is becoming more}} popular due to increasing reports of expressive gains in grain yields. However, incompatibility with pesticides used in seed treatments represents a main limitation for a successful inoculation. Therefore, {{in this study we}} searched for alternatives methods for seed inoculation of maize and wheat, aiming to avoid the direct contact of bacteria with pesticides. Different doses of inoculants containing Azospirillum brasilense were employed to perform inoculation in-furrow, via soil spray at sowing and via leaf spray after seedlings had emerged, in comparison to seed inoculation. Experiments were conducted first under greenhouse controlled conditions and then confirmed in the field at different locations in Brazil. In the greenhouse, most parameters measured responded positively to the largest inoculant dose used in foliar sprays, but benefits could also be observed from both in-furrow and soil spray inoculation. However, our results present evidence that field inoculation with plant-growth promoting bacteria must consider inoculant doses, and point to the need of fine adjustments to avoid crossing the threshold of growth stimulation and inhibition. All inoculation techniques increased the abundance of diazotrophic bacteria in plant tissues, and foliar spray improved colonization of leaves, while soil inoculations favored root and rhizosphere colonization. In field experiments, inoculation with A. brasilense allowed for a 25  % reduction in the need for N fertilizers.

Little or no non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) were found when both the "undiluted passage " (UP) or heated <b>standard</b> (ST) <b>seeds</b> were diluted 100 - to 1000 -fold prior to injection and virus material of near standard composition was obtained. However, there exist also considerable {{differences between the two}} types of seed preparations with respect to the progenies they produce. The yields from UP seeds never revealed ID~ 0 /I-IA ratios lower than 10 ~, whereas those derived from heated ST virus showed ratios as low as 101. On the other hand, the ratios obtained in the first few undiluted passages decreased by as much as 2 log 10 unites below those of the seeds used (2 - 4), while the yields of heated standard virus revealed always ratios equal to or greater than those of the inocula (1). This became more evident when UP and heated ST seeds were compared on the basis of equal IDs 0 and HA concentrations. Both yielded similar quantities of HA, but the former produced considerably less infectious virus. It is the purpose of this report to present data on some of the quantitative aspects of passages of standard virus which had been heated at 37 °C. for increasing periods of time. The results indicate that the inactivated virus in the inocula interferes with second infectious cycles but does not significantl...|$|R
40|$|Eight lots of heifers {{are being}} used in the current test. All eight lots have been wintered on a daily ration of 20 pounds Atlas sorgo silage, full access to prairie hay in racks, and 8 protein supplement. Dehydrated brome grass and {{dehydrated}} alfalfa pellets and a combination of dehydrated brome grass and cottonseed meal were compared with the <b>standard</b> oil <b>seed</b> meals and with mustard seed meal. In addition to the above ration, lots 1 to 5 inclusive received 2 pounds ground shell corn...|$|R
