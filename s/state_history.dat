40|$|As {{education}} focuses increasingly on standards based assessment, {{social studies}} must be examined for its integration of Black History in the United <b>States</b> <b>History</b> curriculum. Using a Critical Race Theory lens, this directed content analysis attempts {{to examine the}} Florida Standards for United <b>States</b> <b>History</b> to determine if and how Black History is integrated into United <b>States</b> <b>History</b> courses. The study also makes use of Banks’ (1994) “levels of integration” to explore {{the degree to which}} this is accomplished. In addition, lesson plans created and/or endorsed by the state of Florida are analyzed for their inclusion of Black History. Data and analysis from this study demonstrate that while Black History is integrated to varying degrees across the K- 12 United <b>States</b> <b>History</b> Florida Standards, the “levels of integration” (Banks, 1994) and topics covered do not offer a complete historical narrative. Similarly, while the lesson plans approved by the state of Florida often reflect a higher “level of integration” (Banks, 1994) and historical understanding, the limited topics of slavery and the Civil Rights Movement prevent students from seeing the development of Black History across the continuum of United <b>States</b> <b>History.</b> Further, the findings suggest that standards should be developed that directly address the role race and racism play {{in the development of the}} United States. These findings can be useful to both administrators and teachers looking to develop standards which help form an accurate historical understanding of the development of the United States. The study recommends that United <b>States</b> <b>History</b> courses and <b>state</b> standards in United <b>States</b> <b>History</b> focus on the role racism has played in developing the United States, include the voices of people of color, and focus on social justice in the United <b>States</b> <b>History</b> curriculu...|$|R

Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. The heightened precautions were {{due in part}} to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24in (610mm) in the town of Ewan. This would make the storm the wettest in <b>state</b> <b>history.</b> The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. Damage in the state amounted to $4million. Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves.

5|$|Reports of a {{potentially}} destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low-lying areas to evacuate {{prior to the}} storm moving inland. Offshore, the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge, peaking at 6.4ft (1.95m) on {{the western edge of}} Lake Pontchartrain. The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana's outlying islands, inundating resorts. Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage, primarily in Texas, though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the U.S. Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds. However, much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low-lying areas, setting off record floods. Rainfall peaked at 37.5in (953mm) in Miller Island off Louisiana, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in <b>state</b> <b>history.</b> Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana observed record 24-hour rainfall totals for the month of August {{as a result of the}} slow-moving hurricane. Property, livestock, and crops – especially cotton, corn, and pecan crops – were heavily damaged. Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall.
