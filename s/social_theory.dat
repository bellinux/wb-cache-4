5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to <b>social</b> <b>theory</b> is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in <b>social</b> <b>theory,</b> and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist r√©gime.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical <b>social</b> <b>theory.</b> In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} social media encourages {{more and more}} users to participate in various online activities and produces data in an unprecedented rate. Social me-dia data is big, linked, noisy, highly unstructured and in-complete, and differs from data in traditional data mining, which cultivates a new research field- social media mining. <b>Social</b> <b>theories</b> from <b>social</b> sciences are helpful to explain so-cial phenomena. The scale and properties of social media data {{are very different from}} these of data social sciences use to develop <b>social</b> <b>theories.</b> As a new type of social data, social media data has a fundamental question- can we ap-ply <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> to <b>social</b> media data? Recent advances in computer science provide necessary computational tools and techniques for us to verify <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> on large-scale so-cial media data. <b>Social</b> <b>theories</b> have been applied to mining social media. In this article, we review some key social theo-ries in mining social media, their verification approaches, in-teresting findings, and state-of-the-art algorithms. We also discuss some future directions in this active area of mining social media with <b>social</b> <b>theories.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Current {{psychiatric}} {{practice is}} being influenced by {{advances in the}} field of molecular biology, genetic studies, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacology and the approach has become "biological. " <b>Social</b> <b>theories</b> of mental illness had once revolutionized the field of psychiatry and are currently being somewhat ignored under the dazzle of biological sciences. Main <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> are functionalism, interpersonal theory, attachment theory, stress theory, and labeling theory. Each of these theories had tried to explain the genesis of psychiatric disorders in their own way. However, each theory has its own limitations and critique. Still, for a holistic approach to treat persons with mental illness, it is essential to take a biopsychosocial approach which can only be done if one understands the contribution and relevance of <b>social</b> <b>theories.</b> Nonpharmacological management has been the cornerstone of treatment of any psychiatric disorder and <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> also form the basis of various nonpharmacological modes of treatment. Overall, <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> are still very relevant in current psychiatric practice and should not be neglected. Efforts should be made to integrate <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> with other theories of mental illness for better understanding and treatment...|$|R

40|$|There are {{fundamental}} {{differences in the}} epidemiological patterns of AIDS in Africa and the United States. A number of theories have been advanced to explain these differences. These theories may {{be divided into two}} basic approaches, theories based upon biological explanations and <b>theories</b> based upon <b>social</b> explanations. Biological based theories include a socio-biological explanation and a natural history explanation. The <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> may be divided into three theories which are historical/materialist in their explanation of AIDS in Africa and one theory which is primarily idealist and cultural in its explanation. The present article critically examines these biological and <b>social</b> <b>theories.</b> It argues that the biological theories lack scientific support, lack sufficient evidential support, have an inequality of cause and effect, and fail to integrate the micro/macro. This article argues that the <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> also have some major difficulties including, in some cases, a failure to integrate the micro/macro and a lack of adequate or sufficient causation to produce the massive epidemic of AIDS in Africa. There are difficulties with the quality of evidence and support for the <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> and more research needs to be conducted, particularly in the form of retrospective studies, to determine the validity of various <b>social</b> <b>theories</b> which attempt to explain the epidemiological patterns of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. ...|$|R
