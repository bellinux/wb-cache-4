The Finnish-American cartoonist Klaus Nordling featured the Baron in a weekly Baron Munchausen comic <b>strip</b> <b>from</b> 1935 to 1937, and in 1962, Raspe's text was adapted for Classics Illustrated #146 (British series), with both interior and cover art by the British cartoonist Denis Gifford.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force struck Egyptian air fields, {{destroying}} much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>from</b> Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{played in}} an all blue <b>strip</b> <b>from</b> their {{formation}} until 1884, when they adopted {{a red and}} white halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red and white stripes in the 1887–88 season. Their badge included a ship, {{the upper part of}} the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red and white stripes. In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background of red and white stripes.|$|E

40|$|Aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> spontaneously {{hypertensive}} (SH) rats {{relax in}} calcium-free physiological medium and contract to approximately 60 % of maximum when calcium is again {{restored to the}} medium. In vivid contrast, the resting tension of aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> normal rats is unaffected by manipulation of the calcium concentration of the bathing medium. These findings, {{as well as the}} reduced sensitivity of aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> SH rats to norepinephrine and the observation that aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> SH rats relax at a faster rate in calcium-free medium in comparison with aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> normal rats, are consistent with the hypothesis that vascular smooth muscle membranes from SH rats leak calcium at a rate that is only partially compensated by the calcium pump...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} human {{inhabitants of}} Chiapas were foragers {{living in the}} northern highlands and along the coastal <b>strip</b> <b>from</b> approximately 6000 BC until about 2000 BC. For approximately the last two millennia BC, {{the majority of the}} territory that is now covered by the state of Chiapas was occupied by Zoque-speaking peoples. Gradually, Mayan-speakers began to make inroads from the east and, from about 200 AD, Chiapas was divided roughly equally between the Zoques in the western half and Maya in the eastern half; this distribution continued up to the time of the Spanish conquest.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied {{engineering}} at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant {{professor of physics at}} the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum <b>strip</b> <b>from</b> the laboratory's cyclotron deflector in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|The Aouzou dispute was {{concluded}} for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ {{by a majority}} of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing an agreement as early as 4 April concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and final transfer of the <b>Strip</b> <b>from</b> Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were done}} to {{determine}} the influence of gender and the oestrous cycle on rat urinary bladder contractility in response to cholinergic stimulation. Bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> female rats responded to high frequency stimulation with smaller contractile responses than did <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> males, and to low concentrations of carbachol with greater responses. The decreased responsiveness of bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> female rats to electrical field stimulation can be primarily attributed to the rats in the oestrous stage of the oestrous cycle. Bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> female rats in all stages of the oestrous cycle were more sensitive to carbachol than those from males, but there were no differences in sensitivity to electrical field stimulation. The contractile responses of <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> both male and female rats to carbachol were antagonized by muscarinic antagonists with the following rank order of affinity (pA 2) estimates: 4 -DAMP>>pirenzepine>methoctramine, suggesting that the receptor mediating contraction was the M 3 subtype. There were no differences in pA 2 values between bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> male and female rats. The data indicate that responsiveness of bladder strips to electrical field stimulation and carbachol is altered in female rats in the oestrous stage of the oestrous cycle. Furthermore, gender influences the sensitivity of rat bladder to muscarinic stimulation...|$|R

5|$|Aymer {{was the son}} of William de Valence, son of Hugh X, Count of La Marche and Isabella of Angoulême. William was Henry III's {{half-brother}} {{through his}} mother’s prior marriage to King John, and as such gained a central position in the Kingdom of England. He had come to the earldom of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, granddaughter of William Marshal. Aymer was the third son of his family, so little is known of his birth and early years. He {{is believed to have been}} born some time between 1270 and 1275. As his father was on crusade with Lord Edward until January 1273, a date towards the end of this period is more likely. With the death in battle in Wales of his remaining brother William in 1282 (John, the elder brother, was dead in 1277), Aymer found himself heir to the Earldom of Pembroke. William de Valence died in 1296, and Aymer inherited his father's French lands, but had to wait until his mother died in 1307 to succeed to the Earldom. Through inheritance and marriages his lands consisted of– apart from the county palatine in Pembrokeshire– property spread out across England primarily in a <b>strip</b> <b>from</b> Gloucestershire to East Anglia, in south-east Ireland (Wexford), and French lands in the Poitou- and Calais areas.|$|E
