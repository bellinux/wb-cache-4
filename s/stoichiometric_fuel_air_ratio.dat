40|$|Petroleum based fuels play a {{vital role}} in rapid {{depletion}} of conventional energy sources along with increasing demand and also major contributors of air pollutants. Major portion of today’s energy demand in India is being met with fossil fuels. Hence it is high time that alternate fuels for engines should be derived from indigenous sources. As India is an agricultural country, there is a wide scope for the production of vegetable oils (both edible and non-edible) from different oil seeds. The present work focused only on non-edible oils as fuel for engines, as the edible oils are in great demand and far too expensive. The past work revealed that uses of vegetable oils for engines in place of diesel were investigated. The present investigations are planned after a thorough review of literature in this area. Experiments are carried out in a more popular single cylinder, water cooled engine. Major problems associated with vegetable oils are higher viscosities, lower heating values, rise in <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> and thermal cracking. I am focused on Utilization of Castor oils, their blends with diesel. In this process, the performance parameters of engine such as Brake thermal efficiency and volumetric efficiency are slightly decreased, Brake specific fuel consumption and Exhaust gas temperature are increased compared to diesel for all bio-diesels. 1...|$|E

An air blast type fuel injector with nineteen fuel injection points {{was used to}} provide a uniform spatial fuel air mixture. The range of inlet conditions where ignition occurred were: inlet air temperatures of 600 to 1000 K air pressures of 180 to 660 kPa, equivalence ratios (fuel air ratio divided by <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio)</b> from 0. 12 to 1. 05, and velocities from 3. 5 to 30 m/s. The duct was insulated and the diameter was 12 cm. Mixing lengths were varied from 16. 5 to 47. 6 and residence times ranged from 4. 6 to 107 ms. The fuel was no. 2 diesel.

Levels of unburned hydrocarbons were below 0. 50 gram per kilogram of fuel for both combustors and thus there was no detectable difference in the two methods of fuel injection. The contraswirl flame stabilizer did not produce the level of mixing obtained with a flat plate circular flame stabilizer. It did produce higher levels of oxides of nitrogen, which peaked at a <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 037.

The 72 -module swirl-can combustor reached a maximum average exit temperature of 2306 K with a combustion efficiency of 92 percent at an inlet air temperature of 894 K. At a constant inlet air temperature, maximum oxides of nitrogen emission index values occurred at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 037 for the 72 -module design and 0. 044 for the 120 -module design.

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient, quasi-one-dimensional supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) propulsion {{model has}} been produced {{to be used in}} hypersonic system design studies. The model uses a series of ordinary differential equations, solved using a 4 th order Runga-Kutta method, to describe the gas dynamics within the scramjet duct. Additional models for skin friction and wall heat transfer are also included. The equations were derived assuming an open thermodynamic system with equilibrium or simplified chemistry combustion models. The combustion was also assumed to be mixing rather than kinetically limited. This assumption allows simplification of the modeling and was justified when the model was compared against experimental results. Three test cases are used to validate the performance of the scramjet propulsion model: (1) modeling a reflected shock tunnel hydrogen fuelled scramjet experiment, (2) a continuous flow hydrogen fuelled scramjet ground test and (3) a segment of the HyShot II flight test.

40|$|The {{effect on}} the intake flow field, <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> mixing processes, {{thermodynamic}} performance and emissions output has been investigated {{for a range of}} valve operating profiles. A standard speed load point of 2000 rpm and 2. 7 bar IMEP 720 ° has been reached by throttling the intake whilst running standard cam profiles, by early closing of both inlet valves (EIVC) and by early closing of each inlet individually to generate bulk swirl motions within the cylinder. Data has been recorded at <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> for both direct injection and port fuelled operation. The valve profiles have been applied to two single cylinder homogeneous gasoline direct injection (GDI) spark ignition engines, developed to investigate the potential of controlling engine load by limiting the inducted air mass using fully variable valve timing (FVVT) to reduce pumping losses at part load. The first engine featured a full length optical liner, allowing 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the intake flow fields to be made, along with Mie imaging studies of the liquid fuel fraction. The second was a thermodynamic engine equipped to measure specific fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2, CO, NOX and THC. The work shows that fuel economy benefits can be gained by operating the engine with unthrottled EIVC operation.

40|$|The {{automobile}} market is, nowadays, {{characterized by}} a growing demand for cars equipped with diesel engines. This is because these offer smaller fuel consumption and better engine performance. A modern common rail turbocharged diesel engine provides performance equal to a gasoline engine, with same displacement, not turbo-charged but with a higher torque at lower engine speeds and with smaller fuel consumption. The methyl esters of vegetable oils, known as biodiesel, are receiving increasing interest because of their low environmental impact and their potential as an alternative fuel for diesel engines as they would not require any significant modification of existing engines. The modern common rail (CR) diesel engines are normally optimized for commercial diesel fuel. Consequently, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) calibrations are defined to offer the best compromise between performance and emissions. If the engine is fuelled with an alternative fuel with different characteristics (net heating value, <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> (a/f), density, viscosity, etc.), {{it is clear that}} the calibration must be modified. In past experiments the authors have demonstrated that it is possible to optimize emissions and performances of a light duty CR diesel engine fueled with a vegetable derived fuel (rapeseed methyl ester) pure or blended with commercial diesel fuel, changing ECU parameters. This paper will show a detailed analysis of combustion in a modern diesel engine fueled with biodiesel and in particular some of the influences on engine parameters will be analyzed in order to demonstrate how an optimization strategy of ECU parameters could be applied to a diesel engine, when it is fueled with different fuels, with different physical/chemical characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Lean {{premixed}} combustors, such {{as those}} used in industrial gas tuibines to achieve low emissions, are often susceptible to thennoacoustic combustion instabilities, which manifest themselves as pressure and heat release oscillations in the combustor. These oscillations can result in increased noise and decreased durability due to vibration and flame motion. A physically based nonlinear parametric model has been developed that captures this instability. It describes the coupling of combustor acoustics with {{the rate of heat}} release. The model represents this coupling by accounting for the effect of acoustic pressure fluctuations on the varying fuel/air ratio being delivered to the flame, causing a fluctuating heat release due to both <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> variations and flame front oscillations. If the phasing of the fluctuating heat release and pressure are proper, an instability results that grows into a limit cycle. The nonlinear nature of the model predicts the onset of the instability and additionally captures the resulting limit cycle. Tests of a lean premixed nozzle run at engine scale and engine operating conditions in the UTRC Single Nozzle Rig, conducted under DARPA contract, exhibited instabilities. Parameters from the model were adjusted so that analytical results were consistent with relevant experimental data from this test The parametric model captures the limit cycle behavior over a range of mean <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratios,</b> showing the instability amplitude (pressure and heat release) to increase and limit cycle frequency to decrease as mean <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> is reduced.
