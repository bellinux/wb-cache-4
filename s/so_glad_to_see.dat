500|$|Soon after, Olivia {{attended}} a showing of The Land of Heart's Desire, {{and found herself}} moved by the performance. She wanted to meet the [...] "tall and black haired" [...] poet and asked Johnson to invite Yeats to tea on 10May1894, adding in her handwriting to the invitation, [...] "I shall be <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you". In his Memoirs Yeats referred to her as [...] "Diana Vernon", writing, [...] "In this book I cannot giver her real name—Diana Vernon sounds pleasantly in my ears and will suit {{as well as any}} other".|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was giving}} up {{hope of finding}} Judy when she arrived in his new camp. [...] "I couldn’t believe my eyes. As I entered the camp, a scraggy dog hit me square between the {{shoulders}} and knocked me over! I’d never been <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the old girl. And I think she felt the same!" [...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They {{had been told that}} it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E

60|$|He did {{not seem}} to notice the lack of cordiality in my tone. He {{appeared}} <b>so</b> genuinely <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me again that I instantly became rather ashamed of my ill nature.|$|R

6000|$|She {{looked up}} at him with an {{expression}} of unalloyed pleasure. 'I am <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you. I was delighted when I heard you were coming.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am <b>so</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you,' {{she said}} to Ursula, in her slow voice, that was like an incantation. 'You and Rupert have become quite friends?' ...|$|E

60|$|Just {{then the}} sound of a bell coming up from the town below was a warning to both that the {{conversation}} must be broken off.

6000|$|The {{poor old}} slut, I am beholden {{to her for}} my living, and bound to stand by her, as I say to my mill knaves, in right and in wrong.
