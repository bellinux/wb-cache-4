40|$|<b>Sarmoxicillin,</b> an {{amoxicillin}} prodrug, is the methoxymethyl ester of hetamoxicillin. Esterification converted amoxicillin from an amphoteric to a cationic {{compound and}} resulted in a 30 - to 600 -fold increase in lipid partitioning. Oral absorption studies in normal subjects demonstrated that <b>sarmoxicillin</b> was only partially hydrolyzed by nonenzymatic and gut or hepatic first-pass metabolism and that significant quantities of intact ester appeared in the systemic circulation. <b>Sarmoxicillin</b> was converted to amoxicillin in plasma by hydrolysis of the acetone penicinate and the methoxymethyl ester bonds. Significant amoxicillin levels were demonstrated in saliva after administration of <b>sarmoxicillin,</b> but not amoxicillin, over a 250 - to 1, 000 -mg dose range. Differences in the absorption, distribution, or metabolism of amoxicillin were also evident in the lower plasma amoxicillin maximum concentration and area under the curve and longer half-life after <b>sarmoxicillin</b> administration. Differences {{in the distribution of}} this lipophilic ester could result in a significant increase in tissue penetration and subsequent therapeutic efficacy of amoxicillin when administered as <b>sarmoxicillin...</b>|$|E
