40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the experience of}} engaging senior clinical nurses as <b>surge</b> <b>staff</b> in a pandemic public health response and {{determine the effect of}} an on‑line training package and exercise participation on these individuals’ perceptions and confidence of being deployed during an influenza pandemic. Design: After action reviews, end of exercise surveys, and pre‑ and post‑training risk perceptions questionnaire completion. Setting: The study was conducted within the operational aspects of a public health exercise response to an influenza pandemic. Subjects: Clinical nurse consultants, nurse educators and nurse managers sourced from areas defined as not clinically critical during the early containment phase of an influenza pandemic response. Interventions: Four hour on‑line training package and a four day influenza pandemic exercise. Main outcome measures: Expert observation and self‑perceived appropriateness of <b>surge</b> <b>staff</b> and measured changes in risk perception. Results: Observers’ comments and after action reviews indicated {{that by the end of}} the deployment, day <b>surge</b> <b>staff</b> were able to perform public health surveillance functions competently. The end of day survey showed that the on‑line training package served as a useful reference document but alone was an inadequate means of equipping staff for deployment. Exercise pre‑ and post‑perceptions surveys found that self‑perceived knowledge and confidence in performing duties increased following the exercise from 46 % to 93 % (p< 0. 01) and from 46 % to 90 % (p< 0. 01), respectively. Conclusion: Clinical nurse consultants, nurse educators and nurse managers working within a health authority are an appropriate surge workforce during public health emergencies if provided with appropriate training and support...|$|E
40|$|Influenza {{identifies}} discrete {{stages of}} an Australian response to pandemic influenza, including DELAY and CONTAIN phases. 1 The {{objective of the}} DELAY phase is to prevent or slow the entry of the virus into Australia using border measures and increased vigilance for cases. Isolation and quarantine during pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza in NSW: the operational experience of public health units Abstract: During the DELAY and CONTAIN phases of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza in NSW, public health units needed to rapidly surge operations to manage the 3070 potential cases and 1894 contacts notified to them. The Incident Control System, NetEpi (the web-based multi-user access database), training to up-skill <b>surge</b> <b>staff,</b> and electronic communication were all integral to the outbreak response. Ongoing identification and training of <b>surge</b> <b>staff</b> would assist a timely and effective response to future large scale outbreaks. Investing and incorporating information technol-ogy tools into routine public health unit business to assist with communication, outbreak management and reporting will improve familiarity and capabil-ity within the network to respond to public health emergencies...|$|E
40|$|The 2014 - 2016 Ebola {{virus disease}} {{epidemic}} in West Africa highlighted {{challenges faced by}} the global response to a large public health emergency. Consequently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established the Global Rapid Response Team (GRRT) to strengthen emergency response capacity to global health threats, thereby ensuring global health security. Dedicated GRRT staff can be rapidly mobilized for extended missions, improving partner coordination and the continuity of response operations. A large, agencywide roster of <b>surge</b> <b>staff</b> enables rapid mobilization of qualified responders with wide-ranging experience and expertise. Team members are offered emergency response training, technical training, foreign language training, and responder readiness support. Recent response missions illustrate the breadth of support the team provides. GRRT serves {{as a model for}} other countries and is committed to strengthening emergency response capacity to respond to outbreaks and emergencies worldwide, thereby enhancing global health security. 29155672 PMC 571129...|$|E
40|$|CHDS State/LocalThis thesis {{addresses}} {{the role of}} the emergency department in planning for mass casualties during an emergency. The demand on hospital emergency departments has stretched the capacity for normal operations beyond their original design. Hospital surge capacity is not only complex, but affects every hospital emergency department in the country. Factors, such as hospital bed capacity, <b>surge</b> levels, <b>staffing</b> and the use of volunteers in time of emergency, all {{play a critical role in}} the ability and accessibility of the hospital to react during times of need. The recommendations provided are based on the analysis of county, state and federal plans along with case studies that provide a varied approach to emergency preparedness and {{the role of the}} hospital, focus on some of the facets of preparedness and the immediate need for emergency planning, training/exercising and communication in hospitals across America, and specifically, in hospitals in South Carolina.

40|$|The federal {{pandemic}} influenza plan predicts that 30 % {{of the population}} could be infected. The impact of this pandemic would quickly overwhelm the public health and health-care delivery systems in the U. S. and throughout the world. <b>Surge</b> capacity for <b>staffing,</b> availability of drugs and supplies, and alternate means to provide care must be included in detailed plans that are tested and drilled ahead of time. Accurate information on the disease must {{be made available to}} health-care staff and the public to reduce fear. Spokespersons must provide clear, consistent messages about the disease, including actions to be taken to contain its spread and treat the afflicted. Home care will be especially important, as hospitals will be quickly overwhelmed. Staff must be prepared ahead of time to assure their ability and willingness to report to work, and public health must plan ahead to adequately confront ethical issues that will arise concerning the availability of treatment resources. The entire community must work together to meet the challenges posed by an epidemic. Identification and resolution of these challenges and issues are essential to achieve adequate public health preparedness...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} public health Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) in the US, the European Union, the UK and Australia, and {{summarize}} the good practice {{for the improvement of}} National Health Emergency Response Command Center in Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission. MethodsLiterature review was conducted to explore the EOCs of selected countries. ResultsThe study focused on EOC function, organizational structure, human resources and information management. The selected EOCs had the basic EOC functions of coordinating and commanding as well as {{the public health}} related functions such as monitoring the situation, risk assessment, and epidemiological briefings. The organizational structures of the EOCs were standardized, scalable and flexible. Incident Command System was the widely applied organizational structure with a strong preference. The EOCs were managed by a unit of emergency management during routine time and <b>surge</b> <b>staff</b> were engaged upon emergencies. The selected EOCs had clear information management framework including information collection, assessment and dissemination. ConclusionsThe performance of National Health Emergency Response Command Center can be improved by learning from the good practice of the selected EOCs, including setting clear functions, standardizing the organizational structure, enhancing the human resource capacity and strengthening information management...|$|E

The Global RRT maintains resources and a multidisciplinary roster of CDC staff, both of which can rapidly mobilize to support CDC experts and partners responding to global public health concerns, within the US and abroad. The Global RRT maintains its operations from CDC Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia with a dedicated team of full-time staff from across the Agency. There are more than 300 senior and junior <b>surge</b> <b>staff</b> representing almost all Centers and the Office of the Director, with over 50 ready to deploy at short notice each month. Global RRT staff can remain in the field during an emergency response for up to six months. By the first year anniversary of its first deployment, Global RRT staff have spent approximately 3, 000 person-days in over 90 responses to cholera, yellow fever, Ebola, measles, polio, mass gatherings, and wildfires.
