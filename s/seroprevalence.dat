40|$|Leptospirosis is a {{bacterial}} disease that in pigs primarily causes reproductive disturbances. The {{disease is a}} zoonosis, i. e. it can be transmitted between animals and humans. Leptospirosis is spread worldwide, although it is of most importance in tropical regions where animal management and climate favour transmission and survival of the bacteria in the environment, such as the tropical Mekong delta (MD) in southern Vietnam. In the MD, reproduction disturbances in pigs due to infectious agents are of concern. This thesis investigates Leptospira infection among pigs in the MD with aspects on epidemiology, clinical affection and bacteriology. Such information is of importance if preventive measures are to be implemented. This study showed that leptospiral <b>seroprevalences</b> among sows were high and that {{a larger proportion of}} sows on small-scale farms compared with large-scale farms were seropositive. Few risk factors were found that could explain seropositivity in the sows. It was also found that the <b>seroprevalences</b> for some serovars were higher during the dry period compared with the wet period. Furthermore, some serovars were associated with impaired reproductive performance of the sows, such as an increased number of piglets born dead per litter and a longer weaning to service interval. Also, <b>seroprevalences</b> among fattening pigs at slaughter were high, and in these animals leptospires were demonstrated in a large number of kidneys with macro- and microscopic kidney lesions. One leptospiral serovar was isolated from a kidney. Taken together, Leptospira infection, indicated by seropositivity, is common among pigs in the MD, which may be explained by a favourable environment rather than certain risk factors. Small-scale farms are in closer contact with the surrounding environment than large-scale farms, which may explain the differences between the farming systems. Even in regions with high leptospiral <b>seroprevalences,</b> infection, as indicated by seropositivity, has a negative impact on the reproductive performance of sows. Furthermore, a large proportion of fatteners with macroscopic renal lesions carry the bacteria, which constitutes a health hazard for personnel at abattoirs and persons exposed elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{potential}} {{contamination of}} Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum oocysts {{in the human}} environment is a concern from the public health viewpoint. However, estimation of their <b>seroprevalences</b> in humans cannot be performed {{in a manner that}} distinguishes between oocysts and tissue cysts as a source of infection. Rabbits are considered popular pet animals in Japan that can acquire natural infections by the aforementioned parasites only through the ingestion of oocysts. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate the <b>seroprevalences</b> of T. gondii and N. caninum in pet rabbits in Japan as an indicator of the possible oocyst contamination in the environment surrounding human beings. Serum samples of 337 rabbits were examined by different serological methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to measure the titer of IgG and IgM antibodies. Samples revealed to be seropositive by ELISA were further analyzed by a latex agglutination test, Western blotting and an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The rates of seropositivity for T. gondii were 0. 89 % (3 / 337) and 0. 29 % (1 / 337) in IgG and IgM ELISA, respectively.
