5|$|Following {{his release}} from the Browns, Hornsby was unable to retire because he had lost <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> {{gambling}} over the years. He signed as a player-coach with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League in 1938 before leaving them to play for and manage the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association {{for the rest of}} the season. Hornsby then returned to the Orioles to manage them for 1939, but he did not return to the club following the season. Halfway through 1940, he signed to manage the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League. He led them from last place to the Texas League playoffs, where they fell to the Houston Buffaloes in four games. Hornsby began 1941 managing the Indians once again, but he resigned in the middle of the season. In November, he became the general and field manager of the Fort Worth Cats, also of the Texas league. Fort Worth finished in third place and made the playoffs in 1942, but they were eliminated in the first round by the Shreveport Sports.|$|E
5|$|The Venezuelan intern Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) {{falls in}} love with April (Aubrey Plaza), who convinces him she is feared and very powerful. Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go to movies with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they have <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> from oil, they can build {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E

5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E

25|$|The Punch years gave Mayhew the {{opportunity}} to meet talented illustrators who he later employed to work from daguerreotypes on London Labour and the London Poor.

His former running-mate, Frank McEnulty, stated:"Ted truly {{believed}} {{in trying to}} do what was best for the country and it is what had driven him to spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time, <b>money</b> and effort on his campaign and in support of the Reform Party." ...|$|R

25|$|When the Supreme Court Building {{opened in}} 1935, McReynolds, {{like most of}} the other justices, refused to move his office into the new building; he {{continued}} to work out of the office he maintained in his apartment. His reason was that with the country in the turmoil of the Great Depression, it was unconscionable to have spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> on a single building.|$|E
25|$|William Scot of Bavelaw {{purchased}} the barony {{and his son}} Lawrence divided the Mains of Kersland into two farms, Easter and Wester Kersland, feuing Easter to Robert Ker and Wester to James Kirkwood. Lawrence had a son Charles who borrowed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> against the feu-duties that upon his death the barony in 1801 was sold. At this time John Smith of Swindridgemuir {{purchased the}} mid-superiority.|$|E
25|$|With <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> readily {{available}} for investment, speculation was inevitable, {{particularly in the}} Tokyo Stock Exchange and the real estate market. The Nikkei stock index hit its all-time high on 29 December 1989 when it reached an intra-day high of 38,957.44 before closing at 38,915.87. The rates for housing, stocks, and bonds rose so much {{that at one point}} the government issued 100-year bonds. Additionally, banks granted increasingly risky loans.|$|E
60|$|George, as {{he heard}} this, at once {{determined}} that he must persuade Mr. Hart to include Mr. Walker's little account in that due to himself.

25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money.</b> That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|In May 1859, Colonel Wright made a {{scouting}} trip fifty {{miles up the}} Snake River, which joins the Columbia not far {{to the north of}} Wallula. Colonel Wright was the first steamboat to reach Lewiston, Idaho, 140 miles upriver from Wallula. In 1861 she ascended the Clearwater River to within two miles of the forks, accomplishing the downstream run of over 300 miles to Wallula in less than 24 hours. Thompson and Coe made <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> with the Wright that in the spring of 1860 they built a larger and more powerful steamer, the Tenino on the same route, afterward pooling both steamers with the Oregon Steam Navigation Company.|$|E
25|$|Instruments made {{mostly from}} plastic, {{including}} the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, {{emerged in the}} 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce {{is different from that}} of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.|$|E
50|$|Although the Hongwu era saw the {{introduction}} of paper currency, its development was stifled from the beginning.

25|$|Adding to his {{reputation}} {{was the fact}} that Liszt gave away much of his proceeds to charity and humanitarian causes. In fact, Liszt had made <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> by his mid-forties that virtually all his performing fees after 1857 went to charity. While his work for the Beethoven monument and the Hungarian National School of Music are well known, he also gave generously to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral, the establishment of a Gymnasium at Dortmund, and the construction of the Leopold Church in Pest. There were also private donations to hospitals, schools and charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. When he found out about the Great Fire of Hamburg, which raged for three days during May 1842 and destroyed much of the city, he gave concerts in aid of the thousands of homeless there.|$|E
25|$|The numbers {{involved}} in this cottage industry were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof. Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games. Housewives served up refreshments for sale and children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime. With <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the sidewalk into particular homes. By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of N. 20th Street.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1960, Valentino met Giancarlo Giammetti at the Café de Paris on the Via Veneto in Rome. One {{of three}} children, Giammetti {{was in his}} second year of {{architecture}} school, living at home with his parents in the haut bourgeois Parioli section of Northern Rome. That day Giammetti gave Valentino a lift home in his Fiat and a friendship, as well as a long-lasting partnership, started. The day after, Giammetti was to leave for Capri for vacation and, by coincidence, Valentino was also going there, so they met again on the island 10 days later. Giammetti would shortly thereafter abandon the University to become Valentino's business partner. When Giammetti arrived, the business situation of Valentino's atelier was in fact not brilliant: in one year he had spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> that his father's associate pulled out of the business, and had to fight against bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Lawyers said {{it might}} be {{difficult}} for them to recover those amounts from Metro-North and the MTA if the cause of the accident turned out to be Rockefeller's lapse at the controls, since there would be far less liability on their part. New York law further limits potential damages in cases like these. Victims' lawyers said their goal was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the <b>money</b> but making sure the railroad installed PTC.|$|R
