2500|$|Apart {{from the}} greater span, {{the wing of}} the Jantar 2 {{differed}} only from that of its predecessor by having less taper and a slight change of plan. [...] The leading edge remains straight and slightly swept, but the inner half-span has no sweep on the trailing edge, with the ailerons mounted on the forward <b>swept</b> <b>edge</b> of the outboard part. The wing construction {{is similar to that}} of the Jantar 1, all glass fibre with a single spar and glass cloth/foam sandwich skin. [...] There are mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes which extend both above and below the wing. [...] Its camber changing flaps are hingeless; instead the movement is provided by deflection of the upper wing surface. [...] Combined with a carefully sealed sliding joint in the lower surface, these elastic flaps minimise loss in lift due to leakage and abrupt shape changes. [...] The first two prototypes had two piece wings but later aircraft have further wing divisions at about 2.5m (8ft) from the wing tips for easier handling.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the comparison of}} the performance between two different designs of wind turbine blades; one is a straight {{and the other with}} a backward swept blade. The straight edge blade was constructed so that it is optimal on coming wind and rotation speeds with 7 m/s and 20 rpm. The blade has a length of 20 m and uses a constant airfoil cross section NACA 4412. The <b>swept</b> <b>edge</b> blade has the same characteristics as the straight edge except for the trajectory of the edge. Each cross section has the same dimensions and has at the same distance from the hub as its corresponding section in the straight edge blade. To test this new design the performance of both blades were measured using CFD at a wind speeds ranging 0 to 20 m/s. Comparisons were made for power generation and acoustic noise for both designs of the blades...|$|E
50|$|The Kria's {{cantilever}} wing was straight tapered {{over all the}} span except for elliptical tips, with an unswept leading edge and a forward <b>swept</b> trailing <b>edge.</b> There was no dihedral. The wings carried short span ailerons at the tips and undersurface airbrakes, which could be extended at 90° to the airflow, inboard. The tail surfaces, separated by 110°, had <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges</b> and rounded tips.|$|R

25|$|Many Mooney {{aircraft}} {{have the}} signature vertical stabilizer with its vertical leading <b>edge</b> and <b>swept</b> trailing <b>edge</b> {{that gives the}} illusion of being forward-swept.|$|R
5000|$|The Lignel 10 was {{powered by}} a [...] Renault 6Q-03 air-cooled, supercharged, {{inverted}} 6 cylinder inline engine. The cockpit, enclosed under multi-part glazing, placed the pilot over the wing trailing edge. The rear fuselage was raised to continue the canopy line, dropping gently away to the tail. Its fin and tailplane, the latter mounted at mid-fuselage, had straight, <b>swept</b> <b>edges</b> but rounded tips and carried round-edged, unbalanced control surfaces. The rudder extended down to the keel and worked in a small elevator cut-out.|$|R
50|$|Like the Sokol, the Scaut was a wood framed, fabric covered aircraft. Their shared {{straight}} {{tapered wing}} had a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> but no sweep on the trailing edge They had marked dihedral beyond {{a very short}} centre section. The fin also had a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> and carried a rounded rudder. The tailplane was set well to the rear and {{near the top of}} the fuselage with a single piece elevator; the rudder moved above it. The Skaut had fixed tricycle landing gear.|$|R
60|$|With heavy hearts, Dave and {{the others}} {{returned}} to the cabin. The water in the cove had now risen so high that it <b>swept</b> the <b>edge</b> of the lean-to.|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance and}} controllability of advanced, highly maneuverable supersonic aircraft {{can be enhanced}} by means of 'vortex management', which refers to the purposeful manipulation and reordering of stable and concentrated vortical structures due to flow separations from highly <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges</b> and slender forebodies at moderate-to-high angles-of-attack. Attention is presently given {{to a variety of}} results obtained in the course of experiments on generic research models at NASA Langley, clarifying their underlying aerodynamics and evaluating their performance-improvement potential. The vortex-management concepts discussed encompass aerodynamic compartmentation of highly <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges,</b> vortex lift augmentation and modulation, and forebody vortex manipulation...|$|R
50|$|The {{triangular}} {{delta wing}} has a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> {{while maintaining a}} sufficiently deep wing root for structural stiffness, and from {{the introduction of the}} French Dassault Mirage fighter it became a popular choice, with or without a tailplane.|$|R
5000|$|Delta: {{triangular}} planform with <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> {{and straight}} trailing edge.

Variants are: ...|$|R
50|$|Seating apart, the two {{variants}} {{were generally}} similar. The two surface wing, tapered in plan {{with a straight}} leading edge and a forward <b>swept</b> trailing <b>edge,</b> was braced from below on each side by a single strut, assisted by jury struts. The ailerons filled the whole span. The fuselage of the Phoenix was a completely open aluminium frame structure which carried the exposed pilot's seat, placing his head just below {{the leading edge of}} the wing and supporting the engine in pusher configuration immediately behind. The fuselage frame extended rearwards to carry a conventional tail with horizontal surfaces at the same height as the wing and an all-moving rudder with a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge,</b> extending below the tailplane aft of the rudder post. The rudder of the CII was <b>swept</b> on both <b>edges,</b> unlike that of the single seat version, and extended downwards further. The tricycle undercarriage had three similarly sized wheels mounted on short legs interconnected by a triangular frame. The front wheel was steerable from the rudder bar and the rear pair were differentially brakeable.|$|R
5000|$|After the Spitfire, Shenstone was Chief {{aerodynamicist}} on the Supermarine B.12/36 proposal. This specification {{was for a}} four engined {{heavy bomber}} and the Supermarine proposal used a wing with a highly <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge,</b> storing the bomb load in both the wing and fuselage ...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{distinction}} between types is blurred, for example the wings of many modern combat aircraft may be described either as cropped compound deltas with (forwards or backwards) <b>swept</b> trailing <b>edge,</b> or as sharply tapered swept wings with large leading edge root extensions (or LERX).|$|R
5000|$|To further improve {{handling}} and stability, the new UT-2M (modernized) variant {{was developed in}} 1941 and it replaced the original UT-2 in production. The wing planform was redesigned, with a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> and a straight trailing edge, and the vertical stabilizer was enlarged.|$|R
50|$|The San Francesco is a {{conventionally}} arranged single-engine, high-wing light aircraft. It has {{constant chord}} wings with rounded tips, built of wood with plywood leading edges and fabric covered. Each wing has a V-shaped pair of lift struts {{attached to the}} lower fuselage longerons and assisted by a single subsidiary strut from each lift strut upwards to the wing. The flat sided, fabric covered fuselage is a steel tube structure with wooden formers. The square tipped fin has a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> and a curved fillet; it carries a deep rudder with a straight trailing edge, which extends between the elevators {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage. The tailplane, with <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges</b> is wire-braced to the fin. All tail surfaces are fabric covered steel tube structures.|$|R
40|$|Meanflow {{solutions}} of 3 D {{supersonic flow}} past a cone at incidence and a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> wing {{have been obtained}} by thre methods, viz., boundary-layer, parabolized Navier-Stokes, and thin shear-layer Navier-Stokes solvers. The smoothness and accuracy of the solution profiles are compared {{with a view to}} applying the meanflow solution to boundary-layer stability analysis...|$|R
50|$|The G-27's {{empennage}} was conventional. A parabolic vertical tail, with a {{trim tab}} equipped balanced rudder, reached aft {{to the extreme}} fuselage. A small gap between fuselage and {{the bottom of the}} rudder allowed upward deflections of the balanced, tabbed elevators mounted on a tailplane with a strongly <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge,</b> positioned at mid-fuselage height.|$|R
50|$|The PL.3 had a {{low wing}} built entirely of wood, covered with plywood, {{tapering}} uniformly both in chord and thickness from wide, deep roots to rounded tips. The tail was conventional, the tailplane set at mid-fuselage with straight <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges</b> and carrying elevators with trim tabs. The fin was triangular, with a rounded rudder ending above the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The {{limousine}} had a conventionally {{laid out}} empennage. It had no fixed tailplane but its balanced elevator, {{with a slightly}} <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> and almost semi-circular, fabric-covered rear, was hinged at the extreme tail. The fin, built integral to the fuselage, was triangular and the fabric-covered rudder was rhomboidal, leaving a space below for elevator movement.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first version}} of the Arbalète was the Pa.60 which made its first flight on 5 June 1965. It was powered by a [...] Hirth HM 504 air-cooled, four cylinder, {{inverted}} inline engine, [...] which was totally enclosed within the flat sided fuselage with no side-scoops for cooling air, an arrangement which led to overheating. Its <b>swept,</b> straight <b>edged</b> fins were placed with their leading edges on the wing leading edges; they extended beyond the wing trailing edge via rounded tips to rudders with <b>swept,</b> curved trailing <b>edges</b> and trim tabs. The two side-by-side seats were enclosed by a long, wide two piece canopy. The main undercarriage legs of the Pa.60 Arbalète were located near the wing leading edge, immediately under the fins.|$|R

40|$|Part 3 of the Symposium {{proceedings}} contains papers addressing advanced airfoil development, flight research experiments, and supersonic transition/laminar {{flow control}} research. Specific topics include {{the design and}} testing of natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils, NLF wing gloves, and NLF nacelles; laminar boundary-layer stability over fuselage forebodies; the design of low noise supersonic/hypersonic wind tunnels; and boundary layer instability mechanisms on <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges</b> at supersonic speeds...|$|R
50|$|Vortex lift {{works by}} {{capturing}} vortices {{generated from the}} sharply <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> of the wing. The vortex, formed roughly parallel to {{the leading edge of}} the wing, is trapped by the airflow and remains fixed to the upper surface of the wing. As the air flows around the leading edge, it flows over the trapped vortex and is pulled in and down to generate the lift.|$|R
50|$|The AB-C.1 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with straight-edged, slightly tapered wings {{which had}} straight wing tips tips rounded at the leading edge. Ailerons {{extended to the}} tips. The tail surfaces had straight <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges</b> but had rounded trailing edges on the control surfaces. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and the rudder extended {{to the bottom of the}} fuselage, moving between separate elevators.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} upwind {{finite element}} technique that uses cell-centered quantities and implicit and/or explicit time marching {{was developed for}} computing hypersonic inviscid flows using adaptive unstructured grids. This technique was used to predict shock interference on a swept cylinder. An {{attempt was made to}} determine the flowfield and, in particular, the pressure augmentation caused by an impinging shock on the <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> of a cowl lip of an engine inlet...|$|R
2500|$|These trials {{ended in}} January 1930 and the A.10 {{went back to}} Saro's for modification. [...] Changes {{included}} a 3 in (76mm) shift aft of the main undercarriage to improve ground handling, a 1ft 9 in (533mm) fuselage extension and revised empennage.

50|$|The chord of Hoffman's {{own design}} spanned {{from the rear}} of the cowling along the entire {{fuselage}} of the aircraft. The thickness of the wing was up to 20 in at the root. From the top the wing appeared semi-circular with a slightly <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge.</b> The aircraft used a conventional taildragger configuration with retractable landing gear. The center section and controls were welded steel tubing, the rest was spruce wood with aircraft fabric covering.|$|R
50|$|The Vultur was a mixed-power design, {{combining}} an Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop in {{the nose}} with a Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet in the tail. It was a low-wing aircraft, with the wing featuring a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> and a straight trailing edge, folding at the middle. The aircraft had tricycle landing gear, with the main gear hinged in the wings just inside the wing fold and retracting towards the fuselage, the nose gear retracting backwards.|$|R
50|$|Like earlier Wibault designs, the Wib 210 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with {{a largely}} Duralumin structure and clad with narrow aluminium strips applied longitudinally. Its wings, mounted with mild dihedral, were straight edged and tapered with blunt wing tips. Full span ailerons were fitted. The triangular tailplane carried split elevators and the fin was angular, with a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> and square tip, bearing a rudder which extended down between the elevators to the keel.|$|R

25|$|Production {{aircraft}} {{differed in}} having the front elevator mounted on an upswept outrigger {{on the front}} of the nacelle. Additionally, the outer panels of the upper wing had a <b>swept</b> back leading <b>edge,</b> and were rigged with a slight dihedral.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{outline of}} the {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation of boundary layer instability mechanisms on a <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge</b> at Mach 3. 5 is presented. Transition is affected by wind tunnel noise only when roughness is present. Local bar-R sub * Reynolds number and k/eta sub * are useful correlation parameters {{for a wide range}} of free stream Mach numbers. Stability theory is in good agreement with the experimental cross flow vortex wavelength. These conclusions are briefly discussed...|$|R
50|$|The V.1 had a {{cantilever}} {{shoulder wing}} of thin section, built around four spars with plywood and fabric covering. Straight edged beyond the centre section, it tapered only {{slightly to the}} oblique tips. The tailplane had curved, <b>swept</b> leading <b>edges</b> and carried split elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. The fin was almost triangular, with a slightly convex leading edge; it carried a pointed rudder on a vertical hinge extending {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|High-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{of wooden}} construction, with closed cab, three engines, and a fixed landing gear. Sparless wing, with slightly <b>swept</b> leading <b>edge,</b> straight rear edge and rounded tips, was basing on a geodetical structure of crossing ribs. Crew {{sat in a}} cab before the wing. Next and below in the fuselage, under the wing, there was a cabin for 10 passengers, with rectangular windows and access doors in front and at the rear. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a tailwheel.|$|R
