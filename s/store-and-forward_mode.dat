There are Sercos III products {{currently on the}} market that support both modes. Likewise, Sercos III does not define whether a port should intelligently process UC telegrams, such as learn the network topology.|$|E
50|$|An {{adaptive}} switch is {{a network}} switch designed {{to operate in}} cut-through mode (cut-through switching) normally but if a port's error rate jumps too high, the switch automatically reconfigures the port to run in <b>store-and-forward</b> <b>mode.</b> This optimizes the switch's performance by providing higher speed cut-through switching if error rates are low but higher throughput store and forward switching if error rates are high.|$|E
40|$|Communication {{over the}} packet-switched {{networks}} such as IP networks {{is far more}} efficient and cost-effective than the circuit-switched networks such as PSTN. It is therefore desirable to use IP network as transport for circuit-switched applications such as voice and facsimile. However, voice transport over IP network is common. In this work, we have designed and implemented a facsimile gateway for the transmission of facsimile documents between two standard terminal devices connected to a telephone network using the IP network {{for part of the}} communication path and between a terminal device connected to a telephone network and an electronic mail service accesible via an IP network. Our design is based on the <b>store-and-forward</b> <b>mode</b> of transmission in which the facsimile document does not reach the destination before the sending terminal device terminates the facsimile call. So the sending terminal device will receive the confirmation of delivery to the recipient in a separate fax transm [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{bandwidth}} is elevating in today’s networks. However, security threats and attacks are increasing as well. We study how to maximize throughput and maintain secu- rity in (I) wireless and (II) wired communication networks. For throughput maximization, (I) we investigate the cases where applying Network Coding (NC) in a careless manner, could cause significant throughput degradation in multi-rate environments. Via extensive experiments and an analysis, we characterize the regimes where NC offers throughput ben- efits and those {{where it does}} not. We design PACE, a policy-aware coding enforcement logic, which allows a router to switch between NC and <b>store-and-forward</b> <b>modes</b> depending on link qualities. Our evaluations show that PACE could potentially offer network-wide throughput improvements of up to 350 %. (II) we propose a standards agnostic framework BOLT, that helps realize the throughput potential of Power Line Communication (PLC) {{to serve as a}} viable backhaul for local network connectivity. The design of BOLT is based on a comprehensive measurement study that provides many insights with regards to PLC net- work characteristics and dynamics. We implement BOLT on three different testbeds using off-the-shelf PLC adapters and showcase its ability to effectively manage flows, delivering several folds throughput improvement over state-of-the-art solutions. To maintain security, (I) We propose JIMS, a jamming interference mitigation scheme, using which, transceivers can identify subcarriers that are relatively unaffected by jamming and utilize them for communications. Prior approaches can only alleviate jamming interference to a limited extent; they are especially vulnerable to a reactive jammer, i. e., a jammer that injects noise upon sensing a legitimate transmission or wideband jamming. We show that JIMS restores throughput up to 75 % on our WARP testbed. (II) We study VM migration as an effective countermeasure against an attempt at malicious co-residency. We first undertake an experimental study on Amazon EC 2 to obtain an in-depth understanding of the side-channels attack. Here, we identify a new set of stealthy side-channel attacks and show that migration limits the co-residency time with a victim VM to about 1 % of the time with bandwidth costs of a few MB...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{communication}} networks route data packets in a <b>store-and-forward</b> <b>mode.</b> A router buffers received packets and forwards them intact {{towards their}} intended destination. Network Coding (NC), however, generalises this method {{by allowing the}} router to perform algebraic operations on the packets before forwarding them. The purpose of NC {{is to improve the}} network performance to achieve its maximum capacity also known as max-flow min-cut bound. NC has become very well established in the field of information theory, however, practical implementations in real-world networks is yet to be explored. In this thesis, new implementations of NC are brought forward. The effect of NC on flow error control protocols and queuing over computer networks is investigated by establishing and designing a mathematical and simulation framework. One goal of such investigation is to understand how NC technique can reduce the number of packets required to acknowledge the reception of those sent over the network while error-control schemes are employed. Another goal is to control the network queuing stability by reducing the number of packets required to convey a set of information. A custom-built simulator based on SimEvents® has been developed in order to model several scenarios within this approach. The work in this thesis is divided into two key parts. The objective of the first part is to study the performance of communication networks employing error control protocols when NC is adopted. In particular, two main Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) schemes are invoked, namely the Stop-and-Wait (SW) and Selective Repeat (SR) ARQ. Results show that in unicast point-to point communication, the proposed NC scheme offers an increase in the throughput over traditional SW ARQ between 2. 5...|$|E
