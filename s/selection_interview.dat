40|$|Research into {{choosing}} {{individuals to}} fill positions {{at or near}} board level in organisations is scarce; however we know that interviewing is the dominant selection practice. The research into <b>selection</b> <b>interviewing</b> at junior and middle levels is extensive. Overwhelmingly it {{takes the form of}} scientific (typically psychological) studies of independent, interacting individuals understood in either rational agent or stimulus-response modes. This research narrates the author???s involvement as an expert adviser to the board of a UK non-profit in the selection of their chief executive. The narrative material is interrogated using the concepts of habitus and practice as developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. This work builds on explorations of power, skill and intuition which use further narratives of the author???s experience as an interviewer and a leader, and also a participant in the management doctorate programme at the University of Hertfordshire. Previously the author worked for eighteen years in executive search. The author argues that both the practice of senior <b>selection</b> <b>interviewing</b> and its theorisation are damaged by too narrowly scientific a discourse which neglects substantial strands of relevant scholarship (for example within broader management studies, sociology, critical theory and philosophy). Behavioural competencies and transferable skills ??? bedrock concepts in contemporary human resource ???best practice???, including selection ??? are called into question. The author experiences the practice of senior <b>selection</b> <b>interviewing</b> as stuck, caught between cynical and scientific interpretations of itself (that is, self-interested power play and disinterested measurement). Neither perspective yields a productive dialectic. The ideas of habitus and practice open a different understanding which does not simply reject the preceding perspectives but attempts to advance beyond them...|$|R

50|$|The Irgun {{operated}} a sophisticated recruitment and military-training regime. Those wishing to join {{had to find}} and make contact with a member, meaning only those who personally knew a member or were persistent could find their way in. Once contact had been established, a meeting was set up with the three-member selection committee at a safe-house, where the recruit was interviewed in a darkened room, with the committee either positioned behind a screen, or with a flashlight shone into the recruits eyes. The interviewers asked basic biographical questions, and then asked {{a series of questions}} designed to weed out romantics and adventurers and those who had not seriously contemplated the potential sacrifices. Those selected attended a four-month series of indoctrination seminars in groups of five to ten, where they were taught the Irguns ideology and the code of conduct it expected of its members. These seminars also had another purpose - to weed out the impatient and those of flawed purpose who had gotten past the <b>selection</b> <b>interview.</b> Then, members were introduced to other members, were taught the locations of safe-houses, and given military training. Irgun recruits trained with firearms, hand grenades, and were taught how to conduct combined attacks on targets. Arms handling and tactics courses were given in clandestine training camps, while practice shooting took place in the desert or by the sea. Eventually, separate training camps were established for heavy-weapons training. The most rigorous course was the explosives course for bomb-makers, which lasted a year. The British authorities believed that some Irgun members enlisted in the Jewish section of the Palestine Police Force for a year as part of their training, during which they also passed intelligence. In addition to the Irguns sophisticated training program, many Irgun members were veterans of the Haganah (including the Palmach), the British Armed Forces, and Jewish partisan groups that had waged guerrilla warfare in Nazi-occupied Europe, thus bringing significant military training and combat experience into the organization. The Irgun also {{operated a}} course for its intelligence operatives, in which recruits were taught espionage, cryptography, and analysis techniques.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{influences}} of the intercultural <b>selection</b> <b>interview</b> wholistically on interview outcomes. Originality: Abduction reasoning and the place of attribution theory in the intercultural <b>selection</b> <b>interview</b> literature. Design/methodology/approach: Three sets of data are gathered from a large Australian financial institution - real live selection interviews, and semi-structured debrief interviews with candidates and interviewers. Qualitative approach based on abduction and induction reasoning {{is used in the}} analysis of the data. Findings: It is anticipated that the thesis will confirm the importance of competency and personality fit when non-Chinese interviewers are evaluating the Chinese candidates in the <b>selection</b> <b>interview.</b> The study will then highlight the mediating influences of culture and attribution on the <b>selection</b> <b>interview</b> outcomes. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of the study are 1) data are gathered from one institution, 2) the relatively small sample size that is consistent with qualitative research, 3) restriction to only the Chinese candidates.

40|$|Aggressiveness and {{violence}} in schools are concerns that educators have to address. Using a random method of sampling, this study focused on six secondary schools located in the Chicago Public Schools System. Each school's administrator was interviewed, and two teachers at the school were also interviewed by a person trained in the Urban Teacher <b>Selection</b> <b>Interview.</b> Clusters of comparable traits were identified, and a statistical comparison was made, with teachers scoring well on the Urban Teacher <b>Selection</b> <b>Interview.</b> This study articulates common characteristics of gentle teachers (de-escalators) who provide students with classroom environments which promote non-threatening, accepting, risk-taking communities. Twelve teachers are described as de-escalators or escalators by their school administrators. Gentle teacher characteristics are identified {{through the use of}} Q-sorts, t-tests, discriminant analysis, and the Urban Teacher <b>Selection</b> <b>Interview.</b> A high correlation is found between outstanding teachers in the interview and characteristics that administrators find common to teachers who de-escalate violence and aggression.

40|$|Aim: One of {{the aims}} of medical {{selection}} is to deselect students who have personal characteristics that would impact negatively {{on their ability to}} interact with patients, supervisors and peers and impede their ability to cope with the stress of medical training. The arduous requirements of the formal curriculum, the customs and rituals of the socialisation process and the mistreatment and abuse reportedly experienced by students all contribute to stress, mental illness, suicide, lowered self-confidence in clinical ability, decreased ability to learn and alcohol and substance abuse. There has been little research on the effectiveness of the <b>selection</b> <b>interview</b> in deselecting students with negative personal characteristics. Our research profiles the dysfunctional interpersonal tendencies of students already selected into a medical programme through the process of academic merit, application and interview. Methods: During 2001 and 2002, 159 students enrolled in an Australian undergraduate medical programme completed the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), which is a self-report measure of dysfunctional personality characteristics that inhibit the development of working relationships with others. Results: The HDS identified negative personality characteristics in medical students that were not detected in the <b>selection</b> <b>interview.</b> Conclusions: The presence of patterns of dysfunctional behaviour in medical training has implications for the selection, teaching and pastoral care of medical students. The HDS has the potential to identify negative personal characteristics that are hard to detect during a <b>selection</b> <b>interview,</b> and may be a valuable adjunct to the interview...|$|E
