25|$|BMI is {{particularly}} inaccurate {{for people who}} are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number.

Gestational weight gain, however, is often not accounted for. The objective was to explore whether the effects of maternal glucose and lipid levels on offspring’s birth weight and subcutaneous fat were independent of early pregnancy BMI and mid-gestational weight gain. Methods: In a population-based, multi-ethnic, prospective cohort of 699 women and their offspring, maternal anthropometrics were collected in gestational week 15 and 28. Maternal fasting plasma lipids, fasting and 2 -hour glucose post 75 g glucose load, were collected in gestational week 28. Maternal risk factors were standardized using z-scores. Outcomes were neonatal birth weight and sum of <b>skinfolds</b> in four different regions. Results: Mean (standard deviation) birth weight was 3491 ± 498 g and mean sum of <b>skinfolds</b> was 18. 2 ± 3. 9 mm. Maternal fasting glucose and HDL-cholesterol were predictors of birth weight, and fasting and 2 -hour glucose were predictors of neonatal sum of <b>skinfolds,</b> independently of weight gain as well as early pregnancy BMI, gestational week at inclusion, maternal age, parity, smoking status, ethnic origin, gestational age and offspring’s sex. However, weight gain was the strongest independent predictor of both birth weight and neonatal sum of <b>skinfolds,</b> with a 0. 21 kg/week increased weight gain giving a 110. 7 (95 % confidence interval 76. 6 - 144. 9) g heavier neonate, and with 0. 72 (0. 38 - 1. 06) mm larger sum of <b>skinfolds.</b> The effect size of mother’s early pregnancy BMI on birth weight was higher in non-Europeans than in Europeans.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{describe}} normative values and seasonal variation of body composition in female cyclists comparing female road and track endurance cyclists, and to validate the use of anthropometry to monitor lean mass changes. Anthropometric profiles (seven site <b>skinfolds)</b> were measured over 16 years from 126 female cyclists. Lean mass index (LMI) was calculated as body weight[*]×[*]skinfolds−x. The exponent (x) was calculated as the slope of the natural logarithm of body weight and <b>skinfolds.</b> Percentage changes in LMI were compared to lean mass changes measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a subset of 25 road cyclists. Compared to sub-elite and elite cyclists, world class cyclists were (mean [95 % CI]) 1. 18  kg [0. 46, 1. 90] and 0. 60  kg [0. 05, 1. 15] lighter and had <b>skinfolds</b> that were 7. 4  mm [3. 8, 11. 0] and 4. 6  mm [1. 8, 7. 4] lower, respectively. Body weight (0. 41  kg [0. 04, 0. 77]) and <b>skinfolds</b> (4. 0  mm [2. 1, 6. 0]) were higher in the off-season compared to the early-season.

LMI (mean exponent 0. 15 [0. 13, 0. 18]) explained 87 % of the variance in DXA lean mass. In conclusion, higher performing female cyclists were lighter and leaner than their less successful peers, road cyclists were lighter and leaner than track endurance cyclists, and weight and <b>skinfolds</b> were lowest early in the season.

DEXA scans measure both subcutaneous and visceral fat; however, <b>skinfolds</b> measure subcutaneous fat only.

This emphasises the importance of validity when selecting measurement tools and methods used to assess intervention outcomes indicative of body fat.

50|$|Body fat may be {{estimated}} {{from the body}} mass index by formulae derived by Deurenberg and co-workers. When making calculations, the relationship between densitometrically determined body fat percentage (BF%) and BMI must take age and sex into account. Internal and external cross-validation of the prediction formulas showed that they gave valid estimates of body fat in males and females at all ages. In obese subjects, however, the prediction formulas slightly overestimated the BF%. The prediction error {{is comparable to the}} prediction error obtained with other methods of estimating BF%, such as <b>skinfold</b> thickness measurements and bioelectrical impedance. The formula for children is different; the relationship between BMI and BF% in children was found to differ from that in adults due to the height-related increase in BMI in children.|$|E
50|$|Skinfold-based {{body fat}} {{estimation}} {{is sensitive to}} the type of caliper used, and technique. This method also only measures one type of fat: subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat under the skin).

Some models partially address this problem by including age as a variable in the statistics and the resulting formula. Older individuals are found to have a lower body density for the same <b>skinfold</b> measurements, which is assumed to signify a higher body fat percentage. However, older, highly athletic individuals might not fit this assumption, causing the formulas to underestimate their body density.|$|E

The data showed that there was a decrease in stature from pivots to line-pivots, lines, linebackers and backfields. The pivots and line-pivots were heavier than the lines and the latter heavier than the linebackers and backfields. The pivots also had higher BMI values than lines and linebackers and no differences were found among the other groups.

RESUMO Este trabalho se propôs a estabelecer o perfil da composição corporal dos atletas participantes da Liga Nacional 2003 de basquetebol masculino. Foram avaliados 85 atletas de oito equipes participantes da Liga. Os dados foram coletados entre 24 / 04 e 10 / 05 / 2003, sendo avaliados os seguintes itens: peso, altura, índice de massa corporal, peso da massa magra, peso de gordura, dobras cutâneas subescapular, triciptal, biciptal, peitoral, médio axilar, supra ilíaca, abdominal, coxa medial e panturrilha medial. Os seguintes parâmetros foram utilizados na determinação do perfil dos atletas: somatório de nove dobras, somatório das dobras de tronco, somatório das dobras de membros, percentual de gordura (Jackson e Pollock) e índice de massa corporal. A partir destes dados foi verificado, entre os grupos, uma redução na altura na seguinte ordem: pivôs, alas-pivôs, alas, alas-armadores e armadores. Os pivôs e alas-pivôs apresentaram-se mais pesados que os alas e estes mais pesados que os alas-armadores e armadores. Os pivôs apresentaram também maior IMC que os alas e alas-armadores. Nos demais grupos não foram encontradas diferenças. O grupo dos pivôs apresentou maiores percentual de gordura, peso da massa magra, peso de gordura, soma das nove dobras, soma das dobras de tronco e soma das dobras de membros que os demais grupos, os quais não apresentaram diferenças entre si.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two main {{questions}} are stated: 1) are BIA and anthropometric equations accurate in estimating body composition in male power athletes {{and more specifically}} in body builders and 2) {{is there a difference}} in body composition when body builders are compared to weight and power lifters? METHODS: Experimental design: this is a descriptive, comparative study on a selected sample of power athletes. Participants: 49 Belgian elite and sub-top male power athletes (34 body builders and 15 weight and power lifters) were included in this sample. More than 70 % was in preparation of competition at time of data collection. Measures: an extended set of anthropometric measures was taken. Body composition was estimated by BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) and by regression equations of <b>skinfolds.</b> Somatotype and muscle+bone areas were calculated. Factor analysis on all anthropometric measures was carried out to determine the body structure of the athletes. RESULTS: Compared to external visual criteria, the equations of Durnin and Womersley and Lohman (<b>skinfolds)</b> and the Guo-equation (BIA) were the only equations that could accurately estimate the body composition for this specific group of athletes. However, the sum of <b>skinfolds</b> attains the most accurate estimate of subcutaneous fatness. Body builders have significantly (p< 0. 01) larger arm and thigh circumferences and are more mesomorfic than the other power athletes (5. 9 vs 3. 8). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that to estimate body composition in extreme power athletes BIA is not as accurate as compared to anthropometric equations. Moreover, the sum of a larger set of <b>skinfolds</b> is preferred to anthropometric prediction equations. In addition, body builders are more muscular and leaner than other power athletes. status: publishe...|$|R
