30|$|Oceanic crusts {{created at}} mid-ocean ridges are {{considered}} to have similar basic structure everywhere, {{with the exception of}} anomalous regions such as fracture zones and hotspots (White et al., 1992). Most of the structural models of normal oceanic crust were obtained through seismic studies conducted between 1960 and 1980 (e.g., Shor et al., 1970; Christensen and Salisbury, 1975). Recently, the remarkable advancement of technologies for studying seismic refraction and reflection (e.g., GPS navigation systems, Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBS), analytical methods, calculation performance of computers) has allowed for the acquisition of more precise velocity structures (e.g., Kasahara et al., 2007; Oshida et al., 2008).

40|$|The oceans are {{covering}} {{most of the}} earth. The noise levels in the oceans are high, even though most people are ignorant to the fact. Through the increase in anthropogenic noise in the oceans, the ambient noise level is rising. Low frequent sound can propagate over large distances and is therefore omnipresent. This {{is the cause of}} the concern that humans pollute the oceans not only with plastic and rubbish but pollute with oceanic sound emissions as well. This has, to a large extent unknown consequences for marine life. There are several anthropogenic noise sources that contribute to the increase of the ambient sound level. The shipping industry together with <b>seismic</b> <b>explorations</b> are two of those that have the largest impact. <b>Seismic</b> <b>explorations</b> have excessive noise levels, but relative to ships, they are rare. Ships on the other hand yield lower noise levels, but are outnumbering the <b>seismic</b> <b>explorations.</b> The emitted noise can harm, disturb and confuse marine life. The literature is more focused on marine mammals, such as wales. However, fish are also affected. This study focuses on analysis of ship noise. DNV-GL has put forward a standard related to ship noise with specific noise levels that are acceptable for different kinds of ships in different conditions. Ecoxy in collaboration with Jens Hovem have developed a measurement procedure and EcoNoise, a computer program that enables processing of the recorded files with a given structure following a procedure according to this standard. Data from several field trials of measuring fishing vessels conducted by Ecoxy AS were made available for this thesis. The acoustic data which has been processed as part of this thesis stems from these measurements. EcoNoise, the computer program, has been the basis of the data analysis which will be presented in this thesis. The functions have been changed to find the wanted metrics used for analysis. Different components of the acoustic emissions have been studied, such as the audible range of the noise for fish radiated from the ships as well as suggesting a possible procedure to measure the directivity of the vessels. A graphical user interface has also been developed for EcoNoise as a part of this thesis. The interface combines all the functionality of EcoNoise in an interface which is easy to use. This has been done to make the program more user friendly and make it more available for people without too much programming knowledge. This is important to enable for example the fishermen themselves to use the program while at sea. Vibration measurements of the hull of the ferry MF Glutra have been performed. This was done as preparation for measuring the vibration of the hull of one of the fishing vessels, but these measurements were not done due to the ship's schedule. Through established formulae for calculating vibration, the vibration in plates with different characteristics was calculated. Through these simulations, {{it was found that the}} plates have resonance frequencies in the audible range for fish, and will therefore have an impact on fish...|$|R

Unless it recovered full locomotory control, asphyxiation was inevitable. Potential internal injury is discussed, both acoustic-mediated and from extreme exertion (exertional myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric nephrosis). As behaviour was spatially and temporally closely associated with firing seismic airguns, we suggest a cause–effect relationship.

40|$|Abstract. In {{industrial}} {{fields such}} as <b>seismic</b> <b>explorations,</b> RS 485 is considered a workhorse interface standard, {{and it is the}} most widely used for serial interface found on sensors. However, long-distance transmission at high data throughput {{is one of the key}} features. An improved RS 485 -based high-speed remote transmission method is developed to implement the transmission of large amounts of data from distributed sensors. Based on the signal integrity analysis, the hardware interface designs including interface chips and impedance matching are determined by continuous square-wave pulse transmission. Then a self-defined protocol with the aid of FPGA hardware real-time processing is designed to make high-speed clock recovery and frame synchronizations. The 8 b/ 10 b encoded data streams are transmitted via a twisted-pair cable in the experiment. The experimental results indicate that the designed RS 485 transceiver unit can drive the 220 meter twisted-pair lines at 20 Mbps data speed with an error rate of 1...|$|R

Although the anisotropy-induced distortion is less significant since the poststack processing of narrow-azimuth data is not sensitive to velocity. The advancement of seismic anisotropy is largely contributed by the Thomsen's work on anisotropy notation and also by the discovery of the P-wave time-process parameter [...] These fundamental works enable to parametrize the transverse isotropic (TI) models with only three parameters, while there are five full independent stiff tensor element in transverse isotropic (VTI or HTI) models.

40|$|All {{rights are}} reserved. Anthropogenic noise {{is an issue}} that {{originates}} both from ships and the infrastructure that supports them, i. e., ports. Noise pollution is a known issue that can affect both humans and marine organisms. Humans are affected when ports, which are often active throughout the day and night, are located near residential areas in a city. Marine organisms are affected when noise from various activities of the shipping industry is transferred into the water. Four main sources of anthropogenic noise are generally recognised: underwater explosions, <b>seismic</b> <b>explorations</b> with high-energy systems, active sonar systems and shipping. The primary concerns regarding organisms exposed to elevated levels of anthropogenic noise include permanent or temporary hearing loss, the masking of a desired signal, and behavioural changes in response to a sound. Noise generated in port areas can affect both the staff working at the port and the neighbouring areas. Several negative health effects of noise pollution have been identified, for example, hearing and cardio-vascular disturbances, increased blood pressure, annoyance and sleep disturbance...|$|R
