5|$|The derived {{category}} of coherent sheaves is constructed using tools from complex geometry, {{a branch of}} mathematics that describes geometric curves in algebraic terms and solves geometric problems using algebraic equations. On the other hand, the Fukaya category is constructed using <b>symplectic</b> geometry, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics. <b>Symplectic</b> geometry studies spaces equipped with a <b>symplectic</b> form, a mathematical tool {{that can be used}} to compute area in two-dimensional examples.|$|E
5|$|The homological mirror {{symmetry}} conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich {{states that}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent {{in a certain sense}} to the Fukaya category of its mirror. This equivalence provides a precise mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. In addition, it provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and <b>symplectic</b> geometry.|$|E
25|$|In SFT {{the contact}} {{manifolds}} {{can be replaced}} by mapping tori of <b>symplectic</b> manifolds with symplectomorphisms. While the cylindrical contact homology is well-defined and given by the <b>symplectic</b> Floer homologies of powers of the symplectomorphism, (rational) <b>symplectic</b> field theory and contact homology {{can be considered as}} generalized <b>symplectic</b> Floer homologies. In the important case when the symplectomorphism is the time-one map of a time-dependent Hamiltonian, it was however shown that these higher invariants do not contain any further information.|$|E
25|$|The theory also {{extends to}} real <b>symplectic</b> vector bundles, by the {{intermediation}} of compatible almost complex structures. In particular, <b>symplectic</b> manifolds have a well-defined Chern class.|$|E
25|$|The <b>symplectic</b> group Sp(2n, R) {{consists}} of all 2n × 2n matrices preserving a <b>symplectic</b> form on R2n. It is a connected Lie group of dimension 2n2 + n.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the semi-implicit Euler method, {{also called}} <b>symplectic</b> Euler, semi-explicit Euler, Euler–Cromer, and Newton–Størmer–Verlet (NSV), is a {{modification}} of the Euler method for solving Hamilton's equations, a system of ordinary differential equations that arises in classical mechanics. It is a <b>symplectic</b> integrator and hence it yields better results than the standard Euler method.|$|E
25|$|A similar argument. with quaternions {{replacing}} the complex numbers, shows uniquess for the <b>symplectic</b> group, which corresponds to Hermitian matrices over R. This can also been see more directly by using complex structures. A complex structure is an invertible operator J with J2 = −I. preserving the <b>symplectic</b> form B and such that −B(Jx,y) {{is a real}} inner product. The <b>symplectic</b> group acts transitively on complex structures by conjugation. Moreover, the subgroup commuting with J is naturally identified with the unitary group for the corresponding complex inner product space. Uniqueness follows by showing that any compact subgroup K commutes with some complex structure J. In fact, averaging over Haar measure, there is a K-invariant inner product on the underlying space. The <b>symplectic</b> form yields an invertible skew-adjoint operator T commuting with K. The operator S = −T2 is positive, so has a unique positive square root, which commutes with K. So J = S−1/2T, the phase of T, has square −I and commutes with K.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr–Sommerfeld {{quantization}} conditions lead {{to questions}} in modern mathematics. Consistent semiclassical quantization condition requires {{a certain type}} of structure on the phase space, which places topological limitations on the types of <b>symplectic</b> manifolds which can be quantized. In particular, the <b>symplectic</b> form should be the curvature form of a connection of a Hermitian line bundle, which is called a prequantization.|$|E
25|$|They involve taking averages {{over the}} phase {{space of the}} system, which is a <b>symplectic</b> manifold.|$|E
25|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between the}} compaction of a function and its Fourier transform can be formalized {{in the form}} of an uncertainty principle by viewing a function and its Fourier transform as conjugate variables with respect to the <b>symplectic</b> form on the time–frequency domain: from the point of view of the linear canonical transformation, the Fourier transform is rotation by 90° in the time–frequency domain, and preserves the <b>symplectic</b> form.|$|E
25|$|The {{projective}} {{representation of}} the restricted <b>symplectic</b> group can be constructed directly on coherent states as in the finite-dimensional case.|$|E
25|$|The <b>symplectic</b> {{version of}} Floer {{homology}} figures in a crucial {{way in the}} formulation of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture.|$|E

25|$|Likewise the unitary group U(n) acts transitively on V'k(Cn) with {{stabilizer}} subgroup U(n'k) and the <b>symplectic</b> group Sp(n) acts transitively on V'k(Hn) with stabilizer subgroup Sp(n'k).|$|E
25|$|The Segal-Shale {{quantization}} criterion {{states that}} T is implementable, i.e. {{lies in the}} restricted <b>symplectic</b> group, {{if and only if}} the commutator TJ – JT is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator.|$|E
25|$|In even {{dimensions}} in characteristic 2 the orthogonal {{group is a}} subgroup of the <b>symplectic</b> group, because the symmetric bilinear form of the quadratic form is also an alternating form.|$|E
25|$|The Arnold conjecture, {{linking the}} number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and the {{topology}} of the subjacent manifolds, was the motivating source {{of many of the}} pioneer studies in <b>symplectic</b> topology.|$|E
25|$|The Floer cohomology {{groups of}} the loop space of a semi-positive <b>symplectic</b> {{manifold}} (M,ω) are naturally isomorphic to the ordinary cohomology of M, tensored by a suitable Novikov ring associated the group of covering transformations.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{characterizations}} of the Fourier transform exist. For example, one uses the Stone–von Neumann theorem: the Fourier transform is the unique unitary intertwiner for the <b>symplectic</b> and Euclidean Schrödinger {{representations of the}} Heisenberg group.|$|E
25|$|The Lagrangian Floer {{homology}} of two transversely intersecting Lagrangian submanifolds of a <b>symplectic</b> manifold is the homology {{of a chain}} complex {{generated by}} the intersection points of the two submanifolds and whose differential counts pseudoholomorphic Whitney discs.|$|E
25|$|Lie groups {{occur in}} {{abundance}} throughout mathematics and physics. Matrix groups or algebraic groups are (roughly) groups of matrices (for example, orthogonal and <b>symplectic</b> groups), and these give {{most of the}} more common examples of Lie groups.|$|E
25|$|Using {{elementary}} {{properties of}} the <b>symplectic</b> form ω, one can show that a compatible almost complex structure J is an almost Kähler structure for the Riemannian metric ω(u, Jv). Also, if J is integrable, then (M, ω, J) is a Kähler manifold.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} they cannor {{be adjusted}} by addition of scalar operators {{to remove the}} second term on the right hand side. This shows that the cocycle on the restricted <b>symplectic</b> group is not equivalent to one taking only the values ±1.|$|E
25|$|A <b>symplectic</b> {{manifold}} {{is a kind}} of manifold {{which is}} used to represent the phase spaces in classical mechanics. They are endowed with a 2-form that defines the Poisson bracket. A closely related type of manifold is a contact manifold.|$|E
25|$|The above {{exceptional}} isomorphisms {{involving the}} projective special linear groups are {{almost all of}} the exceptional isomorphisms between families of finite simple groups; the only other exceptional isomorphism is PSU(4, 2) ≃ PSp(4, 3), between a projective special unitary group and a projective <b>symplectic</b> group.|$|E
25|$|The vector bundles {{associated}} to these principal bundles via the natural action of G on Fk {{are just the}} tautological bundles over the Grassmannians.

25|$|If {{there is}} an {{irreducible}} quaternion-Kähler symmetric space of the form G/(Sp(1) · K), then H is a non-symmetric irreducible affine holonomy groups, as is C* · H if dim V = 4. Here the complexified tangent representation of Sp(1) · K is C2 ⊗ V, and H preserves a complex <b>symplectic</b> form on V.|$|E
25|$|With the Clifford {{action as}} above but with {{contraction}} using the hermitian form, this construction gives a spinor space at every point of an almost Hermitian manifold {{and is the}} reason why every almost complex manifold (in particular every <b>symplectic</b> manifold) has a Spinc structure. Likewise, every complex vector bundle on a manifold carries a Spinc structure.|$|E
25|$|He {{became an}} {{academician}} of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (Russian Academy of Science since 1991) in 1990. Arnold {{can be said}} to have initiated the theory of <b>symplectic</b> topology as a distinct discipline. The Arnold conjecture on the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and Lagrangian intersections were also a major motivation in the development of Floer homology.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{an almost}} complex {{manifold}} is a smooth manifold {{equipped with a}} smooth linear complex structure on each tangent space. The existence of this structure is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a manifold to be a complex manifold. That is, every complex manifold is an almost complex manifold, but not vice versa. Almost complex structures have important applications in <b>symplectic</b> geometry.|$|E
25|$|In some contexts, a non-compact Stiefel {{manifold}} {{is defined}} as the set of all linearly independent k-frames in Rn, Cn, or Hn; this is homotopy equivalent, as the compact Stiefel manifold is a deformation retract of the non-compact one, by Gram–Schmidt. Statements about the non-compact form correspond to those for the compact form, replacing the orthogonal group (or unitary or <b>symplectic</b> group) with the general linear group.|$|E
25|$|The tangent {{space and}} the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same {{dimension}} and therefore isomorphic to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a Riemannian metric or a <b>symplectic</b> form {{gives rise to a}} natural isomorphism between the tangent {{space and the}} cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.|$|E
25|$|In each {{of these}} equations, the two {{structures}} on the right hand side are called compatible when the corresponding construction yields a structure of the type specified. For example, ω and J are compatible iff ω(•, J•) is a Riemannian metric.
