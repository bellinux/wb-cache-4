40|$|The model {{describing}} three coupled quantum oscillators with {{decay of}} Rayleigh mode into the Stokes and vibration (phonon) modes is examined. Due to the Manley-Rowe relations {{the problem of}} exact eigenvalues and eigenstates is reduced to the calculation of new orthogonal polynomials defined both by the difference and differential equations. The quantum statistical properties are examined in the case when initially: the Stokes mode is in the vacuum state; the Rayleigh mode is in the number state; and the vibration mode is {{in the number of}} or squeezed states. The collapses and revivals are obtained for different initial conditions as well as the change in time the sub-Poisson distribution by the <b>super-Poisson</b> <b>distribution</b> and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Probability {{models are}} {{developed}} {{for assessing the}} probable effects of distance on the demand for one and several facilities. A solution of these models leads to binomial approximate Poisson, <b>super-Poisson,</b> and mixed <b>distributions.</b> Several studies have shown the importance of incorporating uncertain interaction effects of distance in location models. Harris (1967) and Schneider (1959), for example, have suggested an exponential model for the interaction effects of distance, which measures the comparative resistance of the population to using a distant facility. Cooper (1974) has also recognized the probabilistic effects of distance (while studying location resulting from random demands) and suggested {{that they may be}} accounted for by a normal probability distribution. Using a similar (normal) distribution for the probable effects of distance, I have applied it to the estimation of the demand for recreational facilities (Tapiero, 1974). Other approaches to the. distance factor in location theory and in economic migration theory have been reviewed by Olsson (1965) and Brown (1968). The choice of a particular model of probable effects of distance may represent, for example, the attitude of a populatio...|$|R
