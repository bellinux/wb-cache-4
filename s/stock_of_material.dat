Milk, however, is a stock of materials which essentially consists of savings from the food-stuffs supplied to the mother. And these savings are in such a physical and chemical condition that the organism of the child can easily convert them into work-stuff. That is to say, by borrowing directly from the vital capital of the mother, indirectly from the store in the natural bodies accessible to her; it can make good the loss of its own. The operation of borrowing, however, involves further work; that is, the labour of sucking, which is a mechanical operation of much the same nature as breathing. The child thus pays for the capital it borrows m labour; but as the value in work-stuff of the milk obtained is very far greater than the value of that labour, estimated by the consumption of work-stuff it involves, the operation yields a large profit to the infant. The overplus of food-stuff suffices to increase the child's capital of work-stuff; and to supply not only the materials for the enlargement of the [...] "buildings and machinery" [...] which is expressed by the child's growth, but also the energy required to put all these materials together, and to carry them to their proper places. Thus, throughout the years of infancy, and so long thereafter as the youth or man is not thrown upon his own resources, he lives by consuming the vital capital provided by others.|$|E

The varied elements of a die ranging from the standard Die set, the dieblock, the punch plate with the punch holder, compression springs and the other elements necessary for assembling the die calls for a make-or-buy decision. While standard parts are preferred to be bought out, the components to be manufactured in-house necessitates an elaborate `Process Plan ’ for yielding the most economic die with the prescribed specs for quality Sheet-metal die is an inseparable constituent of the development process of any given automotive or consumer appliance. In most of the cases, this accounts for a high proportion in the tooling needs of the large size and structural member in any automotive like the chassis and the BIW. Many other brackets and gussets along with peripheral clips etc are invariably made of Sheet-metal due to the strength characteristics complimented by this material and the process of stamping. Process planning is responsible for the conversion of design data to work instructions through the specification of the process parameters to be used as well as those machines capable of performing these processes in order to convert the piece part from its initial state to final form. The output of the planning includes the specification of machine and tooling to be used, the sequence of operations, machining parameters, and time estimates. Doing all this with computer-aided assistance is called computer-aided process planning (CAPP). CAPP uses computer software to determine how a part is t...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that about 10 million tonnes of construction and demolition (C 2 ̆ 6 amp;D) waste is generated annually in Tanzania. This waste {{is expected to increase}} even more because of population increases, urbanization, industrialization and commercialization which results in more utilization of natural resources as well. The <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> resources (raw materials) decrease worldwide and any excessive material extraction puts pressure on natural resources, including ecosystems which depend on this resource for survival. This justifies the research to find a proper technology for recovery (reusing, recycling and upcycling) of C 2 ̆ 6 amp;D wastes which would alleviate the excessive extraction and utilization of natural resources. The research aims at solutions to use the C 2 ̆ 6 amp;D waste to produce building materials (for example concrete blocks) which is a commonly used building material in Tanzania. To ensure the sustainability of such building materials, the environmental, social and economic parameters have to be assessed by using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. Life cycle assessment is a technique for assessing the environmental impacts associated with a product over its life cycle. Currently, most of Life Cycle Assessment tools applied are developed in developed countries such as SimaPro (Netherlands), INVEST (United Kingdom), BEES (United States) etc. Their direct applicability is limited {{due to the fact that}} they are developed in countries with different environmental conditions as well as economic status. Therefore, this research paper discusses the identification of an appropriate Life Cycle Assessment tool which can be applied in research to determine the extent to which building products resulting from construction and demolition waste are sustainable in ecological sense...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. "May 2005. "Process {{planning}} is an activity within {{the production process}} that translates design requirements into {{a detailed description of}} instructions for transforming a raw <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> into a completed product. The instructions contain a sequence of operations that should be followed to arrive at the final product that satisfies design requirements. Over the years, many researchers have examined the modeling and analysis of process plans for the production of discrete parts. As a result, a number of mathematical models have been proposed. Input to these models is usually a sequence of operations required to complete the part with each operation having associated processing equipment with certain capability. These models can be used to check the feasibility of the process plan or to calculate operational tolerances such that the final product is produced within design specifications. The existing models allocate operational tolerances under specific assumptions. For example, when these models consider the process capability, they formulate it as a single fixed value that represents the worst case performance of a process capability. None of the existing models consider the stochastic nature of process capability. In addition, the current tolerance allocation research does not place emphasis on the value of the product under consideration. It is logical that high-value products should be assigned to highly capable processes in order to increase the confidence level in their production to design specifications. Furthermore, the existing tolerance allocation methods typically associate single processing equipment (machine) with certain capability to each operation in the process plan. Because there is no option for choosing a different machine automatically in case the assigned machine results in an infeasible plan. Actually, assigning a single machine to each operation can result in sub optimality in terms of the allocated tolerances and may lead to scheduling inflexibility. This research proposes a model which simultaneously allocates operational tolerances and assigns the most economical machines. Two versions of the model are developed, stochastic and fuzzy. The stochastic version of the model captures the stochastic nature of process capability in which, a stochastic distribution is used to represent the capability of a process. Alternatively, the fuzzy version evaluates the process capability utilizing expert's knowledge. Both the proposed versions introduce flexibility and optimality to the modeling of the production process by considering multiple available machines for each type of operation. This helps in selecting the machine with the lowest capability possible to make the process plan feasible while allocating maximum tolerances to each operation. Furthermore, a formula that determines the value of product considering the change of product value through the different stages of the production process is presented and integrated with the proposed models. Both versions of the proposed model can be easily solved by common of-the-shelf software. The models are implemented and analyzed using literature-application example. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|E
