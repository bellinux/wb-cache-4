5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, the <b>squid</b> <b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, may remain there for several days.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal in habits, after dusk {{the leopard}} {{catshark}} hunts for small, benthic bony fishes and invertebrates in shallow water. In daytime, it generally rests inside caves and crevices, sometimes in groups. This species {{has been documented}} ambushing spawning chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> reynaudi) within their spawning grounds. Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds year-round. Females produce rectangular, light-colored egg capsules two at a time, attaching them to structures on the sea floor. Small and harmless, the leopard catshark adapts well to captivity and is often exhibited in public aquariums. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers as bycatch, and often killed as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; its numbers {{do not seem to}} be declining, but heavy human activity occurs within its native waters. The possibly fragmented nature of its distribution also merits caution for each local population.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{deepening}} {{knowledge on}} the biology and {{ecology of the}} two <b>squids</b> <b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> (Lamarck, 1798) and Loligo forbesii (Steenstrup, 1856) from Sardinian waters. Considering their socio- economic importance in the Sardinian fisheries, the annual fluctuations in abundance highlighted the possibility of set management measures for their rational exploitation {{on the base of}} the knowledge of their life cycle Even if their different preferential bathymetric range, the study of the reproductive process through macroscopic histological and gravimetric analysis of the reproductive systems showed similarities between the two squids both in morphology of the gonads and in the pattern of reproduction. They are similar because they show an extended period of sexual maturity; they have an intermittent spawning with intermediate characteristics between coastal and deep spawning. In particular specific results on the reproductive output of L. vulgaris, showed a potential fecundity of about 4000 eggs (size 0. 30 - 3 mm) and 436 spermatophores (size 7. 25 - 17. 37 mm) according to the few studies so far carried out on the species. The reading of the age from the eye lens, tested {{here for the first time}} on cephalopods decapods, has allowed to estimate for both species a life cycle of about 18 - 20 months. For both squids were also performed morphometric analysis of the beaks and calculated specific correlations with the animal size. Considering the taxonomic value of the beak such information may be helpful in studies on diets of predators of these species...|$|R
40|$|A biomass {{dynamic model}} {{making use of}} an {{observation}} error estimator has been used over recent years to assess {{the status of the}} <b>squid</b> resource, <b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> reynaudii, off the coast of South Africa. This assessment has indicated the resource to be at a low level and the risk of collapse under the current level of fishing effort to be high. Accordingly, past scientific management advice has been that effort should be reduced. This assessment is refined here to take account of both observation and process error, and a number of sensitivity tests related to assumptions made in the original model are conducted. Bayesian analyses to take full account of estimation uncertainty are also undertaken. The results from the respective analyses are reported, and it is shown that changing the “hockey-stick” stock–recruitment function of the original model to a Beverton–Holt form opens the possibility that the resource is under less risk from the current level of effort than has been supposed...|$|R
5|$|The slow-swimming leopard {{catshark}} generally {{spends the}} day resting inside caves or crevices, either {{alone or in}} groups. At night, it moves towards the shore to actively forage for small bony fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. In False Bay, fishes {{are the most important}} prey type, followed by cephalopods and then the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii). This shark has been observed attacking octopus and cuttlefish by seizing and tearing off tentacles with a twisting motion. Like its close relative the pyjama shark, it will temporarily abandon its nocturnal habits {{to take advantage of the}} daytime mass spawnings of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round with a peak from October to December. The sharks lie motionless amongst the squids' egg masses with their heads hidden, and make sudden lunges at female squid that have descended to the sea floor to attach their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} forages {{for food}} both {{during the day}} and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca). When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its back like a scorpion. Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.|$|E
25|$|A common predatory {{technique}} {{that has been}} observed among benthic elasmobranchs is ambushing behavior. As it pertains to rays, skates, carpet sharks, and angel sharks, the predator searches for suitable hiding environments such as sand, pebbles, coral, or algae that match its coloration or patterning, which {{is also known as}} aggressive mimicry. Ambushing is a behavior in which a predator relies on its coloring, body structure, or the environment as an advantage in concealing itself while waiting on unsuspecting prey to enter its striking range. There have been recorded occasions where this form of ambushing behavior of stingrays and related benthic sharks has been directed towards a common prey type. One example of this occasion involves the chokka <b>squid,</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> reynaudii), which spawns in the inshore coastal habitats around South Africa. The diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) frequently relies on aggressive mimicry as it blends into sandy habitats waiting for preoccupied female chokka squids who are busy spawning. Diamond rays then shoot off from the bottom substrates and use suction feeding to ingest the spawning squids and their eggs. Suction feeding works in conjunction and is aided by ram filter feeding, which is demonstrated by pelagic rays including the manta ray (Manta birostris) and the closely related devil rays (Mobula sp.). Many of the pelagic rays have external mouth structures called cephalic lobes that assist in siphoning in water and planktonic organisms as the rays swim in acrobatic patterns in these patches of food. A stingray's diet includes small fish, snails, clams, and shrimp, and some other small sea creatures.|$|E

Fisheries Research, 167, 207 - 209. As cephalopods fulfil {{important roles in}} marine ecosystems and may be especially susceptible to overfishing the predicted expansion of cephalopod fisheries will require improved assessment and management of stocks to ensure ecosystem compatible exploitation. Genetic markers facilitating high throughput accurate species identification, particularly for early life history stages, would considerably benefit cephalopod fisheries research. Reported here {{is the development of}} a PCR-RFLP assay {{for identification}} of four <b>squid</b> species (<b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> <b>Loligo</b> forbesi, Alloteuthis media and Alloteuthis subulata) of growing interest as fisheries resources. The assay was used to type morphologically indistinguishable paralarvae collected from Seine Bay and revealed 99 % to be A. media despite a priori expectations that L. vulgaris (present at 1 %) would predominate. As the method can be applied to various life history stages and tissue types it offers considerable potential for use in studies of life history, stock structure, reproduction, recruitment and abundance that are necessary for sustainable management. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The {{smooth hammerhead}} is an active-swimming {{predator}} that feeds on bony fishes, rays, sharks (including {{of its own}} species), cephalopods, {{and to a lesser}} extent crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and barnacles. They readily scavenge from fishing lines. In some areas, stingrays are a favored prey and comprise a majority of its diet. The venomous barbs of stingrays are often found lodged in and around the mouths of these sharks; one specimen examined contained 95 such spines. In northern Europe, the smooth hammerhead feeds on herring and seabass, while in North America it takes Spanish mackerel and menhaden. Off South Africa, smooth hammerheads feed on <b>squid</b> such as <b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> and small schooling fish such as pilchard over the deep coral reefs at the edge of the continental shelf, with individuals over 2 m long taking increasing numbers of smaller sharks and rays. Off Australia, squid are the most important prey, followed by bony fish.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The veined <b>squid,</b> <b>Loligo</b> forbesii, {{is found}} {{throughout}} the northeast Atlantic, including the waters off the Iberian Peninsula, and is a socio-economically important cephalopod species, sustaining several small-scale commercial and local artisanal fisheries.

500|$|The pyjama shark {{feeds on}} a wide variety of small animals, {{including}} bony fishes such as anchovies, gurnards, and hakes, hagfishes, smaller sharks and rays and their egg cases, crustaceans, cephalopods, bivalves, and polychaete worms; it has also been known to scavenge on fish offal. Although it has a predilection for cephalopods, the dietary composition of this opportunistic predator generally reflects the locally available prey types. For example, in False Bay the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) is the most important food source, followed by cephalopods and then fish. Pyjama sharks have been observed seizing and tearing off tentacles from octopus and cuttlefish with a twisting motion; on one occasion three sharks were seen attacking an octopus simultaneously in this manner. During mass spawnings of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round but peak from October to December, pyjama sharks deviate from their nocturnal habits and gather in substantial numbers inside the squids' [...] "egg beds" [...] during daytime. The sharks conceal their heads amongst the egg masses, while their stripes break up the outlines of their bodies. As the female squid descend to the sea floor to attach their eggs, guarded by the males, they become vulnerable to the sharks' ambush attacks.|$|E

Macroscopic and single channel ionic currents were recorded using whole-cell voltage and patch clamp. In the whole-cell configuration, depolarisation from negative holding potentials evoked two voltage-dependent currents, an inward current and a delayed outward current. The outward current resembled an outwardly rectifying K+ current and was activated at − 40 mV after a latent period of 5 - 20 ms following a step depolarisation. The current was reduced by externally applied nifedipine, Co 2 + or quinine, was not blocked by addition of apamin or charibdotoxin and was insensitive to externally applied l-glutamate or acetylcholine. The voltage-gated inward current was activated at − 40 mV and was identified as an L-type calcium current sensitive to externally applied nifedipine. Schwann cells were impaled in situ in split-open axons and voltage clamped using discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp. Voltage dependent outward currents were recorded that were kinetically identical to those seen in isolated cells and that had similar current-voltage relations. Single channel currents were recorded from excised inside-out patches. A single channel type was observed with a reversal potential close to the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK) and was therefore identified as a K+ channel. The channel conductance was 43. 6 pS when {{both internal and external}} solutions contained 150 mm K+. Activity was weakly dependent on membrane voltage but sensitive to the internal Ca 2 + concentration. Activity was insensitive to externally or internally applied l-glutamate or acetylcholine.

50|$|To detect water movement, many {{invertebrates}} have sensory {{cells with}} cilia that project {{from the body}} surface and make direct contact with surrounding water.

Cephalopods, including the <b>squid</b> <b>Loligo</b> <b>vulgaris</b> and cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, have ciliated sensory cells arranged in lines at different locations on the body.
