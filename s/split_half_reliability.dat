40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} aspects of pitch perception of auditors when presented with musical tones whose frequencies were modulated. Research problems were: estimation of the effect of musical training upon pitch perception; estimation of the effect of stimuli of differing tonal qualities and frequency ranges upon perception; and estimation of the effect of solo and ensemble performances upon pitch perception. Subjects for the study were thirty musicians and thirty nonmusicians. Subjects were students at North Texas State University and Paris Junior College who had volunteered for the study. A test containing thirty-six items was developed which required subjects to match a tone created by a sawtooth wave generator to a simultaneously presented musical tone performed with vibrato. Each subject was tested individually, and allowed three attempts to match each test item. After the third playing of each item, a reading was taken of the frequency selected by the subject, Using the <b>split</b> <b>half</b> method, <b>reliability</b> for the test was found to be. 86 for nonmusicians and. 88 for musicians.

Differences located in responses of the groups were consistant with regard to stimuli of varying frequency levels and timbres, and were unaffected by either solo or ensemble performance of the stimulus. Subsidiary findings indicated that among musicians no significant differences in pitch perception may be traced to the major performing instrument of the subject; differences in these subgroups and nonmusicians were consistant with the findings comparing musicians as "a whole and nonmusicians.

40|$|To examine {{individual}} differences in adults’ sensitivity to facial expressions, we used a novel method that has proved revealing in studies of developmental change. Using static faces morphed to show different intensities of facial expressions, we calculated two measures: (1) the threshold to detect that a low intensity facial expression is different from neutral, and (2) accuracy in recognizing the specific facial expression in faces above the detection threshold. We conducted two experiments with young adult females varying in reported temperamental shyness and sociability - the former trait is known to influence the recognition of facial expressions during childhood. In both experiments, the measures had good <b>split</b> <b>half</b> <b>reliability.</b> Because shyness was significantly negatively correlated with sociability, we used partial correlations to examine the relation of each to sensitivity to facial expression. Sociability was negatively related to threshold to detect fear (Experiment 1) and to misidentify fear as another expression or happy expressions as fear (Experiment 2). Both patterns are consistent with hypervigilance by less sociable individuals. Shyness {{was positively related to}} misidentification of fear as another emotion (Experiment 2), a pattern consistent with a history of avoidance. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this new approach for studying {{individual differences}} in sensitivity to facial expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to test the realibility {{and validity of the}} Turkish version of Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder Self-Rating Scale (PTED Self-Rating Scale) which evaluates prolonged and disabling embitterment reactions in the aftermath of negative life events and to introduce the scale to clinical and nonclinical settings in Turkey. The PTED scale was administered to four independent groups of inpatients and normal people, a total of 1333 participants: 1. Inpatients with the PTSD diagnosis; 2. Inpatients with general psychiatric disorder diagnosis; 3. Normal people having no psychiatric diagnosis but experiencing a traumatic life events during the study applications; and 4. Normal people who experienced a traumatic life event in the past. Applications were performed in both face to face and group settings. Results showed that the internal consistency, test-retest reliability and <b>split</b> <b>half</b> <b>reliability</b> were high. Factor analysis indicated a two-factor solution, accounting for 54. 47 % of the total variance. The item loadings were 0. 37 and higher. The analysis indicated that the PTED Scale has very good convergent and criterion validity. The PTED Scale is a reliable and valid measure for embitterment as an emotional reaction to a negative life event. It can be used for clinical and nonclinical populations in Turkey...|$|E

It has become a global problem that threatens the lives and security of people everywhere. Because of its widespread, violence is considered now a human fact that cannot be avoided. No country or community is untouched by violence. Objectives: To study the epidemiological distributions of violence among adolescent in Dubai. Methods: This is a cross sectional study. The study was conducted among students in preparatory and secondary schools “Governmental and Private ” in Dubai, U. A. E. A sample of 1054 students was randomly selected from preparatory and secondary schools in Dubai. A structured interview questionnaire was used to collect data from the students. Reliability of the questionnaire using: Cronbach’s alpha with Guttman <b>split</b> <b>half</b> <b>reliability</b> coefficient was carried out. Results: The majority of study sample live with both parents (84. 9 %). Those who feel love toward mother constituted 89. 9 %, 82 % love father, 65. 3 % love older brother/sister, while only 23. 2 % like housemaid. The highest percentage of students reported punishment at home by preventing something he/she loves whether from mothe...|$|E
