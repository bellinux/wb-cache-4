500|$|Potter {{produced}} two books per annum for Warne, but by 1910 she was juggling {{the demands of}} aging parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had {{originally}} been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, [...] "I <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. She provided Warnes with two books per annum, but, by 1910, she was juggling the demands of ageing parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and, as a result, her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. She published only one book in 1910, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and wrote to a friend on New Year's Day 1911:I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work.|$|E

"There were {{thousands}} of soldiers on both sides during the Civil War, who, at the beginning, started to keep a diary of daily events, but those who kept a record {{from start to finish}} can be counted on the fingers of one hand. I was so fortunate as to save <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> notes made during the four years of conflict, and in 1865, having no fixed pursuit in life, I <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the time in arranging and writing up these incidents of camp life while fresh in my memory.|$|R

[...] Capra has said of his father, [...] "Unfortunately, I never knew my father and when I did, it was very briefly. He was incarcerated for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life and he was killed two years ago; he was shot. I think that even though my father wasn't there, in his death and in his memory, he has been a mentor to me in my manhood because my mom couldn't teach me how to be a man." ...|$|R
500|$|Fantastics {{circulation}} {{was about}} 37,000 when White took over; only about 4 {{percent of this}} was subscription sales. [...] Cohen's wife filled the subscriptions from their garage, and according to White, Cohen regarded this as a burden, and never tried to increase the subscription base. [...] Despite White's efforts, Fantastics circulation fell, from almost 37,000 {{when he took over}} as editor to less than 24,000 in the summer of 1975. [...] Cohen was rumored to be interested in selling both Fantastic and Amazing; among other possibilities, both Roger Elwood, at that time an active science fiction anthology editor, and Edward Ferman, the editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, approached Cohen with a view to acquiring the titles. [...] Nothing came of it, however, and White was not aware of the possible sales. [...] He was working at a low salary, with unpaid help from friends to read unsolicited submissions—at one point he introduced a 25-cent reading fee for manuscripts from unpublished writers; the fee would be refunded if White bought the story. [...] White sometimes found himself at odds with Cohen's business partner, Arthur Bernhard, due to their different political views. [...] White's unhappiness with his working conditions culminated in his resignation after Cohen refused his proposal to publish Fantastic as a slick magazine, with larger pages and higher quality paper. [...] White commented in an article in Science Fiction Review that he had brought to the magazines [...] "a lot of energy and enthusiasm and a great many ideas for their improvement ...Well, I have put into effect nearly every idea which I was allowed to follow through on ... and have <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> energy and enthusiasm." [...] Cohen was able to persuade him to stay for another year; in the event White stayed for another three.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the United States became engaged in a series of local {{conflicts}} in Latin America, which went into history as banana wars. The main purpose of these wars were to defend American commercial interests in the region. Later, U.S. Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler famously wrote, [...] "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Written in an {{uplifting}} {{first person}} narrative, the song depicts Clarkson's {{journey from the}} past and her vision in the future, with the chorus revealing her new life mantra. Lipshutz noted, [...] "I've <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time catching my breath, letting it go, turning my cheek {{for the sake of the}} show!" [...] Clarkson sings, before promising to spend the rest of her days appreciating what she has and being herself." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote, [...] "While Clarkson has clocked plenty of songs about the perils of love over the course of her career, her romance on this single is more positive than in the past." ...|$|E

[...] "From when I was 8 or 10 I {{knew it was going to}} be a career for me. [...] It's a tennis life so it wasn't so easy. [...] You have to give up many things. When all my friends were playing outside I had to practice. I didn't go to all the school trips. But I was focused from a very young age. I grew up {{practicing}} at the Jerusalem tennis center.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} conducted by Contemporary Authors, Terpening said: “My desire to create imaginary worlds through fiction springs, as I suspect {{it does for}} most writers, from a love of reading. From early grade school years, when I was given my first books (most still in my library today) and when I lived one house away from the public library in Gresham, Oregon (where I <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> free time), to the present, when I teach Italian literature for a living, my addiction has been not to candy, rock 'n' roll, TV, drugs, sex, or gambling, but to the book—both as an artifact and {{as a source of}} delight, a distraction from the constraints of life. A good book carries you away and never lets you down.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dyke {{appeared}} on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on 8 July 2011 alongside comedian Steve Coogan, where he confronted former News of the World deputy features editor Paul McMullen over his attitude {{to the events}} of the phone hacking scandal. Dyke told McMullen [...] "You're [...] nothing to do with a free press, or a decent democracy". Distancing himself from McMullen he said [...] "I've <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life being a journalist, and I'm nothing to do with him, and neither are most other journalists." [...] He continued [...] "You could see there are occasionally, very occasionally, public interest cases {{but most of the time}} [...] These guys [...] just tapped anyone they could think of". He was also of the opinion that stronger independent regulation of the press was needed, claiming that broadcast media had always been more strictly regulated.|$|E

[...] After the fourth disruption, Oren took a 20-minute leave {{before returning to the}} podium. Before continuing he said, [...] "I've <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life living in and studying the Middle East and one of the great and eternal cultural facets of the Middle East is hospitality... even if you do not agree with them, even if they're ostensibly your enemy.

2500|$|Despite any {{difficulties}} that his suspected Communist sympathies might have posed, Copland traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 60s {{to observe the}} avant-garde styles of Europe, hear compositions by Soviet composers not {{well known in the}} West and experience the new school of Polish music. While in Japan, he was taken with the work of Toru Takemitsu and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade. Copland revised his text [...] "The New Music" [...] with comments on the styles that he encountered. He found much of what he heard dull and impersonal. Electronic music seemed to have [...] "a depressing sameness of sound," [...] while aleatoric music was for those [...] "who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos." [...] As he summarized, [...] "I've <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life trying to get the right note in the right place.
