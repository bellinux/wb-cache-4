40|$|Using a {{community}} classification based on key demographic and geographic factors and {{data from the}} U. S. Census, analyses from 212 <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> indicate significant inter- and intra-state differences. The communities studied were located in two states within the North Central Region. The sample was limited to incorporated places with populations between 1, 000 and 2, 500. Several commonly-held ideas about <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> are either challenged or confirmed by this research. Similarities and differences among the communities {{as well as between}} the states support the conclusion that <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> have diverse characteristics. Not all <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> ofthis size are geographically isolated places with declining population. While many <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> have a large proportion of their residents age 65 or older, not all do. Finally, while most <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> are populated by large proportions of white residents, some <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> have growing minority populations. The diversity of <b>small</b> <b>communities</b> has substantial implications for public policy decisions such as the allocation of Community Development Block Grant funding or the distribution of services for community residents. Recommendations for future research directions are also presented...|$|R
