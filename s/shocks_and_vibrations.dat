50|$|Crystals {{suffer from}} minor {{short-term}} frequency fluctuations as well. The main causes of such noise are e.g. thermal noise (which limits the noise floor), phonon scattering (influenced by lattice defects), adsorption/desorption of molecules {{on the surface}} of the crystal, noise of the oscillator circuits, mechanical <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations,</b> acceleration and orientation changes, temperature fluctuations, and relief of mechanical stresses. The short-term stability is measured by four main parameters: Allan variance (the most common one specified in oscillator data sheets), phase noise, spectral density of phase deviations, and spectral density of fractional frequency deviations. The effects of acceleration and vibration tend to dominate the other noise sources; surface acoustic wave devices tend to be more sensitive than bulk acoustic wave (BAW) ones, and the stress-compensated cuts are even less sensitive. The relative orientation of the acceleration vector to the crystal dramatically influences the crystal's vibration sensitivity. Mechanical vibration isolation mountings can be used for high-stability crystals.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{propulsion}} technologies, including hybrid {{electric and}} hydraulic hybrid, equip vehicles with nonconventional power sources (in {{addition to the}} internal combustion engine) to provide higher fuel efficiency. However, these technologies tend to lead {{to higher levels of}} noise, vibration, and harshness in the vehicles, mainly due to the switching between the multiple power sources involved. In addition, the <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> associated with the power sources switching may occur over a wide range of frequencies. It has been proven that passive vibration isolators (e. g., elastomeric and hydraulic mounts) are unable to mitigate or totally isolate such <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Active mounts, while effective, are more complex, require significant power to operate, and can lead to system instabilities.

This paper presents a review of novel semiactive shock and vibration isolators developed using magnetorheological and electrorheological fluids.

As a result, these fluids allow one to transform a passive hydraulic vibration isolator into a semiactive device...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{procedures for}} obtaining {{a reliable and}} dense optical flow from image sequences taken by a television (TV) camera mounted on a car moving in usual outdoor scenarios. The optical flow can be computed from these image sequences by using several techniques. Differential techniques to compute the optical flow do not provide adequate results, because of a poor texture in images {{and the presence of}} <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> experienced by the TV camera during image acquisition. By using correlation based techniques and by correcting the optical flows for <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations,</b> useful sequences of optical flows can be obtained. When the car is moving along a flat road and the optical axis of the TV camera is parallel to the ground, the motion field is expected to be almost quadratic and have a specific structure. As a consequence the egomotion can be estimated from this optical flow and information on the speed and the angular velocity of the moving vehicle are obtained. By analyzing the optical flow it is possible to recover also a coarse segmentation of the flow, in which objects moving with a different speed are identified. By combining information from intensity edges a better localization of motion boundaries are obtained. These results suggest that the optical flow can be successfully used by a vision system for assisting a driver in a vehicle moving in usual streets and motorways.
