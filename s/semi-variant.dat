30|$|The {{combined}} cumulant (<b>semi-variant)</b> algorithm and Gramâ€“Charlier (GC) expansion {{theory can}} be used to convert the complicated convolution calculation into a simple arithmetic process according to the superior properties of cumulants [12]. This method greatly enhances the calculation speed and is able to accurately approximate the PDF or CDF of output variables [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Based on the GC theory, several improved approaches were employed to address PLF analysis, such as the stochastic collocation interpolation [18], and polynomial chaos expansion [19, 20]. However, the GC expansion based PLF (GC-PLF) calculation method may mistakenly obtain negative values in tail regions of PDF, which limits system planners to determine line security and maximum power rating [21, 22]. Reference [21] adopted an improved C-type GC expansion to avoid gaining negative values results. Reference [22] introduced the principle of maximum entropy (ME) from information theory to reconstruct PDF from an entirely different perspective according to the moments of output variables, guaranteeing positive PDF results. Work in [22] showed the superiority of ME to GC in both mean results and operational limit predictions. However, the algorithm did not consider the integration of distributed generation.|$|E
