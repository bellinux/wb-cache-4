5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer <b>stereo</b> <b>vision</b> and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{explore and}} study the effect of cover {{adjustment}} on binocular visual function in children with anisometropic amblyopia. METHODS: Forty-five children with anisometropic amblyopia of our hospital from July 2014 to April 2015 were as the study group, and treated by cover adjustment. Then 40 cases of healthy volunteers were selected as the blank control group. The binocular visual function of the subjects was observed. RESULTS: Before treatments, at 1 and 3 mo after treatments, the positive rates of binocular fusion were respectively 62 %, 76 % and 87 %, which at 3 mo after treatments {{was significantly higher than}} that before treatments(P P > 0. 05). Before treatments, at 1 and 3 mo after treatments the numbers of children whose <b>stereo</b> <b>visions</b> were 3000 "～ 801 " were respectively 26, 13 and 2, and the numbers of children whose <b>stereo</b> <b>visions</b> were 800 "～ 401 " were respectively 12, 13 and 6; the numbers of children whose <b>stereo</b> <b>visions</b> were 400 "～ 101 " were respectively 7, 15 and 25; the numbers of children whose <b>stereo</b> <b>visions</b> were≤ 100 " were respectively 0, 4 and 12. Far apart from the point of rupture and the convergence function in the study group after treatments were improved and significantly higher than those in the control group(both P P P P P P > 0. 05). After cover adjustment treatment, the lag of binocular regulation significantly decreased than that before treatments(P P > 0. 05). In the study group(45 cases with 90 eyes) 52 eyes were cured, 24 eyes improved, 14 eyes ineffective; the total effective rate was 84 %.

40|$|Abstract—When reconstructing a scenario, it is {{necessary}} to know the structure of the elements present on the scene to have an interpretation. In this work we link 3 D scenes reconstruction to evolutionary algorithms through the <b>vision</b> <b>stereo</b> theory. We consider <b>vision</b> <b>stereo</b> as a method that provides the reconstruction of a scene using only a couple of images of the scene and performing some computation. Through several images of a scene, captured from different positions, <b>vision</b> <b>stereo</b> can give us an idea about the threedimensional characteristics of the world. <b>Vision</b> <b>stereo</b> usually requires of two cameras, making an analogy to the mammalian vision system. In this work we employ only a camera, which is translated along a path, capturing images every certain distance. As we can not perform all computations required for an exhaustive reconstruction, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to partially reconstruct the scene in real time. The algorithm employed is the fly algorithm, which employ “flies ” to reconstruct the principal characteristics of the world following certain evolutionary rules...|$|R

25|$|Recovering <b>stereo</b> <b>vision</b> {{as far as}} {{possible}} has long been established as an approach to the therapeutic treatment of stereoblind patients.

40|$|International audienceAbstract.   As one {{branch of}} stereo {{matching}}, video stereo matching {{becomes more and}} more significant in computer vision applications. The conventional stereo matching methods for static images would cause flicker-frames and worse matching results. We propose a joint motion-based square step (JMSS) method for stereo video matching. The motion vector is introduced as one component in the support region building for the raw cost aggregation. Then we aggregate the raw cost along two directions in the support region. Finally, the winner-take-all strategy determines the best disparity under our hypothesis. Experimental results show that the JMSS method not only outperforms other state-of-the-art stereo matching methods on test sequences with abundant movements, but also performs well in some real-world scenes with fixed and moving stereo cameras, respectively, in particular under some extreme conditions of real <b>stereo</b> <b>visions.</b> Additionally, the proposed JMSS method can be implemented in real time, which is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.

500|$|Mantises have <b>stereo</b> <b>vision.</b> They locate {{their prey}} by sight; their {{compound}} eyes contain up to 10,000 ommatidia. A small {{area at the}} front called the fovea has greater visual acuity {{than the rest of}} the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea. The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated, affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic vision at close range. The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed [...] "head-on" [...] absorb the incident light, while those to the side reflect it.|$|E
