Why not instead charge them nearer the full costs but waive their repayments while they are earning less than £ 15 000 or working exclusively as a medical practitioner for the NHS or in another public sector? Medical students who worked until retirement for the state would then never have to repay a penny {{of the costs of}} their expensive state funded education. At the very least, this should help applicants to medical schools think a little more carefully about their future careers before applying. Should they wish to work in private medicine or in another career unrelated to health that is similarly lucrative, they could at least help, through their repayments, to fund the training of the extra medical students needed to replace their lost efforts.
