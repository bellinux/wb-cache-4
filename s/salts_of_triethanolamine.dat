40|$|Compared to pure zinc plating, {{zinc alloys}} provide several advantages. A zinc alloy {{generally}} offers superior sacrificial protection to steel since it corrodes {{more slowly than}} pure zinc. A search for a non-cyanide zinc plating bath resulted {{on the development of}} a zinc nickel sulphamate bath. To obtain better quality zinc-nickel deposits, triethanolamine was added to the bath. In this paper the influence <b>of</b> <b>triethanolamine</b> in zinc-nickel plating from sulphamate bath has been investigated through current efficiency measurements, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction techniques. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>triethanolamine</b> in the zinc-nickel sulphamate bath the current efficiency of alloy deposition increased to a maximum of 99 % at the current density of 1. 5 Adm- 2 and thereafter decreased. TEA adsorbed on the electrode surface obeying Henry’s isotherm. On mild steel surfaces, uniform smooth slate gray deposit with smaller crystallites was produced, in presence of TEA in solution, and the electrodeposits exhibited additional Zn(OH) 2 and g-Ni 3 Zn 22 phases.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of surfactant-polymer {{interactions}} on structure building in shear, rheological behaviour and the characteristics of corn oil in water emulsions, stabilised by triethanolamine oleat (TEAO) with and without addition of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) have been investigated. Amphiphilic properties of carboxymethyl cellulose acquired by TEAO-CMC interactions and formation of their complex, could be supposed to have an important influence on the rheological behaviour and properties of the emulsions. Viscous characteristics of emulsion continuous phases (water solution <b>of</b> <b>triethanolamine</b> and water solution <b>of</b> <b>triethanolamine</b> and carboxymethyl cellulose) shown triethanolamine carboxymethyl cellulose interaction indicating conformation changes on CMC molecule. These interactions brought about formation of TEAO-CMC complex and its adsorption around oil droplets in the emulsion. The emulsions have shown pseudoplastic, thixotropic or antithixotropic behaviour depending on the oil and emulsifier (TEAO) concentration and addition of CMC. During the flow of emulsions with moderately high oil concentration and high emulsifier content certain rheological effects and building of internal structure by various interaction links were shear induced.
