Steam conditions must remain as stable as possible, because variations in the steam system can affect downstream processes. Pressure variations in the steam <b>supply</b> <b>header,</b> for example, can have a severe effect on heat transferred to a process. If that process suffers an upset, unstable conditions can propagate from one process to another via the steam supply system. The closer the tolerance in the boiler control system, the smaller the steam header disturbances will be. This reduces the interaction, or 'coupling', of upsets between steam-consuming processes.

40|$|The Antiproton (Pbar) Source at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is a {{facility}} comprised {{of a target}} station, two rings called the Debuncher and Accumulator and the transport lines between those rings and {{the remainder of the}} particle accelerator complex. Water {{is by far the most}} common medium for carrying excess heat away from components, primarily electromagnets, in this facility. The largest of the water systems found in Pbar is the 95 degree Fahrenheit Low Conductivity Water (LCW) system. LCW is water which has had free ions removed, increasing its resistance to electrical current. This water circuit is used to cool magnets, power supplies, and stochastic cooling components and typically has a resistivity of 11 [...] 18 megaohms-cm. For more than ten years the Antiproton rings were plagued with overheating magnets due to plugged water-cooling channels. Various repairs have been tried over the years with no permanent success. Throughout all of this time, water samples have indicated copper oxide, CuO, as the source of the contamination. Matters came to a head in early 1997 following a major underground LCW leak between the Central Utilities Building and the Antiproton Rings enclosures. Over a span of several weeks following system turn-on, some twenty magnets overheated leading to unreliable Pbar source operation. Although it was known that oxygen in the system reacts with the copper tubing to form CuO, work to remedy this problem was not undertaken until this time period. Leaks, large quantities of make-up water, infrequent filter replacement, and thermal cycling also result in an increase in the corrosion product release rate. A three-pronged approach has been implemented to minimize the amount of copper oxide available to plug the magnets: (1) installation of an oxygen removal system capable of achieving dissolved oxygen concentrations in the parts per billion (ppb) range; (2) regular closed-loop filter/flushing of the copper headers and magnets and stainless steel header during down periods; and (3) installation of a full-flow filtration system designed to remove any CuO produced by the trace amounts of dissolved oxygen in the LCW system. All three items have been completed. The dissolved oxygen concentration is now routinely on the order of 15 ppb and returns to that level within 8 [...] 12 hours following an upset condition such as a leak. Prior to installation of the oxygen removal system, oxygen levels were approximately 3, 000 ppb. Particle analysis of the water before-and-after filter and flushing of the LCW system indicates a cleaner system. Another round of filter/flushing occurred shortly before the scheduled start-up and will be performed during down periods when deemed necessary by newly-installed instrumentation. The full-flow filtration system has been recently commissioned. The system consists of two parallel filter housings, with a rated total flow capacity of 2, 500 gpm at 300 psi, piping to the LCW <b>supply</b> <b>header</b> and associated instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe helium cooled magnets of the LHC {{particle}} accelerator are {{installed in a}} confined space, formed by a 27 km circumference 3. 8 m diameter underground tunnel. The vacuum enclosures of the superconducting LHC magnets are protected by a lift plate against excessive overpressure created by eventual leaks from the magnet helium bath, or from the helium <b>supply</b> <b>headers.</b> A three-meter long no stay zone has been defined centered to these plates, based on earlier scale model studies, to protect the personnel against the consequences of an eventual opening of such a lift plate.

Data recorded during these tests include oxygen level, temperature and flow speed as well as video recordings, taken up- and downstream of the spill point (- 100 m to + 200 m) with respect to the ventilation direction in the LHC tunnel.

40|$|In summary, a scaling {{analysis}} of a water-cooled Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS) system was performed based on generic information on the RCCS design of PBMR. The analysis demonstrates that the water-cooled RCCS can be simulated at the ANL NSTF facility at a prototypic scale in the lateral direction and about half scale in the vertical direction. Because, by necessity, the scaling {{is based on a}} number of approximations, and because no analytical information is available on the performance of a reference water-cooled RCCS, the scaling analysis presented here needs to be 'validated' by {{analysis of}} the steady state and transient performance of a reference water-cooled RCCS design. The analysis of the RCCS performance by CFD and system codes presents a number of challenges including: strong 3 -D effects in the cavity and the RCCS tubes; simulation of turbulence in flows characterized by natural circulation, high Rayleigh numbers and low Reynolds numbers; validity of heat transfer correlations for system codes for heat transfer in the cavity and the annulus of the RCCS tubes; the potential of nucleate boiling in the tubes; water flashing in the upper section of the RCCS return line (during limiting transient); and two-phase flow phenomena in the water tanks. The limited simulation of heat transfer in cavities presented in Section 4. 0, strongly underscores the need of experimental work to validate CFD codes, and heat transfer correlations for system codes, and to support the analysis and design of the RCCS. Based on the conclusions of the scaling analysis, a schematic that illustrates key attributes of the experiment system is shown in Fig. 4. This system contains the same physical elements as the PBMR RCCS, plus additional equipment to facilitate data gathering to support code validation. In particular, the prototype consists of a series of oval standpipes surrounding the reactor vessel to provide cooling of the reactor cavity during both normal and off-normal operating conditions. The standpipes are headered (in groups of four in the prototype) to water <b>supply</b> (<b>header)</b> tanks that are situated well above the reactor vessel to facilitate natural convection cooling during a loss of forced flow event. During normal operations, the water is pumped from a heat sink located outside the containment to the headered inlets to the standpipes. The water is then delivered to each standpipe through a centrally located downcomer that passes the coolant to the bottom of each pipe. The water then turns 180 {sup o} and rises up through the annular gap while extracting heat from the reactor cavity due to a combination of natural convection and radiation across the gap between the reactor vessel and standpipes. The water exits the standpipes at the top where it is headered (again in groups of four) into a return line that passes the coolant {{to the top of the}} header tank. Coolant is drawn from each tank through a fitting located near the top of the tank where it flows to the heat rejection system located outside the containment. This completes the flow circuit for normal operations. During off-normal conditions, forced convection water cooling in the RCCS is presumed to be lost, as well as the ultimate heat sink outside the containment. In this case, water is passively drawn from an open line located at the bottom of the header tank. This line is orificed so that flow bypass during normal operations is small, yet the line is large enough to provide adequate flow during passive operations to remove decay heat while maintaining acceptable fuel temperatures. In the passive operating mode, water flows by natural convection from the bottom of the supply tank to the standpipes, and returns through the normal pathway to the top of the tanks. After the water reaches saturation and boiling commences, steam will pass through the top of the tanks and be vented to atmosphere. In the experiment system shown in Fig. 4, a steam condensation and collection system is included to quantify the boiling rate, thereby providing additional validation data. This system does not exist in the prototype. The first part of the report presents the non-dimensional conservation equations describing the response of the water-based RCCS during steady-state and transient operations. These equations are used to develop similarity relationships that define a scaling of the NSTF that minimizes distortions between scaled experiments and prototype operation. Then, some limited simulations of heat transfer in cavities are presented that strongly underscore the need of experimental work to validate CFD codes, and heat transfer correlations for system codes, and to support the analysis and design of the RCCS. Finally, a summary is provided of the NSTF modifications needed to conduct scaled simulations of the RCCS...|$|E

Many papers have dealt with single-phase flow and both flow distribution data and analytical or numerical models are available for header design. With regard to two-phase flow, phase separation in manifolds with several outlets is so complicated that, to date, there is no general way to predict the distribution of two-phase mixtures at header-channel junctions.

The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall.

The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches.

The tokamak cooling water system (TCWS) will accomplish the objective of removing about 1 GW of peak heat load from in-vessel components while maintaining pressures and temperatures of the coolant within acceptable and safe limits during different operational scenarios. A study of feasibility has been launched for the IBED PHTS (Integrated Blanket, Edge localized mode coils (ELMs) and Divertor Primary Heat Transfer System; it consists of five independent cooling trains (four operational and one in stand-by), one steam pressurizer, <b>supply</b> and return <b>headers,</b> ring manifolds and connections to the all in-vessel components (i. e. First Wall Blanket, Divertor, ELM, Diagnostics and other Ports clients). The dynamic behaviour of the IBED PHTS has been investigated by means of RELAP 5 ® code to simulate the response of the system during plasma pulse and baking operations. Due to the plasma heat deposition on the surfaces of the in-vessel components and subsequent increase in hot leg temperature, a large amount of water volume is transferred from the hot legs of the circuit to the surge-line of the pressurizer during each burn cycle. This causes rapid increase of pressure and temperature of the system and the following actions are proposed to counteract these variations: spray injection in the upper dome of the pressurizer from the Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) to reduce the pressure and active control of flow rates through heat exchangers and their bypass loops to regulate the heat transfer from the primary system to the environment via secondary and tertiary loops. This paper focuses on the prediction of the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the IBED PHTS during plasma pulses and baking scenarios, describing the various activity of the analysis, the geometrical assessment of the circuit and the modelling with RELAP 5 ® code. The results have been compared with design and operational requirement. Possible strategies to enhance the system performances have been formulate...|$|R

An on-site wastewater treatment project site with two separate drip fields produced data on emitter flow rates and uniformity after 6 years of operation. The site served a two-bedroom residence in Weslaco, Texas, with treatment through a septic tank and subsurface flow constructed wetland. Filtration was accomplished with a small sand filter and screen filter. Results represent a worst-case scenario because the air relief valves were improperly installed and maintenance on the system was lacking. A pressure compensating (PC) emitter (Netafim Bioline 2. 30 L/hr) and a pressure dependent (PD) emitter (Aqua-Drip 3. 79 L/hr) were evaluated. When new, the PC emitters produced a mean discharge of 2. 33 L/hr with a manufacturing coefficient of 0. 043. The PD emitters, when new, produced a mean discharge of 4. 30 L/hr and a manufacturing coefficient of variation of 0. 016. The testing protocol was verified with the collection of data on new emitters. Two individual drip fields contained PC emitters (Netafim Bioline 3. 50 L/hr) and PD emitters (Aqua-Drip 2. 35 L/hr). The PC emitters were installed in a 200 m continuous length of tubing and the PD emitters were installed with ten individual lines of 15. 24 m connected with a <b>supply</b> and return <b>header.</b> Wastewater with an average BOD? of 23 mg/L was applied to two drip fields for 6 years. Emitter flow rates for 313 PC emitters were reduced to a mean discharge of 0. 95 L/hr with a coefficient of variation of 0. 74 and the 251 PD emitters were reduced to a mean discharge of 1. 52 L/hr with a coefficient of variation of 0. 35. Two shock chlorination treatments with chlorine concentrations of 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L were used to increase the emitter's flow rate. Sixty PC and 61 PD emitters were evaluated. The initial average flow rate of the PC emitters was 0. 818 L/hr. Average flow rates for the PC emitters increased significantly to 0. 859 L/hr and 0. 954 L/hr following the 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L shock chlorination treatments, respectively. The initial flow rate of the PD emitters was 1. 54 L/hr. The field flushing cycle represented an increase in flow rate to 1. 60 L/hr. The shock chlorination treatments increased the average flow rate to 1. 71 L/hr and 1. 77 L/hr following the 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L treatments respectively. All increases in mean discharge were statistically significant. Uniformity and over-application of wastewater were evaluated by analyzing the soil profile on a 1. 22 m grid over the entire drain field. Statistical uniformity was 48. 1 percent and 71. 4 percent for the PC and PD emitters, respectively. The uniformity coefficient resulted in similar results with 70. 1 percent for the PC emitters and 85. 6 percent for the PD emitters. PC and PD fields caused an over-application of 55. 3 percent and 58. 5 percent of the field area, respectively...|$|R
