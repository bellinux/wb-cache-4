5|$|The {{rejection}} of the Tanner <b>sighting</b> as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another <b>sighting</b> of a man carrying a child that night, this one reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland. Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith <b>sighting</b> offered the approximate time of Madeleine's kidnap.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016 {{there was}} a rare <b>sighting</b> of a Sumatran Rhino in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. The last time {{there was a}} Sumatran Rhino in the Kalimantan area was {{approximately}} 40 years ago. This optimism was met with despair as that very specific Sumatran Rhino was found dead several weeks later after the <b>sighting.</b> The reason of the death is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the <b>sighting</b> head and the computor. The <b>sighting</b> head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E
50|$|Iron <b>sights</b> are {{typically}} {{composed of two}} component <b>sights,</b> formed by metal blades: a rear <b>sight</b> mounted perpendicular {{to the line of}} <b>sight</b> and a front <b>sight</b> that is a post, bead, or ring. Open <b>sights</b> use a notch of some sort as the rear <b>sight,</b> while aperture <b>sights</b> use some form of a circular hole. Civilian, hunting, and police firearms usually feature open <b>sights,</b> while many military battle rifles employ aperture <b>sights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|To {{increase}} shooting accuracy {{they employ}} shooting support {{devices such as}} [...] the holographic weapon <b>sight,</b> AMT reflex <b>sights,</b> Schmidt & Bender 1.5 - 6 x 42 daylight <b>sights,</b> Simrad KN250F night vision <b>sights,</b> Zeiss Diavari daylight <b>sights,</b> Varo AN/PVS-4 night vision <b>sights,</b> EDS laser <b>sights</b> and Sure-Fire flashlights.|$|R
50|$|Any type of <b>sight</b> can be used, except laser <b>sights.</b> Many {{competitors}} use iron <b>sights,</b> but {{the recent}} trend has been towards red dot <b>sights,</b> which many shooters find easier to use. Telescopic <b>sights,</b> while legal, are rare, as magnification is not considered an advantage. Iron <b>sights</b> are usually adjustable Patridge type <b>sights,</b> carefully treated to reduce glare that might impact <b>sight</b> alignment.|$|R
5|$|The latest {{definite}} <b>sighting</b> of dodos, on Amber Island in 1662, may {{not necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed <b>sighting</b> of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last <b>sighting</b> before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{impression}} of space within the cockpit {{area and the}} great degree of visual <b>sighting</b> afforded by the Plexiglas panelling were regarded as positive factors, with one important provision in relation to weather conditions. Should either bright sunshine or rainstorms be encountered, the pilot's visibility could be dangerously compromised either by glare throwback or lack of good <b>sighting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical computer to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV <b>sighting</b> unit was {{much smaller than the}} Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the sight pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of <b>sighting.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Sight</b> {{distance}} {{allows the}} driver to assess developing situations and take actions appropriate for the conditions. <b>Sight</b> distance relies on drivers being aware of and paying attention to their surroundings and driving appropriately for conditions presented. For the purposes of design, <b>sight</b> distance is considered in terms of stopping <b>sight</b> distance, passing <b>sight</b> distance, and decision <b>sight</b> distance. For additional information, see the following chapters: Chapter Subject 1250 <b>Sight</b> distance at railroad crossings 1310 <b>Sight</b> distance at intersections at grade 1320 <b>Sight</b> distance at roundabouts 1340 <b>Sight</b> distance at driveways 1515 <b>Sight</b> distance for shared-use path...|$|R
40|$|The {{driver of}} a vehicle needs to see far enough ahead to assess {{developing}} situations and take actions appropriate for the conditions. For the purposes of design, <b>sight</b> distance is considered in terms of stopping <b>sight</b> distance, passing <b>sight</b> distance, and decision <b>sight</b> distance. For additional information, see the following chapters: Chapter Subject 1250 <b>Sight</b> distance at railroad crossings 1310 <b>Sight</b> distance at intersections at grade 1320 <b>Sight</b> distance at roundabouts 1340 <b>Sight</b> distance at road approaches 1515 <b>Sight</b> distance for shared-use path...|$|R
50|$|The {{complementing}} rear <b>sight</b> element {{may be an}} open type iron <b>sight</b> or an aperture <b>sight</b> as used in ghost {{rings and}} target aperture <b>sights</b> such as a target shooting diopter <b>sight.</b>|$|R

5|$|Most {{historical}} calendars are lunisolar. The 7th-century Islamic calendar is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} purely lunar calendar. Months are traditionally determined by the visual <b>sighting</b> of the hilal, or earliest crescent moon, over the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Once in the air, the biplane {{was escorted}} to the French coast by four {{military}} aircraft led by French Air Force Captain Venson, and sighted from the coastal town of Étretat. A <b>sighting</b> {{was made by}} the commanding officer of the British submarine , who recorded the note in his log, that he observed a biplane at 300 m altitude, 20 nautical miles southwest of the tip of Needles on the Isle of Wight. In Ireland, an aircraft overhead was reported by a resident of the town of Dungarvan and a Catholic priest reported a <b>sighting</b> over the village of Carrigaholt, then no further verified reports were made.|$|E
2500|$|The iron <b>sight</b> {{line was}} {{redesigned}} and featured a rear receiver aperture battle <b>sight</b> calibrated for [...] {{with an additional}} ladder aperture <b>sight</b> that could be flipped up and was calibrated for [...] in [...] increments. This <b>sight</b> line like other aperture <b>sight</b> lines proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel rear <b>sight</b> elements <b>sight</b> lines offered by Mauser, previous Lee–Enfields or the Buffington battle <b>sight</b> of the 1903 Springfield.|$|R
50|$|A tang <b>sight</b> is {{the rear}} <b>sight</b> {{of a pair}} of iron <b>sights</b> used to aim or align a rifle so the bullet fired will hit the target. The <b>sight</b> is {{attached}} to the tang: a steel plate extending toward the butt from a rifle receiver for attachment of the receiver to a wooden buttstock. A tang <b>sight</b> often offers the maximum <b>sight</b> radius, or distance between the front and rear <b>sights</b> attached to the rigid receiver and barrel assembly of a rifle. Large <b>sight</b> radius decreases bullet placement errors caused by <b>sight</b> misalignment.|$|R
50|$|The SUIT <b>sight</b> is a 4× {{telescopic}} <b>sight</b> with tritium-powered illumination, utilised at dusk or dawn. The {{full name}} is the L2A2 <b>Sight</b> Unit Infantry Trilux. The <b>sight</b> is not {{designed as a}} sniper <b>sight,</b> but was issued to designated marksmen. The <b>sight</b> was mounted on the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle or GPMG.|$|R

5000|$|Optical <b>sights</b> {{are fairly}} common {{for use on}} airsoft rifles; mostly red dot <b>sights</b> for {{short-range}} use, and telescopic <b>sights</b> for longer-range use. These range from inexpensive <b>sights</b> designed for use on pellet guns and [...]22 rifles, to mid-range <b>sights,</b> usually inexpensive replicas of actual rifle <b>sights</b> (such as replicas of the M68 Aimpoint, Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), and imitation holographic weapon <b>sights</b> that are actually just red dot <b>sights),</b> to actual <b>sights</b> designed for use on rifles, including the EOTech holographic <b>sights,</b> and the Trijicon ACOGs. Replica (or [...] "clone") <b>sights</b> are much cheaper than their real counterparts, but are usually unlicensed, much less durable and reliable, {{and should not be}} used with real firearms where violent recoil may damage them or throw the <b>sight</b> off zero. Most optical <b>sights</b> are mounted on a MIL-STD-1913 rail, while other guns, including replicas of Kalashnikovs, MP5s and G36s may have specific proprietary mounts.|$|R
50|$|Each holiday group {{includes}} {{an equal number}} of blind/partially <b>sighted</b> and <b>sighted</b> individuals. Blind travellers pair daily with different <b>sighted</b> ones, and the <b>sighted</b> traveller describes the <b>sights</b> to their blind partner. The role of the <b>sighted</b> individual is to be a fellow traveller and not to act as a carer. <b>Sighted</b> travellers receive a discount on the price of their holiday in return for this ‘use of their eyes’.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} Model 1916 night (Luminous) <b>sights</b> were issued during World War I. The rear night <b>sight</b> {{is a small}} brass plate that is placed {{underneath}} the rear <b>sight</b> leaf. The front <b>sight</b> clamps around the rifle's front <b>sight</b> base.|$|R
5|$|The <b>sighting</b> by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man {{carrying}} a child that night became {{an important part of}} the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the <b>sighting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sole <b>sighting</b> of the Negros {{fruit dove}} {{involved}} {{a pair of}} birds seen eating at a fruiting tree. No other information is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|As a {{powerful}} long-distance migrant, the nominate subspecies of Pacific swift has occurred as a vagrant far from its normal range. Birds {{have been recorded}} from Brunei, the Maldives, New Zealand and Macquarie Island, {{and there have been}} multiple occurrences in the Seychelles. In the US, this species is casual in the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands; a claimed 2010 <b>sighting</b> from the Yukon will be the first for Canada and the mainland of North America if ratified. In South America, there is a 1959 record from Colombia. There are 13 European records as of 2013, from Denmark (two), Spain, Sweden (four) and the UK (seven). It is possible that this overstates the true number of visiting birds. All the listed countries had a <b>sighting</b> on different dates in the summer of 2013 which could be due to a single wandering bird. The four most recent English records in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013 all included sightings at Spurn, East Yorkshire and may refer to one returning individual.|$|E
50|$|The trigger {{action is}} single action and {{completely}} adjustable. The <b>sights</b> {{are of a}} square-section type, with fixed front <b>sight</b> and a rear <b>sight</b> with lateral and vertical adjustment. The <b>sight</b> radius is 218 mm (from rear to front <b>sight).</b>|$|R

50|$|An express open <b>sight</b> {{with big}} rear <b>sight</b> and brass bead <b>sight</b> and single stage trigger are standard. A Rigby style diopter <b>sight,</b> a safari folding <b>sight</b> with white enamel inlay for rapid target {{acquisition}} or adverse light conditions and an express <b>sight</b> with two folding leaves zeroed for 50, 100 and 150 meters are available as options.The M 98 system {{can also be}} factory prepared for swing-off telescopic <b>sight</b> mounts (bases in square bridge) or complete mounts for telescopic <b>sights</b> {{with or without a}} mounting rail.|$|R
5|$|As the {{computor}} {{held the}} level line and was sending angle commands to the sight, it eliminated {{the need for}} a two-axis gyro in the <b>sighting</b> head itself. The gyro on the sight head only adjusted for rotation of the aircraft around its roll axis.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 gunnery {{training}} exercises, Patrie suffered mechanical {{problems with}} her <b>sighting</b> equipment that disabled {{one of her}} main battery turrets. In 1910 the battleship again was in an accident; while on maneuvers in the Gulf of Jouan, Patrie launched a torpedo that inadvertently struck her sister République. Her hull was damaged, and {{she was forced to}} put into Toulon for repairs.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{it often}} makes short {{distance}} movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of Iran, and less commonly north-western Gujarat, India. Longer movements may occur, {{as suggested by}} a possible <b>sighting</b> in the United Arab Emirates in November 2000.|$|E
50|$|Aperture <b>sights,</b> {{also known}} as peep <b>sights,</b> range from the ghost ring <b>sight,</b> whose thin ring blurs to near invisibility (hence ghost), to target {{aperture}} <b>sights</b> that use large disks or other occluders with pinhole-sized apertures. In general, the thicker the ring, the more precise the <b>sight,</b> and the thinner the ring, the faster the <b>sight.</b>|$|R
