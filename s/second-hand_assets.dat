50|$|Statistical {{treatment}} of the trade in second-hand fixed assets varies among different countries. Increasingly an attempt is made in many countries to identify the trade in <b>second-hand</b> <b>assets</b> separately if it occurs on a quantitatively significant scale (for example, vehicles). In principle, if a fixed asset is bought during the year by one organization, and then resold to another organization during the same year, {{it should not be}} counted as investment twice over in that year; otherwise the true growth of the fixed capital stock would be overestimated. Hence statistical agencies traditionally often measured only the acquisition of newly produced fixed assets, or else tried to measure the net purchases of used assets. In general, also, the expenditure on Gross Domestic Product of which GFCF is a component should definitionally include only newly produced fixed assets, not <b>second-hand</b> <b>assets.</b> GDP is supposed to measure the net new output, the new value added to the existing stock of wealth. But given a growing domestic and international trade in second-hand equipment, GFCF may understate the true level of gross fixed investment activity and overstate the real additions to the capital stock, insofar as fixed assets produced at a previous time and resold later are also invested in, without this showing up in the accounts.|$|E
5000|$|In other {{pioneering}} research, Arrow {{investigated the}} {{problems caused by}} asymmetric information in markets. In many transactions, one party (usually the seller) has {{more information about the}} product being sold than the other party. Asymmetric information creates incentives for the party with more information to cheat the party with less information; as a result, a number of market structures have developed, including warranties and third party authentication, which enable markets with asymmetric information to function. Arrow analysed this issue for medical care (a 1963 paper entitled [...] "Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care", in the American Economic Review); later researchers investigated many other markets, particularly <b>second-hand</b> <b>assets,</b> online auctions and insurance.|$|E
50|$|A {{very simple}} {{example would be}} if {{somebody}} sold a <b>second-hand</b> <b>asset</b> at a profit. This transaction is not recorded in gross product measures (after all, it isn't new production), nevertheless a surplus-value is obtained from it. Another example would be capital gains from property sales. Marx occasionally refers {{to this kind of}} profit as profit upon alienation, alienation being used here in the juridical, not sociological sense. By implication, if we just focused on surplus-value newly created in production, we would underestimate total surplus-values realised as income in a country. This becomes obvious if we compare census estimates of income & expenditure with GDP data.|$|R
40|$|This text {{discusses}} {{lessons that}} {{can be drawn from}} the comparative history of bankruptcy laws for present-day reforms, in developping countries. The emphasis is put specifically on three points: informality and the challenges of legalization; the political economy of bankruptcy reforms; and the specific problems raised by illiquid market for credit and <b>second-hand,</b> real <b>assets.</b> This text was presented at the Seminar on “The Judiciary & Economic Development in Emerging Economies” Oxford, Center for Brazilian Studies,February 23, 200...|$|R
5000|$|There exists {{nowadays}} a large {{market in}} <b>second-hand</b> (used) <b>assets.</b> In principle, statistical measures of gross fixed capital formation {{are supposed to}} refer to the net additions of newly produced fixed assets, which enlarge the total stock of fixed capital in the economy. But if a substantial trade occurs in fixed assets resold from one enterprise or one country to another, it may become difficult to know what the real net addition to the stock of fixed capital of a country actually is. A precise distinction between [...] "new" [...] and [...] "used" [...] assets becomes more difficult to draw. How to value used assets and their depreciation consistently becomes more problematic.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of {{financial}} intermediaries as internal markets for corporate assets. By aggregating the information on firms gathered in credit relationships, financial intermediaries achieve a better reallocation of assets of distressed firms. However, the role of intermediaries as internal markets relies on debt contracts which impoverish the quality of <b>second-hand</b> users of <b>assets.</b> We characterize conditions under which intermediation arises, finding that agents’ beliefs can affect the financial structure. We also characterize conditions under which the role of intermediaries in the credit market supports their role as internal markets for corporate assets. ...|$|R
25|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{make money}} from trading in already existing assets which are not used by them to produce any new products and services with. Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of net interest, net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} non-productive assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; <b>second-hand</b> physical <b>assets,</b> financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from operating surplus because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise more adequate measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, then a lot of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new product value, and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an aggregated econometric {{model of the}} world shipping markets. The model distinguishes between dry cargo and tankers and also between the a) freight market, b) second hand market for ships, C) shipbuilding market, d) scrap market. Chapters 1, 2 of the thesis examine the history of shipping in the last 100 years or so, analyse the cyclical behaviour of the industry, and consider past theoretical attempts at modelling the shipping markets. It is argued that the structure of existing models of the shipping industry is theoretically flawed In its treatment of the demand for new and second hand ships {{as well as in}} the treatment of expectations. Chapter 3 presents a 'new' theoretical model of the behaviour of shipping markets that attempts to remedy these defects. Novel features of this theory are the assumption of 'rational expectations' in shipping markets as well as the treatment of new and <b>second-hand</b> ships as <b>assets,</b> the portfolio demand for which varies with the own expected return relative to the return on other assets. Econometric versions of the theoretical model are estimated from post World War II annual data, separately for the dry cargo and tanker sectors In chapters 4, S. The two models are linked In chapter 6 and the models are used In order to simulate the dynamic response of the shipping markets to anticipated and unanticipated external shocks. A crucial role in the adjustment process is played by the forward looking speculative positions of investors in the second hand and newbuilding markets. Chapter 7 tests the assumption of the rational expectations hypothesis in the shipping markets by examining the evidence from the freight futures, time charter and new building markets. The stochastic behaviour of these variables is examined and statistical tests are performed in order to Investigate the extent to which this Is considered to be consistent -with the efficient markets / rational expectations hypothesis. The results are somewhat mixed. Chapter 8 illustrates how the model can be used for real world forecasting purposes and scenario planning...|$|R
