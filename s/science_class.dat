5|$|Like {{his father}} and {{brothers}} before him, Ted attended Harvard College. In his spring semester, {{he was assigned to}} the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play being characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a <b>science</b> <b>class.</b> At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within a year or two if they demonstrated good behavior during that time.|$|E

Twenty high school honor students participated in semi-structured face-to-face interviews and one theme emerged from the interview transcripts. The findings revealed that the most important academic skills for success in college <b>science</b> <b>classes</b> were problem solving, critical thinking, and how to study effectively skills. The implications of these findings for high school honor students are that the focus of the high school curricula should on the development of critical thinking, problem solving, and study skills...|$|R

After his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is murdered, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battlesuit, Norman becomes a freakish [...] "Green Goblin", who begins to terrorize the city.

During their practice sessions they experimented with electronic music using a Roland Juno-60 (belonging to Lopatin's father) and their high school's Ensoniq SQ-2, which Ford used as a drum machine. During these sessions, the two became serious about composing electronic music together. For a time they had separate careers, with Ford moving to New York City to play in soft-rock group Tigercity and Lopatin remaining in Boston to produce and compose music as Oneohtrix Point Never. In the summer of 2009, they developed {{an idea for a}} group they called [...] "Games" [...] after what Lopatin described as [...] "an intense 72-hour internet writing frenzy". Lopatin and Ford spent a week recording demos at Ford's home in Massachusetts, developing their sound with [...] "a ridiculously sick collection of vintage synths" [...] they collected during their years as musicians. Other musical commitments slowed the work, but by 2010 they had moved into an apartment (lacking heat and hot water) to focus on the project.|$|E

40|$|Although a large {{percentage}} of elementary school children show high interest in <b>science</b> <b>classes,</b> they tend to lose interest and dislike them in junior and senior high schools. This paper aims to clarify the causes that bring about this loss of interest in science. The study was based on a questionnaire that was conducted among the university students who want to become teachers. The result of the investigation reveals that neither their favor/disfavor of <b>science</b> <b>classes</b> in elementary school nor their nature-baaed experiences are related to their favor/disfavor of <b>science</b> <b>classes</b> in high school. The students who disliked <b>science</b> <b>classes</b> in high school claim that they lost interest because teachers demanded rote memorization and lessons were not effectual or inspiring. The authors conclude that science teachers should improve teaching strategies to enhance the students' interest and enthusiasm in the learning of science...|$|R
500|$|Later, a {{group of}} {{students}} go out into the woods at night to play with black magic, an attempt to [...] "score" [...] {{on the part of the}} boys in the group. The experiment causes unexplainable things to happen, causing all but one of the teenagers to flee. The remaining teen's mutilated body is discovered the next day, leading Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to investigate. Locals—including the faculty members—claim that the children have unleashed a demonic force with their rituals; a theory which is given validity by strange occurrences, such as frogs falling from the sky and water in the drinking fountain draining counter-clockwise, contrary to the Coriolis effect. Unknown to the agents, substitute teacher Mrs. Phyllis Paddock (Susan Blommaert) is behind the murder, keeping the eyes and heart of the victim in her desk. One of the faculty members, Jim Ausbury (Dan Butler) suspects one of his colleagues killed the boy, but the others believe it was an outside force. Ausbury's stepdaughter, Shannon (Heather McComb), suffers a breakdown during <b>science</b> <b>class</b> while dissecting a pig fetus, seeing its heart beat and its head move.|$|E
