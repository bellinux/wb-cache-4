50|$|Construction of the Cannelton Cotton Mill {{began in}} 1849 and was {{completed}} in 1851. Designed by Rhode Island architect Thomas Alexander Tefft and built of <b>sandstone,</b> the <b>mill</b> was once the largest industrial building in the United States west of the Allegheny Mountains. It initially employed about 400 workers, mostly women and girls, and annually produced more than 200,000 pounds of cotton batting and four million yards of cotton sheeting.Of 309 workers employed there in 1890, only 78 were men. As late as 1900, the mill employed 35 girls and 19 boys {{under the age of}} 18.|$|R
50|$|Old Main, {{originally}} University Hall, is the University’s signature {{building and}} appears on its seal. The building was constructed between 1873 and 1875 {{as part of}} a land grant for the state of Arkansas. The building was designed in Second Empire architectural style. The exterior walls are made of local red brick, and the foundation uses local <b>sandstone.</b> John <b>Mills</b> Van Osdel's original plan called for a clock, but one was not installed until 2005. Old Main currently houses the offices of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences, its honors program and five academic departments, as well as classrooms and meeting spaces.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1800s, John Blaxland {{built an}} {{original}} wooden weir at [...] "Grove Farm" [...] (now known as Wallacia) for a <b>sandstone</b> flour <b>mill</b> and additional brewery. The land {{was also used}} for wheat farming until 1861 when wheat rust infected the entire crop. The rural regions were chiefly one of dairying and grazing during the 19th century, {{but in the early}} 20th century - because of its rural atmosphere and proximity to Sydney - tourism developed as people opened their homes as guest houses. Today, the rural areas include a number of orchards and vineyards in the meadows. Vegetable farming and fruit picking are common activities.|$|R
5000|$|John Blaxland {{had built}} an {{original}} wooden weir at [...] "Grove Farm" [...] for a <b>sandstone</b> flour <b>mill</b> and additional brewery. When rust {{got into the}} English soft wheat, the flour mill failed and George Edward Cox of Winbourne (now Christian Brothers Retreat Mt Zion) at Mulgoa across the Nepean River, a teetotaller, bought Grove Farm to stop further brewing. Grove Farm was subsequently purchased by William [...] "Billy" [...] Baines hence Baines Hill on Silverdale Road over the Blue Mountains monosinclinal foothills. In 1873 the highest recorded Nepean River flood was marked by Billy Baines with a brass plaque on a sandstone block at Grove Farm near the barn which still has a water mark on a wood trunk pillar.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} mill {{was built}} in 1869, and was an 18 feet long by 16 feet wide building constructed of squared logs with [...] "V"-notched corners. In 1930, the original superstructure was dismantled {{down to the last}} five log courses, and a 2 1/2 story wood frame building was erected over the logs and the original <b>sandstone</b> foundation. The <b>mill</b> is sheathed in board and batten siding and topped by a gable roof.|$|R

All three bodies of water are extensions of the Bay of Fundy. Other former hamlets or villages on the peninsula include Upper and Lower Rockport, Slacks Cove, Pink Rock, Hard Ledge, and Johnson's <b>Mills.</b> <b>Sandstone</b> and gypsum quarrying was the mainstay of the economy.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} coals and {{adjacent}} sandstones were sampled from cores retrieved from depths between 3. 4 and 5 km on the Norwegian Shelf. The optical maturity of the coals varied between 0. 53 and 1. 12 % Ro with most {{values in the}} 0. 8 – 1. 0 % range. Gas was liberated from the coals by crushing and from fluid inclusions in the <b>sandstone</b> by sling <b>mill.</b> The fluid inclusion gas was very dry while the coal gas was wet probably reflecting preferential leakage of the smallest molecules from the coal during retrieval and storage of the cores. Equally isotopically light methane (C 1) {{was released from the}} coals and from the adjacent fluid inclusions in sandstones (- 60. 9 to- 72. 7). This suggests that the coals are the source of the gas and that no isotope fractionation takes place during gas expulsion from the coals. The very light isotope values would normally be ascribed biogenic activity. However, recent data opens for an early thermogenic origin (Schoell et al., 2005). Galimov (1988) reports isotopically light C 1 (- 60. 3 to- 47. 0) from all the Cenomanian supergiant gasfields of northern West Siberia. These gasfields makes up more than 30 % of the World’s proven gas reserves and are currently at depths of ~ 1000 – 1200 m. The source rocks consist of coaly humic material, which is believed to have formed the isotopically light C...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} research {{effort for}} Phase 1 (Concept Development) {{of the project}} has been data compilation; determination of the tectonic, depositional, burial, and thermal maturation histories of the North Louisiana Salt Basin; basin modeling (geohistory, thermal maturation, hydrocarbon expulsion); petroleum system identification; comparative basin evaluation; and resource assessment. Existing information on the North Louisiana Salt Basin has been evaluated, an electronic database has been developed, and regional cross sections have been prepared. Structure, isopach and formation lithology maps have been constructed, and burial history, thermal maturation history, and hydrocarbon expulsion profiles have been prepared. Seismic data, cross sections, subsurface maps and burial history, thermal maturation history, and hydrocarbon expulsion profiles {{have been used in}} evaluating the tectonic, depositional, burial and thermal maturation histories of the basin. Oil and gas reservoirs {{have been found to be}} associated with salt-supported anticlinal and domal features (salt pillows, turtle structures and piercement domes); with normal faulting associated with the northern basin margin and listric down-to-the-basin faults (state-line fault complex) and faulted salt features; and with combination structural and stratigraphic features (Sabine and Monroe Uplifts) and monoclinal features with lithologic variations. Petroleum reservoirs include Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous fluvial-deltaic sandstone facies; shoreline, marine bar and shallow shelf sandstone facies; and carbonate shoal, shelf and reef facies. Cretaceous unconformities significantly contribute to the hydrocarbon trapping mechanism capacity in the North Louisiana Salt Basin. The chief petroleum source rock in this basin is Upper Jurassic Smackover lime mudstone beds. The generation of hydrocarbons from Smackover lime mudstone was initiated during the Early Cretaceous and continued into the Tertiary. Hydrocarbon expulsion commenced during the Early Cretaceous and continued into the Tertiary with peak expulsion occurring during the Early to Late Cretaceous. The geohistory of the North Louisiana Salt Basin is comparable to the Mississippi Interior Salt Basin with the major difference being the elevated heat flow the strata in the North Louisiana Salt Basin experienced in the Cretaceous due primarily to reactivation of upward movement, igneous activity, and erosion associated with the Monroe and Sabine Uplifts. Potential undiscovered reservoirs in the North Louisiana Salt Basin are Triassic Eagle <b>Mills</b> <b>sandstone</b> and deeply buried Upper Jurassic sandstone and limestone. Potential underdeveloped reservoirs include Lower Cretaceous sandstone and limestone and Upper Cretaceous sandstone...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Greg {{was born}} at Manchester in 1809. The family stock was Irish by {{residence}} and settlement, though Scotch in origin. The family name was half jocosely and half seriously {{believed to be the}} middle syllable of the famous clan of Macgregor. William Rathbone Greg's grandfather was a man of good position in the neighbourhood of Belfast, who sent two of his sons to push their fortunes in England. The younger of the two was adopted by an uncle, who carried on the business of a merchant at Manchester. He had no children of his own. The boy was sent to Harrow, where Dr. Samuel Parr was then an assistant master. When the post of head master became vacant, Parr, though only five-and-twenty, entered into a very vehement contest for the prize. He failed, and in a fit of spleen set up an establishment of his own at Stanmore. Many persons, as De Quincey tells us, of station and influence both lent him money and gave him a sort of countenance equally useful to his interests by placing their sons under his care. Among those who accompanied him from Harrow was Samuel Greg. The lad was meant by his uncle to be a clergyman, but this project he stoutly resisted. Instead of reading for orders he travelled abroad, acquired foreign languages, and found out something about the commercial affairs of the continent of Europe. His uncle died in 1783, and the nephew took up the business. It was the date of the American Peace. Samuel Greg was carried forward on the tide of prosperity that poured over the country after that great event, and in a moderate time he laid the foundation of a large and solid fortune. The mighty industrial revolution that was begun by the inventions of Arkwright was now in its first stage. Arkwright's earliest patent had been taken out a few years before, and his factory in Derbyshire had by this time proved a practical success. Instead of sharing the brutish animosity of the manufacturers of Lancashire to the new processes that were destined to turn their county into a mine of gold, Greg discerned their immense importance. The vast prospects of manufacturing industry grew upon his imagination. He looked about him in search of water-power in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and at length found what he wanted a dozen miles away at Wilmslow, over the Cheshire border. Here the stream of the Bollen cuts through a flat and uninteresting table-land, and forms a pretty valley of its own, as it winds between banks of red <b>sandstone.</b> When the <b>mill</b> was built, and a house close to it, Quarry Bank became the home of the family, and it was here that W. R. Greg passed his childhood, youth, and early manhood.|$|R
