5|$|From 1852 until 1888, San Diego was {{governed by}} a board of trustees, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no {{official}} mayor.|$|E
5|$|Early on, it {{was learned}} that {{diseases}} were species specific, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{no danger of}} a disease or virus spreading to other races and potentially causing a pandemic. Extreme care is still taken, as there only has to be single instance of this not being the case to have deadly consequences.|$|E
5|$|Swimming or bathing {{outdoors}} was discouraged in the Christian West, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little demand or {{need for}} swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.|$|E

5|$|The format {{was changed}} for this series, with the dual {{timelines}} {{and much of}} the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little point going back to the start.|$|E
5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little for Ismay to do. After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder}} of their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased {{operations}} at midnight on 1 April 1996, {{and local government}} was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially {{different from those of}} the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire had continued to be held at the Ruthin branch, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no problem in segregating the records.|$|E
25|$|The vertex {{figure of}} the 24-cell {{honeycomb}} is a tesseract (4-dimensional cube). <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 16 edges, 32 triangles, 24 octahedra, and 8 24-cells meeting at every vertex. The edge figure <b>is</b> a tetrahedron, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 4 triangles, 6 octahedra, and 4 24-cells surrounding every edge. Finally, the face figure <b>is</b> a triangle, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 3 octahedra and 3 24-cells meeting at every face.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the RFC, the RNAS was {{organized}} on a non-central basis <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several No 1 Squadrons. Even wings numbers were not consistently {{given to the}} same unit, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many exceptions in historic data.|$|R

5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design objectives of the systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little incentive for currency war even if it had been possible.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig Borga did {{not return}} to the WWF after his ankle healed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no closure to his feud with Tatanka. The feud between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow was also soon forgotten. In the summer of 1994, both wrestlers joined Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. The two {{eventually}} formed a tag team and unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|The Captaincy General of Chile {{followed}} a process analogous {{to that of}} the May Revolution, and elected a Government Junta that inaugurated the brief period known as Patria Vieja. The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Rancagua, and the subsequent Reconquista of Chile would make it a royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural barrier between the Argentine revolutionaries and Chile, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no military confrontation between them until the Crossing of the Andes, led by José de San Martín in 1817, a campaign that resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.|$|E
5|$|The House {{resolution}} did {{not pass}} the Senate, nor did the Senate pass a resolution of their own, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no 2012 budget of record. The actual appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2012 included four continuing resolutions and three full-year appropriations bills enacted in November and December 2011, {{in accordance with the}} United States budget process. These appropriations were greatly affected by the Budget Control Act of 2011, passed in August 2011 as a resolution to the debt-ceiling crisis; it mandated budget cuts over a ten-year period beginning with Fiscal Year 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Underground station {{underwent}} major reconstruction at {{the same}} time as the main line station, with the work being completed in 2012. From 14 December 2014, the station's opening hours changed significantly, with the station opening on Sundays and no longer closing early in the evenings. The station previously had restricted opening hours because it primarily served the local financial services sector, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> low demand for services outside office hours. However, with the main line station's opening hours being extended due to the Thameslink Programme, the Underground station's opening hours were changed to accommodate the additional passengers.|$|E

5|$|The ground has {{undergone}} several major changes since its original construction in 1905. The original Main Stand, boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof, burnt down in 1921, {{and was replaced}} by the current stand before the 1922–23 campaign. The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} {{long-range}} radar station at Poling caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working and could see almost as far out to sea. Along the surrounding coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until Poling was repaired.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible {{due to the lack}} of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no mention}} of NATO {{enlargement}} in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no formal commitment not to expand. Whether or not the West informally committed to not enlarge NATO to the East is a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer rejects that an informal agreement existed. Texas A University political scientist Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson argues that an informal agreement existed.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Bretagne was based in Toulon. At the time, Italy remained neutral, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no immediate threat to the Mediterranean Fleet. In December, Bretagne covered convoy traffic in the Atlantic. On 4 December, she and Provence, along with the cruisers Colbert, Dupleix, and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar. Around {{the middle of the}} month, the task force began to return to the Mediterranean. After returning to Toulon, Bretagne underwent an extensive overhaul, which lasted until 3 March 1940. On 11 March, she left France carrying 1,820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury along with the cruiser Algérie, which carried another 1,179 boxes. They arrived in Halifax on 10 April. On the return voyage, they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April. On 27 April, Bretagne and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria. Bretagne and Provence returned to Mers El Kébir on 18 May.|$|E
