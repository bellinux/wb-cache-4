5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby orangutan was painted over a nail on the wall, where people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E
5|$|Both sides made changes {{going into}} the second ODI; for England, Sidebottom made way as England opted to hand a debut to Tredwell in order to play two spinners, while Bangladesh called on Shuvo and Rubel Hossain, {{dropping}} Siddique and Mortaza. For the second consecutive match, England won the toss and chose to field. The match began in similar fashion to the first ODI, with two quick wickets in the 10th and 11th overs taking Bangladesh from 46/0 to 56/2. However, a third-wicket partnership of 90 between Kayes and Rahim steadied the innings and helped Bangladesh to gain confidence. After Imrul Kayes' dismissal, Rahim increased his scoring-rate {{with a series of}} boundaries to take the score past 200, and was dismissed by a slower ball from Bresnan with the score at 211/5. Some late <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> the tail saw Bangladesh finish on 260/6, their highest total in ODIs against England.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{develops}} its narrative thread {{through the}} actions of its player-controlled protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa. Viewed from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical action-adventure fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> pole to pole, or running across water. The game world {{is made up of}} several distinct regions, most of which are connected via the city of Tairon, which functions as a hub. Access to these regions are obtained by fighting enemies, finding keys, or solving puzzles, inspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda video games. Dragon busts scattered throughout the regions provide the means to save player progress, permitting gameplay to be resumed at a later time.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a red car into the street, Brody <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country is a {{platform}} game where players must complete 40 different side-scrolling levels (or 41 in the Game Boy Color version) and recover the Kongs' banana hoard, {{which has been}} stolen by the Kremlings. Each level is uniquely themed and consists of varying tasks such as swimming, riding in mine carts, launching out of barrel cannons, or <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> vine to vine. The player begins {{with a minimum of}} six lives. Players lose a life if they get hit by any enemy or fall off the screen. To defeat an enemy, players can either execute a roll, jump or hand slap (a move only usable by Donkey Kong). However, some enemies cannot be taken down in this manner, so the player must throw a barrel or use the assistance of an animal. Enemies vary in difficulty, usually becoming tougher to take down as the game progresses. When the player has lost all their lives, the game is over. However, the player can gain additional lives by collecting items scattered throughout the levels, including bananas, golden letters that spell out K–O–N–G, extra life balloons, and golden animal tokens that lead to bonus levels. There are also many secret passages that can lead to bonus games where the player can earn additional lives or other items, as well as gain possible shortcuts through the level.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} during the 1990s that {{control of the}} Victorian ARU began to change hands from the old CPA-aligned {{leadership}} to {{a new group of}} union activists based around the Rank-and-File Committee ticket.

50|$|The {{sum of all}} {{the swings}} between parties must equal zero. In a three party system, the most {{complicated}} swings will involve a major swing either to or from one political party, with this swing being made up of two components {{from each of the}} other two parties. For instance there may be a 3-point swing towards the Purple party, consisting of a 2% <b>swing</b> <b>from</b> the Orange party and a 1-point <b>swing</b> <b>from</b> the Brown party. Alternatively, there may be a 5-point <b>swing</b> <b>from</b> the Orange party, of which 3 points are towards the Brown party and 2 towards the Purple party.|$|R

25|$|Shank {{has other}} attacks such as {{multiple}} grapple attacks, throw enemies, {{and is able}} to perform a pounce maneuver, in which he jumps in the air and lands on a nearby enemy. Some acrobatic abilities can also be performed, such as <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> lampposts or other tall structures, and running along the front of things such as billboards. On-screen enemies each have a health bar that displays on the player's HUD, akin to Final Fight.|$|E
25|$|Also, when {{fighting}} on ships, several events can provide {{opportunity for a}} non-conventional attack. These include buckets and gaffs lying around on the ship's deck, as well as ropes swinging overhead. When the player or the enemy is situated adjacent to such an item, executing the correct attack will use the item (kicking the bucket, <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> the ropes, etc.). If such an attack is successful, it knocks the enemy back and causes more disadvantage to him than a normal strike.|$|E
25|$|Mathieson's part in {{the match}} was curtailed when he fell through a glass roof, to be rescued <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> a girder above a 40-foot drop! The Culbertson team won by the decisive, but not overwhelming, margin of 10,900 points (total points scoring). Hubert Phillips, writing in the News Chronicle, put the reasons as {{superior}} teamwork, avoidance of unnecessary risks when vulnerable, and greater precision in slam-bidding. The match was analysed in three books, and had a considerable effect on bidding methods in Britain and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Shooting {{episodes of}} Deadliest Catch is a {{dangerous}} occupation for the camera crews on board the boats. In the early seasons, when many of the camera crews {{had little or no}} experience on crab boats, they frequently ran into dangers not normally encountered when shooting a documentary. Northwestern captain Sig Hansen told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that he saved a cameraman's life during the first season, screaming at him {{to get out of the}} way just seconds before a 900-pound crab pot <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> a crane crossed the space where the cameraman was standing. In another incident, showcased on the behind the scenes special, an inattentive cameraman had his leg fall through an open hatch on the deck of one of the boats when he unwittingly stepped into the hole, suffering three broken ribs (and, according to the cameraman, having to buy a case of beer for the entire crew as per tradition on crab boats).|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} gorillas {{is led by}} one or more adult males. In cases where there are more than one silverback males in a group, they are most likely father and son. Groups {{containing}} only one male are believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in. In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in trees. They are often found on the ground and are made up of up to 30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in the smallest family groups of all gorillas, with an average of 4 to 8 members in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities, like eating, nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who challenge this alpha male are apt to be cowed by impressive shows of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing a frightening roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play, climbing trees, chasing one another and <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> branches.|$|E
25|$|According to Rod Fergusson, {{the game}} was at one point {{intended}} to be a horror game influenced by Band of Brothers, Resident Evil 4 and Kill Switch. A romance subplot was considered for the game but was eventually dropped. In an interview with Cliff Bleszinski, lead developer for Epic Games, he cites three games that were the primary influences in the game's design, including the pacing and over-the-shoulder third-person perspective from Resident Evil 4 and the tactical-cover system from Kill Switch; Bleszinski also cited Bionic Commandos influence on the cover system, equating the actions of moving from cover to cover as similar to the action of <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> platform to platform in the latter game. These design choices reflect themselves in the gameplay, as Gears of War focuses mainly on squad team-based and cover-dependent tactics with limited weapons rather than brute force. Bleszinski also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda, including its storytelling and world-building elements, acquiring and mastering of tools, and underground environments. The game's title itself is a homage to Metal Gear, an early formative influence on Bleszinski. The total cost of development was $10 million, according to Epic's Mark Rein, and only 20 to 30 people were involved with the development at any time. The game also includes a content filter, which will turn off the blood and gore, and the usage of profanity. However, these figures do not include the proprietary Unreal Engine 3.|$|E

25|$|England won {{the coin}} toss and Australia's Andrew Johns {{kicked off the}} match. In England's first set with the ball Australia were penalised for their skipper Brad Fittler's high tackle on Andrew Farrell. From the {{resulting}} good field position England were able to force a line drop-out and get another set of six in Australia's half of the field. At {{the end of the}} set, Radlinski put up a high kick, which Australia's fullback Tim Brasher failed to secure and Australia were penalised for regathering the ball when off-side. Bobbie Goulding kicked the penalty goal from fifteen metres out, giving his side a 2 – 0 lead. From Australia's resulting kick-off, the English players couldn't secure the ball and it was regathered by the Kangaroos deep in the opposition half. On the last tackle of the ensuing set, Johns at first receiver put a chip kick into the left-hand corner of England's in-goal area where winger Rod Wishart dived in and got a hand on it, giving Australia the first try of the match in the seventh minute. Johns then converted the try from the touch-line and the Kangaroos were leading 2 – 6. A few minutes later England were penalised around the centre of the field and Johns attempted the kick at goal but missed. With the game now <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> end to end, Johns conceded a penalty close to the goal posts and Goulding's kick bounced off the uprights but went in, so England were trailing 4 – 6 by the eighteenth minute. A few minutes later England conceded a penalty in front of their goal posts and Johns kicked Australia to a 4 – 8 lead. Shortly after that England winger Martin Offiah made a break down along the left sideline and was contentiously ruled to have been taken over the sideline by a desperate Tim Brasher tackle as he threw the ball back into the field for Paul Newlove to toe ahead and dive on, though television replays suggested that Offiah had managed to release the ball before he went into touch. After a high shot from Andy Farrell on Mark Carroll, Johns kicked another penalty giving Australia a 4 – 10 lead at the thirty-minute mark. Just before the half-time break England conceded another penalty in the ruck but Johns' kick missed so the score remained unchanged at the break.|$|E
500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} John Dykstra {{was hired}} to produce the film's visual effects in May 2000. He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer generated, {{as they would have}} been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production. Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> buildings, which he described as, [...] "ballet in the sky." [...] The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70million to around $100million. Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.|$|E
500|$|The relief, however, was dashed {{in early}} March by {{news of the}} Damascus affair.

[...] Eight Jews were arrested, including the chief rabbi and David Mizrahi, who were tortured by being suspended <b>swinging</b> <b>from</b> hooks in the ceiling {{in the presence of the}} European consuls.
