5|$|New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) is the 2008 fourth studio album by American neo soul {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Erykah Badu. After a hiatus from recording music due to writer's block, Badu communicated with several hip hop producers over the Internet {{and worked on}} new music using the GarageBand <b>software</b> <b>program</b> on her laptop. Once the songs were composed, {{she went on to}} record most of the album at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.|$|E

Early plans to incorporate a surrounding waterfall and stairway were abandoned. In the end, budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that left many elements in their most straightforward form, such as exposed pipes and conduits, or rough concrete.|$|E

Eventually, The Cool Kids signed to Chocolate Industries, another independent label. The group has revealed on its MySpace page that The Cool Kids' debut album, When Fish Ride Bicycles, will be released in 2008, though it did not come out until 2011. Ingersoll has been the producer for tracks released thus far, but both work in rapping and production.

40|$|This {{paper is}} to {{identify}} the collections and the downloading patterns in software repositories. Data was collected from three major software repositories (i. e., softonic. com, wareseeker. com, and download. com) from 1 st April 2011 to 30 April 2011. The findings reveal that softonic. com (2, 242) leads the Microsoft Windows-based educational software, followed by wareseeker. com (1, 506), and download. com (991). However, Softonic. com provides {{the highest number of}} Mac-based <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> (278) while Linux-based <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> are only present in wareseeker. com (97).

40|$|This {{document}} {{describe the}} <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> for the Programmable Logic Controller and the Datable Access Module for Pumping Instrumentation and Control skid ''N''. The Appendices contains {{copies of the}} printouts of these <b>software</b> <b>programs.</b> This document describes the <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> for the Allen-Bradley SLC 500 programmable logic controller (PLC) and the Allen-Bradley DTAM PLUS operator interface module used on Pumping Instrumentation and Control (PIC) skid ''N''. The <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> for the SLC 500 and DTAM Plus {{are based on the}} core programs provided by Allen-Bradley. The PLC and DTAM <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> on skid ''D'' for SX- 104 are the baseline programs. These baselines have been tailored for U-farm skids. The skid ''N'' program for U- 109 is similar to the skid ''M'' program for U- 102. An Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) and an Operational Test Procedure (OTP) verify that the <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> meet the specific requirements for U- 109 pumping. This document represents the final PLC and DTAM programs for PIC skid ''N'' at U- 109. These programs were printed out after the performance of the OTP. The OTP acts as the final qualification test for the <b>software</b> <b>programs.</b> Functional requirements and details of the PLC ladder logic are described in this document. The final programs entered into the PLC and DTAM Plus are included as Appendices to this document...|$|R
5|$|In 1998 Salon {{reported}} that Scientologists were now blocked from viewing sites critical of Scientology including Operation Clambake and alt.religion.scientology, {{through the use}} of a content-control <b>software</b> <b>program</b> referred to by critics as Scieno Sitter. The Church of Scientology was unable to shut down Operation Clambake's internet service provider in Norway. The organization succeeded in shutting down the upstream connection to the site's internet service provider, Netherlands-based Xtended Internet. In November 2002, Xtended Internet's upstream provider, Cignal Global Communications received a letter from Church of Scientology counsel alleging copyright and trademark infringement involved with Xenu.net. This letter led to Cignal Global Communications, a United States-based company, terminating its service with Xtended Internet, which had to move their company to a new backbone provider.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a <b>software</b> <b>program</b> for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates {{a game of}} tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC was one of {{the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it {{included}} three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E

30|$|The {{average of}} normal {{bandwidth}} significantly differed {{among the four}} <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> except in the comparison of 4 DM and ECTb. Moreover, the normal phase SD significantly differed among the four <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> except in the comparison of cREPO and ECTb. The <b>software</b> <b>programs</b> showed high correlation levels for bandwidth, phase SD, and entropy (r[*]≥[*] 0.73, p[*]<[*] 0.001). ROC AUCs of bandwidth, phase SD, and entropy were ≥ 0.850, ≥ 0.858, and ≥ 0.900, respectively. Moreover, the ROC AUCs of bandwidth, phase SD, and entropy did not significantly differ among the four <b>software</b> <b>programs.</b> Optimal cutoff points for phase parameters were 24 °– 42 ° for bandwidth, 8.6 °– 15.3 ° for phase SD, and 31 – 48 % for entropy.|$|R
