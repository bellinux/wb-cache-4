40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we take a}} {{predefined}} geometry <b>shape</b> as a constraint {{for accurate}} <b>shape</b> alignment. A <b>shape</b> model is divided in two parts: fixed <b>shape</b> and active <b>shape.</b> The fixed <b>shape</b> is a user-predefined simple <b>shape</b> {{with only a few}} landmarks which can be easily and accurately located by machine or human. The active one is composed of many landmarks with complex <b>shape</b> contour. When searching an active <b>shape,</b> pose parameter is calculated by the fixed <b>shape.</b> Bayesian inference is introduced to make the whole <b>shape</b> more robust to local noise generated by the active <b>shape,</b> which leads to a compensation factor and a smooth factor for a coarse-to-fine <b>shape</b> search. This method provides a simple and stable means for online and offline <b>shape</b> analysis. Experiments on cheek and face contour demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach...|$|R

In this paper we present a local shape-indexing scheme defined on the Fourier spectrum of the <b>shape</b> distribution. We theoretically prove that our <b>shape</b> code is strictly invariant of affine transformations, and be suitable as an index of the <b>shape</b> knowledge of a form feature. A framework applying the invariant <b>shape</b> code in <b>shape</b> knowledge indexing is presented. Associated empirical evaluations are given to demonstrate the robustness of the invariant <b>shape</b> code regarding input noises; in addition, the quantity analysis of the results is provided. Eventually, our approach is promiseful to develop the unambiguous <b>shape</b> index in large <b>shape</b> knowledge repository.
