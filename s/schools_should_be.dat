5|$|Fifty-eight bills {{about school}} {{desegregation}} were filed for consideration by the Virginia Assembly. The administration immediately entered into negotiations {{to amend the}} Stanley plan to allow parents to sue a school district to force it to accept state funds (and resegregate). The Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans were also filed. Backers of the Gray Commission plan filed 14 bills to implement the Commission's proposals, but the Gray plan's supporters said they would abandon their pupil assignment plan {{in favor of the}} Mann-Fenwick pupil assignment plan. Delegate C.W. Cleaton introduced a bill to prohibit school districts from raising private money to operate integrated schools, Senator Eugene Snydor introduced a bill to allow residents to vote on whether integrated <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> closed and whether closed <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> reopened as segregated, and Delegate Griffith Purcell introduced a bill to require a statewide referendum in November 1956 on whether school segregation should be state policy.|$|E

He thought that all schools should adhere to some religious aspect. He also argued that public high <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} presidency, Jefferson {{continued}} to be active in public affairs. He also became increasingly concerned with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences, where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other universities. Jefferson believed educating people {{was a good way}} to establish an organized society, and also felt <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> paid for by the general public, so less wealthy people could obtain student membership as well. A letter to Joseph Priestley, in January, 1800, indicated that he had been planning the University for decades before its establishment.|$|E

25|$|Straw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education {{spokesman}} from 1987. In this role, {{he called}} on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right {{to opt out of}} the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.|$|E
25|$|Wesley himself opened {{schools at}} The Foundery in London, and Kingswood School. A Wesleyan report in 1832 {{said that for}} the church to prosper the system of Sunday <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{augmented}} by day-schools with educated teachers. It was proposed in 1843 that 700 new day-schools be established within seven years. Though a steady increase was achieved, that ambitious target could not be reached, in part limited by the number of suitably qualified teachers. Most teachers came from one institution in Glasgow. The Wesleyan Education Report for 1844 called for a permanent Wesleyan teacher-training college. The result was the foundation of Westminster Training College at Horseferry Road, Westminster in 1851.|$|E
25|$|From the 1860s onwards {{government}} in New South Wales became increasingly stable and assured. Fears of class conflict faded {{as the population}} bulge resulting from the gold rushes was accommodated on the newly available farmlands and in the rapidly growing towns. The last British troops left the colony in 1870, and law and order was maintained {{by the police and}} a locally raised militia, which had little to do apart from catching a few bushrangers. The only issue which really excited political passions in this period was education, which was the source of bitter conflict between Catholics, Protestants, and secularists, who all had conflicting views on how <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> operated, funded and supervised. This was a major preoccupation for Henry Parkes, the dominant politician of the period (he was Premier five times between 1872 and 1889). In 1866 Parkes, as Education Minister, brought in a compromise Schools Act that brought all religious schools under the supervision of public boards, in exchange for state subsidies. But in 1880 the secularists won out when Parkes withdrew all state aid for church schools and established a statewide system of free secular schools.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} {{should be allowed}} in schools {{has been on the}} rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, {{the boys}} were {{evacuated}} to the seaside town of Cleveleys, Lancashire, where they shared accommodation with a primary school. Chetham's was damaged by an explosion in December 1940, {{when most of the}} windows were shattered and the roof set alight. The boys relocated to Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, in 1943, although thirteen boys attending grammar school moved to Buxton College. By 1944 the governors believed {{that it would not be}} appropriate for the school to return to Manchester, and it was proposed the site become a religious education centre. However, after years of discussion, it was decided to return the school to Manchester. The Education Act 1944, which stipulated that <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> classified as primary or secondary, complicated matters, since Chetham's went across the middle. [...] It was decided in 1950 that Chetham's should become a grammar school, and this change took place two years later. In 1950, Chetham's amalgamated with Nicholls' Hospital School, a similar school based in Ardwick which had been established in 1863. While it could take up to 100 boys, by the end of the war there were only 22 and it was considered beneficial for the schools to merge.|$|E

[...] To help meet those overwhelming needs of students, particularly those in poor neighborhood, the ethic of care philosophy dictates that <b>schools</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> full-service institutions.

2500|$|The UCSCAM {{believed}} {{that the government of}} Malaysia had a [...] "final goal" [...] (referring to the Razak Report) to eradicate the Chinese schools and Tamil schools.
