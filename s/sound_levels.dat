5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E

He says that before subwoofers {{made it possible}} to have loud, relatively undistorted bass, movie <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> were limited by the distortion in less capable systems at low frequency and high levels.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the perception of soundscape reproduced by an ambisonic reproduction system on a horizontal plane, how the experience of space affected the perception of soundscape reproduction, and how the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment on soundscape reproduction affected the perception of soundscape compared with actual conditions. There were three experiments conducted: a soundwalk in situ in Manchester (United Kingdom) city centre, listening tests in Salford (United Kingdom), and listening tests in Bandung (Indonesia). The listening tests used material recorded from four locations on the soundwalk route in Manchester. The Salford listening tests were performed at the in-situ measured <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> and {{the participants were asked to}} adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents actual locations. The listening test in Bandung was conducted to understand the effect of participants who never come to the actual location to the perception of soundscape and the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment. The listening tests in Bandung were conducted at the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> at 9. 5 dB below the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (based on the preference <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> from the experiment in Salford), and the participants were also requested to adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents the actual space (to examine the consistency with the experiment in Salford). In each case, soundscape perception was measured on 19 semantic differential scales. Analysis of the semantic differential results showed that the ambisonic reproduction produced a similar subjective experience to the in situ soundwalk when the reproduction <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was 9. 5 dB lower than the actual <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> in situ. Reproduction at the actual <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> in situ produced a different dimensional space. The study shows that the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment of soundscape reproduction in laboratory experiment produces more ecologically valid results compared to the reproduction at the actual <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> in situ...|$|R

5|$|Professional audio subwoofers used in rock {{concerts in}} stadiums, DJ {{performances}} at dance music (e.g., EDM) and similar events must {{be capable of}} very high bass output levels, at very low frequencies, with low distortion. This {{is reflected in the}} design attention given in the 2010s to the subwoofer applications for sound reinforcement, public address systems, dance club systems and concert systems. Consumer applications (as in home use) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower playback levels. Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound, churches, nightclubs, and theme parks. Movie theatres certified to the THX standard for playback always include high capability subwoofers. Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high <b>sound</b> <b>levels,</b> using multiple 12-, 15-, 18- or 21-inch drivers (30cm, 40cm, 45cm, 53cm respectively). Drivers as small as 10-inch (25cm) are occasionally used, generally in horn-loaded enclosures.|$|E

5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's <b>sound</b> <b>levels,</b> interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

Noise related parameters like LAeq (Equivalent continuous A-weighted <b>sound</b> <b>level),</b> LAE (<b>Sound</b> exposure <b>level),</b> LAV (Average <b>sound</b> <b>level)</b> and TWA (Time weighted average level) are measured in a machine laboratory. TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), an important MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision Making) tool, is used to identify the best alternative.

However, the reading from a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> meter does not correlate well to human-perceived loudness, which is better measured by a loudness meter.

40|$|Propagation {{of sound}} waves in air can be {{considered}} as a special case of fluid dynamics. Consequently, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for fluid flow can be used for simulating sound propagation. In this article application of the LBM to sound propagation is illustrated for various cases: free-field propagation, propagation over porous and non-porous ground, propagation over a noise barrier, and propagation in an atmosphere with wind. LBM results are compared with solutions of the equations of acoustics. It is found that the LBM works well for sound waves, but dissipation of sound waves with the LBM is generally much larger than real dissipation of sound waves in air. To circumvent this problem it is proposed here to use the LBM for assessing the excess <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> i. e. the difference between the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> and the free-field <b>sound</b> <b>level.</b> The effect of dissipation on the excess <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> is much smaller than the effect on the <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> so the LBM can be used to estimate the excess <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> for a non-dissipative atmosphere, which is a useful quantity in atmospheric acoustics. To reduce dissipation in an LBM simulation two approaches are considered: i) reduction of the kinematic viscosity and ii) reduction of the lattice spacing...|$|R
