500|$|There are {{two primary}} ways for adding support for PHP to a web server {{as a native}} web <b>server</b> <b>module,</b> or as a CGI executable. [...] PHP has a direct module {{interface}} called Server Application Programming Interface (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, Netscape (now defunct) and iPlanet. [...] Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), which is a Microsoft's web <b>server</b> <b>module</b> interface. [...] If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always {{be used as a}} Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or FastCGI processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.|$|E
500|$|... over 20 million Internet domains had web {{services}} hosted on servers with PHP installed and mod_php was recorded {{as the most}} popular Apache HTTP <b>Server</b> <b>module.</b> , PHP {{was used as the}} server-side programming language on 83% of 10 million most popular websites. Web content management systems written in PHP include MediaWiki, Joomla, eZ Publish, eZ Platform, SilverStripe, WordPress, Drupal, and Moodle. Websites written in PHP, in back-end and/or user-facing portion, include Facebook, Digg, Tumblr, Dailymotion, and Slack.|$|E

50|$|In computing, {{the form}} {{factor is the}} {{specification}} of a motherboard - the dimensions, power supply type, location of mounting holes, number of ports on the back panel, etc. Specifically, in the IBM PC compatible industry, standard form factors ensure that parts are interchangeable across competing vendors and generations of technology, while in enterprise computing, form factors ensure that <b>server</b> <b>modules</b> fit into existing rackmount systems. Traditionally, the most significant specification is for that of the motherboard, which generally dictates the overall size of the case. Small form factors have been developed and implemented.|$|R

5000|$|In 1999, Forté Software {{came out}} with a version of Forte based on java instead of TOOL, named SynerJ, also {{referred}} to as [...] "Forté for Java". As with the original TOOL-based products this consisted of a development IDE, a code repository, and a runtime environment. This new java product was of interest to Sun Microsystems who bought out the company. The TOOL-based listed above were bundled together and re-branded as Unified Development Server (UDS) and Integration Server (IS) under the IPlanet division.

50|$|Software {{developers}} {{seeking to}} include telephone-related functions in their applications incorporate CT Connect software modules into their projects. The CT Connect <b>server</b> <b>module</b> must be installed {{on a computer}} that has a special CTI communication link to the telephone system. The CT Connect client module is installed on the same computer as the developer's application software. The client module presents an API for application telephone functions such as dialing a new call or generating an alert for an incoming call. The client module executes these requests by signaling them to the <b>server</b> <b>module,</b> which in turn requests the function from the telephone system. The client-server structure allows multiple applications running on multiple computers to share access to a single telephone system.|$|E
50|$|While Novell's Personal NetWare {{continues}} to be published unmodified {{as part of the}} DR-DOS suite by its newer owners Caldera, Lineo and DeviceLogics up to the present, Personal NetWare had been abandoned since 1995 within Novell itself. This led to the situation that Novell never published a PNW.NLM driver to support the Personal NetWare protocol under the newer 32-bit ODI32/NIOS stack, so that users of Personal NetWare, who could take advantage of the PNW <b>server</b> <b>module's</b> DPMS capabilities already, were ironically bound to continue to use the memory-consuming ODI/VLM 16-bit client with its PNW.VLM protocol driver.|$|R

Internally, it had a network stack, file and print <b>server</b> <b>modules,</b> disk caching, user handling and more, all running simultaneously inside the DOS memory space. Because they were not limited by the PC memory map, 3Servers could support 1 megabyte of flat memory, breaking the PC's 640 kB barrier. This was {{a large amount of}} RAM for the time.|$|R

40|$|Consider a {{processor}} organization {{consisting of a}} number of client <b>modules</b> and <b>server</b> <b>modules,</b> like memory units and arithmetic-logic processing units. Suppose that these modules are interconnected with a single bus which is segmented {{in such a way that}} modules connected to a particular segment can communicate in parallel to the data transfer operations going on in the other segments. This is achieved by a control logic which is capable to reserve a continuous subsequence of the segments necessary to establish a path from the source to the target module. Given the frequency of data transfer operations between the modules, our task is to determine an efficient segmentation and segment-to-module assignment of this kind of computer organization. We consider several different optimization methods for the problem and demonstrate their use for sample cases...|$|R
