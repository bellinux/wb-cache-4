2500|$|Department for Education {{officials}} {{were said to}} be taking an urgent interest in child protection arrangements at the school. [...] Inspection reports refer specifically to seven monks who have worked at the school at different times and whose behaviour has been [...] "a cause for concern". [...] The Independent Schools Inspectorate had previously criticised a lack of urgency in making improvements to child protection. The Charity Commission also sent a compliance team to work with the school on this, which it treated as [...] "a high-risk case". The Abbot responded by apologising to parents and reported that 50 years of confidential school records indicated that four of the monks had faced police action, two had restrictions imposed on them, and one was cleared and returned to monastic life. A review of <b>school</b> <b>governance</b> was already taking place. The school now works closely with the Diocese of Clifton in matters pertaining to Safeguarding Children and the two most recent Independent School Inspectorate Reports (2012, 2015) have noted the School's full compliance with current regulations.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many public}} {{alternative}} schools in other cities, CHS is {{not restricted to}} a particular student population (such as [...] "gifted" [...] or [...] "underachieving" [...] students), nor does it explicitly emphasize one particular area of study over others. Founded on an experimental [...] "school-without-walls" [...] concept, CHS continues to offer opportunities {{to interact with the}} surrounding community, primarily through its open campus and its , an avenue for students to design their own courses for credit through experiential learning projects in the Ann Arbor area. In contrast to many traditional high schools, CHS has been known for its small size, its open campus and downtown location, student participation in <b>school</b> <b>governance</b> and staff hiring, and loose attendance policies more similar to those of colleges than those at most high schools. The school has also eschewed many of the characteristics of traditional high schools, including interscholastic sports programs, valedictorians, dress codes, detention, hall passes, changing bells, mascots (aside from a rainbow-spangled zebra). [...] Although regular proms were not embraced until the 1990s, in 1974 an openly homosexual student, John Arden Rhyne, was named homecoming queen. [...] There was a small prom attended by part of the student body. [...] And Queen John was escorted by the winner of the third floor Euchre tournament. [...] On the court were Marci Woolson, Karim Boukar (wrapped in cellophane) and two others.|$|E

5000|$|Opponents of mayoral control {{typically}} cite {{two major}} {{issues with the}} shift. Most importantly, mayoral control represents an affront to democratic, public participation in <b>school</b> <b>governance.</b> Many worry that taking popular elections of school board members out of the <b>school</b> <b>governance</b> formula prevents local neighborhoods from having any say in how their interests are represented. [...] As Hess admits, [...] "some voices {{are likely to be}} silenced or marginalized under an appointed board". [...] A related complaint focuses on the lack of transparency that accompanies appointed school boards. Comparing appointed school boards to the board malfeasance in private sector companies such as Enron points to the danger of having a single-minded board take control of any entity.|$|E
