These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive.

25|$|Mainly on {{the basis}} of their reunion {{behaviours}} (although other behaviours are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Secure (Group B); Avoidant (Group A); and Anxious/Resistant (Group C). There are subclassifications for each group (see below). A fourth category, termed Disorganized (D), can also be assigned to an infant assessed in the Strange Situation although a primary 'organized' classification is always given for an infant judged to be disorganized. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the mother. A child may have a different type of attachment to each parent as well as to unrelated caregivers. Attachment style is thus not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the child's thinking, but is characteristic of a specific relationship. However, after about age five the child exhibits one primary consistent pattern of attachment in relationships.|$|E
500|$|Her bosom was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of {{her public}} persona that talk-show host Jack Paar once welcomed the actress to The Tonight Show by saying, [...] "Here they are, Jayne Mansfield", a line written for Paar by Dick Cavett {{that became the}} title of her {{biography}} by Raymond Strait. Joan Jacobs Brumberg describes the 1950s as [...] "an era distinguished by its worship of full-breasted women" [...] and attributes the paradigm shift to Mansfield and Monroe. Almost half a century after her death, a biographer of Nikolaus Pevsner (a German-born writer on British architecture), noted the improbable coincidence that Pevsner and Mansfield had once stayed at the same hotel in Bolton, Lancashire. [...] There, she had [...] "electrified the dining room with her imposing bosom". Patricia Vettel-Becker makes that observation more specific by attributing the phenomenon to Playboy {{and the appearance of}} Mansfield and Monroe in the magazine. Anita Ekberg and Bettie Page are also added to the list of catalysts besides Mansfield and Monroe. Drawing on the Freudian concept of fetishism, British science fiction writer and socio-cultural commentator J. G. Ballard commented that Mae West, Mansfield and Monroe's breasts [...] "loomed across the horizon of popular consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|The Zhuangzi {{interprets the}} {{universe}} as a thing that changes spontaneously without a conscious God or will driving it, and argues that humans can achieve ultimate happiness by living equally spontaneously. It argues that because of humans' advanced cognitive abilities, they {{have a tendency to}} create artificial distinctionssuch as good versus bad, large versus small, usefulness versus uselessness, and social systems like Confucianismthat remove themselves from the natural spontaneity of the universe. In order to illustrate the mindlessness and spontaneity he felt should characterize human action, Zhuangzi most frequently uses the analogy of craftsmen or artisans. As Burton Watson described, [...] "the skilled woodcarver, the skilled butcher, the skilled swimmer does not ponder or ratiocinate on the course of action he should take; his skill has become <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of him that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously and, without knowing why, achieves success." [...] The term [...] "wandering" [...] (yóu遊) is used throughout the stories of the Zhuangzi to describe how an enlightened person [...] "wanders through all of creation, enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Historically <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of Lancashire, Moss Side was {{formerly}} a rural township and chapelry within the parish of Manchester and hundred of Salford. Thought {{to be named}} after a great moss which stretched from Rusholme to Chorlton-cum-Hardy, the earliest mention of the area is in 1533 when it contained part of the estates of Trafford. Moss Side is described in the opening chapter of Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton as a rural idyll with a 'deep clear pool' and an old black and white timber framed farmhouse, later identified as Pepperhill Farm. [...] Following the Industrial Revolution there was a process of unplanned urbanisation and a rapid increase in population size. The population in 1801 was 151 but by 1901 this had increased to 26,677. The industrial growth of the area resulted in a densely populated area, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> that <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the township of Moss Side was amalgamated into the expanding city of Manchester in 1885, with the rest joining in 1904.|$|R
5000|$|According to Riffard, [...] The {{doctrine}} of analogy and correspondence, {{present in all}} esoteric schools of thinking, upholds that the Whole is One and that its different levels (realms, worlds) are equivalent systems, whose parts are in strict correspondence. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in <b>a</b> realm symbolically reflects and interacts with the corresponding part in another realm.For instance, the Sun in the mineral realm is the counterpart of the Lion in the animal realm. The relation between A and B {{is similar to the}} relation between C and D. The microcosm and macrocosm are analogous, that is, equivalent, similar in their structures, even though they are outwardly dissimilar. The parts are in strict correspondence, closely knit together and closely interacting : thus feet/pisces, veins/ rivers. According to Robert Fludd (Utriusque Cosmic Historia, II), [...] "Man is a whole world of its own, called microcosm for it displays a miniature pattern of all the parts of the universe. Thus the head is related to the Empyreal, the chest to the ethereal heaven and the belly to the elementary substance.|$|R
6000|$|He {{approached}} {{him as if}} to speak; but the recluse anticipated his purpose, murmuring in stifled tones, from beneath the fold in which his head was muffled, and which sounded like a voice proceeding from the cerements of a corpse,--"Abide, abide--happy thou that mayest--the vision is not yet ended." [...] So saying, he reared himself from the ground, drew back from the threshold on which he had hitherto lain prostrate, {{and closed the door}} of the chapel, which, secured by a spring bolt within, the snap of which resounded through the place, appeared <b>so</b> <b>much</b> like <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the living rock from which the cavern was hewn, that Kenneth could hardly discern where the aperture had been. He was now alone in the lighted chapel which contained the relic to which he had lately rendered his homage, without other arms than his dagger, or other companion than his pious thoughts and dauntless courage.|$|R
500|$|Series creator Damian Kindler {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Sanctuary in 2001, many of his ideas {{were included in the}} final product, one of them being the English scientist Helen Magnus. A few years later, Kindler asked Martin Wood if there was a potential for a series. When Wood believed it would be, they both decided to approach Amanda Tapping to participate in the project, and she accepted. Kindler believed that casting Tapping was a [...] "nice fit" [...] to the character because the actress was born in England. Tapping, who played the regular character Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and sister show Stargate Atlantis, did not know the future of her role in the show when she was approached to appear on Sanctuary in 2006. When the webseries started shooting in January 2007, it did not conflict with her commitments on Stargate. After the fourth season of Atlantis, Tapping was offered to return to the fifth season and she accepted. When Sanctuary was picked up to a television series, Tapping decided to turn down the Atlantis contract, having been encouraged by her husband to move on after playing Carter for eleven years. She went through a [...] "weird disconnect" [...] playing Magnus since [...] "Sam Carter was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of me". However, she was able to embrace playing a new character [...] "pretty quickly".|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{felt that}} the chronological running order put more {{emphasis}} on the band's well-regarded earlier periods. [...] "The selection of songs perhaps indicates Garbage view their career the same way many fans do", wrote Victoria Durham of Rock Sound, and [...] "that they never quite managed [...] the brilliance of their early work." [...] Johnny Dee of Classic Rock expressed, [...] "The later material here sounds formulaic, however, new song [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] adds strings to the dynamic and sits well alongside their peerless early material". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that despite ignoring 2000s singles such as [...] "Run Baby Run", [...] "it already seems that the comp has lingered far longer than necessary on the last stage of Garbage's career", {{in contrast to the}} debut album singles [...] "still sounding sleek and alluring." [...] Kerrang! magazine's Tom Byrant also felt that Garbage's work had dated, expounding, [...] "Something that was once <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Zeitgeist has remained rooted to the era it marked, untranslatable across the millennial divide. Still, songs like 'Stupid Girl' and 'Only Happy When It Rains' [...] maintain an urgency and spite that sees their intent remain intact." [...] Billboard writer Kerri Mason praised the choice of remixes on the special edition: [...] "the band continually brought the best of dance's best producers, not one of the thirteen tracks is a throwaway." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH called the compilation a [...] "deserved retrospective", further noting that [...] "the best way to get to know Garbage is through their albums, which demonstrate their strength in depth. In particular the self-titled debut and Version 2.0 withstand a heavy hammering on any stereo." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{causes of}} this war are unclear. We hardly have any {{information}} about their first years, before the involvement of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. The only extant writing on this war, apart from some references in passing by other authors, are a brief account by Florus and another equally brief one by Orosius. Both authors concentrated on when Augustus was engaged in the war. Florus wrote that the Cantabri tried to domineer their neighbours and harassed them, carrying out frequent raids on the Autrigones (who lived between the Atlantic {{and the source of}} the River Ebro) to their east, the Curgoni (or Turmodigi, in the area within the Arlanzón and Arlanza river valleys in the modern province of Burgos) to their southeast, and the Vaccaei (in the northwest of central Hispania) to their south. Orosius wrote much the same. We do not know whether, or if <b>so,</b> how <b>much</b> of <b>a</b> <b>part</b> this played in the outbreak of the war.|$|R

60|$|The proper {{constitution}} of local representative bodies does not present much difficulty. The principles which apply to it {{do not differ}} in any respect from those applicable to the national representation. The same obligation exists, {{as in the case}} of the more important function, for making the bodies elective; and the same reasons operate as in that case, but with still greater force, for giving them a widely democratic basis; the dangers being less, and the advantages, in point of popular education and cultivation, in some respects even greater. As the principal duty of the local bodies consists of the imposition and expenditure of local taxation, the electoral franchise should vest in all who contribute to the local rates, to the exclusion of all who do not. I assume that there is no indirect taxation, no octroi duties, or that, if there are, they are supplementary only, those on whom their burden falls being also rated to a direct assessment. The representation of minorities should be provided for in the same manner as in the national Parliament, and there are the same strong reasons for plurality of votes; only there is not so decisive an objection, in the inferior as in the higher body, to making the plural voting depend (as in some of the local elections of our own country) on a mere money qualification; for the honest and frugal dispensation of money forms <b>so</b> <b>much</b> larger <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the business of the local than of the national body, that there is more justice as well as policy in allowing a greater proportional influence to those who have a larger money interest at stake.|$|R
40|$|As {{a student}} of physics, one grows up in a climate of optimism. One experi-ences how Nature can be {{described}} in terms of mathematically simple laws which the human mind is able to comprehend. In quantum theory one finds an elegant and powerful tool which-one feels-may well be the final theory for all there is to know on this earth, ranging from atoms to living organisms. Quantum theory, apart from its practical success, has raised profound and puzzling questions on the nature of physical reality {{and the role of the}} human observer, but these questions have remained on the periphery because they seemed of no practical relevance. Through the results of psi research it became apparent that quantum theory has flaws in a very practical sense. Applied to a systems that include human subjects the predictions of quantum theory were seen to be sometimes incor-rect. This finding may well touch upon the open problems of the role of the ob-server in quantum theory, the nature of reality, and perhaps even on the prob-lem of consciousness. For our present discussion we will put these profound problems aside and look at psi from the view of an optimistic and practical minded physicist. We will consider the psi effects as a challenge to either modify the quantum for-malism or to look for other novel mechanisms. The Causality Principle A most striking feature of psi effects is the violation of the causality princi-ple. Causality, in the meaning in which I am using this term, concerns the time order between cause and effect, with the cause always preceding the effect. From early childhood we get used to the principle of causality. If the milk is spilled, somebody must have tipped the cup, and there is no way to undo the accident by changing the past. Causality has become <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> integral <b>part</b> of our common sense feelings that a non-causal world appears almost unthink-able.

2500|$|The servus callidus {{functions}} as the exposition {{in many of}} Plautus' plays. According to C. Stace, [...] "slaves in Plautus account for almost twice as much monologue as any other character... {{this is a significant}} statistic; most of the monologues being, as they are, for purposes of humor, moralizing, or exposition of some kind, we can now begin to see {{the true nature of the}} slave's importance." [...] Because humor, vulgarity, and [...] "incongruity" [...] are <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Plautine comedies, the slave becomes the essential tool to connect the audience to the joke through his monologue and direct connection to the audience. He is, then, not only a source for exposition and understanding, but connection—specifically, connection to the humor of the play, the playfulness of the play. The servus callidus is a character that, as McCarthy says, [...] "draws the complete attention of the audience, and, according to C. Stace, 'despite his lies and abuse, claims our complete sympathy'". He does this, according to some scholarship, using monologue, the imperative mood and alliteration—all of which are specific and effective linguistic tools in both writing and speaking.|$|E
2500|$|The Normal Heart is a play set between 1981 and 1984. It {{addresses}} a writer named Ned Weeks as he nurses his lover, who is dying of an unnamed disease. His doctors are puzzled and frustrated by having no resources to research it. Meanwhile, the unnamed organization Weeks {{is involved in}} is angered by the bad publicity Weeks' activism is generating, and eventually throws him out. Kramer later explained, [...] "I tried to make Ned Weeks as obnoxious as I could... I was trying, somehow and again, to atone for my own behavior." [...] The experience was overwhelmingly emotional for Kramer, as at one time during rehearsals he watched actor Brad Davis hold his dying lover played by D.W. Moffett on stage; Kramer {{went into the bathroom}} and sobbed, only moments later to find Davis holding him. The play is considered a literary landmark. It contended with the AIDS crisis when few would speak of the disease afflicting gay men, including gays themselves; it remains the longest-running play ever staged at the Public Theater, running for a year starting in 1985. It has been produced over 600 times in the U.S., Europe (where it was televised in Poland), Israel, and South Africa. Actors following Davis who portrayed Kramer's alter ego Ned Weeks included Joel Grey, Richard Dreyfuss (in Los Angeles), Martin Sheen (at the Royal Court in London), Tom Hulce and then John Shea in the West End, Raul Esparza in a highly acclaimed 2004 revival at the Public Theater, and most recently Joe Mantello on Broadway at the Golden Theater. Upon seeing the production of The Normal Heart, Naomi Wolf commented, [...] "No one else on the left at that time... ever used the moral framework that is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of Kramer's voice, and that the right has coopted so skillfully.

60|$|Water is experience, {{immediate}} sensation, {{and wine}} is emotion, {{and it is}} with the intellect, as distinguished from imagination, that we enlarge the bounds of experience and separate it from all but itself, from illusion, from memory, and create among other things science and good journalism. Emotion, on the other hand, grows intoxicating and delightful after it has been enriched with the memory of old emotions, with all the uncounted flavours of old experience, and it is necessarily an antiquity of thought, emotions that have been deepened by the experiences of many men of genius, that distinguishes the cultivated man. The subject-matter of his meditation and invention is old, and he will disdain a too conscious originality in the arts as in those matters of daily life where, is it not Balzac who says, 'we are all conservatives?' He is above all things well bred, and whether he write or paint will not desire a technique that denies or obtrudes his long and noble descent. Corneille and Racine did not deny their masters, and when Dante spoke of his master Virgil there was no crowing of the cock. In their day imitation was conscious or all but conscious, and while originality was but <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the more <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the man himself, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the deeper because unconscious, no quick analysis could find out their miracle, that needed it may be generations to reveal; but it is our imitation that is unconscious and that waits the certainties of time. The more religious the subject-matter of an art, the more will it be as it were stationary, and the more ancient will be the emotion that it arouses and the circumstances that it calls up before our eyes. When in the Middle Ages the pilgrim to St. Patrick's Purgatory found himself on the lakeside, he found a boat made out of a hollow tree to ferry him to the cave of vision. In religious painting and poetry, crowns and swords of an ancient pattern take upon themselves new meanings, and it is impossible to separate our idea of what is noble from a mystic stair, where not men and women, but robes, jewels, incidents, ancient utilities float upward slowly over the all but sleeping mind, putting on emotional and spiritual life as they ascend until they are swallowed up by some far glory that they even were too modern and momentary to endure. All art is dream, and what the day is done with is dreaming ripe, and what art moulds religion accepts, and in the end all is in the wine cup, all is in the drunken phantasy, and the grapes begin to stammer.|$|R
