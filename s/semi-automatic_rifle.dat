5|$|Sometime after 4p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc Lépine {{arrived at}} the {{building}} housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, armed with a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>rifle</b> and a hunting knife. He had purchased a Ruger Mini-14 on November 21, 1989 in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal, telling the clerk {{that he was going}} to use it to hunt small game. Lépine was familiar with the layout of the building since he had been in and around the École Polytechnique at least seven times in the weeks leading up to the event.|$|E

At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama were home at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the shooting from an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, {{to find out why}} the first family had not been informed.|$|E

5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>rifle,</b> then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E

25|$|The first {{successful}} {{design for a}} <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>rifle</b> is attributed to German-born gunsmith Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher, who unveiled the design in 1885. The Model 85 {{was followed by the}} equally innovative Mannlicher Models 91, 93 and 95 semi-automatic rifles. Although Mannlicher earned his reputation with his bolt-action rifle designs, he also produced a few semi-automatic pistols, including the Steyr Mannlicher M1894, which employed an unusual blow-forward action and held five rounds of 6.5mm ammunition that were fed into the M1894 by a stripper clip.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the American M1 Garand was {{the first}} <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>rifle</b> to replace its nation's bolt-action rifle as the standard-issue {{infantry}} weapon. The gas-operated M1 Garand was developed by Canadian-born John Garand for the U.S. government at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. After years of research and testing, the first production model of the M1 Garand was unveiled in 1937. During World War II, the M1 Garand gave American infantrymen an advantage over their opponents, {{most of whom were}} issued slower firing bolt-action rifles.|$|E

25|$|The Winchester Model 1907 is a blowback-operated, <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>rifle</b> {{produced}} by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company beginning in 1906 with production ending in 1958. It fired a cartridge of intermediate power (roughly equivalent in energy to the 7.62x39), cycled through a semi-automatic operating mechanism, fed by a detachable magazine. It was fed from a 5, 10, or 15 round detachable box magazine located immediately forward of the trigger guard. In size and handling, it is much like an M1 carbine, though the 1907 is heavier and fires a much harder hitting round.|$|E

The gunman was later apprehended and taken into custody. Until the situation was clarified and under control, a few terminals at the airport were evacuated, all inbound flights were diverted and all outbound flights were grounded until the airport began returning to normal operation at around 2:30p.m.|$|E

25|$|Once he {{finished}} eating, Bryant moved towards {{the back of}} the café and set a video camera on a vacant table. He took out a Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine (<b>semi-automatic</b> <b>rifle)</b> and, firing from the hip, began shooting patrons and staff. Within fifteen seconds, he had fired seventeen shots, killing twelve people and wounding ten. Bryant then walked {{to the other side of}} the shop and fired 12 more times, killing another eight people while wounding two. He then changed magazines before fleeing, shooting at people in the car park and from his yellow Volvo 244 sedan as he drove away; four were killed and an additional six were injured.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>rifle</b> {{adopted and}} widely issued {{by a major}} {{military}} power (France) was the Fusil Automatique Modele 1917. This is a locked breech, gas-operated action which is very similar in its mechanical principles to the future M1 Garand in the United States. The M1917 was fielded during the latter stages of World War I {{but it did not}} receive a favorable reception. However its shortened and improved version, the Model 1918, was much more favourably received during the Moroccan Rif War from 1920 to 1926. The Lebel bolt-action rifle remained the standard French infantry rifle until replaced in 1936 by the MAS-36 despite the various semi-automatic rifles designed between 1918 and 1935.|$|E
