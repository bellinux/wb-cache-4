40|$|Problem statement: The current {{research}} investigated {{the utilization of}} <b>soft</b> wood <b>waste</b> as a feedstock to produce a value-added product-fuel ethanol. Approach: The main issue in converting <b>soft</b> wood <b>waste</b> to fuel ethanol is the accessibility of the polysaccharides for breaking down into monosaccharides. This study focused {{on the use of}} steam as the pretreatment method. The governing factors for the effectiveness of steam pretreatment are steam temperature and retention times. Following steam pretreatment, <b>soft</b> wood <b>waste</b> was subjected to acid hydrolysis. The sugars released by acid hydrolysis were fermented in series chemical reactions that convert sugars to ethanol. The fermentation reaction was caused by yeast, which feed on the sugars. Results: Steam pretreatment was able to improve both glucose yields from acid hydrolysis and ethanol yields from fermentation. The results obtained from this study showed that steam pretreated <b>soft</b> wood <b>waste</b> are a heterogeneous material. So biomass goes through a size-reduction step {{to make it easier to}} handle and to make the ethanol production process more efficient. Steam treatment on <b>soft</b> wood <b>waste</b> increased the hydrolysis of cellulose by acid hydrolysis. Following 24 h of diluted or concentrated acid hydrolysis, a maximum cellulose conversion of 20. 5 % was obtained. Similarly, sugars to ethanol conversions were improved by steam treatment.

40|$|Quantitative {{extraction}} of tritium from a sample matrix {{is critical to}} efficient measurement of the low-energy pure beta emitter. Oxidative pyrolysis using a tube furnace (Pyrolyser) has been adopted as an industry standard approach for the liberation of tritium (Warwick et al. in Anal Chim Acta 676 : 93 – 102, 2010) however pyrolysis of organic-rich materials can be problematic.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} {{sections of the}} urban waste precariat, positioned in the City of Tshwane, responded to the formalisation and privatisation of the waste management system by the city's public authorities. Focusing on two landfill sites, it consists of an ethnographic description {{and analysis of the}} nexus between waste makers, waste governors and the waste precariat, including waste-pickers. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, the ethnography brings to light aspects and dynamics of the waste management system which are invisible to the waste governors. These include a typical instance of "accumulation by dispossession" (Harvey 2004, Samson 2012), which involved the closure of three municipal landfill sites and the relocation of a section of the city's waste precariat to other landfill sites, as the state sought to capture the value of the waste generated by the waste makers in the city. Moreover, the closure of one landfill site located {{in the midst of a}} wealthy suburb also shows how this process of dispossession is constructed on older distinctions of race and class (Malan 1996, Ballard 2004). As those sections of the waste precariat move to another landfill they are confronted with new dynamics which include access to <b>soft</b> <b>waste</b> being controlled by an established waste-picker committee and city-supported cooperatives that have formed an alliance with the waste governors. As a result, the 'newcomers' are pushed into fringe recycling. This thesis contributes to the debate around the formalisation of waste picking in demonstrating how the process of formalisation, often pushed for and initiated by third sector organisations (Alexander 2009), engenders the exclusion of fringe recycling practices. As such this thesis contributes to a gap in the literature on fringe recycling, in the process also working towards portraying waste-pickers as a differentiated group. In theorising fringe recycling as part of the broader response of the waste precariat to formalisation and privatisation, this thesis deploys the concept of bricolage (Levi-Strauss 1966) in order to make sense of the creative and autonomous actions implied in improvisation. This emphasis on improvisation and creativity pushes the thesis into a consideration of 'things' (Ingold 2010) and the processes of formation, flows and the transformation of materials. Tracing the complex lines of flow and entanglement that exists between people and things in the context of landfill sites gives credence to the idea of a thing as a "gathering together of the threads of life" (Ingold 2010 : 2 - 3) and challenges our established understanding of agency and indeed the effort by Appadurai (1986) to theorise value through tracing 'the social life of things'.

Abstract. In this study, nutritional components that are obtained during poultry slaughtering having significance with respect to processing into animal feeds were investigated. By-products obtained during poultry slaughtering are considered very valuable raw materials for production of highly valuable animal feeds and energetic feeds. Recognition of chemical and physical characteristics of the raw materials represents essential prerequisite for conduction of any technological process, for proper raw materials handling {{as well as for the}} equipment and machines design that are necessary for acceptance and processing of the inedible slaughterhouse by-products. Authors have found that the nitrogen complex of the examined raw materials contains predominantly proteins. Digestible nitrogen for all investigated raw materials equals approximately with total nitrogen content, indicating that all proteins from these raw materials are accessible for utilization in animal organism, with exception of feathers that need special technological processing. Basic chemical composition, nitrogen fractions and amino acid composition of the inedible by-products from poultry slaughterhouses indicate that the processing of these raw materials could be directed into production of swine and pet feeds production, as well in production of bio fuels and biogas. Blood and feathers anyhow represent significant protein source, and <b>soft</b> <b>wastes,</b> heads and legs, as well as the mixed raw material, besides as protein source, can be regarded as raw fat source.

Methods: Prospective study in Government district maternity hospital. 300 term newborns were assessed by CAN score and anthropometry recorded. The newborns were classified as per weight for age. Ponderal index (PI), Body mass index (BMI) and midarm circumference/head circumference ratio (MAC/HC) calculated and compared to CAN Score for accuracy in identifying FM. Findings: Incidence of FM was 24 %. Newborns identified malnourished by PI, BMI, MAC/HC were evaluated by CAN score and significant number of them (31 / 78 in PI, 60 / 121 in BMI, 51 / 81 in MAC/HC) were found well nourished. Similarly those recognized as normal by PI, BMI, MAC/HC were malnourished by CAN score(25 / 222 in PI, 11 / 179 in BMI, 42 / 219 in MAC/HC) with statistical significance(0. 0001).

The CWLF, located in SNL/NM Technical Area II, is a 1. 5 -acre site that received nuclear weapon components and related materials from about 1950 through 1987. These materials {{were used in the}} development and testing of nuclear weapon designs. The CWLF is being remediated by the SNL/NM Environmental Restoration (ER) Project pursuant to regulations of the New Mexico Environment Department. A goal of the CWLF project is to maximize the amount of excavated materials that can be demilitarized and recycled. However, some of these materials are radioactively contaminated and, if they cannot be decontaminated, are destined to require disposal as radioactive waste. Five major radioactive waste streams have been designated on the CWLF project, including: unclassified <b>soft</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> [...] consists of soft, compatible trash such as paper, plastic, and plywood; unclassified solid radioactive waste [...] includes scrap metal, other unclassified hardware items, and soil; unclassified mixed waste [...] contains the same materials as unclassified soft or solid radioactive waste, but also contains one or more Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) constituents; classified radioactive waste [...] consists of classified artifacts, usually weapons components, that contain only radioactive contaminants; and classified mixed waste [...] comprises radioactive classified material that also contains RCRA constituents. These waste streams contain a variety of radionuclides that exist both as surface contamination and as sealed sources. To characterize these wastes, the CWLF project's waste management team is relying on data obtained from direct measurement of radionuclide activity content to the maximum extent possible and, in cases where direct measurement is not technically feasible, from accumulated PK of the excavated materials...|$|R

40|$|Suspension is a {{necessary}} system for solar cars because it protects the frame and other on-board components from large jolts encountered along highways. If the suspension is too <b>soft,</b> energy is <b>wasted</b> by absorbing the motion of a car as it travels over bumps. For increased efficiency, most solar cars use a suspension that is stiffer than normal. For this project, the solar car has two front wheels and one rear wheel.

The type of front suspension for this project is a double wishbone system. It has a pair of an A-frames, one above the other, mounted to {{the top and bottom of}} the wheel hub.

30|$|Results clearly {{demonstrated}} that the employed waste materials completely carbonized by pyrolysis phenomena at about 500  °C for 20  min, because of the <b>soft</b> nature of <b>waste</b> materials and developed ACs having high surface and porous areas. The basic microstructure of the char with microporosity is formed around 500  °C (Sun et al. 1997). The AC manufacturing consists of a charring or carbonization step in which the most of non carbon material (and much of the carbon) is volatilized by pyrolysis (usually between 500 and 750  °C) and obviously weight (60 – 70  %) is loosed (Girgis and Ishak 1999; Holland 1994; Sun et al. 1997). The present study clearly revealed that the higher C containing ACWM exhibited the larger surface and porous areas developed by microwave heating process. The criteria of higher percentage of C as well as larger surface and porous areas would play significant role to increase the sorption capacity of ACWM. AC produced by the pyrolysis of carbonaceous materials of vegetable origin, such as wood, coal, peat, fruit stones, and shell or synthetic polymer followed by the activation of the chars obtained from them (Manocha 2003). The AC of highly developed porosity and correspondingly large surface area is obtained only by activating the carbonized material either by physical or chemical activation (Menendez et al. 1999). The AC possesses extraordinarily large surface area and pore volume those give it a unique adsorption capacity (Manocha 2003). The surface chemistry and pore size distribution of AC are highly responsible for adsorption process (Radovic 2001).|$|R

While these regulations specify the level of flame retardancy required, they do not specify how such levels should be achieved. Consequently, it remains unclear which FRs are present in UK soft furnishings. This is important not only to help assess what FRs we may be exposed to currently, but which FRs are currently entering the waste stream with concomitant potential for release into the environment. To address this data gap, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and a range of chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were measured in samples of domestic and office <b>waste</b> <b>soft</b> furnishings products entering the UK waste stream in 2011 and 2012.

Such properties can be improved by incorporating a sustainable element in the existing variety of stabilisation techniques. Rubber chips derived from waste rubber tyres and sand were used as additives together with cement to stabilise clay. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS), bender element (BE), one-dimensional consolidation test; Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)) observations, Acid Neutralisation Capacity (ANC), Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and pH were done to examine the eff~cacy of rubber chips and sand stabilisation. Analysis was carried out to investigate the effects of 0, 2 and 4 % cement (for kaolin) while 0, 5 and 10 % cement (for soft clay) together with 0, 5, 10 and 15 % rubber chips or sand addition, as well as different curing periods up to two months. Furthermore, the stringently controlled laboratory tests were complemented with semi-controlled test and field tests on the optimum strength mixtureSobtained from the laboratory test result (viz. for SC- 10 C- 5 R and SC- 1 OC- 1 5 s). An analytical comparison {{was made of the}} philosophy of the three different environmental methods of the stabilised soil testing, i. e, laboratory-controlled, semi-controlled and field test.

40|$|Civil {{engineering}} projects {{located in}} areas with soft soil present {{some of the most}} common problems {{in many parts of the}} world. Depending on the nature of the project, expensive solutions are sometimes used, which commonly involves the removal and replacement of the weak soils. Alternatively, ground improvement is now considered the best solution for such problems. Soil improvement can be achieved either by mechanical and/or chemical stabilisation. To reduce the use of cement and lime as the most traditional stabilizers applied to <b>soft</b> soils, sustainable <b>waste</b> materials have been increasingly used for soil stabilisation. This paper presents the results of a laboratory study on the stabilisation of silty clayey soil using a waste material fly ash (FA) with high calcium content produced from the incineration processes in domestic power stations. The FA used in this study has a high content of calcium oxide CaO and suitable content of silicon dioxide SiO 2 (more than 25 %). These cementitious and pozzolanic properties are responsible for the self-cementing characteristics of this fly ash. An intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic matter content has been used in this study. The effect of FA on the physical and engineering properties on the selected soil such as the consistency limits, compaction characteristics (optimum moisture content and maximum dry density), and soil strength (unconfined compressive strength (UCS)), has been investigated. Different percentages of fly ash were added to the soft soil (1. 5, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 %) to produce different admixtures. Improvement levels were evaluated dependant on the UCS tests carried out on specimens at different periods of curing (zero, 7, 14, and 28 days). Results indicated that the maximum dry density decreased and the optimum moisture content increased with the increase of the FA content. In terms of the UCS tests, the results yielded the optimum value of the FA used in this study to be 12. 0 %, as this percentage decreased the index of plasticity (IP) significantly. The results of this study indicated that the use of this waste material could produce a significant cementitious reaction when added to the soil, and it could be used as a supplementary cementitious material...|$|R

The first part analyses and summarises existing approaches worldwide to sustainable tourism, potential benefits and different impacts of tourism in order to specify possible measures avoiding unwanted impacts later on. The need to change towards sutainability in tourism is based on analysis of different policies and documents and a summary of duties of the Czech government (national ones and international ones). There is also a list of the best experiences available how to promote, support and encourage development of sustainable tourism based on analysis of the World Tourism Organisation studies and recommendations, existing EMS systems like ISO, EU ecolabel or methods, approaches, criteria and indicators used by different labels. Next part defines neccessary elements for successful system functioning in the Czech Republic, based on existing and working governmental and non-governmental structures not forgetting such important activities like information, education, marketing and motivation and sets expected responsibilities and roles of different potential partners participating on the system implementation. Unfortunately, there is no one certified tourist business in Czechia according to ISO, EMAS or EU flower before end of October 2004. Main reasons are price, missing benefits and motivations for businesses. Therefore an self-assesment questionnaire for a small-scale accommodation is developed. This fits with the „easy to understand, easy to answer“. This option is missing in the country and it is understood as a prestep to more sophisticated methods of measurment. The main sustainable criteria are set as “GUESTS“, “NATURE RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT“ (water, energy, green building, reduction of <b>waste,</b> <b>soft</b> mobility, biodiversity), “LOCAL COMMUNITIES“ (culture, economy) and “FUTURE“. The Czech Republic needs to start to implement sustainable tourism policies in practice. It should be organised in wide cross-sector partnership co-operation of profession associations, consumer associations and under the official responsibility of Ministry of Environment and Ministry for Regional Development (responsible for tourism). This thesis has been published in a shorten form during the WTO conference for Europe “Public Private Partnerships for Sustainability Certification of Tourism Activities“, taken place in October 2004 in Mariánské Lázně. Based on this presentation, conclusions and results of this thesis will be included in the project „National programme for Sustainability in Tourism“. This project will be submitted in the Czech government by both above mentioned ministries before end of 2004...|$|R
40|$|The work {{conducted}} {{in this thesis}} examines the potential for emissions of flame retardants (FRs) {{from a range of}} treated end-of-life materials during and following disposal. A series of standardised leaching experiments were developed and conducted to study FR leaching from a range of waste flame retarded products, including: textiles, EPS and XPS building insulation foams, cathode-ray tube plastics and polyurethane furniture foams (PUF). The leaching tests were conducted using a range of leaching fluids, with the view of simulating the characteristics of real landfill leachates. A number of different test parameters were examined, such as a variety of dissolved humic matter concentrations, landfill relevant pHs between 5. 8 and 8. 5, landfill relevant temperatures, the effect of agitation, contact durations and longer term cycles of periodic wetting and draining of waste. It is apparent from these experiments that despite the relatively hydrophobic physicochemical properties of brominated FRs (BFRs), they are able to leach from waste materials at substantial concentrations. Concentrations of ƩPBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) in the leachate from the leaching experiments in this study ranged from 14, 000 – 200, 000 ng L- 1, while concentrations of ƩHBCDD (hexabromocyclododecane) ranged from 170 ng L- 1 – 13, 000 ng L- 1 in textile leaching experiments and from 13, 000 ng L- 1 – 4, 200, 000 ng L- 1 in building insulation foam experiments. BFR leaching appears to be a second order process, whereby a period of initially intense dissolution of more labile BFR is followed by a slower stage corresponding to external diffusion of the soluble residue in the material. Tris (chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) is more readily soluble in water than the BFRs studied, and leaching of TCIPP from PUF appears to be a first order process. Concentrations of TCIPP in the leachate from the leaching experiments in this study ranged from 13 mg L- 1 – 130 mg L- 1. In serial batch leaching experiments, > 95 % of TCIPP was depleted from the flexible PUF after the sixth batch (168 h total contact). Hence, leaching is potentially a very significant pathway for TCIPP emissions to the environment. A small survey of <b>waste</b> <b>soft</b> furnishings from a variety of UK domestic and office locations was also conducted, to help determine the total FR content entering the UK waste stream {{as a result of the}} disposal of soft furnishings. The predominant FR detected was TCIPP. Closed test chamber experiments investigating the effect of temperature on volatilisation of TCIPP from polyurethane foam were conducted. These experiments show volatilisation of TCIPP from PUF to increase exponentially with temperature and to constitute an additional potentially significant pathway for emissions from UK MSW landfills, with TCIPP emissions via volatilisation from landfilled PUF estimated to range between ~ 200 and ~ 3, 800 tonnes yr- 1...|$|R
