Based on the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, {{we present}} {{analytical}} description of low-energy electron transport through a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>junction</b> of two semimetal armchair ribbons. The results obtained demonstrate the transmission suppression {{in the vicinity}} of the neutrality point except for the junction of the ribbons consisting of 3 p − 1 and 3 p + 5 dimer lines, p/ 2 is odd. Unlike other interconnections, these compounds are shown to be free of even local levels arising at the junction interface and exhibit electron backscattering to be inversely as the square of p + 1...|$|E
40|$|The basilar artery {{is one of}} {{the three}} vessels {{providing}} the blood supply to the human brain. It arises from the confluence of the two vertebral arteries. In fact, it is the only artery of this size in the human body arising from a confluence instead of a bifurcation. Earlier work, concerning flow computations in simplified models of the basilar artery, has demonstrated that a junction causes distinctive flow phenomena. This paper presents three-dimensional finite-element computations of steady viscous flow in a rigid <b>symmetrical</b> <b>junction</b> geometry representing the anatomical situation in a more realistic way. The geometry consists of two round tubes merging into a single round outlet tube. The Reynolds number for the basilar artery ranges from 200 to 600, and both symmetrical and asymmetrical inflow from the two inlet tubes has been considered. Just downstream of the confluence a 'double hump' axial velocity profile is found. In the transition zone the flow pattern appears to have a complicated structure. In the symmetrical case the axial velocity profile shows a sharp central ridge, whereas in the asymmetrical case the highest 'hump' crosses the centreline of the tube. The flow has a highly three-dimensional character with secondary velocities easily exceeding 25 % of the mean axial flow velocity. The secondary flow pattern consists of four vortices. Under all simulated flow conditions, the inlet length turns out to be much larger than the average length of the human basilar artery. To validate the computational model, a comparison is made between numerical and experimental results for a junction geometry consisting of tubes with a rectangular cross-section. The experiments have been performed in a Perspex model with laser Doppler velocimetry and dye injection techniques. Good agreement between experimental and computational results is found. Moreover, all essential flow phenomena turn out to be quite similar to those obtained for the circular tube geometry...|$|E
40|$|For {{junctions}} between metals partially gapped by charge density waves (CDWs), the quasiparticle tunnel currents J(V) and conductances G(V) in external {{magnetic fields}} H are calculated as functions of H, the bias voltage V, temperature T, the dielectric gaps ∑, and the gapped portions μ of the Fermi surface (FS). The paramagnetic effect of H is taken into account, whereas orbital effects are neglected. General expressions are obtained for different CDW metal electrodes. Analytical formulas are obtained for T = 0. Explicit numerical {{calculations are carried}} out for <b>symmetrical</b> <b>junctions.</b> The results are substantially unlike those for junctions between superconductors. It is shown that due to the interplay between quasiparticles from nested and non-nested FS sections the junction properties involve features appropriate to both symmetrical and asymmetrical setups. In particular, for H = 0 discontinuities at eV = ± 2 ∑ and square-root singularities at eV = ±∑ should coexist. Here e is the elementary charge. For H ≠ 0 the former remain intact, while the latter split. It is suggested to use the splitting as a verification of the CDW nature of the pseudogap in high-Tc superconducting oxides...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The Least-Squares Boundary Residual Method is {{employed}} in the present paper to develop a computer model of the <b>symmetrical</b> six-port waveguide <b>junction.</b> The analytical formulation is difficult because of the insertion of a metallic post together with a dielectric sleeve into the over-sized cavity of the junction. Computational and experimental tests confirm that the resultant model is able to compute the scattering parameters of such a structurally-complicated component with numerical accuracies of ± 0. 001 and ± 0. 1 ◦ for magnitude and phase respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Construction of {{permanent}} metal−molecule− metal (MMM) junctions, though technically challenging, is desirable for both fundamental investigations and applications of molecule-based electronics. In this study, we employed the nanotransfer printing (nTP) technique using perfluoropo-lyether (PFPE) stamps to print Au thin films onto self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanedithiol formed on Au thin films. We {{show that the}} resulting MMM junctions form permanent and <b>symmetrical</b> tunnel <b>junctions,</b> {{without the need for}} an additional protection layer between the top metal electrode and the molecular layer. This type of junction makes it possible for direct investigations into the electrical properties of the molecules and the metal−molecule interfaces. Dependence of transport properties on the length of the alkane molecules and the area of the printed Au electrodes has been examined systematically. From the analysis of the current−voltage (I−V) curves using the Simmons model, the height of tunneling barrier associated with the molecule (alkane) has been determined to be 3. 5 ± 0. 2 eV, while the analysis yielded an upper bound of 2. 4 eV for the counterpart at the interface (thiol). The former is consistent with the theoretical value of ∼ 3. 5 − 5. 0 eV. The measured I−V curves show scaling with respect to the printed Au electrode area wit...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of the generalised proximity effect theory. The theory {{has been used to}} determine the energy gap (Δg) in proximised transition metal/aluminium bilayer structures such as Nb/Al, Ta/Al, V/Al and Mo/Al. These bilayers have different film thicknesses ranging from 5 to 260 nm. For the cases of Nb/Al, Ta/Al and V/Al bilayers, the interface parameters γ and γBN (here we define γ as the ratio of the products of normal state resistivity and coherence length in each film of the bilayer while γBN is the ratio of the boundary resistance between films 1 and 2 to the product of the resistivity and coherence length in the second film), which were used as input parameters to the model, were inferred experimentally from an existing bilayer of each kind and then suitably modified for different film thicknesses. This experimental assessment is therefore based on a comparison of measurements of the critical temperature and the energy gap at 300 mK with the predictions from the model for various values of γ, γBN. The energy gap of the bilayer was experimentally determined by using <b>symmetrical</b> superconducting tunnel <b>junctions</b> (STJs) of the form S–Al–AlOx–Al–S, where each electrode corresponds to a proximised bilayer. However for the case of Mo/Al bilayers the interface parameters were determined theoretically since currently no STJ data for this configuration are available. The results for the Nb/Al, Ta/Al and V/Al bilayers have also then been compared to experimentally determined energy gaps found for a series of STJs with different film thicknesses. The correspondence between experiment and theory is very good...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Nano/micro scale {{devices have}} {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest due to the emergence of wearable/portable devices. One of the challenging tasks in the miniaturization is to reduce the size and weight of the powering unit. Harvesting mechanical energy and making the device a self-powered one, not only helps in reducing the size/weight ratio but also in designing a maintenance free and sustainable device. Piezoelectric energy harvesting research has gained new momentum with the discovery of piezoelectric charges in semiconducting zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs). Semiconducting ZnO NWs provide an opportunity to integrate with electronic devices and circuits directly unlike non-conducting traditional piezoelectric materials. The coupling of piezoelectric and semiconducting properties was used to design energy generating devices called nanogenerators (NGs). The basic working principle involves application of a mechanical force to create a piezopotential across the wurtzite structured NWs and this piezopotential is channelled employing metal-semiconducting pathways such as p-n junctions. These junctions also {{play a key role in}} various other devices such as solar cells, capacitors, fuel cells and water splitting devices. This thesis concentrates mainly on the fabrication of semiconducting piezoelectric nanowires on functionalised flexible substrates and the junctions thereby obtained. It is based on the idea that ZnO NWs can be grown directly on poly(3, 4 -ethylendioxydithiophene) (PEDOT) or graphene-functionalised substrates using low temperature aqueous synthesis. ZnO NWs can be fabricated using a low temperature aqueous processing route on flexible substrates and fibres. ZnO creates a wide variety of nanostructures due to the polar terminating layers and the surface chemistry of the substrate. The position of the substrate in the growth solution was therefore investigated and found to dictate the morphology and aspect ratio of the nanostructure in seed mediated low temperature aqueous synthesis on polyethersulfone (PES) -based flexible substrates. Vapour phase polymerisation was used to fabricate PEDOT coated 2 -D and 3 -D PES. To produce graphene-coated flexible substrates, colloidal graphene was synthesized and functionalised onto 2 -D and 3 -D PES using layer by layer technique (LbL) with polyelectrolytes such as polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) and polystyrenesulfonate (PSS). The LbL modification was achieved by exploiting the surface functional groups in the colloidal graphene. Various surface treatments and heat treatments were carried out to tune the system to obtain higher conductivity. ZnO seed solution was coated and NWs were grown on the functionalized substrates. The newly formed junctions were characterised for their I-V characteristics to determine if they have similar function to junctions formed with ZnO on ITO or metals. ZnO NWs grown on PEDOT shows an ohmic contact and gives linear I-V characteristics. On the other hand when a PEDOT coated substrate was made to form a junction at the top of the ZnO NWs, it forms a Schottky contact and gives rectification. However the ZnO-graphene interface shows a Schottky contact. When a top graphene electrode was made to form a junction with ZnO NWs grown on graphene, the I-V characteristics shows a <b>symmetrical</b> and rectifying <b>junction</b> on both sides. Nanogenerators were designed and tested using ZnO NWs grown on PEDOT coated 2 -D and 3 -D PES. Thus, the fabricated PEDOT-NGs produced a higher current by a factor of 106 and a 102 times increase in the voltage compared to the traditional ITO grown NG design. Vapour phase polymerised PEDOT on flexible substrates eliminated the use of expensive and less efficient electrodes such as ITO and Au. It has also been shown that this approach can be extended to fibre substrates by sandwiching them between PEDOT sheets which make them more suitable for wearable energy harvesting with 102 times improved efficiency compared to ITO sandwiched fibre NG. The higher performance of PEDOT NGs was accounted by the new junctions formed at the interfaces which reduce the screening of free charge carriers in the system. Graphene NGs were fabricated using gold top electrodes. The NG fabricated on surface treated PES was found to outperform the NG fabricated without surface treatment due to the higher conductivity of the surface treated electrode. The output of the surface treated NG was found to be much less than the ITO based or PEDOT based NGs...|$|R
