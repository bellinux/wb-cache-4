5|$|At the NFL Spring League Meeting on May 23, 2017, a rule {{change was}} {{approved}} {{for the upcoming}} 2017 NFL season, which shortened overtime from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for preseason and regular season games.

5|$|Going {{into the}} final match, City were level on points with {{neighbours}} Manchester United, with City holding the advantage in goal average – the first decider if teams finished level on points – but needing to win {{to be sure of}} staying above their cross-city rivals. Liverpool were three points behind, but had a game in hand, <b>so</b> <b>could</b> still win the title if both City and United faltered. City faced tenth-placed Newcastle United at St James' Park; United were at home to bottom-half Sunderland. Bookmakers made United slight favourites for the title.|$|E

Martin marched <b>so</b> Jesse Jackson <b>could</b> run. Jesse ran <b>so</b> Obama <b>could</b> WIN."

In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. The Games were then scheduled for 1991.

The sister aircraft Najaden arrived later in the afternoon with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on the mountain and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> not help with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company.

5|$|During the 1964 ouster {{to remove}} Khrushchev as First Secretary and Premier, Podgorny and Brezhnev {{appealed to the}} Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for {{economic}} failures and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior. Influenced by Brezhnev and his allies, Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office. In the aftermath of Khrushchev's removal, a collective leadership was formed, headed by Brezhnev as First Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as head of government, and Anastas Mikoyan as head of state. Before becoming head of state, Podgorny served as the party's Second Secretary, and was therefore {{in charge of the}} Party's Organisational Division. In this capacity, Podgorny threatened Brezhnev's position as First Secretary because the Organisational Division, if Podgorny chose <b>so,</b> <b>could</b> easily be turned into his own power base within the party.

5|$|During {{the first}} 36 {{hours of the}} Battle of Megiddo, between 04:30 on 19 September and 17:00 on 20 September, the German and Ottoman front line had been cut by {{infantry}} of the EEF's XXI Corps. This allowed the cavalry of the Desert Mounted Corps {{to pass through the}} gap and begin their ride towards their objectives at Afulah, Nazareth, and Beisan. The two Ottoman armies were left without effective communications, and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> not organize any combined action against the continuing onslaught by the British Empire infantry in the Judean Hills. The Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies were forced to withdraw northwards along the main roads and railways from Tulkarm and Nablus, which converged to run through the Dothan Pass to Jenin on the Esdrealon Plain. There, retreating columns from these two Ottoman armies would be captured during the evening of 20 September by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, who already occupied the town.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiment}} {{had previously}} been considered, but rejected, by Isaac Newton as a practical demonstration of his theory of gravitation. However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, {{was convinced that the}} effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then <b>so</b> <b>could</b> the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of contour lines, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do <b>so</b> <b>could</b> make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.|$|E
5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E
5|$|Hulagu died in 1265, and was {{succeeded by}} Abaqa (1234–1282), who further pursued Western cooperation. Though a Buddhist, upon his {{succession}} he married Maria Palaiologina, an Orthodox Christian and the illegitimate {{daughter of the}} Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Abaqa corresponded with Pope Clement IV through 1267 and 1268, sending envoys to both Clement and King James I of Aragon. In a 1268 message to Clement, Abaqa promised to send troops to aid the Christians. It is unclear if this was what led to James's unsuccessful expedition to Acre in 1269. James initiated a small crusade, but a storm descended on his fleet as they attempted their crossing, forcing most of the ships to turn back. The crusade was ultimately handled by James's two sons Fernando Sanchez and Pedro Fernandez, who arrived in Acre in December 1269. Abaqa, despite his earlier promises of assistance, {{was in the process}} of facing another threat, an invasion in Khorasan by Mongols from Turkestan, and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> only commit a small force for the Holy Land, which did little but brandish the threat of an invasion along the Syrian frontier in October 1269.

5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> not have known about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he {{would probably have to}} have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E
5|$|The line of Beauchamps Earls {{ended in}} 1449 when Anne de Beauchamp, 15th Countess of Warwick, died. Richard Neville became the next Earl of Warwick through his wife's {{inheritance}} of the title. During {{the summer of}} 1469, Neville rebelled against King Edward IV and imprisoned him in Warwick Castle. Neville attempted to rule in the king's name; however, constant protests by the king's supporters forced the Earl to release the king. Neville was subsequently killed in the Battle of Barnet, fighting against King Edward IV in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. Warwick Castle then passed from Neville to his son-in-law, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. George Plantagenet was executed in 1478 and his lands passed onto Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick; however, Edward Plantagenet was only two when his father died so his lands were taken {{in the custody of}} The Crown. He was placed under attainder, and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> not inherit the throne, by Henry VII, being held by Henry for fourteen years in the Tower of London until he was executed for high treason in 1499, supposedly for conspiring to escape with the 'pretender' Perkin Warbeck. Edward was the last Earl of Warwick of the title's first creation.|$|E
5|$|What Yamamoto did {{not know}} was that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code (dubbed JN-25 by the Americans), divulging many details of his plan to the enemy. His {{emphasis}} on dispersal also meant none of his formations were {{in a position to}} support each other. For instance, despite the fact that Nagumo's carriers were expected to carry out strikes against Midway and bear the brunt of American counterattacks, the only warships in his fleet larger than the screening force of twelve destroyers were two Kongō-class fast battleships, two heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser. By contrast, Yamamoto and Kondo had between them two light carriers, five battleships, four heavy cruisers, and two light cruisers, none of which would see action at Midway. The light carriers of the trailing forces, and Yamamoto's three battleships, were unable {{to keep pace with the}} carriers of the Kido Butai and <b>so</b> <b>could</b> not have sailed in company with them. The distance between Yamamoto and Kondo's forces and Nagumo's carriers had grave implications during the battle: the invaluable reconnaissance capability of the scout planes carried by the cruisers and carriers, as well as the additional antiaircraft capability of the cruisers and the other two battleships of the Kongō-class in the trailing forces, was denied to Nagumo.|$|E
