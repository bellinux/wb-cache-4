25|$|The {{level of}} water in the steam separators, the {{percentage}} of steam in the reactor pressure tubes, the level at which the water begins to boil in the reactor core, the neutron flux and power distribution in the reactor, and the feedwater flow through the core have to be carefully controlled.

25|$|The turbine {{consists}} of one high-pressure rotor and four low-pressure ones. Five low-pressure separators-preheaters {{are used to}} heat steam with fresh steam before being fed to {{the next stage of}} the turbine. The uncondensed steam is fed into a condenser, mixed with condensate from the separators, fed by the first-stage condensate pump to a chemical purifier, then by a second-stage condensate pump to four deaerators where dissolved and entrained gases are removed; deaerators also serve as storage tanks for feedwater. From the deaerators, the water is pumped through filters and into the bottom parts of the <b>steam</b> <b>separator</b> drums.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a <b>steam</b> <b>separator</b> before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E

50|$|The flow {{exceeded}} the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam {{pressure in the}} <b>steam</b> <b>separators.</b> At the same time, the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the <b>steam</b> <b>separators.</b> Since water weakly absorbs neutrons (and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam), turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still. The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow, {{in an effort to}} increase steam pressure, and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power.|$|R
25|$|The reactor is {{tripped in}} cases of high or low water level in the <b>steam</b> <b>separators</b> (with two {{selectable}} low-level thresholds); high steam pressure; low feedwater flow; loss of two main coolant pumps on either side. These trips can be manually disabled.|$|R
2500|$|If {{the coolant}} {{temperature}} {{is too close}} to its boiling point, cavitation can occur in the pumps and their operation can become erratic or even stop entirely. The feedwater temperature is dependent on the steam production; the steam phase portion is led to the turbines and condensers and returns significantly cooler (...) than the water returning directly from the <b>steam</b> <b>separator</b> (284°C). At low reactor power, therefore, the inlet temperature may become dangerously high. The water is kept below the saturation temperature to prevent film boiling and the associated drop in heat transfer rate.|$|E

2500|$|The reactor has two {{independent}} cooling circuits, each having four main circulating pumps (three operating, one standby). The cooling water is fed to the reactor through lower water lines {{to a common}} pressure header (one for each cooling circuit), which is split to 22 group distribution headers, each feeding 38–41 pressure channels through the core, where the feedwater boils. The mixture of steam and water {{is led by the}} upper steam lines, one for each pressure channel, from the reactor top to the <b>steam</b> <b>separators,</b> pairs of thick horizontal drums located in side compartments above the reactor top; each has [...] diameter, [...] length, wall thickness of , and weighs [...] Steam, with steam quality of about 15%, is taken {{from the top of the}} <b>separators</b> by two <b>steam</b> collectors per <b>separator,</b> combined, and led to two turbogenerators in the turbine hall, then to condensers, reheated to , and pumped by the condensate pumps to deaerators, where remains of gaseous phase and corrosion-inducing gases are removed. The resulting feedwater is led to the <b>steam</b> <b>separators</b> by feedwater pumps and mixed with water from them at their outlets. From the bottom of the <b>steam</b> <b>separators,</b> the feedwater is led by 12 downpipes (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.|$|R
5000|$|SCWR is {{typically}} {{designed as a}} direct-cycle, whereby steam or hot supercritical water from the core is used directly in a steam turbine. This makes the design simple. As a BWR is simpler than a PWR, a SCWR is a lot simpler and more compact than a less-efficient BWR having the same electrical output. There are no <b>steam</b> <b>separators,</b> <b>steam</b> dryers, internal recirculation pumps, or recirculation flow inside the pressure vessel. The design is a once-through, direct-cycle, the simplest type of cycle possible.

A 1.22GW electrical BWR6 has 177 control rods and 748 fuel assemblies for a total of 46,376 fuel rods. It had a gravity containment flooder, and they had options for a compact control room, and only Clinton took the solid state nuclear system protection system.|$|R
50|$|Once {{this water}} is again inside the boiler or steam generator, {{the process of}} adding the latent heat of {{vaporization}} or Enthalpy is underway. The boiler transfers energy to the water by the chemical reaction of burning some type of fuel. The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum. Once the water enters the steam drum it goes down the downcomers to the lower inlet waterwall headers. From the inlet headers the water rises through the waterwalls and is eventually turned into steam due to the heat being generated by the burners located {{on the front and}} rear waterwalls (typically). As the water is turned into steam/vapor in the waterwalls, the steam/vapor once again enters the steam drum. The steam/vapor is passed through a series of <b>steam</b> and water <b>separators</b> and then dryers inside the steam drum. The <b>steam</b> <b>separators</b> and dryers remove the water droplets from the steam and the cycle through the waterwalls is repeated. This process is known as natural circulation.|$|R
50|$|Steam {{produced}} in the reactor core passes through <b>steam</b> <b>separators</b> and dryer plates above the core and then directly to the turbine, {{which is part of}} the reactor circuit. Because the water around the core of a reactor is always contaminated with traces of radionuclides, the turbine must be shielded during normal operation, and radiological protection must be provided during maintenance. The increased cost related to operation and maintenance of a BWR tends to balance the savings due to the simpler design and greater thermal efficiency of a BWR when compared with a PWR. Most of the radioactivity in the water is very short-lived (mostly N-16, with a 7-second half-life), so the turbine hall can be entered soon after the reactor is shut down.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} water in the steam separators, the {{percentage}} of steam in the reactor pressure tubes, the level at which the water begins to boil in the reactor core, the neutron flux and power distribution in the reactor, and the feedwater flow through the core have to be carefully controlled.

50|$|By pumping {{slightly}} more water in {{than can be}} evaporated, the output {{was a mixture of}} steam and a bit of water with concentrated dissolved solids. A <b>steam</b> <b>separator</b> removed the water before the steam was fed to the train. An automatic blowdown valve would be periodically cycled to eject solids and sludge from the separator. This reduced limescale buildup caused by boiling hard water. Scale build-up that occurred had to be removed with acid washouts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steam dome}} is a vessel fitted {{to the top}} of the boiler of a steam engine. It {{contains}} the opening to the main steam pipe and its purpose is to allow this opening to be kept well above the water level in the boiler. This arrangement acts as a simple <b>steam</b> <b>separator</b> and minimises the risk that water will be carried over to the cylinders where it might cause a hydraulic lock - this is also known as priming.|$|E

40|$|The {{supercritical}} water-cooled reactor (SCWR) {{is one of}} the six reactor technologies {{selected for}} research and development under the Generation-IV program. SCWRs are promising advanced nuclear systems because of their high thermal efficiency (i. e., about 45 % vs. about 33 % efficiency for current Light Water Reactors, LWRs) and considerable plant simplification. SCWRs are basically LWRs operating at higher pressure and temperatures with a direct once-through cycle. Operation above the critical pressure eliminates coolant boiling, so the coolant remains single-phase throughout the system. Thus the need for recirculation and jet pumps, a pressurizer, <b>steam</b> generators, <b>steam</b> <b>separators</b> and dryers is eliminated. The main mission of the SCWR is generation of low-cost electricity. It is built upon two proven technologies, LWRs, which are the most commonly deployed power generating reactors in the world, and supercritical fossil-fired boilers, a large number of which is also in use around the world...|$|R

Experiments were carried out in an air-water facility at atmospheric conditions to characterize the entrainment in drums with ratio of the drum diameter to riser diameter varying from 1 to 6. Various parameters influencing the liquid entrainment were identified. The vapour superficial velocity and the drum diameter to riser diameter ratio were found to be the most influencing parameters.

The superficial layer of the assembled coating was occupied by PTFE self-segregated from PPS during the melt-flowing process of this blend polymer; it conferred an outstanding slipperiness and water repellent properties because of its low friction and surface free energy. However, PTFE underwent hydrothermal oxidation in hot brine, transforming its molecular structure into an alkylated polyfluorocarboxylate salt complex linked to Na. Although such molecular transformation increased the friction and surface free energy, and also impaired the thermal stability of PTFE, the top PTFE-rich PPS layer significantly contributed to preventing the permeation of moisture and corrosive electrolytes through the coating film, so mitigating the corrosion of carbon steel...|$|R
5000|$|The Clayton forced-circulation steam {{generator}} {{does not have}} a steam drum in the typical sense. A series of small tubes that are part of one giant coil, usually made of steel, have feed water pumped through at great speed. The water is pumped {{from the top of the}} {{steam generator}} down to the bottom and out. The tubes that are arranged in such a way that the combustion gasses pass around the tube subsequently heating the water. Essentially, the arrangement can be best described as having a large thin walled coil of pipe wrapping around the circumference of a vertical steel drum looping around and down until it reaches the bottom. As only some of the water may become steam, it is important to separate the two and send any water back through to absorb more heat. If this separation does not occur, the damage to the system could be costly. If steam goes through the generation tubes inside, the tubes may overheat and become weak, and if water is allowed down into the steam system, corrosion, water hammer, or other ill effects may occur. To combat this, after exiting the steam generator, the mixture is put through a centrifugal <b>steam</b> <b>separator</b> which does exactly that producing steam that is above ninety-nine percent dry saturated steam. If superheated steam is desired, an additional coil is run back through the steam generator. To maintain a constant level of water in the <b>steam</b> <b>separator,</b> the feed pump in conjunction with a leveling system is utilized. A great advantage to this system is that steam can be generated very quickly. However, the downside to this system is the complete dependence on a constant supply of feed water.

5000|$|The SCWR {{operates}} at supercritical pressure. The reactor outlet coolant is supercritical water. Light water {{is used as}} a neutron moderator and coolant. Above the critical point, steam and liquid become the same density and are indistinguishable, eliminating the need for pressurizers and steam generators (PWR), or jet/recirculation pumps, <b>steam</b> <b>separators</b> and dryers (BWR). Also by avoiding boiling, SCWR does not generate chaotic voids (bubbles) with less density and moderating effect. In a LWR this can affect heat transfer and water flow, and the feedback can make the reactor power harder to predict and control. Neutronic and thermal hydraulic coupled calculation is needed to predict the power distribution. SCWR's simplification should reduce construction costs and improve reliability and safety.A LWR type SCWR adopts water rods with thermal insulation and A CANDU type SCWR keeps water moderator in a Carandira tank. A fast reactor core of the LWR type SCWR adopts tight fuel rod lattice as a high conversion LWR. The fast neutron spectrum SCWR has advantages of a higher poｗer density, but needs plutonium and uranium mixed oxides fuel which will be available from reprocessing.|$|R

Introduction: Unless steam is passed through a superheater after it leaves the boiler,it will carry with it {{a certain amount of}} entrained water. The violent ebulition in the boiler throws more or less water up in the steam space as spray,and some of this is carried along with the steam. Besides this,there {{is a certain amount of}} water in the steam caused by condensation in the pipes before it reaches the place where it is to be used. This water increases the initial condensation in the cylinder,and if there is a great deal of it present,may cause the cylinder heads to be blown out. To get rid of,so called "Steam Separators" are used. These depend for their action upon the fact that the water is several hundred times as heavy as the steam,and when the direction of flow of the steam is quickly changed,the inertia of the water carries it on out of the path of the steam into a chamber where it can be drawn off. Ribbed plates called baffles are usually used to collect the water and direct its flow...|$|R
