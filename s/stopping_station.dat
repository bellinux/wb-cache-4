But I was certain now, from the studious unconcern he was anxious to exhibit, that he must be a spy upon us. He overdid his mood of careless observation. It was too obvious an assumption. Precisely the same thing happened again when we pulled up at Berwick. I knew now that we were watched. It would be impossible for us to get married at Edinburgh if we were thus closely pursued. There was but one chance open; we must leave the train abruptly at the first Scotch <b>stopping</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for computing and analysing headway variance of fixed-route buses offering scheduled service is developed. The model assumes {{a situation where}} both the passengers' OD pattern and the bus-route structure {{do not have any}} particular form but the number of passengers served at any bus station is a stationary Poisson process. Basic probability concepts are mostly used in deriving the model. Innovations in the model are the inclusion of a skip probability at a stop and the correlation factors between successive bus loads at a loading point and between the travel times of successive buses on a link. The model is, therefore, applicable to a wider range of situations than was possible with the earlier models. Results indicate that bus loading conditions and traffic conditions along the route are the major factors responsible for headway variability. The developed model can be used to determine the relative importance of these factors on headway variance at individual <b>stopping</b> <b>station</b> and thereby simplify the task of evolving effective countermeasures in any given situation. A numerical example that illustrates the application of the model is also given. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{coupling}} and decoupling of trains {{while they}} are in motion {{is one of the}} research fields of the DLR project Next Generation Train. The coupling will be non-mechanical, but virtual and will be maintained by means of distance control technology. A special challenge of the virtual coupling in railway operation is the peril point of the switch in case of failure during the passage of two trains which are coming from different tracks, running in close succession at high-speed. Therefore some concepts are unrealizable with the current switch technology. Nevertheless there are situations where virtual coupling seems promising. One scenario is the virtual coupling at low speed, e. g. in the proximity of a station, where a safe brake is possible in case of a switch failure. The “Shinkansen” scenario aims to increase line capacity on the Tokaido high-speed line in Japan between Tokio and Osaka. The fastest “Nozomi” trains are stopping only at major stations. These stations have two tracks per direction with a 400 m platform. The idea is to double the number of Nozomi trains. So in every <b>stopping</b> <b>station,</b> there are two trains arriving and departing in a short interval. The distance on the open line is not that close, so it is more a ride within relative braking distance than a virtual coupling. To evaluate that scenario a special railway operation simulation has been developed, which is able to handle virtual coupling. The simulation shows the possibility to increase seating capacity from 15, 000 to 23, 000 seats per hour and direction. One bottleneck is occurring in Nagoya, where an additional platform is needed. Also the return time in Tokio has to be shortened to no more than 15 minutes...|$|E
