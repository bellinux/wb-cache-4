The route proposed by surveyors was to traverse {{an area in}} central Niagara County, New York, which was then [...] "uncivilized" [...] and free of White settlers. At the time, the nearest settlers were in nearby Cold Springs, New York. As it became known where the proposed canal was to be built, land speculators began to buy large plots along and near the proposed route of the canal.

The process repeats until all iCANdidates are assigned to an act. The last act is automatically assigned to the remaining iCANdidates who were not able to choose an act.|$|R
50|$|The canal {{as built}} had a locks at both ends, {{both of which}} dropped into the river. As it had no natural water supply, and water was lost every time a boat passed through a lock, a feeder was built from just above Paddington Lock on the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The water was then carried across the Mersey in an aqueduct, which also acted as a footbridge, and {{followed}} {{the banks of the}} Mersey to arrive at Latchford Lock. It emptied into the canal just to the south of the lock. When the Black Bear Canal section was created, Twenty <b>Steps</b> <b>Lock</b> also rose from the ship canal, and so the feature was retained. Latchford Lock was usually known as Manor Lock after the construction of the ship canal, as the locks immediately above its junction with the Black Bear Canal were called Latchford Locks.|$|R

50|$|The {{canal and}} the Mersey and Irwell Navigation were bought {{out by the}} Bridgewater Canal Company in 1844. The new owners {{invested}} little in the canal and its condition gradually grew worse. They in turn were bought out by the Manchester Ship Canal Company in the 1890s, who particularly wanted ownership of the Runcorn to Latchford Canal, as the ship canal would use the same course for part of its route. Much of {{the western end of}} the canal, including the docks at Runcorn, disappeared when the much larger ship canal was built. The eastern end fared rather better, as the section between Twenty Steps Bridge and Latchford Lock was retained. A new <b>lock,</b> called Twenty <b>Steps</b> <b>Lock,</b> was built where the old canal left the course of the ship canal, and it was used to supply tanneries at Howley with hides which were imported from Argentina, and this trade continued until the 1960s. This section was called the Black Bear Canal, and it ceased to be used after the tanneries closed.|$|R
5000|$|The R3000 {{and later}} {{microprocessors}} {{had only a}} typical amount of internal error checking, insufficient for Tandem's needs. So the Cyclone/R ran pairs of R3000 processors in <b>lock</b> <b>step,</b> running the same data thread. It used a curious variation of <b>lock</b> <b>stepping.</b> The checker processor ran 1 cycle behind the primary processor. This allowed them to share a single copy of external code and data caches without putting excessive pinout load on the sysbus and lowering the system clock rate. To successfully run microprocessors in <b>lock</b> <b>step,</b> the chips must be designed to be fully deterministic. Any hidden internal state must be cleared by the chip's reset mechanism. Otherwise, the matched chips will sometimes get out of sync for no visible reason and without any faults, long after the chips are restarted. All chip designers agree that these are good principles because it helps them test chips at manufacturing time. But all new microprocessor chips seemed to have bugs in this area, and required months of shared work between MIPS and Tandem to eliminate or work around the final subtle bugs.|$|R

40|$|The {{roles of}} fimB and fimE in the phase-variable {{expression}} of type 1 fimbriae in Escherichia coli were examined. A method {{was developed to}} {{study the effects of}} fimB and fimE on both recombination of the fim invertible element and fimbrial expression. The method used an allelic exchange procedure consisting of two steps. The first step, construction of intermediate strains, deleted fimB and fimE.

The second step of the exchange procedure introduced either wild-type or mutant alleles of fimB and/or fimE into the chromosome of the intermediate strains. Analysis of the resulting strains supported the current, plasmid-based model of recombination. Unexpectedly, strains in which the invertible element was locked in the on orientation (either by mutation of both fimB and fimE or, in a control strain, by mutation of the left inverted repeat sequence of the invertible element) continued to exhibit phase-variable expression of type 1 fimbriae. A strain in which fimA was transcribed from the tac promoter continued to exhibit phase-variable fimbrial expression, suggesting that inversion-independent phase variation cannot be explained by variable transcription initiation of fimA...|$|R

40|$|We numerically {{study the}} {{behavior}} of two-dimensional skyrmions {{in the presence of}} a quasi-one-dimensional sinusoidal substrate under the influence of externally applied dc and ac drives. In the overdamped limit, when both dc and ac drives are aligned in the longitudinal direction parallel to the direction of the substrate modulation, the velocity-force curves exhibit classic Shapiro step features when the frequency of the ac drive matches the washboard frequency that is dynamically generated by the motion of the skyrmions over the substrate, similar to previous observations in superconducting vortex systems. In the case of skyrmions, the additional contribution to the skyrmion motion from a non-dissipative Magnus force shifts the location of the <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> to higher dc drives, and we find that the skyrmions move at an angle with respect to the direction of the dc drive. For a longitudinal dc drive and a perpendicular or transverse ac drive, the overdamped system exhibits no Shapiro steps; however, when a finite Magnus force is present we find pronounced transverse Shapiro steps along with complex two-dimensional periodic orbits of the skyrmions in the phase-locked regimes. Both the longitudinal and transverse ac drives produce <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> whose widths oscillate with increasing ac drive amplitude. We examine the role of collective skyrmion interactions and find that additional fractional <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> occur for both longitudinal and transverse ac drives. At higher skyrmion densities, the system undergoes a series of dynamical order-disorder transitions, with the skyrmions forming a moving solid on the phase <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> and a fluctuating dynamical liquid in regimes between the steps.

40|$|Calcaneal {{osteotomy}} {{is often}} performed {{to correct the}} align-ment of the hindfoot and the weight-bearing axis of the lower limb. It is commonly undertaken {{in combination with other}} bony or soft tissue procedures in correction of a more global foot deformity. The operative approach, the position of the osteotomy, the direction of the shift, and the mode of fixation are all subject to considerable variation. Historically, fixation of a calcaneal osteotomy with a headed screw has been associated with high rates of compli-cations due to posterior heel pain from prominent screw heads, requiring secondary surgery for screw removal. In our unit, the method of fixation has changed over time and according to surgeon preference while the operative approach and the technique utilized have remained rela-tively unchanged, which provided a good opportunity to compare the outcome of calcaneal osteotomy with respect to fixation methods utilized. These included fixation using a headed screw, a headless conical screw, or a laterally applied <b>stepped</b> <b>locking</b> plate. We also present the medium-term results in 67 calcaneal osteotmies using our standard operative approach.

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} collective ordering and disordering {{effects for}} vortices in type-II superconductors interacting with square and triangular substrate arrays under a dc drive that is slowly rotated {{with respect to}} the fixed substrate. A series of directional locking transitions occur when the particle motion locks to symmetry directions of the substrate, producing a series of steps in the velocity-force curves. The locking transitions coincide with structural transitions between triangular, square, smectic, or disordered particle arrangements, which can be identified using the structure factor. We show that the widths of the <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> pass through local minima and maxima {{as a function of the}} ratio of the number of particles to the number of substrate minima. Unlike a static system, where matching effects occur for simple integer commensuration ratios, our system exhibits dynamical commensuration effects where an integer number of particle chains flow between one-dimensional lines of substrate minima. As the system enters and exits the <b>locking</b> <b>steps,</b> order-disorder transitions in the structure of the moving particle assembly occur. We identify two distinct symmetry locking regimes as a function of substrate strength which produce different <b>locking</b> <b>step</b> characteristics. For weak substrates, all the particles are in motion and a portion of the particles flow through the substrate minima, leading to structural transitions at certain driving angles. For strong substrates, some particles are permanently pinned while the remaining particles flow around them. At the crossover between these two regimes of substrate strength, the <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> are destroyed due to the onset of chaotic plastic flow which produces pronounced changes in the transport characteristics. Similar effects occur for colloidal particles driven over square and triangular substrate arrays. Comment: 28 pages, 23 postscript figure...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{transverse}} {{phase locking}} for vortex motion in a superconductor with a longitudinal DC drive and a transverse AC drive. For both square and triangular arrays we observe {{a variety of}} fractional phase <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> in the velocity versus DC drive which correspond to stable vortex orbits. The <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> are more pronounced for the triangular arrays {{which is due to}} the fact that the vortex motion has a periodic transverse velocity component even for zero transverse AC drive. All the steps increase monotonically in width with AC amplitude. We confirm that the width of some fractional steps in the square arrays scales as the square of the AC driving amplitude. In addition we demonstrate scaling in the velocity versus applied DC driving curves at depinning and on the main step, similar to that seen for phase locking in charge-density wave systems. The phase <b>locking</b> <b>steps</b> are most prominent for commensurate vortex fillings where the interstitial vortices form symmetrical ground states. For increasing temperature, the fractional steps are washed out very quickly, while the main step gains a linear component and disappears at melting. For triangular pinning arrays we again observe transverse phase locking, with the main and several of the fractional step widths scaling linearly with AC amplitude.
