5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake.

60|$|So Peter said good-by {{and kept}} on down the Laughing Brook to the Smiling Pool. Right where the Laughing Brook entered the Smiling Pool {{there was a little}} pebbly beach. Running along {{the very edge of the}} water was a slim, trim little bird with fairly long legs, a long slender bill, brownish-gray back with black spots and markings, and a white {{waistcoat}} neatly spotted with black. Every few steps he would stop to pick up something, then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way, as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw.

50|$|The Terek sandpiper {{likes to}} {{associate}} with ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), smallish calidrids, and Charadrius (but maybe not Pluvialis) plovers; a vagrant bird at Paraty (Rio de Janeiro state) was noted to pair up with a <b>spotted</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Actitis macularius). Thus {{it may be that}} the Terek sandpiper under natural conditions may mate with common sandpiper (A. hypoleucos), the Old World sister species of <b>spotted</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (A. macularius). As hybridisation in shorebirds is extremely commonplace and Actitis is among the closer relatives of the Terek sandpiper, such pairings (should they indeed occur) may produce hybrid offspring.|$|E

Females that fail to find additional mates usually help incubate and rear chicks. [...] "Prior to incubation, blood plasma concentrations of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are substantially higher in males than in females" [...] and these levels plummet 25-fold in males as incubation proceeds.

5000|$|Polyandry care {{occurs in}} roughly 9% of bird species (approximately 852 species). (Andrew Cockburn)The {{two forms of}} {{polyandry}} are sequential and simultaneous polyandry. Sequential polyandry refers to the mating strategy females use in certain situations. First, they will mate with one male and raise the offspring {{for a short period}} of time. Then they will mate with another male and care for that clutch resulting in more genetic diversity and quantity of the offspring per season. Females never incubate offspring alone unless the male has been killed. Some examples of birds who practice sequential polyandry include <b>spotted</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and red-necked phalaropes. Temminck's stint, little stint, mountain plover, and sanderling are very similar because the females lay a clutch of eggs and the males incubate them. A second clutch is laid that the female incubates herself.|$|R
