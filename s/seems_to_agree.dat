25|$|This {{vision of}} the Anglo-Saxons exercising {{extensive}} political and military power at an early date remains contested. The most developed vision of a continuation in sub-Roman Britain, with control over its own political and military destiny {{for well over a}} century, is that of Kenneth Dark, who suggests that the sub-Roman elite survived in culture, politics and military power up to c. 570. However, Nick Higham <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with Bede, who identified three phases of settlement: an exploration phase, when mercenaries came to protect the resident population; a migration phase, which was substantial as implied by the statement that Anglus was deserted; and an establishment phase, in which Anglo-Saxons started to control areas, implied in Bede's statement about the origins of the tribes.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides {{states that}} anyone who does not accept the seven laws is to be executed, as God {{compelled}} the world to follow these laws. However, for the other prohibitions such as the grafting of trees and bestiality he holds that the sons of Noah {{are not to be}} executed. Maimonides adds a universalism lacking from earlier Jewish sources. The Talmud differs from Maimonides in that it handles the seven laws as enforceable by Jewish authorities on non-Jews living within a Jewish nation. Nahmanides disagrees with Maimonides reasoning. He limits the obligation of enforcing the seven laws to non-Jewish authorities taking the matter out of Jewish hands. The Tosafot <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with Nahmanides reasoning. According to some opinions, punishment is the same whether the individual transgresses with knowledge of the law or is ignorant of the law.|$|E

2500|$|Parts of Mayow's work <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> {{with modern}} ideas {{regarding}} air and combustion. [...] Mayow noted, as had others before him, that some materials gain weight on strong heating. [...] Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) and others later interpreted this gain {{in terms of}} a reaction with a gaseous material (oxygen) in the air. [...] See Holmyard and others for critiques of Mayow's work and comparisons to modern chemical thought.|$|E
2500|$|... forbids {{transporting}} a minor (defined {{as under}} 18) in interstate or foreign commerce {{with the intent}} of engaging in criminal sexual acts in which a person can be charged. This subsection is ambiguous on its face and seems to apply only when the minor is transported across state or international lines to a place where the conduct is already illegal to begin with. The United States Department of Justice <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with this interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|But recently, {{there has}} been some debate about this matter. For example, Scott G. Brown (while {{defending}} the authenticity of Secret Mark) disagrees with Smith that the scene is a reference to baptism. Thus, he says, [...] "here is no mention of water or depiction of a baptism." [...] He adds that [...] "...the young man’s linen sheet has baptismal connotations, but the text discourages every attempt to perceive Jesus literally baptizing him." [...] S. Carlson <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with Brown. The idea that Jesus practiced baptism is absent from the synoptic gospels, though it is introduced in the Gospel of John.|$|E

2500|$|Weston won the {{starting}} quarterback position and led the Wolverines {{in the next six}} games, outscoring their opponents by a combined score of 234 to 3. After his first three starts, Weston faced a major test against a strong Nebraska team. In a profile of the Wolverines published the week before the game, The Lincoln Daily Star focused on Weston: [...] "Weston is continuing to improve at the quarterback. Work <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with him; he has put on three pounds of weight since he became famous two weeks ago, being no longer the lightest man on the squad." [...] Leading the Wolverines to a 20-0 win over Nebraska, his reputation continued to grow.|$|E
2500|$|... 1. 90 degrees east of Jerusalem. The {{concept of}} a halakhic date line is {{mentioned}} in the Baal HaMeor, a 12th-century Talmudic commentary, which {{seems to indicate that}} the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of Jerusalem (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through Australia, the Philippines, China and Russia). This line, which he refers to as the K'tzai Hamizrach (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashanah and Eruvin) and in the Jerusalem Talmud. [...] The Kuzari of Yehuda Halevi, also a 12th-century work, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with this ruling.|$|E
2500|$|Joel Coen <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree.</b> In an {{interview}} with David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that [...] "overall [...] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by Fargo (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' He shakes his head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'" [...] In addition, Ethan Coen states that [...] "we're not conscious of it, [...] {{to the extent that}} we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to Fargo did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only thing that comes to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [...] it is by accident." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biographers {{have looked}} for {{consistency}} from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; Lockwood, {{who knew him}} as his mother's partner; David [...] "Honeyboy" [...] Edwards, whose cousin Willie Mae Powell {{had a relationship with}} Johnson. From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts, biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character. [...] "He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable". [...] "As for his character, everyone <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way". [...] "Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to comics {{historian}} Les Daniels, [...] "nearly everyone <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that Two-Face was Kane's brainchild exclusively". [...] Catwoman, originally {{introduced by}} Kane with no costume as [...] "the Cat", was partially {{inspired by his}} cousin, Ruth Steel. Kane, a frequent movie goer, mentioned that Jean Harlow was {{a model for the}} design and added that [...] "I always felt that women were feline". [...] Kane created the Scarecrow and drew his first appearance, which was scripted by Finger. [...] Kane also created the original incarnation of Clayface. [...] According to Kane, he drew the Penguin after being inspired by the then advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes — a penguin with a top hat and cane. Finger, however, claimed that he created the villain as a caricature of the aristocratic type, because [...] "stuffy English gentlemen" [...] reminded him of emperor penguins.|$|E
2500|$|Camille Paglia {{states that}} {{there is nothing in the}} poem that would provide a clue as to whether the poem is {{directed}} towards a man or a woman, but assumes, as many do, that Sonnet 29 was written about the young man. Both Paglia and Frank agree that the first octave is about the Speaker's current depression caused by his social ostracism in his [...] "outcast state" [...] (line 2) and personal misfortune that has [...] "curse my fate" [...] (line 4). The Speaker proclaims his jealousy of those that are [...] "rich in hope" [...] (line 5) and [...] "with friends possess'd" [...] (line 6), once again referring to his hopelessness and low social status. Paglia refers to this section of the poem as a [...] "list of half-imaginary grievances." [...] Frank <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with her statement of [...] "half imaginary" [...] since he believes the Speaker wills his own misery.|$|E

2500|$|National [...] Treasure no. 83, exhibiting stylistic {{influence}} from Northern Qi, for a [...] time, {{was believed to}} be from Baekje. [...] However, recent research [...] strongly suggests, based on numerous pieces of evidence, suggests that [...] the statue was produced in Silla and scholarly consensus <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> [...] on that point. [...] A similar stone pensive statue found in Silla territory [...] and a head with a similar crown excavated at Hwangnyongsa indicates an [...] origin in Silla. [...] National Treasure no. 83 is also important because it [...] illustrates the close connection between Korea and Japan during this [...] period. [...] Koryu-ji's [...] almost identical Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva) (...) , [...] a national treasure of Japan, is now believed to be of Silla [...] manufacture because of the use of red pine, a wood used for Korean [...] sculpture, ancient Japanese records, and the use of Korean carving [...] techniques.|$|E
