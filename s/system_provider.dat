2500|$|Israel has {{provided}} China with military assistance, expertise and technology. According {{to a report}} from the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, [...] "Israel ranks second only to Russia as a weapons <b>system</b> <b>provider</b> to China and as a conduit for sophisticated cutting edge military technology, followed by France and Germany." [...] Israel was ready to sell China the Phalcon, an Israeli airborne early-warning radar system (AWACS), until the United States forced it to cancel the deal. Some estimate that Israel sold arms worth US$4 billion to China in this period. China has looked to Israel for the arms and military technology it cannot acquire from the United States and Russia. [...] Israel is now China's second-largest foreign supplier of arms after Russia with China has purchased a wide array of military equipment and technology, including communications satellites. China is a vital market for Israel's aerospace and defense industry. Due to Israel's recognition of China, Israel has also limited its cooperation with Taiwan in order to foster closer ties with Mainland China.|$|E

30|$|Some {{regression}} models omitted the <b>system</b> <b>providers</b> from the data, {{and we find}} that international ownership in particular boosted subcontractors’ export rate. This is also a novel contribution, and the observed effect is probably {{a result of a}} decrease in subcontractors’ market dependency on regional <b>system</b> <b>providers</b> when they have international ownership. International ownership thus appears to boost the export rate for subcontractors in particular, most likely as a function of access to international distribution channels and branding effects through international ownership. Innovative subcontractors also tended to have an export orientation, but this effect was not found to be particularly strong for this group of firms (compared with <b>system</b> <b>providers).</b>|$|R
