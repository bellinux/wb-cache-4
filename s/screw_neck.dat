Early surgical intervention allows for early mobilization and rehabilitation, thus reducing complications, morbidity and mortality, and improving overall outcomes [14]. A variety of fixation {{methods have been}} recommended to date; these include multiple flexible Ender nails with supplementary pinning, varying combinations of retrograde nailing or plate fixation for femoral shaft and dynamic hip screw or cannulated screw fixation for neck fractures, antegrade interlocking nailing with <b>screw</b> <b>neck</b> fixation and second-generation reconstruction (cephalomedullary) interlocking nailing.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess, by the {{three-dimensional}} finite element method, the influence of crown-to-implant ratio and parafunctional occlusal loading on stress distribution in single external hexagon implant-supported prosthesis. Computer-aided design software was used to confection three models. Each model was composed of a block bone and an external hexagon implant (5 x 10. 0 mm) with screw-retained implant prostheses, varying the height crown: 10, 12. 5 and 15 mm. Finite element analysis software was used to generate the finite element mesh and to establish the loading and boundary conditions. Normal (200 N axial and 100 N oblique load) and parafunctional forces (1, 000 N axial and 500 N oblique load) were applied. The results were visualized by von Mises and maximum principal stress. In comparison with the normal occlusal force, the parafunctional occlusal force induced an increase in stress concentration and magnitude on implant (platform and first threads) and <b>screw</b> (<b>neck).</b> The cortical bone showed the highest tensile stress under parafunctional force (oblique load). The stress concentration increased as the crown height increased. It was concluded that: increasing the C/I increased stress concentration in both implant components and cortical bone; parafunctional loading increased between 4 - 5 times the value of stresses in bone tissue compared with functional loading; the type of loading variation factor is more influential than the crown-to-implant factor...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze, through the 3 D finite element method, the influence of parafunctional occlusal loading, the crown/implant ratio and the prosthetic connection (external hexagon, internal hexagon and morsetaper) on stress distribution in implant-supported single prostheses. Five 3 D models were created with the aid of a 3 D scanner MDX- 20 and the graphical modeling softwares: Rhinoceros 3 D 4. 0 (NURBS Modeling for Windows, USA) and SolidWorks 2010 (SolidWorks Corp., Massachusetts, USA). Each model was composed of a bone block from the mandibular molar region, a dental implant (Conexão Sistema de Prótese Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil) and a metal-ceramic crown with different heights: 10, 12. 5 and 15 mm. The 3 D models were exported to the finite element software FEMAP 10. 1 (Noran Engineering, Inc., USA) to have the boundary conditions established and the finite element meshes generated. A functional load (200 N axial and 100 N oblique) and a parafunctional load (1000 N axial and 500 N oblique) were applied on the occlusal surface of the crowns. The axial load was divided in four points located in the internal slope of the cusps, while the oblique load was divided into two spots, which were located in the internal slopes of the lingual cusps.

40|$|BACKGROUND.   Extra-articular {{fractures}} of {{the proximal}} femur are severe lower extremity trauma, most patients are of elderly and senile age, {{what makes the}} problem of surgical management actual. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We made a retrospective analysis of surgical treatment in 91 patients treated in 2010 – 2013. Entry criteria were: age over 65 years, application of a standard proximal femoral fixator (PFF) and PFF with modified <b>neck</b> <b>screw,</b> postoperative monitoring period up to 36 months. The overall performance was assessed depending on the fracture type in accordance with AO/ASIF classification (A 1, A 2, and A 3). To assess {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed PFF with modified <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> we formed the study group (n= 28) and the comparison group (n= 63). The PFF with modified <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> was applied in the study group. The standard PFF was applied (“Osteosynthesis”, Rybinsk) in the control group. The x-ray, clinical and statistical methods of research were used. To assess the functional status and quality of life, harris hip score was applied. RESULTS.   In overall performance, excellent results occurred in 35. 3 % 12 months postoperatively, good — 29. 7 %, satisfactory — 26 %, unsatisfactory — 8. 8 %. In patients with A 1 type fractures, excellent and good results (77. 7 %) were higher in total than the corresponding figures in patients with A 2 (51. 3 %) and A 3 (75. 0 %) type fractures. Unsatisfactory results more frequently occurred in patients with A 2 type fractures (p= 0. 038). Twelve months after the surgery excellent and good results in the study group (75. 0 %) exceeded the similar data in the comparison group (46. 0 %) by 1. 63 times (p= 0. 039). Unsatisfactory results were observed 3. 08 times more often in patients of the comparison group (3. 6 % and 11. 1 %, respectively), p= 0. 041. CONCLUSION.

30|$|The use {{of one or}} two femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screws</b> for the {{stabilization}} of femoral neck fractures during reconstruction nailing is debated also. In a prospective comparative study, Vidyathara and Rao [20] found that patients treated with a cephalomedullary nail with two, rather than one, femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screws</b> showed slightly, yet not significantly, better results in terms of functional scores, neck fracture displacement and complication rates. In a recent biomechanical study, Wu and Tai [24] found that supplementary {{stabilization of}} the femoral neck fracture with one cannulated screw in front of the reconstruction nail offered better results in terms of load bearing and fracture displacement. In a review of complicated cases, Watson and Moed [21] stressed the poor sliding characteristics of the proximal interlocking screws in second-generation reconstruction nails were accountable for, in their opinion, the varus neck non-unions that occurred in their series. They also suggested that supplementary use of cancellous screws in the femoral neck does not improve neck fracture fixation significantly. Although most of our patients had a single proximal screw, no cases of displacement or malalignment of the neck fracture were met. We conclude that, provided optimal reduction and adequate compression are achieved intra-operatively, a single proximal screw may suffice for the fixation of the neck fracture.|$|R
40|$|Infection {{of the hip}} after implant {{fixation}} is {{an uncommon}} yet devastating complication that results in poor long-term outcome. The gold standard treatment for chronic infection after hip arthroplasty is a two-stage protocol: eradication of infection, follow by re-implantation arthroplasty. The use of interim antibiotic-laden cement spacer has become a popular procedure to maintain hip joint function and provide antibiotic elution simultaneously before re-implantation. However, antibiotic cement spacer is mechanically weak and breaks if overloaded. Therefore, we designed a cement mould with metallic endoskeleton {{with the aim of}} creating a stronger, inexpensive, antibiotic-impregnated spacer resembling a unipolar arthroplasty. We report two cases of severe hip joint infection after implant fixation (bipolar hemiarthroplasty, <b>screw</b> fixation <b>neck</b> of femur). Both patients had undergone first stage surgery of debridement and articulating antibiotic cement insertion using our design. Although the second stage surgery was planned for these patients, both patients delayed the operation in view of good functional status after a year walking with the antibiotic cement spacer.

Epidural screws (frontooccipital) and depth electrodes (amygdala and hippocampus) were implanted bilaterally for EEG recording.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe best {{surgical}} {{strategy for}} extra-capsular proximal femoral fractures (PFFs) is controversial in the elderly. Poor bone quality and <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> instability can adversely affect the results with currently available fixation devices, which predominantly consist in dynamic hip screw-plates and proximal reconstruction nails. HypothesisThe helical blade of the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFN-A™) achieves better cancellous bone compaction in the femoral neck, thereby decreasing {{the risk of}} secondary displacement. Materials and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases of PFN-A™ fixation performed between 2006 and 2008 in 102 patients (75 females and 27 males) {{with a mean age}} of 84. 9 ± 9. 5 years (range, 70 – 100 years). Functional outcomes were assessed using the Parker Mobility Score. ResultsMean follow-up in the 102 patients was 21. 3 ± 17. 5 months (4 – 51 months). Fracture distribution in the AO classification scheme was A 1, n= 45; A 2, n= 41; and A 3, n= 16. At last follow-up, Parker Mobility Score values in the 65 survivors were 0 – 3, n= 35; 4 – 6, n= 11; and 7 – 9, n= 19. Fracture union was consistently achieved, after a mean of 10. 3 ± 3 weeks. Blade back-out allowed by the device design occurred in 16 (15. 7 %) patients but caused pain due to screw impingement on the fascia lata in only five patients (of whom two underwent reoperation). Cephalic blade cut-out was noted in three (2. 9 %) patients, of whom one required reoperation because of acetabular penetration. Two hardware-related fractures were recorded. DiscussionThe new PFN-A™ device ensures reliable fixation with low mechanical complication rates. Although our data do not constitute proof that a helical blade is superior over a <b>neck</b> <b>screw,</b> they suggest a decreased rate of construct failure and may serve as a basis for a comparative study.

40|$|Key words: {{fracture}} {{of the neck}} of the femur, fixation with screws, canulated screw, duplex screw In our country the most prevalent procedure to treat displaced fractured neck of the femur is the method of double canulated femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> developed by Professor Jenő Manninger and coworkers. The aim while elaborating this method was to synthesize displaced fractured neck of the femur and to ensure the highest possible stability with the minimal operative strain. An essential condition of successful recovery is the enhancement of the stability of the fixation of fractures. However, at old age the layer of spongiosa becomes so porous that the threads of screws used for the treatment of the {{fracture of}} {{the neck of the}} femur virtually fulfil their fixing function only in the subchondral region – less and less in the inner layer of the spongiosa. But, in the subchondral region, the outer layer of 4 to 5 mm remains relatively dense. To increase stability, we modified the traditionally – shaped canulated screws, used for the neck of the femur to date, and developed duplex-threaded <b>screws</b> for the <b>neck</b> of the femur. One of the basic criteria {{of the success of the}} operation is the positioning of the screws related to anatomical landmarks and to each other. We examined both traditional and duplex screws with altered thread profile in several conditions applying finite element calculations. Normal pull-out force was applied in order to compare the results in case of both traditional and duplex screws. It showed that the duplex screw increase the pull-out force by 65 % compared to the traditional screws. In case of 5 ° positioning error we found that the power needed for pulling the screw out was decreased by at least 10 - 17 %, depending on the direction of the positioning error but it was less (6 - 9 %) in case of duplex screws. The loading capacity of the models with spongiosa bone matter differs from that of the subchondral bone layer models by at least 12 - 20 % depending, on the shape of the screw and the material law. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Reduction and osteosynthesis with {{cannulated}} <b>screws</b> in femoral <b>neck</b> fracture {{is a valid}} therapeutic option. Our {{objective is}} to identify prognostic factors and risk groups. Methods: We studied retrospectively 93 femoral neck fractures treated with internal fixation with cannulated screw between June 1995 and March 2011 (71 non-displaced and 22 displaced). Results: In 82 of the 93 cases we observed bone consolidation of the fracture. Eleven patients presented complications (5 non-union and 6 avascular necrosis). Consolidation rates were 95. 8 % and 63. 6 % in the non-displaced group and the displaced group of fractures. If the displaced fractures presented conminution, consolidation rate was 50 % and 71. 4 % in the group without conminution. The consolidation index was 46. 1 % with closed reduction and 88 % with open reduction.

RESULTS: Less invasive surgical stabilization of pertrochanteric fractures with the PCCP resulted in shorter theater and surgical time and reduced postoperative pain. The PCCP treatment showed a tendency toward a lower transfusion need and a reduction of fracture impaction; however, results were not statistically significant.

40|$|Fractured neck {{of femur}} {{is a common}} problem seen in elderly {{osteoporotic}} females, mostly in Western countries, among which are the extra-capsular fractures such as intertrochanteric and pertrochanteric fractures also known as peritrochanteric fractures, and commonly treated with dynamic hip screw (DHS) or compression hip screw (CHS). The DHS is based on tension band principle and allows the screw to slide within the barrel to enable compression of the fracture when the patient begins to bear weight. This principle only works {{in the presence of}} intact medial wall and so cannot be successful in a reverse oblique fracture of the proximal femur. However, {{it is important that the}} technique of screw placement is precise and should ideally be central in the femoral neck, on both AP and lateral radiographs. This is why the concept of tip apex distance (TAD) is critical to the outcome of fixation and can accurately predict failure or survival of the screw. A systematic review of articles published in PubMed/Medline, from 1991 to 2011 (twenty years), was carried out to critically analyse common practice with regards to DHS fixation of extra-capsular femoral neck fractures, and review the recommendations of previous authors, with regard to the effect of TAD in DHS fixation. Search words used include TAD, DHS, sliding hip <b>screw,</b> femoral <b>neck</b> fractures, peritrochanteric fractures, tension band principle, fracture collapse, screw cut-out, DHS failure, and failure of fixation. At the end of the review, recommendations and suggestions regarding the ideal techniques of placement of DHS screw into the femoral neck will be made in line with current published literature, in order to establish an evidence base for best practice. A total of forty eight (48) published articles were found relevant to the review topic. Most papers suggested that Tip Apex Distance (TAD) is the most important predictive factor for DHS failure, followed by lag screw position, fracture pattern and reduction, patient′s age and presence of osteoporosis.

Methods: A controlled talar neck fracture was produced in 24 sawbone tali. The fractures were stabilized with CH screws in 12 tali and with 4. 0 C screws in 12 tali. A Mechanical Testing System machine was used to apply a dorsally-directed shear force to the talar head with the talus body fixed to simulate walking and the clinical mode of failure of talar neck fracture fixation. Stiffness of the fixation devices was calculated for each specimen and the groups statistically compared. The results were confirmed in 10 cadaveric bone specimen.

The applied numerical model consisted of three sub-models: 3 D model from solid elements, 3 D cross section of the contact between the plate and the bone and the part of 3 D cross section of the screw head and body. We have reached the conclusion that modified osteosynthesis with bone cement resulted in weaker strain in the part of the plate above the fracture fissure, more even strain on the screws, plate and bone, more even strain distribution along all the screws’ bodies, significantly greater strain in the part of the screw head opposite to the fracture fissure, firm connection of the <b>screw</b> head and <b>neck</b> and the plate hole with the whole plate and more even bone strain around the screw...|$|R
40|$|Hip {{fractures}} {{are mainly}} {{problems of the}} elderly population. The incidence in the Czech Republic {{is one of the}} highest in the world. They include a pertrochanteric fracture. One possibility of its therapy is intramedullary nailing. The advantages of the nailing is allowing a sliding effect of the proximal fragment which leads to better contact between fragments. Surgical procedure has its own risks and complications. We decided to evaluate a group of patients with pertrochanteric fractures treated in 2009 - 2011 with the PFN Medin. We analyzed the sliding effect and factors which can influence it and complications. The study cohort covers 304 patients. We found out that the sliding effect was in 195 cases (67. 1 %). The type of the fracture did not affect the sliding. There was no significant difference depending on the length or screw placement in the proximal fragment. We found following complications: 3 medial displacement (0. 9 %), 6 varus collapses (1. 9 %), 4 necroses of the head of the femur (1. 3 %), 13 cases of the femoral neck resorption (4. 3 %), 10 fractures around the nail (3. 2 %), 4 Z- effects (1. 3 %) and 3 "cut-out" phenomena (1. 0 %).

30|$|Ipsilateral femoral {{neck and}} shaft {{fractures}} occur in 2.5 – 9 % of femur fractures [6, 12, 14]. Most are encountered in high-energy trauma [5, 6, 14]. Victims are usually young, with multiple associated injuries [12, 14]. The {{diagnosis of the}} neck fracture is delayed in 19 – 31 % of patients [14]. The treatment of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures is difficult, {{and there are many}} protocols for the management of these fractures. Treatment options include: (1) antegrade femoral nailing of the shaft with cancellous screws placed anterior to the nail for fixation of the neck [1, 14]; (2) reconstruction-type intramedullary nailing [6, 10]; (3) various plate combinations [including a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and long side plate configuration, a hip screw with a short side plate for the neck and separate plate for the shaft, or cancellous <b>screws</b> for femoral <b>neck</b> and a plate for the shaft] [5, 14]; (4) retrograde intramedullary nailing of the shaft and screw fixation of the neck [8]. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. No consensus exists regarding the optimal treatment of these complex fractures [5]. The three major issues related to these fractures are optimal timing of surgery, which fracture to stabilize first, and the optimal implant to use [6]. This retrospective study reports our experience of managing 27 patients with ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures using two different treatment methods, i.e., reconstruction-type intramedullary nailing and various plate combinations, in order to address these three key issues.|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{management}} of the fractures was performed after initial assessment and resuscitation. The patients were placed supine on a fracture table. Closed reduction was achieved in all cases under traction with slight abduction and internal rotation. In cases of open fractures, wound debridement and closure preceded the femoral shaft nailing. The reconstruction nail was inserted after reduction of the shaft fracture. Careful X-ray monitoring during reaming and nail insertion was carried out to prevent displacement of the neck fracture. Bone grafting was not performed even in cases of severe comminution. Following the insertion of the nail, accurate reduction of the femoral neck fracture was checked for again prior to proximal screw insertion. In all but two cases, a single proximal 10.5 -mm interlocking screw at 125 ° insertion angle (Long Gamma nail, Stryker) {{was used for the}} fixation of the neck fracture. In the remaining two patients, a Russel-Taylor Delta reconstruction nail (Smith & Nephew Richards Inc. Memphis, Tennessee USA) with two proximal screws was inserted. An attempt was made to place the <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> in the centre of the femoral head in both frontal and lateral views. The femoral neck fracture was provisionally stabilized with Steinmann pins to prevent displacement or rotational malalignment of during drilling. Distal locking was performed with either one or two screws. Fluoroscopy was routinely used to confirm correct placement of proximal and distal locking screws in orthogonal views. Concomitant fractures were addressed; a pelvic external fixator was applied for the patient with the ischiopubic fracture and internal fixation performed for the ulna and patella fractures.|$|R
40|$|Injuries of {{the bone}} {{anterior}} edge of the glenoid cavity of scapula is noted in 90 % of patients with recurrent shoulder instability {{and it is the}} cause of recurrent dislocation in 67 % of cases. The authors have presented a description of techniques and benefits of arthroscopic autoplasty (autografting) of scapula glenoid. A total of 10 operations were performed in 9 men and 1 woman. The average age of operated patients was 27, 1 ± 4, 7 years. All patients were injured during contact sports. In the preoperative and immediate postoperative period computer tomography of damaged shoulder was performed in all patients with reconstruction in 3 D images. The size {{of the bone}} defect was evaluated by 3 D scans and averaged 29. 7 %. During the first stage free bicortical grafts with varying sizes from the wing of the ilium were harvested. Preartroscopic stage permits to avoid swelling of paraarticular structures during arthroscopy and allows to correct positioning and fixation autografts in the joint. The arthroscopic signs of defect and the technique of immersing of previously prepared free fragment through a wide 10 mm cannula and subsequent minimally invasive fixation with cannulated <b>screws</b> in scapula <b>neck</b> were described. This operation is an alternative to the transposition of coracoid process, does not require special tools and a long operating time (average 60 - 80 min), excludes injuries of brachial plexus branches and surgical trauma of subscapularis muscle, does not disturb the normal anatomy of the shoulder joint. There were no neurological complications, recurrences of instability in the immediate postoperative period...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Biomechanically {{proximal}} femoral nail (PFN) is {{a better}} choice of implant, still it is associated with screw breakage, cut out of screw through femoral head, Z effect, reverse Z effect, and lateral migration of screws. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the results of augmented PFN in terms of prevention of postoperative complications and failure rates in unstable trochanteric fractures. 				 					Material and methods: We carried out a prospective study of 82 cases with unstable trochanteric femoral fractures from April 2010 to December 2015. Forty-two females and 40 males in the age group between 58 and 81 years were included in this study. There were 45 cases of AO 31 A 2 (2. 2, 2. 3) and 37 cases of AO 31 A 3 (3. 1, 3. 2, 3. 3). Fractures were fixed by PFN with augmentation by an additional screw from trochanter to inferior quadrant of femoral head or cerclage wire to strengthen the lateral trochanteric wall. 				 					Results: The bone healing is observed in all the cases in the mean period of 14. 2 weeks. Nine patients developed complications, including lateral migration of <b>neck</b> <b>screws</b> (n =  5), Z effect (n =  1), infection (n =  2), and breakage of distal interlocking bolt in one case. Removal of screws was required in five cases. Patients were followed up for a mean of 8. 4 months. At the end of follow-up the Salvati and Wilson hip function was 32 (out of 40) in 88 % of patients. 				 					Conclusion: The stabilization of lateral trochanteric wall with additional screw or cerclage wire increases the stability of construct...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: To {{the best}} of our {{knowledge}} there is no other report of an elderly patient who was surgically treated for a patellar fracture with tension band wiring and who subsequently suffered from an avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity. The combination of a patellar fracture and avulsion of the patellar ligament has only been described as complication after bone-patellar tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. However, due to demographic changes and more elderly patients treated this injury may become more frequent in future. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of an 81 year old female who sustained an oblique patellar fracture after a direct contact injury of the left knee when falling on ice. Consequently the patellar fracture was openly reduced and stabilized with tension band wiring. The follow-up was uneventful till three months after surgery when the patient noticed a spontaneous avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity (Ogden type 3). The tibial tuberosity fragment was reattached with two non-resorbable sutures looped around two modified AO cortical 3. 5 mm long <b>neck</b> <b>screws.</b> Intraoperatively multiple bone cysts were seen. Biopsies were not taken to prevent further fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. The patient was followed up with anteroposterior and lateral full weight bearing radiographs and clinical assessment at 6, 12 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Recovery was completely pain free with full satisfaction. CONCLUSION: In conclusion in elderly patients with a patella fracture a possible associated but not obvious fracture of the tibial tuberosity should be ruled out and the postoperative rehabilitation protocol after tension band wiring of the patella might have to be individually adjusted to bone quality and course of the fracture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: No {{consensus}} exists {{regarding the}} optimal treatment of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures. We report {{our experience of}} managing 13 patients with ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures by using either cannulated screws or dynamic hip <b>screws</b> for the <b>neck</b> and retrograde femoral nail for the shaft. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the function; outcome and healing of that complicated fractures. Material and methods: A consent was taken from thirteen patients who sustained ipsilateral femoral shaft and neck fractures from January 2007 and March 2011 in El Minoufiya University Hospital in Egypt. 10 patients with fracture neck femur had been treated with cannulated screws while 3 patients were treated by dynamic hip screw. all fractures shaft had been treated with retrograde femoral nail [...] The mean follow up period was 18 months with range from 12 - 36 months. Results: There were 10 males and 3 females. The average age was 31 years old with range of 19 - 45 years. The mean follow up period was 18 months with range from 12 - 36 months. The average healing period of femoral neck fracture was 14 weeks and all femoral neck fractures united. Average union time for femoral shaft fractures was 19 weeks (range, 16 – 36 weeks). Three femoral shaft fractures needed bone graft at six months. Conclusions: The treatment methods used in the present study achieved satisfactory functional outcome in these complex fractures. The femoral neck fracture should preferably be stabilized first. [Mohamed E. Habib, Yasser S. Hannout and Ahmed F. Shams. Treatment of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaf...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intramedullary {{devices have}} {{increasingly}} become popular and {{are widely used}} for fixation of unstable intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures as well. These implants have been designed taking into consideration the anthropometry of the western population whose anthropometry varies from those of other ethnic groups. This study was carried out to assess the geometry of proximal femur for the placement of short cephalomedullary nails in our subset of patients and suggest suitable design modifications based on these parameters. Materials and Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} the following three groups: (1) Anthropometric study of 101 adult human dry femora, (2) radiographs of the same femora, and (3) radiographs of the contralateral uninjured limb of 102 patients with intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures. In Group 1, standard anthropometric techniques were used to measure neck shaft angle (NSA), minimal neck width (NW), trochanteric offset, and distance from the tip of greater trochanter (GT) to the lower border of lesser trochanter on the femoral shaft axis (distance X). In Group 2 and 3, the NSA, minimal NW, NW at 130 ° and 135 °, trochanteric shaft angle (TSA), trochanteric offset, distance X, distance between the tip of GT and the point where the neck axis crosses the line joining the tip of the GT to the lower border of the lesser trochanter on the femoral shaft axis (distance Y), and canal width at 10, 15, and 20 cm from tip of GT were measured on standard radiographs. The values obtained in these three groups were pooled to obtain mean values. Various parameters of commonly used short cephalomedullary nails available for fixation of pertrochanteric fractures were obtained. These were compared to the results obtained to suggest suitable modifications in the nail designs for our subset of patients. Results: The mean parameters observed were as follows: NSA 128. 07 ° ± 4. 97 (range 107 °– 141 °), minimum NW 29. 0 ± 2. 8 mm (range 22 – 42 mm), NW at 130 ° 30. 12 ± 2. 86 mm (range 22. 2 – 42. 5 mm), NW at 135 ° 30. 66 ± 3. 02 mm (range 22. 8 – 40. 3 mm), TSA 10. 45 ° ± 2. 34 ° (range 3 °– 15. 5 °), distance × 65. 73 ± 6. 45 mm (range 28. 6 – 88. 4 mm), distance Y 38 ± 4. 91 mm (range 16. 6 – 55. 3 mm), and canal width at 10, 15, and 20 cm from the tip of GT 13. 46 ± 2. 34 mm, 11. 40 ± 2. 27 mm, and 11. 64 ± 2. 04 mm, respectively. Conclusion: The measurements of the proximal femur are not significantly different from other ethnic groups and are adequate to accept the current commonly available short cephalomedullary nails. However, certain modifications in the presently available short cephalomedullary nail designs are recommended for them to better fit the anatomy of our subset of population (a) two nails of 125 ° and 135 °, (b) the medio-lateral angle at the level of 65 mm from the tip of the nail, (c) two femoral <b>neck</b> <b>screw</b> placements (35 and 45 mm from the tip of the nail), and (d) five different sizes of distal width for better fit in canal (9 – 13 mm) ...|$|R
5000|$|Features: - {{the round}} Yamaha logo on the {{headstock}} {{is not a}} decal, it's a die cast metal piece with chrome tuning forks (the Yamaha logo) raised above a black background. You can turn it with your fingers on my guitar but it doesn't come off - you can also see in the picture that the Yamaha brand name appears on the neck plate. This is also chrome and black but is a stamping not a casting. And this isn't actually a neck plate because it doesn't hold the neck on. If you remove the four screws this plate comes off, you will then see the actual neck plate which has four larger <b>screws</b> holding the <b>neck</b> on. The neck plate has a rectangular [...] "window" [...] in it {{to allow you to}} access the truss rod through a hole through the body {{into the back of the}} neck (that's right, the truss is accessed through the back of the neck). - All three pickups are identical. They have adjustable pole piece screws. The black and silver areas that you see are actually the tops of the pickup bobbins themselves. The black and silver areas are covered by a domed clear plastic piece. I took the guitar apart a few years ago to give it a good cleaning. I found that the pickups are not held in place with springs at the height adjustment screws like normal pickups, but instead had a large foam rubber block under the body of each pickup. The fretboard is quite thin. Thin enough that the side dots are actually located on the split line between the fretboard material and the wood of the neck. The guitar's serial number is stamped directly into the fretboard between two of the lower frets. - Yamaha was obviously proud of this guitar, and put their name and logo all over it. Besides the Yamaha name on the tuning machines, it has the Yamaha decal and die cast logo on the headstock, the name and logo on the neck plate and the name and logo are molded into the bridge pickup ring between the two bridge pickups. - The SG2 and SG3 were Yamaha's first electric guitar models, and finish details (as described above) are amazing for a 1965 Japanese guitar. If I lay it down next to my Strat, the Strat looks like a bargain basement model by comparison. Later 1960s models in Yamaha's SG series have far cruder appointments. - As was already noted, the bridge has roller saddles and each saddle is height adjustable. The bridge also has the normal coarse height adjustment screws on each end. There are two sheet metal springs on the ends of the bridge pinching the saddles together so they don't move side-to-side. - The guitar shown here has either a metal or black plastic nut, mine is white plastic. There is, of course, a zero fret. - The string tree is also a good quality chrome plated die casting, not a metal stamping like many guitars of the period. - The main knobs are chrome-plated metal with plastic skirts. As for the roller controls, the mysterious 3rd thumbwheel nearest to the bridge pickup is a balance control for the two bridge pickups. This functions whether the slide switch is in the up or down position. - The remaining two thumbwheels are just like their Fender counterparts; they're a volume control and a tone control that override the main volume and tone controls when the slide switch is in the up position. [...] Supposedly most of them were sold in Japan, and only a few were exported to the US.|$|R
