5|$|Apart {{from some}} minor medical applications, the first {{commercial}} use was the daguerreotype. In 1840, bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> layer in daguerreotypy.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} {{rates and}} mechanisms {{are affected by}} a variety of factors including the strength of the surface-adparticle bond, orientation of the surface lattice, attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients. It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> salts used in photographic film.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
50|$|As a group, {{they are}} often {{referred}} to as the <b>silver</b> <b>halides,</b> and are often given the pseudo-chemical notation AgX. Although most <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> involve <b>silver</b> atoms with oxidation states of +1 (Ag+), <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> in which the silver atoms have oxidation states of +2 (Ag2+) are known, of which silver(II) fluoride is the only known stable one.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>halides</b> {{are used}} in {{photographic}} films and papers. When the film is developed, the <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> which {{have been exposed to}} light are reduced to metallic silver, forming an image.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to manufacture of silver bromide, potassium bromide {{is used as}} a restrainer in black and white developer formulas. It improves differentiation between exposed and unexposed crystals of <b>silver</b> <b>halide,</b> and thus reduces fog.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Kodak {{introduced}} the T-Grain emulsion, a technological advancement {{in the shape}} and make-up of <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater light sensitivity with a relatively small grain and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall graininess to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks. This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Although {{photographic}} processes {{have been}} in development since the mid-1800s, there were no suitable theoretical explanations until 1938 {{with the publication of}} a paper by R.W. Gurney and N.F. Mott. This paper triggered a large amount of research in fields of solid-state chemistry and physics, as well more specifically in <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> photosensitivity phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{preparation}} of a simple, light-sensitive surface involves forming an emulsion of <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> crystals in a gelatine, {{which is then}} coated onto a film or other support. The crystals are formed by precipitation in a controlled environment to produce small, uniform crystals (typically < 1 μm in diameter and containing ~1012 Ag atoms) called grains.|$|E
25|$|Silver nitrate is {{the least}} {{expensive}} salt of silver; it offers several other advantages as well. It is non-hygroscopic, in contrast to silver fluoroborate and silver perchlorate. It is relatively stable to light. Finally, it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other ligands, rendering AgNO3 versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making photographic film, silver nitrate is treated with halide salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> in situ in photographic gelatin, which is then applied to strips of tri-acetate or polyester. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some silver-based explosives, such as the fulminate, azide, or acetylide, through a precipitation reaction.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} <b>silver</b> <b>halides,</b> AgF is highly {{soluble in water}} (1800 g/L), and it even has some {{solubility}} in acetonitrile. It is also unique among silver(I) compounds and the <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> in that it forms the hydrates AgF.(H2O)2 and AgF.(H2O)4 on precipitation from aqueous solution. Like the alkali metal fluorides, it dissolves in hydrogen fluoride to give a conducting solution.|$|R

500|$|In stark {{contrast}} to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic zinc blende structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X−Ag+ → XAg) decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small {{that it has a}} considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods. All four are photosensitive (though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography. The reaction involved is: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>halides</b> {{are also}} used to make {{corrective}} lenses darken when exposed to ultraviolet light (see photochromism).|$|R
5000|$|The fogged <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> are {{developed}} and oxidized developing agents couple with the dye couplers in each layer.|$|R
25|$|Silver bromide (AgBr), a soft, pale-yellow, water-insoluble salt {{well known}} (along with other <b>silver</b> <b>halides)</b> for its unusual {{sensitivity}} to light. This property has allowed <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> {{to become the}} basis of modern photographic materials. AgBr is widely used in photographic films and is believed by some to {{have been used for}} making the Shroud of Turin. The salt can be found naturally as the mineral bromargyrite (bromyrite).|$|R
2500|$|A {{color film}} {{is made up}} of many {{different}} layers that work together to create the color image. [...] Color negative films provide three main color layers: the blue record, green record, and red record; each made up of two separate layers containing <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> crystals and dye-couplers. [...] A cross-sectional representation of a piece of developed color negative film is shown in the figure at the right. [...] Each layer of the film is so thin that the composite of all layers, in addition to the triacetate base and antihalation backing, is less than 0.0003" [...] (8µm) thick.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potassium}} dichromate solution in sulfuric acid {{can be used}} to produce a reversal negative (i.e., a positive transparency from a negative film). This is effected by [...] developing a black and white film but allowing the development to proceed more or less to the end point. The development is then stopped by copious washing and the film then treated in the acid dichromate solution. This converts the silver metal to silver sulfate, a compound that is insensitive to light. After thorough washing and exposure to actinic light, the film is developed again allowing the previously unexposed <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> to be reduced to silver metal.|$|E
2500|$|Silane {{pyrolysis}} gives polymeric {{species and}} finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially {{produced by the}} pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C–H or C–C bond {{and the formation of}} radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating silenes :SiH2 or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210kJ/mol) is much less than the Si–Si and Si–H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in methanol, controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH2(OMe)2, SiH(OMe)3, and Si(OMe)4. The Si–H bond also adds to alkenes, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450°C, silane participates in an addition reaction with acetone, as well as a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at −80°C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate hydrogen halide with an Al2X6 catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> in a heated flow reactor: ...|$|E
50|$|Before a {{paper is}} exposed, the image layer {{is a clear}} gelatin matrix holding the {{light-sensitive}} <b>silver</b> <b>halides.</b> For gelatin <b>silver</b> prints, these <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> are typically combinations of silver bromide and silver chloride. Exposure to a negative is typically done with an enlarger, although contact printing was also popular, particularly among amateurs {{in the early twentieth}} century and among users of large format cameras. Wherever the light strikes the paper the <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> form small specks of silver metal on their surface. Light causes a reduction of the silver salt to silver metal. This exposure is the greatest in areas of the print corresponding to clear parts of the negatives, which become the shadows or high density areas of the print.|$|R
40|$|<b>Silver</b> and <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) (Ag, AgCl, AgBr, and AgI) capped {{with two}} different stabilizers (sodium citrate and nonionic surfactant Tween 80) were obtained via sodium borohydride reduction of silver nitrate {{in an aqueous}} solution. The effect of the biocidal action of as-prepared synthesized materials against yeast cells Saccharomyces cerevisiae was compared to the effect produced by silver nitrate and studied through the measurement of cell loss and kinetics of K+ efflux from the cells depending on concentration of silver. The results clearly indicate that the silver ions either remained in the dispersion of silver NPs and <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> NPs after their synthesis or were generated afterwards by dissolving <b>silver</b> and <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> particles playing a major part in the cytotoxic activity of NPs against yeast cells. It was also supposed that this activity most likely does not relate to the damage of cell membrane...|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Key {{stages in}} {{production}} of Ag-based photographs. Two <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> particles, {{one of which}} is impinged with light (hν) resulting in the formation of a latent image (step 1). The latent image is amplified using photographic developers, converting the <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> crystal to an opaque particle of silver metal (step 2). Finally, the remaining <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> is removed by fixing (step 3).|$|E
50|$|There {{is another}} kind of {{chemical}} fog, broadly classified as silver stain. This kind of fog {{does not require a}} fog centre in each <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> crystal, since they can grow on other substrates other than photosensitive <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> crystals.|$|E
50|$|Examples of Agent 1 include: Phenidone, Dimezone S, Metol, p-aminophenol, glycin, Eikonogen. These {{agents have}} {{nitrogen}} atoms that give strong affinity to <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> (argentophilic) {{as well as}} hydrophobic end, effectively acting as a surfactant between the developer solution and <b>silver</b> <b>halide</b> crystals.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{processing}} of photographic films, plates or papers, the photographic developer (or just developer) is one or more chemicals that convert the latent image to a visible image. Developing agents achieve this conversion by reducing the <b>silver</b> <b>halides,</b> which are pale-colored, into silver metal, which is black (when a fine particle). [...] The conversion occurs within the gelatine matrix. The special feature of photography is that the developer only acts on those particles of <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> that {{have been exposed to}} light. Generally, the longer a developer is allowed to work, the darker the image.|$|R
50|$|Gum {{printing}} {{is a way}} {{of making}} photographic reproductions without the use of <b>silver</b> <b>halides.</b> The process uses salts of dichromate in common with a number of other related processes such as sun printing.|$|R
50|$|In a {{film camera}} {{that uses the}} gelatin-silver process, light falling upon {{photographic}} emulsions containing <b>silver</b> <b>halides</b> is recorded as a latent image. The latent image is subjected to photographic processing, which makes it visible and insensitive to light.|$|R
