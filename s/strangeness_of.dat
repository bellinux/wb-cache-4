5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus {{can produce a}} viable male hybrid, {{though it is not}} known if it is sterile. An {{accidental}} crossing of an east African common eland (T. o. pattersonianus) with an east African kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the <b>strangeness</b> <b>of</b> their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The concept <b>of</b> <b>strangeness</b> {{emerged from}} the low energy {{phenomenology}} before the entry of quarks in particle physics. The connection between strangeness and isospin is rather accidental and loose and we recognize later that the definition <b>of</b> <b>strangeness</b> is model-dependent. Indeed, in Gell-Mann’s triplet quark model we {{realize that there is}} a simple alternative representation <b>of</b> <b>strangeness.</b> When the concept of generations is incorporated into the quark model we find that only the second alternative version <b>of</b> <b>strangeness</b> remains meaningful, whereas the original one does no longer keep its significance...|$|R

We find that some double polarization observables are very sensitive to the <b>strangeness</b> content <b>of</b> proton because of the different spin structures of the amplitudes associated with the different mechanisms. This suggests that such measurements could be very useful {{to probe the}} strangeness content in the proton.

40|$|We {{investigate}} φ meson electroproduction {{to probe}} the hidden <b>strangeness</b> content <b>of</b> the nucleon. We found that even {{a small amount of}} the s¯s admixture in the nucleon wavefunction can lead to a significant change in several double polarization asymmetries in φ electroproduction, which can be tested experimentally at current electron facilities. The subject <b>of</b> the <b>strangeness</b> content <b>of</b> the nucleon and nuclei {{has been one of the}} important issues in hadron and nuclear physics [1]. Production of φ meson from nucleon target has been suggested as a sensitive probe to study the <b>strangeness</b> content <b>of</b> the nucleon. Because of the ideal mixing with ω, φ meson is nearly a pure s¯s state and its direct coupling to the nucleon must be suppressed by the OZI rule. A non-vanishing s¯s admixture in the nucleon would then give rise to OZI-evading processes in φ production and the study of such processes is expected to provide information on the hidden <b>strangeness</b> content <b>of</b> the nucleon. Large deviation from the OZI prediction on φ production in p¯p annihilation [2] has been suggested as a signal <b>of</b> non-vanishing <b>strangeness</b> content <b>of</b> the nucleon [3].

Waugh could not redeem himself as he got out shortly to a short ball by Zaheer Khan, and while trying to negotiate a ball from Zaheer, overbalanced and trod on his stumps.

Referring to his failure and the unfortunate mix-up between him and Damien Martyn, Greg Chappell mentioned in an interview that Waugh's last mile was going to be uphill from then.
