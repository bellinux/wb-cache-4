6000|$|Noah, {{by nature}} {{was no better}} than other men: {{therefore}} the reason why he perished not with others, {{it was because he}} [...] "found grace {{in the eyes of the}} Lord." [...] Ye are saved by grace (Eph 2:8). And thus was Noah, as is evident, because he was saved by faith (Heb 11:7). For faith respecteth not works, but grace: Ye are saved by grace through faith. As Paul <b>says</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace," [...] &c. (Rom 4:16). We must therefore, in our deliverance from all the judgments of God, sing grace, grace, unto it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nature," [...] he <b>says</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "makes the text, and {{the medical}} man adds the gloss; but the two fit each other no better than a dog does a bath;" [...] and again, when he is arguing against the doctors who hated chemistry--"Who hates a thing which has hurt nobody? Will you {{complain}} of a dog for biting you, if you lay hold of his tail? Does the emperor send the thief to the gallows, or the thing which he has stolen? The thief, I think. Therefore science should not be despised on account of some who know nothing about it." [...] You will say the reasoning is not very clear, and indeed the passage, like too many more, smacks strongly of wine and laudanum. But such is his quaint racy style. As humorous a man, it seems to me, as you shall meet with for many a day; and where there is humour there is pretty sure to be imagination, tenderness, and depth of heart.|$|E

[...] "Come directly, mas'r," [...] says Sady, and resumes his conversation with his woolly brethren. He grins. He takes the pistols out of the holster. He snaps the locks. He points them at a grunter, which plunges through the farmyard. He points down the road, over which he has just galloped, and towards which the woolly heads again turn. He <b>says</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "Comin', mas'r. Everybody a-comin'." [...] And now, the gallop of other horses is heard. And who is yonder? Little Mr. Dempster, spurring and digging into his pony; and that lady in a riding-habit on Madam Esmond's little horse, can it be Madam Esmond? No. It is too stout. As I live it is Mrs. Mountain on Madam's grey! ...|$|E

Clive runs for a chair, and a dozen were forthcoming. Florac skips back {{with a glass of}} water. Belsize runs towards the {{awakening}} girl: and the father, for an instant losing all patience and self-command, trembling in every limb, lifts his stick, and <b>says</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "Leave her, you ruffian." [...] "Lady Clara has fainted again, sir," [...] says Captain Belsize. [...] "I am staying at the Hotel de France. If you touch me, old man" [...] (this in a very low voice), [...] "by Heaven I shall kill you. I wish you good morning;" [...] and taking a last long look at the lifeless girl, he lifts his hat and walks away. Lord Dorking mechanically takes his hat off, and stands stupidly gazing after him. He beckoned Clive to follow him, and a crowd of the frequenters of the place are by this time closed round the fainting young lady.|$|E

[...] However, according to Bradford himself, whom some consider the author of part of [...] "Mourt's Relation," [...] they who came over in the Fortune the next year were somewhat daunted when [...] "they came into the harbor of Cape Cod, and there saw nothing but a naked and barren place." [...] They soon found out their mistake with respect to the goodness of Plymouth soil. Yet when at length, some years later, when they were fully satisfied of the poorness of the place which they had chosen, [...] "the greater part," [...] says Bradford, [...] "consented to a removal to a place called Nausett," [...] they agreed to remove all together to Nauset, now Eastham, which was jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire; and some of the most respectable of the inhabitants of Plymouth did actually remove thither accordingly.|$|E

6000|$|The other venture, above {{referred}} to, was Mrs. Eddy's Massachusetts Metaphysical College, {{in which}} was taught [...] "the pathology of spiritual power." [...] She could not copyright it, {{but she got}} it chartered. For faculty it had herself, her husband of the period (Dr. Eddy), and her adopted son, Dr. Foster-Eddy. The college term was [...] "barely three weeks," [...] she <b>says.</b> <b>Again</b> she was bold, brave, rash, reckless--choose for yourself--for she not only began to charge the student, but charged him a hundred dollars {{a week for the}} enlightenments. And got it? some may ask. Easily. Pupils flocked from far and near. They came by the hundred. Presently the term was cut down nearly half, but the price remained as before. To be exact, the term-cut was to seven lessons--price, three hundred dollars. The college [...] "yielded a large income." [...] This is believable. In seven years Mrs. Eddy taught, as she avers, over four thousand students in it. (Preface to 1902 edition of Science and Health.) Three hundred times four thousand is--but perhaps you can cipher it yourself. I could do it ordinarily, but I fell down yesterday and hurt my leg. Cipher it; you will see that it is a grand sum for a woman to earn in seven years. Yet that was not all she got out of her college in the seven.|$|E
6000|$|Only, if thou wouldst {{drink it}}, drink it by itself, and that thou mayest not be deceived by {{that which is}} counterfeit, know it is as {{it comes from the}} hand of our Lord, without mixture, pure and clear as crystal. I know there are many mountebanks in the world, and every of them pretend they have this water to sell; but my advice is, that thou go {{directly}} to the throne thyself (Heb 4:16); or as thou art bidden come to the waters (Isa 55:1), and there thou shalt be sure to have that which is right and good, and that which will certainly make thee well, let thy disease, or trouble, or pain, or malady, be what it will. For the price, care not for that, it is cheap enough, this is to be had without money or price. 'I will give,' saith God and the Lamb, 'unto him that is athirst, of the fountain of the water of life freely' (Rev 21:6). Hence he <b>says</b> <b>again,</b> 'Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely' (Rev 22:17). So that thou hast no ground to keep back because of thy poverty; nay, for the poor it is prepared and set open, to the poor it is offered, the poor and needy may have it of free cost (Isa 41:17,18).[1] ...|$|E

'Yes, sure,' replied Mrs. Smith; and {{continued}} after {{the manner of}} certain matrons, to whose tongues the harmony of a subject with a casual mood is a greater recommendation than its pertinence to the occasion, 'John would spend pounds a year upon the jimcrack old thing, if he might, in having it claned, when {{at the same time}} you may doctor it yourself as well.

And, Martin, you must be wet. My son is gone up to change. John is damper than I should like to be, but 'a calls it nothing.

Some of them {{represented}} Christ Jesus our Lord as {{fixed in}} his mediatory {{office in the}} heavens; wherefore in one place, when the Holy Ghost speaks of Christ, as he sprang from Judah to be a mediator, saith, 'Out of him came the corner,' the corner stone, 'out of him the nail' (Zech 10:4). Now, since he is compared to a nail, a golden nail, it is to show, that as a nail, by driving, is fixed in his place; so Christ, by God's oath, is made an everlasting priest (Heb 7:25). Therefore, as he saith again, the nail, the Aaronical priesthood, that was fastened in a sure place, should be removed, be cut down, and fall; so he who has the key of David, which is Christ (Rev 3:7), shall by God, as a nail, be fastened in a sure place, and abide; therefore he <b>says</b> <b>again,</b> 'And he shall be for a glorious throne,' or mercy-seat, 'to his Father's house.' And moreover, That 'they shall hang upon him,' as on a nail, 'all the glory of his Father's house, the offspring, and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons' (Isa 22:20-25). According to that which is written, 'And they sang a new song' to the Lamb that was slain, 'saying, Thou art worthy,' &c. (Rev 5:9-12).|$|E
6000|$|The {{following}} will illustrate how we drummed up {{business in the}} graft of passing the punk. A row of newcomers is installed in your cells. You pass along before the bars with your punk.

A little later you come back and lean up casually against the bars. [...] "Say, Bo, can you let us have a little tobacco?" [...] is what you say. If he is not wise to the game, the chances are that he solemnly avers that he hasn't any more tobacco. All very well. You condole with him and go your way.
