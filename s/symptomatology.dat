5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on <b>symptomatology</b> and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive <b>symptomatology.</b> When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric <b>symptomatology</b> {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional {{lability}} leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|SMA {{syndrome}} is extremely rare, evident in only 0.3% of upper-gastrointestinal-tract barium studies. However, unfamiliarity with this condition {{in the medical}} community coupled with its intermittent and nonspecific <b>symptomatology</b> probably results in its underdiagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that bipolar {{disorder}} has often been misdiagnosed as major depression. Its early diagnosis necessitates that clinicians {{pay attention to the}} features of the patient's depression and also look for present or prior hypomanic or manic <b>symptomatology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Levodopa (or L-DOPA) {{has been}} the most widely used {{treatment}} for over 30 years. L-DOPA is transformed into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by dopa-decarboxylase. Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra, the administration of L-DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor <b>symptomatology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Abdominal aortic aneurysms are {{commonly}} divided {{according to their}} size and <b>symptomatology.</b> An aneurysm is usually defined as an outer aortic diameter over 3cm (normal diameter of the aorta is around 2cm), or more than 50% of normal diameter. If the outer diameter exceeds 5.5cm, the aneurysm {{is considered to be}} large.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} {{and length}} of the withdrawal syndrome is likely determined by various factors, including rate of tapering, length of use and dosage size, and possible genetic factors. Those who have a prior history of withdrawing from benzodiazepines may have a sensitized or kindled central nervous system leading to worsening cognition and <b>symptomatology,</b> and making each subsequent withdrawal period worse.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} acute care, both {{clinically}} and economically, {{has meant that}} there is now little opportunity for meaningful observation of the <b>symptomatology</b> of the acute psychiatric patient. The use of psychotherapy too has been de-emphasized, consequent to like motivating factors. Psychiatrist-patient face-time is now lower than ever before and, {{against a backdrop of}} ever higher professional fees and ever greater cost-sensitivity within health systems, this appears unlikely to change.|$|E
25|$|Perceived threat {{control has}} been {{identified}} as a moderator within panic disorder, moderating the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and agoraphobia; thus, the level of perceived threat control dictates the degree to which anxiety sensitivity results in agoraphobia. Another recently identified moderator of panic disorder is genetic variations in the gene coding for galanin; these genetic variations moderate the relationship between females suffering from panic disorder and the level of severity of panic disorder <b>symptomatology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between March 31 and April 6, 1977, 59 {{individuals}} developed type B botulism. All ill persons {{had eaten}} {{at the same}} Mexican restaurant in Pontiac, Michigan and all had consumed a hot sauce made with improperly home-canned jalapeño peppers, either by adding it to their food, or by eating a nacho that had had hot sauce used in its preparation. The full clinical spectrum (mild <b>symptomatology</b> with neurologic findings through life-threatening ventilatory paralysis) of type B botulism was documented.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of early {{hypercapnia}} include flushed skin, full pulse, tachypnea, dyspnea, extrasystoles, muscle twitches, hand flaps, reduced neural activity, and possibly a raised blood pressure. According to other sources, symptoms of mild hypercapnia might include headache, confusion and lethargy. Hypercapnia can induce increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias. Hypercapnia may increase pulmonary capillary resistance. In severe hypercapnia (generally PaCO2 greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg), <b>symptomatology</b> progresses to disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} {{have begun to}} identify mediators and moderators of aspects of panic disorder. One such mediator is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, which mediates the relationship between panic disorder patients receiving breathing training and anxiety sensitivity; thus, breathing training affects the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in a patient’s arterial blood, which in turn lowers anxiety sensitivity. Another mediator is hypochondriacal concerns, which mediate the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and panic symptomatology; thus, anxiety sensitivity affects hypochondriacal concerns which, in turn, affect panic <b>symptomatology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Executive {{dysfunction}} characterizes many of {{the symptoms}} observed in numerous clinical populations. In the case of acquired brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases {{there is a clear}} neurological etiology producing dysexecutive symptoms. Conversely, syndromes and disorders are defined and diagnosed based on their <b>symptomatology</b> rather than etiology. Thus, while Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative condition, causes executive dysfunction, a disorder such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a classification given to a set of subjectively-determined symptoms implicating executive dysfunction – current models indicate that such clinical symptoms are caused by executive dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Drug abuse, {{including}} {{alcohol and}} prescription drugs, can induce <b>symptomatology</b> which resembles mental illness. This can occur {{both in the}} intoxicated state and also during the withdrawal state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or depression after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. A protracted withdrawal syndrome can also occur with symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. Benzodiazepines are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use. Abuse of hallucinogens can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use.|$|E
25|$|Given the inhumanity of his crimes, Hitler {{was early}} on linked with “psychopathy”, a severe {{personality}} disorder whose main symptoms {{are a great}} or complete lack of empathy, social responsibility and conscience. The biologically determined concept still {{plays a role in}} the psychiatric forensic science, but it is no longer found in the modern medical classification systems (DSM-IV and ICD-10). Today, corresponding clinical pictures are mostly classified as signs of an antisocial personality disorder. However, the <b>symptomatology</b> is rare, and unlike in popular discourse – where the classification of Hitler as a “psychopath” is commonplace –, psychiatrists have only occasionally endeavored to associate him with psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|The disease, {{which affects}} about 1/30,000 infants of both genders, may become {{clinically}} evident {{at any time}} from infancy through early adulthood. The age of onset of Wilson's disease ranges from 3 to 50 years of age. Initial symptoms include hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders and, rarely, renal, skeletal, or endocrine <b>symptomatology.</b> The disease progresses with deepening jaundice {{and the development of}} encephalopathy, severe clotting abnormalities, occasionally associated with intravascular coagulation, and terminal renal insufficiency. A peculiar type of tremor in the upper extremities, slowness of movement, and changes in temperament become apparent. Kayser-Fleischer rings, a rusty brown discoloration at the outer rims of the iris due to copper deposition noted in 90% of patients, become evident as copper begins to accumulate and affect the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET proto-oncogene, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated receptor tyrosine kinase protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical <b>symptomatology.</b> Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas.|$|E
25|$|Drug abuse, {{including}} {{alcohol and}} prescription drugs, can induce <b>symptomatology</b> which resembles mental illness, {{which can make}} it difficult to differentiate between substance induced psychiatric syndromes and pre-existing mental health problems. More often than not psychiatric disorders among drug or alcohol abusers disappear with prolonged abstinence. Substance induced psychiatric symptoms can occur both in the intoxicated state and also during the withdrawal state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or depression after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Abuse of hallucinogens can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use and cannabis may trigger panic attacks during intoxication and with use it may cause a state similar to dysthymia. Severe anxiety and depression are commonly induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence. Even moderate sustained use of alcohol may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases these drug induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence. A protracted withdrawal syndrome can also occur with psychiatric and other symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. Benzodiazepines are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam {{has been found to}} be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthric, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5mg. The nitrazepam-induced <b>symptomatology</b> can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration.|$|E
500|$|Hippocrates {{began to}} {{categorize}} illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, [...] "exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence." [...] Another of Hippocrates' major contributions {{may be found}} in his descriptions of the <b>symptomatology,</b> physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of thoracic empyema, i.e. suppuration of the lining of the chest cavity. His teachings remain relevant to present-day students of pulmonary medicine and surgery. Hippocrates was the first documented chest surgeon and his findings and techniques, while crude, {{such as the use of}} lead pipes to drain chest wall abscess, are still valid.|$|E
500|$|Despite a {{demonstrated}} {{appearance of}} blunted affect, recent {{findings indicate that}} many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive, particularly to stressful or negative stimuli, and that such sensitivity may cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder. Some {{evidence suggests that the}} content of delusional beliefs and psychotic experiences can reflect emotional causes of the disorder, and that how a person interprets such experiences can influence <b>symptomatology.</b> The use of [...] "safety behaviors" [...] (acts such as gestures or the use of words in specific contexts) to avoid or neutralize imagined threats may actually contribute to the chronicity of delusions. Further evidence for the role of psychological mechanisms comes from the effects of psychotherapies on symptoms of schizophrenia.|$|E
500|$|Bladder: <b>Symptomatology</b> of the {{urinary tract}} {{is common in}} MS. Treatments for bladder {{problems}} {{vary depending on the}} origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are desmopressin for nocturia and anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non-pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; [...] and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder.|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, Lacan {{started to}} hold a private weekly seminar in Paris, in which he urged what he {{described}} as [...] "a return to Freud" [...] that would concentrate on the linguistic nature of psychological <b>symptomatology.</b> Becoming public in 1953, Lacan's 27-year-long seminar was highly influential in Parisian cultural life, as well as in psychoanalytic theory and clinical practice.|$|E
2500|$|Glutamate is {{the most}} {{abundant}} excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. Increased glutamate excitatory activity during withdrawal may lead to sensitization or kindling of the CNS, possibly leading to worsening cognition and <b>symptomatology</b> and making each subsequent withdrawal period worse. [...] Those who have a prior history of withdrawing from benzodiazepines {{are found to be}} less likely to succeed the next time around.|$|E
2500|$|In {{patients}} with other pacing modes, other than ventricular pacing, symptoms usually resolve after adjusting and reprogramming of pacemaker parameters, such as tuning the AV delay, changing the postventricular atrial refractory period, the sensing level, and pacing threshold voltage. The optimal values of these parameters {{for each individual}} differ. So, achieving the optimal values is by experimenting with successive reprogramming and measurement of [...] parameters, such as blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance, as well as observations of <b>symptomatology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive {{personality disorder}} (OCPD) are highly comorbid with AN, particularly the restrictive subtype. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is linked with more severe <b>symptomatology</b> and worse prognosis. [...] The causality between personality disorders and eating disorders {{has yet to}} be fully established. Other comorbid conditions include depression, [...] alcoholism, borderline and other personality disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). [...] Depression and anxiety are the most common comorbidities, and depression is associated with a worse outcome.|$|E
2500|$|The KSADS-E, {{which is}} the {{epidemiological}} version of the KSADS, is a tool to interview parents about possible psychopathology in children from preschool onward. It was developed by Puig-Antich, Orvaschel, Tabrizi, and Chambers in 1980 as a structured interview. The tool examines both past and current episodes, focusing on the most severe past episode and the most current episode. However, this tool does not rate symptom severity; it should only be used to assess {{presence or absence of}} <b>symptomatology.</b> This version of the K-SADS introduced screening questions, which, if negative, allowed skipping the remaining diagnostic probes. [...] Furthermore, the K-SADS-E also includes “skip out” criteria when assessing other diagnostic disorders (ADHD, PTSD, etc.), allowing those that screen positive to immediately be interviewed for all of the symptoms regarding that diagnosis, and those that screened negative could “skip out” of being interviewed on the remaining symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Ellen Bass and Laura Davis, co-authors of The Courage to Heal (1988), are {{described}} as [...] "champions of survivorship" [...] by Frederick Crews, who considers Freud the key influence upon them, although in his view they are indebted not to classic psychoanalysis but to [...] "the pre-psychoanalytic Freud... who supposedly took pity on his hysterical patients, found {{that they were all}} harboring memories of early abuse... and cured them by unknotting their repression." [...] Crews sees Freud as having anticipated the recovered memory movement by emphasizing [...] "mechanical cause-and-effect relations between <b>symptomatology</b> and the premature stimulation of one body zone or another", and with pioneering its [...] "technique of thematically matching a patient's symptom with a sexually symmetrical 'memory.'" [...] Crews believes that Freud's confidence in accurate recall of early memories anticipates the theories of recovered memory therapists such as Lenore Terr, which in his view have led to people being wrongfully imprisoned or involved in litigation.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebral palsy is {{characterized}} by abnormal muscle tone, reflexes, or motor development and coordination. There can be joint and bone deformities and contractures (permanently fixed, tight muscles and joints). The classical symptoms are spasticity, spasms, other involuntary movements (e.g., facial gestures), unsteady gait, problems with balance, or soft tissue findings consisting largely of decreased muscle mass. Scissor walking (where the knees come in and cross) and toe walking (which can contribute to a gait reminiscent of a marionette) are common among people with CP {{who are able to}} walk, but taken on the whole, CP <b>symptomatology</b> is very diverse. The effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of motor dysfunction, which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible {{at the other end of}} the spectrum. Although most people with CP have problems with increased muscle tone, some have normal or low muscle tone. [...] High muscle tone can either be due to spasticity or dystonia.|$|E
2500|$|... vanApeldoorn, F.J. et al. (2011) {{demonstrated}} the additive {{value of a}} combined treatment incorporating an SSRI treatment intervention with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Gloster et al. (2011) went on to examine {{the role of the}} therapist in CBT. [...] They randomized patients into two groups: [...] one being treated with CBT in a therapist guided environment, and the second receiving CBT through instruction only, with no therapist guided sessions. [...] The findings indicated that the first group had a somewhat better response rate, but that both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in reduction of panic <b>symptomatology.</b> [...] These findings lend credibility to the application of CBT programs to patients who are unable to access therapeutic services due to financial, or geographic inaccessibility. [...] Koszycky et al. (2011) discuss the efficacy of self-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (SCBT) in situations where patients are unable to retain the services of a therapist. [...] Their study demonstrates that it is possible for SCBT in combination with an SSRI to be as effective as therapist-guided CBT with SSRI. [...] Each of these studies contributes to a new avenue of research that allows effective treatment interventions to be made more easily accessible to the population.|$|E
2500|$|No {{medications}} {{are indicated}} for directly treating schizoid personality disorder, but certain medications {{may reduce the}} symptoms of SPD as well as treat co-occurring mental disorders. The symptoms of SPD mirror the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anhedonia, blunted affect and low energy, and SPD {{is thought to be}} part of the [...] "schizophrenic spectrum" [...] of disorders, which also includes the schizotypal and paranoid personality disorders, and may benefit from the medications indicated for schizophrenia. Originally, low doses of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone or olanzapine were used to alleviate social deficits and blunted affect. However, a recent review concluded that atypical antipsychotics were ineffective for treating personality disorders. In contrast, the substituted amphetamine Bupropion may be used to treat anhedonia. Likewise, Modafinil may be effective in treating some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are reflected in the <b>symptomatology</b> of SPD and therefore may help as well. Lamotrigine, SSRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and Hydroxyzine may help counter social anxiety in people with SPD if present, though social anxiety may not be a main concern for the people who have SPD. However, it is not general practice to treat SPD with medications, other than for the short term treatment of acute co-occurring Axis I conditions (e.g. depression).|$|E
