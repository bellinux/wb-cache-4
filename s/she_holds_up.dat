After Katniss finds Rue and frees her from a trap, Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which fatally strikes Rue. Katniss kills Marvel and comforts Rue as she dies. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> three fingers - a District 12 salute - for Rue. Back in District 11, the residents salute Katniss, then riot, prompting Panem's President Snow to warn Crane about Katniss' influence.|$|E
2500|$|Though it {{is seldom}} used {{except on the}} admissions {{certificates}} issued {{to members of the}} Virginia State Bar, the Supreme Court has its own seal which is distinct from the Seal of Virginia. The Court's seal is remarkably similar to the mural Justicia, by the artist Raphael, in the [...] Sala di Costantino, Vatican Palace, Rome, 1519-1520. It depicts a seated female figure looking at a balance which <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> in her left hand, her other hand resting on the neck of an ostrich. In ancient Egypt, the hieroglyph for justice was an ostrich tail feather. The origin of the seal is not known. There were many prints made of this image over the centuries. [...] During a ceremony to celebrate the Court's 225th anniversary, the seal was used {{for the first time in}} many years on the cover of the programs given to guests, and also appears on certificates of admission and other ceremonial documents issued by the Court. [...] The lesser state seal, however, is depicted on the Justices' chairs and on a medallion over the entrance to the main courtroom.|$|E

5000|$|An uncredited {{review in}} Billboard said that [...] "She sings her heart out, {{but not even}} <b>she</b> can <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> this clich√©-ridden song." ...|$|R

6000|$|... [He goes out. DAISY {{goes over}} to a chest which stands in the [...] room and throws it open. She takes out the Manchu dress which Harry [...] once gave her and handles it smilingly. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> in both her [...] hands the sumptuous headdress. There {{is the sound of}} a door being [...] locked. DAISY puts down the headdress and looks at the door [...] enquiringly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> {{a common}} cash-bag, {{and on the}} table is a heap of such bags. Witch Two laughs at us. Witch Three scowls at us. Witch sisterhood all, stitch, stitch. First Witch has a circle round each eye. I fancy it like the {{beginning}} of the development of a perverted diabolical halo, and that when it spreads all round her head, she will die in the odour of devilry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Six {{or seven}} {{feet on the}} edge, but less further on. We do not draw over five feet, so we will keep on till we touch. The moment we do so let the two anchors go. Wind and tide will take her off again quick enough. Pay out ten or twelve fathoms of chain, and {{directly}} <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> drop the lead-line overboard {{to see if she}} drags; if she does, give her some more rope and chain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> {{a warning}} hand. [...] "I am deeper in death {{at this moment}} than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Slowly <b>she</b> turned, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> a small box, {{and slowly}} she said, [...] "I brought you a present, just a new cigar-case. I don't know if you'd care to have it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{virtue of}} this," [...] <b>she</b> answered, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> {{her hand and}} showing on it a ring I knew. It was the signet of the Empress. I saluted the seal, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, {{snatching}} it from him: [...] "What! It is, it is! Oh, poor dear Lilly! How can {{you ever}} forgive me? She saw me {{looking at it}} to-day at Shumaker's, and it must have come into her head in despair what else to get me. But {{it was a perfect}} inspiration--for it was just what I was longing for. Why"--laughing hysterically while <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> the robe, and turns it this way and that--"I might have seen at a glance that it wasn't a man's, with this lace on and this silk hood, and"--she hurries into it, and pulls it forward, looking down at either side--"it's just the right length, and if it was made for me it couldn't fit me better. What a joke I shall have with Lilly, when I tell her about it. I sha'n't spare myself a bit!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Continues {{strutting}} around, imitating {{what she}} considers are a man's stride and swagger, returns to table {{and proceeds to}} unwrap parcel.] Well, I'll go out like a girl, if I did come in like a man. [Drops wrapping paper on table and holds up a woman's long automobile cloak and a motor bonnet. Is suddenly startled by sound of approaching footsteps and glances in a frightened way toward door.] Mercy! Here comes somebody now! [Glances about her in alarm, drops cloak and bonnet on floor close to table, seizes a handful of newspapers, and runs to large leather chair to right of table, where she seats herself hurriedly. One paper <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> before her, hiding {{her face as she}} pretends to read. Unfortunately the paper is upside down. The other papers lie on her lap.] ...|$|E
60|$|The Gardens are bounded on {{one side}} by a never-ending line of omnibuses, over which Irene has such {{authority}} that if <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> her finger {{to any one of}} them it stops immediately. She then crosses with you in safety to the other side. There are more gates to the Gardens than one gate, but that is the one you go in at, and before you go in you speak to the lady with the balloons, who sits just outside. This is as near to being inside as she may venture, because, if she were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment, the balloons would lift her up, and she would be flown away. She sits very squat, for the balloons are always tugging at her, and the strain has given her quite a red face. Once she was a new one, because the old one had let go, and David was very sorry for the old one, but as she did let go, he wished he had been there to see.|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} turned round, with a scream; her muslin dress, which <b>she</b> was <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> in front, dropped from her hand, and a prodigious lapful of flowers rolled {{out on the}} gravel walk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Observe, then! It is you {{who make}} this a secret,' said <b>she,</b> <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> her hand, 'and not I. It is you, Arthur, who bring here doubts and suspicions and entreaties for explanations, and it is you, Arthur, who bring secrets here. What is it to me, do you think, where the man has been, or what he has been? What can it be to me? The whole world may know it, if they care to know it; it is nothing to me. Now, let me go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> the tool--a horse's leg-bone fitted into {{a handle}} and filed to an edge--"'tis only that they've less {{patience}} with the twigs, because their time {{is worth more}} than mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Saint George and Saint Andrew!" [...] exclaimed the amazed Roland Graeme to himself, [...] "was {{there ever}} such an audacious quean!--she {{seems a little}} ashamed of her mummery too, for she holds the lap of her cloak to her face, and her colour is heightened--but Santa Maria, how she threads the throng, with as firm and bold a step {{as if she had}} never tied {{petticoat}} round her waist!--Holy Saints! <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> her riding-rod as if she would lay it about some of their ears, that stand most in her way--by the hand of my father! she bears herself like the very model of pagehood.--Hey! what! sure she will not strike frieze-jacket in earnest?" [...] But he was not long left in doubt; for the lout whom he had before repeatedly noticed, {{standing in the way of}} the bustling page, and maintaining his place with clownish obstinacy or stupidity, the advanced riding-rod was, without a moment's hesitation, sharply applied to his shoulders, in a manner which made him spring aside, rubbing the part of the body which had received so unceremonious a hint that it was in the way of his betters. The party injured growled forth an oath or two of indignation, and Roland Graeme began to think of flying down stairs to the assistance of the translated Catherine; but the laugh of the yard was against frieze-jacket, which indeed had, in those days, small chance of fair play in a quarrel with velvet and embroidery; so that the fellow, who was menial in the inn, slunk back to finish his task of dressing the bonny gray, laughed at by all, but most by the wench in the stammel waistcoat, his fellow-servant, who, to crown his disgrace, had the cruelty to cast an applauding smile upon the author of the injury, while, with a freedom more like the milk-maid of the town than she of the plains, she accosted him with--"Is there any one you want here, my pretty gentleman, that you seem in such haste?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Buffy realizes she's eaten her Mother's breakfast by mistake. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> {{the last}} bite of bagel and, instead of saying, [...] "there's a bite left," [...] she says: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "What Can I Say?" [...] - This {{featured}} Lorna {{filmed in}} a variety of locations around Hastings. In most shots <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> a piece of paper with {{one of a number of}} selected words from the song, in other shots the paper has a question mark. Towards the end of the video <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> a piece of paper with the word 'sorry' written on it instead. Unlike most of the other videos she does not wear her stage clothes, nor her red shoes, but is dressed in ordinary clothes - at least three separate outfits.|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> a cheque; [...] "now we'll have a jubilee, {{and take}} you down under the East cliff, and we'll invest a {{shilling}} in 'Ivanhoe,' and Rose and Violetta shall open their ears!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she stared}} at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, {{scribbled}} on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way <b>she's</b> <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{was shut}} {{out with her}} in the hall, <b>she</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> her hands, [...] "Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come upstairs to Mr. Skimpole's room. He has been took, miss!" ...|$|R
50|$|The sleeve was {{designed}} by David Willis and Flying Colours and features a humorous take on the Statue of Liberty. Instead of a torch, <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> a microphone typical of those used in the mid-1950s, and flashes her legs.|$|E
50|$|A {{servant of}} Rokuro (Taiji Tonoyama) kills the wife because she cannot {{bring herself to}} commit suicide. Finally Jiju brings {{the head of the}} woman back to the court of the bad man. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> the head and starts laughing. The severed head smiles.|$|E
50|$|At {{the train}} station, Anna chases down Danny and begs {{him to take}} her with him. Danny says that it won't last. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> a regular coin and says if it lands heads, she may go with him. Without looking, he claims it is heads and the two kiss.|$|E
6000|$|... "O mamma, mamma!" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> a {{sheet of}} paper, while a look of intense {{satisfaction}} beamed on her animated countenance, [...] "see, I have drawn Chimo's portrait. Is it like, mamma? Do you think it like?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY. Yes; but {{you know}} you have THE letter in your pocket. (He smiles; takes a letter from his pocket; and tosses it {{on the top of the}} heap. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> it <b>up</b> and looks at him, saying) About Caesar's wife.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> was <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> her hands. He {{lifted her}} gently in his arms, {{dropping}} her head over his shoulder. [...] "Now," [...] he said cheerfully, [...] "you keep a good lookout that way, and I this, and we'll soon be there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bird Girl is cast {{in bronze}} and stands 50 in tall. She {{is the image}} of a young girl wearing a simple dress and a sad or contemplative expression, with her head tilted toward her left shoulder. She stands straight, her elbows propped against her waist as <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> two bowls out from her sides. The bowls are often {{described}} by viewers as [...] "bird feeders".|$|E
5000|$|The film {{opens with}} a stereotypical hillbilly version of Little Red Riding Hood (voiced by Colleen Collins), telling the {{audience}} that she's taking [...] "nourishment" [...] (as <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> a clich√© moonshine bottle) to her grandma, who lives on a country farm. At the farmhouse, a wolf (voiced by Pinto Colvig) reveals himself to the audience, but confesses that he doesn't want to eat Red. He's actually {{in love with her}} and wishes to kiss her.|$|E
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> former National MP Katherine Rich {{as one of}} {{her role}} models. Kaye's own policies, placing her in the {{socially}} liberal wing of the National Party, have been criticised by some people in her own party, where some have called her a [...] "high maintenance backbencher". Others have called her [...] "obsessive", or, in a more positive vein, [...] "driven". However, commentators have argued that her stance is unlikely to hurt her in her marginal electorate, which has traditionally voted Labour.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, look here,' <b>she</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> the sheet. It was {{not what}} he had supposed, but a new one--the local rival to that which had {{contained}} the announcement, and was still damp from the press. She pointed, and he read-- ...|$|R
6000|$|His very insistence had, fortunately, {{the next}} moment, {{affected}} her as bringing her help; with which, at least, <b>she</b> could <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> {{her head to}} speak. [...] "Ah, you ARE through--you were through long ago. Or if you aren't you ought to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What am I {{to say to}} a man who {{has been}} away three days from me? Three!" [...] <b>she</b> repeated, <b>holding</b> <b>up</b> playfully three fingers before Willems' eyes. He {{snatched}} at the hand, but she was on her guard and whisked it behind her back.|$|R
