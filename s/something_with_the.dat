5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At {{the time of its}} demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS {{version was}} {{directed}} by Hironori Ishigami and planned and supervised by Tomie, while Hiroyoshi Umetani was the main planner and in charge of game balance, Shin-ichiro Tomie created the scenario and events, Tanaka worked on the presentation and assisted with the scenario, and Masayasu Yamamoto programmed the dungeons. In addition to Sugiyama, the Nintendo DS version's music was worked on by Hayato Matsuo. The idea of developing a Nintendo DS version started when Chunsoft was considering creating a series of Mystery Dungeon games for the Nintendo DS. Previous Mystery Dungeon titles came up in conversation: they considered doing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Game Boy games, but decided against it {{as it would have}} required them to redraw all the art, leaving them to decide between working on the Super Famicom or the Nintendo 64 titles; they eventually settled on working on the Super Famicom title Shiren the Wanderer.|$|E

In February 2008, {{it was reported that}} All Time Low had collaborated on a song with Mark Hoppus of Blink-182/+44. The band connected with Hoppus after exchanging emails when a video of drummer Rian Dawson getting a Blink-182 tattoo was posted online. Hoppus' management contacted the band saying he wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group, so they co-wrote a song with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} created in 1978 when Great American Recreation (GAR), the new owners of the {{recently}} combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ski area during the off season. Two years earlier, in 1976, they had followed the trend of many other ski areas {{at the time and}} opened a -long alpine slide down very steep ski trails. Gradually, Waterworld and Motorworld came together {{at the base of the}} mountain to form one of North America's earliest modern water parks, which was originally called the Vernon Valley Summer Park. They started out with two water slides and a LOLA race car track in the summer of 1978, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year, as well as tennis courts and a softball field. Finally, Motorworld was carved out of the swampy areas the ski area owned across Route 94. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).|$|E

The theme, inspired by Irving Berlin's 1929 song [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band", was composed within 20 minutes. Lowe said it [...] "sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most computer game music, that I decided to write <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same pep, simplicity, humor, and out-of-sync attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Clifford formed Seefeel in 1992 {{after posting}} {{advertisements}} for potential group members. After performing a few shows and recording demos, Seefeel signed to the Too Pure Records label in late 1992. Too Pure's co-owner Richard Roberts stated that upon hearing Seefeel's demo [...] "there was no obvious song for radio, {{but in my}} opinion it felt good. As we viewed ourselves as an experimental label that didn't want to be tied to a sound or a scene, it seemed to make sense to release <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> band." [...] Seefeel chose Too Pure as they felt the label had respect for its artists, despite the low budget given to them to record Quique.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] was {{directed}} by Rikkard Häggbom. It was released on Lo's Vevo channel and iTunes Store on 19 August 2014, {{the same day the}} singer announced the release of Queen of the Clouds. [...] The clip features the singer dancing and performing the song in a white film set and other locations while colored smoke bombs explode around her. During the video, computer-generated animation is projected on the background and Lo's body is edited to appear distorsed. In an interview with Rolling Stone, the artist said, [...] "I choked on the paint, the smoke made me half blind and here is my three-minute trip that shows the intensity and weirdness I feel when falling in love. The main theme we had in mind while making this video was 'What just happened?' It was quite amazing making <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> happy piece of my heart this time!".|$|E
500|$|Extraterrestrials {{make their}} first {{appearance}} in this episode, as Carter {{thought it would be}} a good moment to reveal them. The image of the alien was stretched in post-production to make it look taller and skinnier. The writers for the episode researched various abductee reports and conspiracy theories in order to get the right feel for the episode and make the aliens appear realistic and not [...] "fanciful". The episode makes several mentions to the Voyager program and the Voyager Golden Record; Mulder and Senator Matheson listen to Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F. First Movement while in the latter's office. The concerto's first movement is the first piece of music on the Voyager record. In addition, the episode relies heavily on mentions of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program, the collective name for a number of activities people undertake to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. Morgan later explained, “I always wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> SETI background. Hope that kids at school check out SETI, because it was factual as to what exists.” ...|$|E
500|$|Gilroy {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Nightcrawler in 1988, after reading the photo-book Naked City, a collection of photographs taken by American photographer Weegee of 1940s New York City residents at night. Often lewd and sensationalized in content, Weegee would sell these photos to tabloid newspapers. Intrigued by {{what he described as}} [...] "an amazing intersection of art and crime and commerce", Gilroy wrote a film treatment with a [...] "Chinatown feel". However, when The Public Eye (1992) was released, a film loosely based on Weegee's life, Gilroy shelved the idea. Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, and noted the predominance of violent crime stories on local news stations. [...] "I suddenly became aware of and intrigued by the idea that it must be a powerful force for a TV station, when they realize their ratings go through the roof when they show <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> potential for violence, like a police chase", says Gilroy. Sometime later, he discovered the stringer profession, and considered it to be the modern day equivalent of Weegee. Unaware of any film that focused on the livelihood of stringers, he began writing a screenplay.|$|E

500|$|Nick Knight, who had {{previously}} shot the cover art for Homogenic, directed the music video for [...] "Pagan Poetry". It is about a woman preparing herself for marriage and for her lover, as she sews a wedding dress onto her skin. As she {{had asked him to}} make a video about her love life, Knight gave Björk a camcorder and asked her to shoot her own private scenes. Shots of skin being pierced were also recorded with this camera; the people being pierced were five women who [...] "were into subculture and piercings" [...] and Björk herself, who only pierced her ear. This first two-thirds of the video contains a great deal of post-production by Peter Marin, who gave the image its abstract watercolor-like effect. The shots of Björk with her Alexander McQueen topless wedding dress were filmed in super 35 format. The main idea behind the music video was: [...] "to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> moving image that was a mirror of what was happening musically". Although the music video has been well received by critics, it was highly controversial and banned from MTV in 2001.|$|E
500|$|In April 1957 Boris Ford, Head of Schools Broadcasting at Associated Rediffusion (A-R), {{wrote to}} Britten, proposing {{a series of}} half-hour programmes. These would show Britten {{composing}} and rehearsing a work through to its performance, and would provide children with [...] "an intimate piece of musical education, by... watching {{a piece of music}} take shape and in some degree growing with it". Britten was initially cautious; he found the idea interesting but, he warned Ford, he was at that time [...] busy [...] travelling, and had little time for writing. He was also anxious not to cover the same ground as he had with Let's Make an Opera. However, he agreed to meet Ford [...] to discuss the project further. On 11 July they met in London, together with Britten's musical assistant Imogen Holst. Britten told Ford that he had [...] "for some months or a year vaguely been thinking of doing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] miracle plays", and agreed to write an opera for A-R's 1958 summer term of school programmes. The subject would be Noah and the flood, based on the Chester text. Later, Ford and his script editor, Martin Worth, travelled to Aldeburgh, and with Britten looked at possible churches for the performance. The Church of St Bartholomew, Orford, was chosen as, unlike most other churches in East Suffolk, its pews were not fixed, thus offering a more flexible performing space.|$|E

ZsaZsa finds three dates for Fatboy, {{but none of them}} are genuine. Fatboy borrows Darren Miller's (Charlie G. Hawkins) ice cream van to practice for his driving test, which he fails, but he buys the van from Darren. He helps Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) sell T-shirts but sells them to Mo Harris (Laila Morse), who has been asked by Becca Swanson (Simone James) to buy them so she can sell them for a greater profit. Becca insists she did not know they were Whitney's and then flirts with Fatboy. However, he later humiliates her by designing T-shirts for her that show a mirror image of the word [...] "chav". He finally passes his driving test and DJs for Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) at R nightclub. Fatboy, Leon, ZsaZsa, Whitney, Lucy and Lucy's brother Peter (Thomas Law) go to Hampshire and he attends a party with Peter while the others spend time in the woods. He is reunited with Mercy but a fight breaks out so they escape and drive back to Fatboy's uncle's home. Peter hits <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> van and the next day they fear it was Leon, as he is missing. However, Leon turns up and they realise Lucy wanted to turn everyone against him, so they play a trick on her in revenge. Fatboy is then shocked to discover that Mercy is planning to move back to Nigeria. He realises that neither Mercy nor her grandmother Grace (Ellen Thomas) want to leave London, and convinces them to stay.|$|E

500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court!
