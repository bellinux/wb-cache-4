50|$|A quartz {{clock is}} a clock that uses an {{electronic}} oscillator that is regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time.

Recent trends have been toward applying computers {{not only for}} computational capabilities, but also for on-line control and data. acquisition from actual analytical instrumentation. Numerous analytical instruments are being designed to incorporate a computer system as an integral part. However it is possible, in many cases, to economically adapt existing instrumentation to a computer and gain the inherent advantages of on-line control, data acquisition, and rapid analysis of results. Reinbold and Pearson [1 described the modifications made to a Perkin-Elmer 141 polarimeter which enabled the acquisition of continuous optical rotatory dispersion data over the spectral region of 650 - 240 nanometers. The modifications basically consisted of replacing the existing light source of the Model 141 polarimeter with a double grating monochromator and a high intensity xenon light source. More recently, Simon and Pearson [2]. reported further modifications done to the Model 141 polarimeter system to convert it into a low cost recording spectropolarimeter. Their modifications include fitting the monochromator with a synchronous drive mechanism and coupling the Model 141 analyzer to a transmitting potentiometer for the continuous recording of optical rotatory dispersion spectra on a multi-speed, multi-millivolt strip chart recorder. In recent years, the Perkin-Elmer Model 141 polarimeter has been replaced on the market with a modernized Model 241 polarimeter.

50|$|Nautel's {{introduction}} of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> transmitter technology {{has had a}} large impact on the radio broadcast industry. As the benefits of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> technology became clear, the industry began to shift away {{from the use of}} tube transmitters and began to adopt the more reliable and efficient <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> designs. By the early 1990s <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> transmitters were being widely used in radio broadcasting, while sales of vacuum tube transmitters began to decline. Since its inception in 1969, Nautel has focused solely on <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> broadcast technology with a lineup of 100% <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> radio transmitters at power levels ranging from 300 W to over 1000 kW. With the July 10, 2014 shutdown of Larcan, Nautel is the only Canadian manufacturer of broadcast transmitters.|$|R
