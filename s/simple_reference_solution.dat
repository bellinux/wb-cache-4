40|$|In this paper, a {{solution}} of Two-Dimensional (2 D) Stokes flow problem, subject to Dirichlet and fluid traction boundary conditions, is developed based on the Non-singular Method of Fundamental Solutions (NMFS). The Stokes equation is decomposed into three coupled Laplace equations for modified components of velocity, and pressure. The solution {{is based on the}} collocation of boundary conditions at the physical boundary by the fundamental solution of Laplace equation. The singularities are removed by smoothing them on disks around them. The derivatives on the boundary in the singular points are calculated through <b>simple</b> <b>reference</b> <b>solutions.</b> In NMFS, no artificial boundary is needed, as in the classical Method of Fundamental Solutions (MFS). Numerical examples include driven cavity flow on a square, analytically solvable solution on a circle and channel flow on a rectangle. The accuracy of the results is assessed by comparison with the MFS solution, and analytical solutions. The main advantage of the approach is its simple, boundary only meshless character of the computations, and possibility of straightforward extension of the approach to Three-Dimensional (3 D) problems, moving boundary problems and inverse problems...|$|R

In this report comparisons {{with the results}} of the <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> are carried out. The results of DYN 3 D/R and the reference calculation for the eigenvalue keff and the power distribution are shown for the steady-state 3 -dimensional IAEA-Benchmark. The results of NEACRP-Benchmarks on control rod ejections in a standard PWR were compared with the <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> published by the NEA Data Bank. For assessing the accuracy of DYN 3 D/R results in comparison to other codes the deviations to the <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> are considered. Detailed comparisons with the published <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> of the NEA-NSC Benchmarks on uncontrolled withdrawal of control rods are made. The influence of the axial nodalization is also investigated. All in all, a good agreement of the DYN 3 D/R results with the <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> can be seen for the considered benchmark problems...|$|R

In this way, the detection time is also fixed for the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> {{and it does}} not change when changing the speed. The quality of the detection for the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> is just linear: by doubling {{the flooding}} interval also the detection time doubles, while the energy cost halves. Figure 4 (a) confirms our intuition: mobility with local cooperation can help computing global properties incurring in a small overhead.|$|R

40|$|There {{are very}} few <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> in the {{literature}} on non-Boussinesq natural convection flows. We propose here a test case problem which extends the well-known De Vahl Davis differentially heated square cavity problem to the case of large temperature differences for which the Boussinesq approximation is no longer valid. The paper is split in two parts: in this first part, we propose as yet unpublished <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> for cases characterized by a non-dimensional temperature difference of 0. 6, (constant property and variable property cases) and (variable property case). These <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> were produced after a first international workshop organized by CEA and LIMSI in January 2000, in which the above authors volunteered to produce accurate numerical solutions from which the present <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> could be established...|$|R

The proposed <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> permits to choose judiciously an appropriate mesh density for a MoM algorithm {{instead of using}} the ten-points-rule in all cases. Additionally, using the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> it is demonstrated that the discrepancy {{should not be used}} as a performance value of the scattering amplitude error while solving the EFIE with the MoM in L 2.

30|$|In this {{simulation}} scenario, for {{a reasonable}} speed of nodes, our protocol outperforms the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> Take, as an example, a flooding interval of 50 seconds. From Figure 4 (a), {{we can see}} that the detection time of the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> protocol is 5000 seconds. The performance of our protocol depends on the average speed of the system. If the average speed of the system is slow, for example, 5 [*]m/s, then the detection time is more than 6000 seconds. However, if the network nodes move faster, then our solution improves over the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> For instance, when the average speed is 20 [*]m/s, the detection time is as low as 1600 seconds, much faster than the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> From this experiment, {{it is also clear that}} the performance of our protocol depends on the average speed in the network: the faster the better. While the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> is an excellent solution for slow networks, for example, where nodes are carried by humans walking, our solution is the best for faster networks, and it is always the best when the energy overhead must be low. Now, we will switch cooperation on, and see that the performance of our protocol increases considerably, even though with some drawbacks when the energy budget is small.|$|R

This will allow new and existing visibility algorithms to be objectively tested. An accurate <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> was developed that employs an optimised ray casting algorithm to calculate visibility. Due to the excessive computational overhead in this calculations, a parallel implementation reduces the amount of time needed to produce the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> The benchmarker component determines the accuracy of the algorithm undergoing testing based on a number of image error metrics which take into account the quality of the final, rendered image.

40|$|Numerical {{convergence}} {{properties of}} a recently developed Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solver are {{compared to the}} ones of the widely used EVP model when solving the sea ice momentum equation with a Viscous-Plastic (VP) formulation. To do so, very accurate <b>reference</b> <b>solutions</b> are produced with an independent Picard solver with an advective time step of 10 s and a tight nonlinear convergence criterion on 10, 20, 40, and 80 km grids. Approximate solutions with the JFNK and EVP solvers are obtained for advective time steps of 10, 20 and 30 min. Because of an artificial elastic term, the EVP model permits an explicit time-stepping scheme with a relatively large subcycling time step. The elastic waves excited during the subcycling are intended to damp out and almost entirely disappear such that the approximate solution should {{be close to the}} VP solution. Results show that residual elastic waves cause the EVP approximate solution to have notable differences with the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> and that these differences get more important as the grid is refined. Compared to the <b>reference</b> <b>solution,</b> additional shear lines and zones of strong convergence/divergence are seen in the EVP approximate solution. The approximate solution obtained with the JFNK solver is very close to the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> for all spatial resolutions tested...|$|R
30|$|The mixture for {{reference}} membrane was prepared in analogous manner, {{except that the}} enzymes were replaced with BSA.

Immediately afterwards, we deposited the mixture of enzyme solution with GA on one pair of electrodes and the mixture of <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> with GA was placed on another one. The time of immobilization was 15  min; GA formed strong covalent bonds between the compounds of bioselective membrane, whereas the whole bioselective membrane was attached to the electrode surface through weak (i.e., Van der Waals) bonds. After immobilization, the electrodes were submerged in the working buffer for 15  min to wash out the unbound enzyme and GA excess.|$|R

3000|$|The main {{communication}} cost of {{both our}} protocol and the <b>reference</b> <b>solution</b> {{is the number}} of flooding.

To simplify our discussion, we assume that a network flooding corresponds to sending and to receiving a message by each network node. This is not always the case; actually, the load for broadcasting varies with different network parameters and the specific broadcasting protocol used [34]. However, this approximation is good enough to achieve our goal, that is, to show the qualitative improvement of our <b>solution</b> over the <b>reference</b> <b>solution.</b> To better appreciate the comparison with the reference solution—where a flooding occurs every time interval—in the following graphs, we report on the [...]...|$|R
