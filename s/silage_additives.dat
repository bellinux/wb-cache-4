40|$|Potassium sorbate is {{intended}} {{to be used as a}} technological additive to improve the ensiling process in the range of 90 to 300  mg/kg fresh material. The application of potassium sorbate in the preparation of silage up to the maximum proposed dose of 300  mg/kg forage is safe for the target animals. The additive, when used in silage, is not expected to increase substantially consumer exposure to potassium sorbate. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that potassium sorbate, when used as a <b>silage</b> <b>additive,</b> is safe for consumers of food products from animals fed treated silage. Potassium sorbate is a skin and eye irritant and a potential irritant to the respiratory tract. Potassium sorbate is not regarded as a skin sensitiser. The dusting potential of the preparation tested indicates that exposure of users via inhalation is possible. In view of the irritancy of potassium sorbate and the absence of information on its inhalation toxicity, exposure to such dust is considered hazardous.

There were four replicates per treatment and the silos were stored for 132 days. DIFF <b>silage</b> made without <b>additive</b> was poorly fermented. All additives increased the extent and improved the direction of DIFF silage fermentation, and reduced in-silo losses.

Agrobiogazownia power of 0. 6 MW, presented in this work {{is one of the}} first projects of its kind in the country and one of the most modern power plants in Europe. Using waste from animal production (manure, slurry and manure) and plant and <b>silage</b> <b>additive</b> produces clean energy, which is an additional source of farm income. The purpose of this study was to analyse the profitability of energy production in Agrobiogazownia based on substrates of agricultural origin, operating for the third year at least 75 % of heat energy produced, which showed good indicators of profitability and return on investment of 8. 7 years. The use of biogas substrates from the food industry will benefit from the revenues and profitability. Similarly, the ongoing work on the full use of the heat will allow an increase returns on investment...|$|R
40|$|An {{inoculant}} (Sila-bac) and a {{non-protein nitrogen}} (LSA- 100) <b>silage</b> <b>additive</b> were evaluated with whole-plant, forage sorghum silage. Sila-bac silage had the fastest temperature rise and peaked at 10 C above its initial temperature. LSA- 100 silage had a slow, steady temperature rise and reached {{a maximum of}} 22 C above its initial. Control silage peaked at 15 C above its initial. Steers fed LSA- 100 silage gained 7 to 9 % faster than did those fed control or Sila-bac silages. LSA- 100 silage was consumed in greatest amount; Sila-bac silage, in the least. The two additives improved feed efficiency by 3 % over the control. Both additives improved aerobic stability; control silage heated after 3 days; Sila-bac and LSA- 100 after 7. Dry matter recovery from the stave silos was similar for control (78. 1 %) and LSA- 100 silages (77. 3 %), but higher for Sila-bac silage (81. 2 %). When fermentation, storage, and feedout losses were combined with steer performance, pounds of gain per ton of ensiled forage were 88. 8 for Sila-bac, 84. 5 for LSA- 100, and 82. 6 for control silages...|$|R
