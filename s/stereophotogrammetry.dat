50|$|A special case, called <b>stereophotogrammetry,</b> {{involves}} {{estimating the}} three-dimensional coordinates of points on an object employing measurements made {{in two or}} more photographic images taken from different positions (see stereoscopy). Common points are identified on each image. A line of sight (or ray) can be constructed from the camera location to the point on the object. It is the intersection of these rays (triangulation) that determines the three-dimensional location of the point. More sophisticated algorithms can exploit other information about the scene that is known a priori, for example symmetries, in some cases allowing reconstructions of 3-D coordinates from only one camera position. <b>Stereophotogrammetry</b> is emerging as a robust non-contacting measurement technique to determine dynamic characteristics and mode shapes of non-rotating and rotating structures.|$|E

50|$|Experiments {{investigating}} {{the structure of}} animal aggregations seek to determine the 3D position of each animal within a volume at each point in time. It {{is important to know}} the internal structure of the group because that structure can be related to the proposed motivations for animal grouping. This capability requires the use of multiple cameras trained on the same volume in space, a technique known as <b>stereophotogrammetry.</b> When hundreds or thousands of animals occupy the study volume, it becomes difficult to identify each one. In addition, animals may block one another in the camera views, a problem known as occlusion. Once the location of each animal at each point in time is known, various parameters describing the animal group can be extracted.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{assessment}} is complete, {{the next step}} is a thorough measured survey with a tape, rod and level. Modern measuring techniques, such as photogrammetry (the use of aerial photographs to make maps and surveys) and <b>stereophotogrammetry,</b> are also used today to increase accuracy. Once the measurements are complete, there is an analysis of the structural stability of the building and its living pattern of movement. No building is permanently still; soil and wind can affect building stability and need to be documented. Finally, the architect or surveyor tests the electrical connections, plumbing, and other utilities present in the building (this is more for historic and re-purposed buildings). For both ancient and historic buildings, lightning conductors and fire-fighting equipment are checked to make sure they can provide sufficient protection.|$|E

50|$|Stereo {{triangulation}} is {{an application}} of <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> where the depth data of the pixels are determined from data acquired using a stereo or multiple-camera setup system.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if measurements of breast morphology computed from three-dimensional (3 D) <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> are equivalent to traditional anthropometric measurements obtained directly on a subject using a tape measure. 3 D torso images of 23 women ranged in age from 36 to 63 who underwent or were scheduled for breast reconstruction surgery were obtained using a 3 dMD torso system (3 Q Technologies Inc., Atlanta, GA). Two different types (contoured and line-of-sight distances) of a total of nine distances were computed from 3 D images of each participant. Each participant was photographed twice, first without fiducial points marked (referred to as unmarked image) and second with fiducial points marked prior to imaging (referred to as marked image). <b>Stereophotogrammetry</b> was compared to traditional direct anthropometry, in which measurements were taken with a tape measure on participants. Three statistical analyses were used to evaluate the agreement between <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> and direct anthropometry. Seven out of nine distances showed excellent agreement between <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> and direct anthropometry (both marked and unmarked images). In addition, <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> from the unmarked image was equivalent to that of the marked image (both line-of-sight and contoured distances). A lower level of agreement was observed for some measures because of difficulty in localizing more vaguely defined fiducial points, such as lowest visible point of breast mound, and inability of the imaging system in capturing areas obscured by the breast, such as the inframammary fold. <b>Stereophotogrammetry</b> from 3 D images obtained from the 3 dMD torso system is effective for quantifying breast morphology.

40|$|Objectives Volume is an {{important}} feature {{in the evaluation of}} hypertrophic scars and keloids. Three-dimensional (3 D) <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> is a noninvasive technique for the measurement of scar volume. This study evaluated {{the reliability and validity of}} 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> for measuring scar volume. Study Design and Setting To evaluate reliability, 51 scars were photographed by two observers. Interobserver reliability was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the measurement error was expressed as limits of agreement (LoA). To assess validity, 60 simulated (clay) scars were measured by 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> and subsequently weighed (gold standard). The correlation of volumes obtained by both measures was calculated by a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and the measurement error was expressed as a 95 % prediction interval. Results The ICC was 0. 99, corresponding to a high correlation of measurements between two observers, although the LoA were relatively wide. The correlation between 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> and the gold standard was also high, with a CCC of 0. 97. Again, the plot of the differences and LoA showed moderate agreement for the validity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Upper-extremity {{lymphedema}} is {{a frequent}} complication in patients treated for breast cancer. Current diagnostic methods for the upper-extremity volume measurements are cumbersome or time consuming. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the validity and reliability of three-dimensional (3 D) <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> for volume measurements in patients with upper-extremity lymphedema. METHOD: Patients with unilateral upper-extremity lymphedema were included. The water displacement volume measurement of both arms was performed using a standardized method. In addition, 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> volume measurements were conducted. RESULTS: Eleven patients (22 arms) were included. The mean volumes obtained by 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> and water displacement show a high correlation, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0. 99 (p = 0. 01). The variance calculated by 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> measurements (205 mL) was statistically significant less than that obtained via water displacement measurements (1540 mL) (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> is an accurate method for measuring upper-extremity volume in patients with lymphedema and gives a lower variance value compared to that of the water displacement measurements.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pre- and {{postoperative}} imaging {{is important and}} essential for {{evaluation of the results}} of rhinoplasty surgery. Two-dimensional photographs are used routinely for this purpose, but have several disadvantages as opposed to three-dimensional imaging techniques, such as <b>stereophotogrammetry.</b> This study is the first to describe the measurement of rhinoplasty results using <b>stereophotogrammetry.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the ability of 3 D imaging to measure and objectify rhinoplasty results. METHODS: During a 6 -month period all consecutive hump reduction patients were included in this prospective study. Pre- {{and postoperative}} 3 D photographs were taken and compared. RESULTS: Twelve patients were studied. In ten of these twelve patients a significant volume reduction in the area of the nasal dorsum was found with <b>stereophotogrammetry.</b> The maximum decrease (i. e. lowering) of the nasal dorsum ranged from 0. 8 to 4. 4 mm. In two patients no reduction of the nasal dorsum was found. In both patients this was due to additional changes made to the nose during surgery.

40|$|Background: Objective {{evaluation}} of the scar property volume, improves our ability to quantitatively compare the response to therapeutic methods, and allows monitoring of an individual patient. Current techniques for measuring volume {{are known to be}} subjective, invasive or cumbersome, and are often not tested for their clinimetric properties such as reliability and validity. 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> is a potential non-invasive technique for the measurement of volume. Therefore, the aim of this study was testing {{the reliability and validity of}} 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> for measuring scar volume. Material and Methods: A total of 51 scars (hypertrophic scars and keloids) of 31 patients were recruited from the scar outpatient clinics in the Red Cross Hospital in Beverwijk and the VU Medical Centre in Amsterdam. To test the reliability, the scars were photographed by two observers. Also, a total of 60 simulated (clay) scars were applied on three different body sites of 20 volunteers (upper leg, lower arm and thorax). These scars were measured by 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> and subsequently weighed to establish a gold standard and test the validity. Results: The reliability of 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> was expressed by an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0. 991, corresponding to the correlation of measurements between two observers. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to express the relative measurement and was found to be 15 %. Data were plotted to visualize the difference between the observers and the limits of agreement were calculated at 0 ± 0. 289 x Mean Volume. The correlation between 3 D <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> and the gold standard was also found to be high: ICC of 0. 979. Conclusion: 3 D stereophotogrametry is a reliable and valid method for measuring scar volume, expressed by the ICC.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{surface area}} of scars is an {{important}} outcome parameter in scar assessment. It {{is often used to}} quantify the extent of scar features, such as pigmentation disturbances, hypertrophy, and contracture. Currently available techniques for measuring the surface area are known to be cumbersome or do not meet the basic clinimetric criteria (i. e., reliability and validity). Three-dimensional <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> is a technique that may improve the quality of surface area measurements. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the reliability and validity of three-dimensional <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> for measuring scar surface area. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, two independent clinicians photographed and measured 50 scar areas of 32 patients using a handheld stereographic camera, to assess reliability. Subsequently, using planimetry, the scar surface was traced on a transparent sheet (considered the accepted standard) to assess validity. RESULTS: Three-dimensional <b>stereophotogrammetry</b> showed good reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 99 and a coefficient of variation of 6. 8 percent. To visualize the differences between the two observers, data were plotted and the limits of agreement were calculated at 0 ± 0. 19 × mean surface area. Also, excellent validity was found, with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0. 99.

The patients had received immediate unilateral breast reconstruction after mastectomy by the extended latissimus dorsi flap and without contra-lateral surgery. In order to capture the whole breast shape including the infra mammary fold, the patients {{were introduced to the}} imaging room and leaned over the imaging rig to open up the infra mammary fold and to expose the entire area of each breast. The imaging system consisted of eight high-resolution (4504 3000 pixels) digital cameras and four flash units.
