5|$|Quinn and Finn go {{together}} for her ultrasound appointment, and {{they learn that}} she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to be supportive, suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is annoyed at his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own baby on the ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the <b>sonogram</b> using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her. Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will be kicked of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|An echocardiogram, often {{referred}} to as a cardiac echo or simply an echo, is a <b>sonogram</b> of the heart. (It is not abbreviated as ECG, because that is an abbreviation for an electrocardiogram.)

40|$|Biliary pseudolithiasis {{has been}} {{reported}} in patients who received ceftriaxone therapy. To examine this phenomenon further, serial gallbladder <b>sonograms</b> were evaluated in 44 adult patients who received intravenous ceftriaxone at 2 g or a placebo daily for 14 days in a double-blind controlled study. Ultrasound examinations of gallbladders were performed on days 1 and 14 of therapy and 2 weeks posttherapy if abnormalities were observed on day 14. Eight patients were unevaluable because of abnormal base-line gallbladder <b>sonograms.</b> Thirty-six patients (ceftriaxone, n = 28; placebo, n = 8) demonstrated normal baseline gallbladder <b>sonograms</b> and were evaluated for the development of change. A total of 6 of 28 (21. 4 %) ceftriaxone-treated patients and 1 of 8 (12. 5 %) patients who received the placebo demonstrated abnormal gallbladder <b>sonograms</b> on day 14 (P = 0. 491). Four of the six ceftriaxone-treated patients demonstrating abnormal <b>sonograms</b> were clinically asymptomatic, while two patients reported vomiting. The abnormal <b>sonograms</b> of gallbladders of patients treated with ceftriaxone returned to normal between 9 and 26 days posttherapy. These data suggest an association between ceftriaxone treatment and the development of gallbladder abnormalities on ultrasound examination which resolve spontaneously on discontinuation of ceftriaxone therapy...|$|R

25|$|The use of spectrograms to {{visualize}} bird song {{was first introduced}} by Donald J. Borror and developed further by others including W. H. Thorpe. These visual representations are also called sonograms or sonagrams. Beginning in 1983, some field guides for birds use sonograms to document the calls and songs of birds. The <b>sonogram</b> is objective, unlike descriptive phrases, but proper interpretation requires experience. Sonograms can also be roughly converted back into sound.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{as part of}} the National Bat Monitoring Programme, BCT {{began the}} first {{systematic}} UK-wide survey of Nathusius’ pipistrelles in order to improve knowledge of the distribution of this species. Nathusius’ pipistrelle is considered to be rare in the UK but is widespread and may be under-recorded in some areas. As this species is often found at large water bodies, particularly during the autumn migration period, the survey involves surveying lakes twice during September, and making audio recordings from broadband bat detectors in order to verify Nathusius’ pipistrelle calls through <b>sonogram</b> analysis.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Representative Callegari {{supported}} {{the ban on}} abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents said {{could lead to the}} closure of many abortion clinics in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, Callegari did not vote on two other anti-abortion measures. One forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions. The other requires that a woman undergo a <b>sonogram</b> before procuring an abortion. This legislation is based on the view that a woman could change her mind about an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. The Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Callegari 41 percent favorable in 2013, 72 percent in 2011, and 100 percent in 2005. The National Abortion Rights Action League rated him 9 percent in 2005.|$|E

We aimed to determine the prevalence of RPWT and whether persistent RPWT related to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Materials and methodsWe retrospectively reviewed sonographic findings of RPWT {{in children and adolescents}} referred for renal ultrasound study from January 2010 to December 2011. A total of 502 patients showing RPWT were included, 372 of whom received follow-up <b>sonograms.</b> Among them, 86 children underwent both follow-up <b>sonograms</b> and voiding cystourethrography studies. The association between persistent RPWT and VUR was analyzed. ResultsA total of 602 <b>sonograms</b> with RPWT were identified, accounting for a prevalence of 11. 4 %. Follow-up <b>sonograms,</b> revealing that these patients had recovered from RPWT, was found in 93. 7 % (459 / 490) of renal units and in 92. 7 % (345 / 372) of the patients. Children with persistent RPWT had a strong association with VUR occurrence (p =  0. 018) and high VUR grading (p =  0. 006) compared to those without persistent RPWT.

40|$|In this study, to {{complement}} our previously proposed method for estimating muscle fiber orientation, the Gabor filter bank (GF) technique {{was applied to}} <b>sonograms</b> of the biceps and forearm muscles to longitudinally enhance the coherently oriented and hyperechoic perimysiums regions. The method involved three steps: orientation field estimation, frequency map computation and Gabor filtering. The method was evaluated using a simulated image distorted with multiplicative speckle noises where the "muscles" were arranged in a bipennate fashion with an "aponeurosis" located in the middle. After enhancement using the GF approach, most of the original hyperechoic bands in the simulated image could be recovered. The proposed method was also tested using a group of biceps and forearm muscle <b>sonograms</b> collected from healthy adult subjects. Compared with the <b>sonograms</b> without enhancement, the enhanced images led to the detection of more linear patterns including muscle fascicles and smaller angle differences compared with the mean of manual results from two operators, therefore, were better prepared for the automatic estimation of muscle fiber orientation. The proposed method {{has the potential of}} assisting in the visualization of strongly oriented patterns in skeletal muscle <b>sonograms</b> {{as well as in the}} semi-automatic estimation of muscle fiber orientations.

Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, Madonna as Postmodern Myth, that her [...] "straggly, expensively unwashed look" [...] was {{comparable to that of}} singer Alanis Morissette and to Venetian paintings. According to Madonna she went for an Italian Renaissance look, invoking work of painter Raphael and Botticelli.

The book recalled how Madonna [...] "quickly grew tired of the Botticelli-Earth Mother phase" [...] with subsequent singles being promoted with a new Asian inspired look. In the book Ex-foliations: Reading Machines and the Upgrade Path, author Terry Harpold commented about the time-lapse sequences, especially the image of a clock and its hands rotating past the hours.

40|$|Summary: Kimura {{disease is}} a rare chronic {{inflammatory}} disorder mimicking malignancy. Nodes {{are present in the}} submental and submandibular regions, within the parotid gland, and in the upper cervical chain. On gray scale sono-grams, they are hypoechoic and round, with normal hilar architecture and homogeneous internal echoes. On power Doppler <b>sonograms,</b> the nodes show prominent intranodal vessels with a hilar pattern and low intranodal resistance. The soft tissue and parotid lesions also show low-resistance vascularity within. Kimura {{disease is a}} chronic inflammatory dis-order of unknown origin that mimics a malignant lesion both clinically and on images (1). It is, how-ever, a benign condition, and the prognosis is good, even with conservative treatment. Although there are reports of the appearances of Kimura disease on CT scans (2) and MR images (3), there is scant information in the literature regarding gray scale (1) and power Doppler sonography of Kimura dis-ease. This report documents the appearances of Ki-mura disease on gray scale and power Doppler <b>sonograms.</b> On power Doppler <b>sonograms,</b> normal nodes show hilar vascularity (Fig 1) and malignant nodes have a more variable appearance...|$|R
