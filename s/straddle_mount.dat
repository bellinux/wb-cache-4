5000|$|The John Deere 5220 Tractor is a utility/agricultural tractor {{produced}} by John Deere, designed for residential and farming use. Manufactured from 2000-2004, {{it has a}} 3 cylinder, [...] engine which produces [...] of torque at 2400 rpm. It was available in 2wd or Mechanical Front Wheel Drive (4wd) and has a rear hitch capacity of 3400 lb.

5000|$|The pinion is {{supported}} both {{in front of}} and behind the pinion teeth, an arrangement {{often referred to as}} [...] "straddle mounting". <b>Straddle</b> <b>mounting</b> greatly reduces pinion deflection under high torque loads, conferring increased longevity and torque capacity. The pinion is also removable from the back as well making for easier access.|$|R
40|$|A {{reliability}} {{model is}} presented for bevel gear reductions {{with either a}} single input pinion or dual input pinions of equal size. The dual pinions {{may or may not}} have the same power applied for the analysis. The gears may be <b>straddle</b> <b>mounted</b> or supported in a bearing quill. The reliability model is based on the Weibull distribution. The reduction's basic dynamic capacity is defined as the output torque which may be applied for one million output rotations of the bevel gear with a 90 percent probability of reduction survival...|$|R
50|$|The Little Sur River and its South Fork {{tributary}} {{comprise a}} 25.4 mi long river on the Central Coast of California. They drain a watershed of about 40 sq mi of the Big Sur area, a thinly settled {{region of the}} Central California coast where the Santa Lucia Mountains rise abruptly from the Pacific Ocean. The South Fork and the North Fork both have their headwaters in the Ventana Wilderness, <b>straddling</b> <b>Mount</b> Pico Blanco. Portions west of the national forest and Old Coast Road lie within the El Sur Ranch. The forks converge about 2 mi before the river empties into the Pacific Ocean.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{right angle}} gear drive design where helical and spiral bevel gears are being used. Because of the high speed ratio (1800 / 18, input/output), three {{reductions}} were applied. Two helical gear sets {{were used in the}} first and second reductions (one each), and a spiral bevel set was used at the final reduction. The gears were mounted on four shafts, with the first and last shafts (output and input shafts) carrying one gear each <b>straddle</b> <b>mounted,</b> and the second and third shafts carrying two gears each, overhung mounted. The design was based on a criterion that was set for every element and was carried out in sequence; i. e. gears, shafts, bearings and housing. The high speed shaft and the bevel pinion shaft were made one piece with the pinions. The housing was made out of three parts: The main housing, which is to house the bevel gear set and to hold the oil; the high speed housing, which is to house the high speed helical gear set and support the high speed bearings; and the rear cover, which is to house the intermediate gear set (second reduction) ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 54) Modern {{high performance}} machinery almost always operates {{at a speed}} in excess {{of at least one}} critical speed. In many cases, the vibrations of important components are difficult or impossible to damp at a critical, yet the machinery must be brought up to the operating point with safety and reliability. Studies have been made during the last 50 years mathematically quantifying the fact that rapid acceleration in rotational speed through a critical does not allow time for destructive vibrations to build up beyond a permissible limit. Previous investigators have largely confined their mathematical investigations to the Jeffcott Rotor, that is, the simple <b>straddle</b> <b>mounted</b> rotor mass between two simple supports. This investigation extends the above results to the case of the overhung rotor, such as is commonly encountered in turbines. As a departure from the Jeffcott Rotor, whose natural frequency is obtained in dynamics of machinery, three kinds of methods were used to deal with the general critical speed and deflection problem, with the effects of gyroscopic, empirical formulas, a deduced quadratic equation, and analytical solutions all being employed. The second is recommended, emphatically. It is shown that considerable Gyroscopic stiffening is possible in the case of forward synchronous precession, and that the consequent elevation of the apparent critical speed and suppression of amplitude buildup can be related to proportions and unbalance by the results of a computer solution of several simultaneous non-linear differential equations. These results are presented in non-dimensional form, in simple curves to guide design...|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of November 24, Forrest's cavalry drove Capron's men through Cox's line south of Columbia and began probing attacks {{in an attempt to}} break through. The line <b>straddled</b> the <b>Mount</b> Pleasant Pike (present day U.S. Route 43) just north of Bigby Creek and then {{continued}} eastward across the Pulaski Pike into the town, curving northward toward the river. By November 25, this line was supplemented with an interior line that roughly encompassed the entire residential area of Columbia. The Confederates bombarded the lines with artillery and a number of skirmishes occurred, but it became apparent to the Union defenders that only a single infantry division with some dismounted cavalry were participating in the attacks and that Hood was merely demonstrating, intending to cross the Duck River either upstream or downstream and cut off the Union force from Thomas, who was assembling the remainder of his force in Nashville.|$|R
