40|$|Three basic bridge {{protection}} schemes were investigated: Rigid passive overhead device, ● Nonrigid passive overhead device, and ● Active {{detection and}} warning system. The first <b>scheme</b> <b>investigated</b> {{was the use}} of an immovable, rigid crossbeam across the road. Thecrossbeam would beset at the clearance of the bridge, and an overweight vehicle would strike the beam, thus warning the driver that the truck wastoohigh for the bridge. Such devices have been used in the past in other states, but, because of their extreme liability, this method was not seriously considered. Inaddition to possible damage to the overheight truck, vehicles traveling behind a log truck are in danger from logs that could be knocked off the truck by the crossbeam. The second <b>scheme</b> <b>investigated</b> {{was the use of}} passive overhead devices that are not rigid and destructive. In some states, items such as chains have been suspended from a span wire in advance of low-clearance obstructions. The noise of the chain striking the top of the overweight vehicle is intended to warn the driver without causing significant damage to the vehicle. However, it was felt that passive overhead devices could not adequately warn the driver of a loud log truck with an overheight load. The third <b>scheme</b> <b>investigated</b> was a system utilizing infrared beam devices located in advance of the bridge, which would detect the overweight vehicle and warn the driver through means of audible bells and/or warning signs with flashing beacons. This scheme was selected for implementation. Warning System Components A system to detect and warn overheight vehicles was designed that incorporated the following five basic parts: ● Advance warning signs of the height restriction, A device to detect overheight vehicles, ● Audible alarm bells that are activated when an overheight vehicle is detected, ● Overhead warning signs with flashing yellow beacons that are activated when an overheight vehicle is detected, an...|$|R

40|$|Intermediate {{temperature}} SOFC components, such as dense, nanostructured SDC electrolytes (samarium doped ceria) and porous anode sublayers were fabricated by suspension {{plasma spraying}} using an axial feed dc plasma torch. The liquid carrier employed {{in this approach}} allowed for controlled injection of much finer particles than in conventional thermal spraying, leading to thin coatings with a refined microstructure. Dense, thin (< 10 (m) and non-fractured electrolytes were created. Various processing routes for SOFC half-cells, using tape-cased, plasmasprayed and suspension-sprayed anodes, were explored. Loss of integrity and non-continuous coverage of the anode constituted the principal difficulties in the subsequent electrolyte deposition.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} discretization schemes for the convection term in the constitutive equation on numerical solutions of viscoelastic fluid flows. For this purpose, a temporally evolving mixing layer, a two-dimensional vortex pair interacting with a wall, and a fully developed turbulent channel flow are selected as test cases, and eight different discretization schemes are considered. Among them, the first-order upwind difference scheme (UD) and artificial diffusion scheme (AD), which are commonly used in the literature, show most stable and smooth solutions even for highly extensional flows. However, the stress fields are smeared too much by these schemes and the corresponding flow fields are quite different from those obtained by higher-order upwind difference schemes. Among higher-order upwind difference <b>schemes</b> <b>investigated</b> in this study, a third-order compact upwind difference scheme (CUD 3) with locally added AD shows stable and most accurate solutions for highly extensional flows even at relatively high Weissenberg numbers. 2001 Elsevier Science B.
