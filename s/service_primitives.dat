Since the protocol {{is seen as}} the logical implementation of the service, one can ask whether it is possible to formally derive the specification of a protocol providing a given service. This paper addresses this question and presents an algorithm for deriving a protocol specification from a given service specification. It is assumed that services are described by expressions, where names identifying both <b>service</b> <b>primitives</b> and previously defined services are composed using operators for sequence, parallelism and alternative.

To verify that IIOP operates correctly, {{it is important}} to define the services it should provide to the interworking ORBs. An international standard, ISO/IEC 14752, defines a set of interworking facilities, three of which are used to define the service of IIOP. Each of these facilities is defined in isolation by a set of <b>service</b> <b>primitives,</b> and their sequences at each local interface. This paper shows how these facilities may be combined to provide a partial service specification, that does not define the global sequences of primitives.

As a result, the reliability of the multicast/broadcast service is reduced due to the increased probability of lost frames resulting from interference or collisions. In this paper, we propose a reliable Batch Mode Multicast MAC protocol, BMMM, which substentially reduces the number of contention phases, thus considerably reduces the time required for a multicast/broadcast. We then propose a Location Aware Multicast MAC protocol, LAMM, that uses station location information to further improve upon BMMM.

40|$|The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an {{important}} transport layer protocol providing a reliable data transfer service to support many applications running over the Internet such as the World Wide Web. It is therefore important to define the intent of TCP. This is achieved by describing the services {{it is intended to}} provide in an abstract way, known as a service definition. Several {{attempts have been made to}} define the services provided by TCP, however, they are all inadequate in various ways. In particular, most of them follow the applications interface defined in the TCP Request for Comments (P&C 793) too closely, making them rather implementation specific. The aim of our work is to provide an appropriately abstract definition of the TCP service, following the guidance of the Open Systems Interconnection service conventions, and to make it as general and as complete as possible. We define the service in terms of a set of 15 <b>service</b> <b>primitives</b> and their sequences, for TCP's main features of connection establishment, data transfer, urgent data transfer, orderly connection release, and aborting connections. The choice of primitives is discussed in terms of their relationship with the Interface Definition of RFC 793.
