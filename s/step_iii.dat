50|$|The Weiss and Cook {{synthesis}} pathways {{consists of}} 5 steps {{starting with the}} condensation of 2 moles of dimethyl-1,3-acetonedicarboxylate and a α-dicarbonyl compound. This reaction is catalyzed by aqueous methanol and afford a high yield of 80%. The product of this is then undergo decarboxylation in step II to remove the carboxylate functional group and allow {{the formation of a}} cis-bicyclo3.3.0octa-3,7-dione. Step II is a multiple synthesis step where the compound from previous step is hydrolyze and decarboxylate through the treatment of series of reagent going from reagents b through e.

Alternative reagent for this step is sodium tert-amylate, DME and Methyl iodide.|$|E

5000|$|SeSaM {{has been}} {{developed}} in order to overcome several of the major limitations encountered when working with standard mutagenesis methods based on simple error-prone PCR (epPCR) techniques. These epPCR techniques rely {{on the use of}} polymerases and thus encounter limitations which mainly result from the circumstance that only single, but very rarely consecutive, nucleic acid substitutions are performed and that these substitutions occur usually at specific, favored positions only. In addition, transversions of nucleic acids are much less likely than transitions and require specifically designed polymerases with an altered bias. These characteristics of epPCR catalyzed nucleic acid exchanges together {{with the fact that the}} genetic code is degenerated decrease the resulting diversity on the amino acid level. Synonymous substitutions lead to amino acid preservation or conservative mutations with similar physico-chemical properties such as size and hydrophobicity are strongly prevalent. By non-specific introduction of universal bases at every position in the gene sequence, SeSaM overcomes the polymerase bias favoring transitory substitutions at specific positions but opens the complete gene sequence to a diverse array of amino acid exchanges. During the development of the SeSaM-method, several modifications were introduced that allowed for the introduction of several mutations simultaneously. Another advancement of the method was achieved by introduction of degenerate bases instead of universal inosine and the use of optimized DNA polymerases, further increasing the ratio of introduced transversions. This modified SeSaM-Tv+ method in addition allows for and favors the introduction of two consecutive nucleotide exchanges, broadening strongly the spectrum of amino acids that may be substituted. By several optimizations including the application of an improved chimera polymerase in <b>Step</b> <b>III</b> of the SeSaM-Tv-II method [...] and the addition of an alternative degenerate nucleotide for efficient substitution of thymine and cytosine bases and increased mutation frequency in SeSaM-P/R, generated libraries were further improved with regard to transversion number and the number of consecutive mutations was raised to 2-4 consecutive mutations with a rate of consecutive mutations of up to 30%.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{oxidative}} folding of synthetic polypeptides assembled by stepwise solid phase synthesis is introduced. Folding is obtained in excellent yields by reacting S-tert-butylthiolated polypeptides with a 100 -fold molar excess of cysteine at 37 degrees C {{in a slightly}} alkaline buffer containing chaotropic salts, and {{in the presence of}} air-oxygen. This novel protocol has been applied to the folding of S-tert-butylthiolated human thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (hu-TARC) derivatives as well as to larger segments of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite proteins. Folded P. falciparum polypeptides have been used as substrates of endoproteinase Glu-C (Glu-C) and endoproteinase Asp-N (Asp-N) in an attempt to identify their disulfide connectivities. Particular practical advantages of the present method are (i) easy purification and storage of the S-protected peptide derivatives, (ii) elimination of the risk of cysteine alkylation during the acidolytic cleavage deprotection and resin cleavage <b>steps,</b> (<b>iii)</b> possibility to precisely evaluate the extent of folding and disulfide bond formation by mass spectrometry, and (iv) facile recovery of the final folded product...|$|R
