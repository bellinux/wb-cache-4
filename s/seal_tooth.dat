40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the dress code}} during the Pitted Ware culture on the Swedish island of Gotland. Eight Pitted Ware grave-fields have been analyzed; only 74 skeletons have been identified {{with some sort of}} ornament that could have been attached to clothes. The grave-fields are rich in finds and in people nearly every age group is present. The analysis has shown that there are clear differences between the genders. The female always has some sort of <b>seal</b> <b>tooth</b> ornament around her waist and thighs. The man has sometimes tusks from wild boar and tubular bones as an ornament on his clothes. The children have all of the ornaments that the parents have but in smaller numbers. There are also other finds that appear on all of the individuals, but the tusks, <b>seal</b> <b>tooth</b> and tubular bones are the ones that appear on nearly every individual. The North American Indians clothing {{has been used as a}} reference to help understand the clothing of the Pitted Ware. So far all of the finds that have been found on the skeletons have shown great diversity in the Pitted Ware clothing...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} NASA Contract NAS 3 - 25950 Task 23 was to numerically {{investigate}} the flow through an axial compressor inner-banded stator seal cavity. The Allison/NASA developed ADPAC code {{was used to}} obtain all flow predictions. Flow through a labyrinth stator seal cavity of a high-speed compressor was modeled by coupling the cavity flow path and the main flow path of the compressor. A grid resolution study was performed to guarantee adequate grid spacing was used. Both unsteady rotor-stator-rotor interactions and steady-state isolated blade calculations were performed with and without the seal cavity present. A parameterized seal cavity study of the high-speed stator seal cavity collected a series of solutions for geometric variations. The parameter list included <b>seal</b> <b>tooth</b> gap, cavity depth, wheel speed, radial mismatch of hub flowpath, axial trench gap, hub corner treatments, and land edge treatments.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of mammalian teeth {{is characterized by}} the frequent and convergent {{evolution of}} new cusps. The evolution of new cusps can be linked to tooth development via population-level variation. This allows testing whether development increases the capacity to evolve, or evolvability, by facilitating and even directing morphological change. In a population sample of living seals, variation in cusp number of individual teeth is from three to five cusps, the variably present cusps being the shortest ones that also develop last. By factoring in recent evidence on development, I show that the variation in cusp number can be explained by a patterning cascade mode of cusp development that cumulatively increases and directs height variation in short cusps. The biased variation in <b>seal</b> <b>tooth</b> cusps supports the recognition of teeth as highly evolvable because only small developmental changes are needed to produce large changes in size and number of small cusps. This evolvability of tooth cusps may have facilitated the fast and independent acquisition of new cusps in mammalian evolution. In phylogenetic studies, small cusps may be unreliable as phylogenetic signals. Population level variation can be a powerful tool in testing and generating hypotheses in developmental evolution studies...|$|E

It is composed of Portland cement and Bismuth trioxide. ObjectiveTo analyze and compare with PIXE, DSC, TGA and DRX elementary chemical and phase composition of MTA Angelus® cement with a white Portland cement (WPC). Material and methodsMTA Angelus® white and a white Portland cement were analyzed with PIXE in a particle accelerator, phase analyses were conducted with XRD contrasting peaks with those in the ICDD database. DSC was conducted in a calorimeter up to 900 oC. ResultsPIXE detected the following as greater percentage elements: aluminum, silica and calcium for both cements. Differences were found with sulfur percentages; Bismuth was only detected in MTA Angelus®. Trace elements of copper and strontium were detected in MTA Angelus® and zirconium in WPC. Relationship between silica-calcium and silica-aluminum was similar in both cements. In both cements, three crystalline phases were detected: dicalcium silicate, tricalcium silicate and tricalcium aluminate. Nevertheless, Bismite was identified in MTA Angelus® and calcium sulfate in the form of gypsum in WPC, this was corroborated with DSC technique.

40|$|A seal is a {{component}} {{used in a}} turbomachine to reduce internal leakage of the working fluid and to increase the machine's efficiency. The stability of a turbomachine partially depends upon the rotodynamic coefficients of the seal. The integral control volume based rotodynamic coefficient prediction programs are no more accurate than {{the accuracy of the}} leakage mass flow rate estimation. Thus an accurate prediction of the mass flow rate through seals is extremely important, especially for rotodynamic analysis of turbomachinery. For labyrinth seals, which are widely used, the energy dissipation is achieved by a series of constrictions and cavities. When the fluid flows through the constriction (under each tooth), a part of the pressure head is converted into kinetic energy, which is dissipated through small scale turbulence-viscosity interaction in the cavity that follows. Therefore, a leakage flow rate prediction equation can be developed by comparing the seal to a series of orifices and cavities. Using this analogy, the mass flow rate is modeled {{as a function of the}} flow coefficient under each tooth and the carry over coefficient, which accounts for the turbulent dissipation of kinetic energy in a cavity. This work, based upon FLUENT CFD simulations, initially studies the influence of flow parameters, in addition to geometry, on the carry over coefficient of a cavity, developing a better model for the same. It is found that the Reynolds number and clearance to pitch ratios have a major influence and tooth width has a secondary influence on the carry over coefficient and models for the same were developed for a generic rectangular tooth on stator labyrinth seal. The discharge coefficient of the labyrinth <b>seal</b> <b>tooth</b> (with the preceding cavity) was found to be a function of the discharge coefficient of a single tooth (with no preceding cavity) and the carry over coefficient. The discharge coefficient of a single tooth is established as a function of the Reynolds number and width to clearance ratio of the tooth and a model for the same is developed. It is also verified that this model describes the discharge coefficient of the first tooth in the labyrinth seal. By comparing the coefficients of discharge of compressible flow to that of incompressible flow at the same Reynolds number, the expansion factor was found to depend only upon the pressure ratio and ratio of specific heats. A model for the same was developed. Thus using the developed models, it is possible to compute the leakage mass flow rate as well as the axial distribution of cavity pressure across the seal for known inlet and exit pressures. The model is validated against prior experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} shape and {{configuration}} of dental crown, especially its biting surface with numerous pits and fissures permanent molars are suitable sites for retaining food remnants and bacteria. For this reason, preventive efforts and early prophylactic procedures should prevent {{the development of}} caries at these critical sites.

40|$|This study investigates {{a method}} of {{designing}} a simplified cylindrical shell model. This model accurately predicts the dynamic characteristics of a prototype cylindrical shell with <b>sealing</b> <b>teeth</b> accurately. The significance {{of this study is}} that it provides an acceptable process which guides the design of test models. Firstly, an equivalent cylindrical shell with rectangular rings is designed by combining the energy equation and numerical analysis. Then the transfer matrixes of the stiffened cylindrical shell and the cylindrical shell are employed to calculate the equivalent thickness of the simplified cylindrical shell commonly used in model tests. Further, the equivalent thicknesses are normalized by introducing an average equivalent thickness. The distorted scaling laws and size applicable intervals are investigated to reduce the errors caused by the normalization. Finally, a 42 CrMo cylindrical shell with <b>sealing</b> <b>teeth</b> is used as a prototype and a number 45 steel scaled-down cylindrical shell is used as a distorted test model. The accuracy of the prediction is verified by using experimental data, and the results indicate that the distorted model can predict the characteristics of the stiffened cylindrical shell prototype with good accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: The null-hypothesis that {{retention}} {{loss of resin}} fissure sealants predicts caries manifestation no {{more accurately}} than random values was tested. Methods: Systematic reviews were checked and electronic databases searched for clinical trials. Trials reporting on the re-tention of resin sealants and caries occurrence in permanent molar teeth, with minimum 24 -month follow-up period, were included. Extracted data: number of <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth,</b> number of teeth without completely retained sealants, number of <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> with caries. The number of teeth with complete sealant retention and absence of carious lesions/cavities was calcu-lated; the predictive outcomes: true/false positive; false/true negative were established. Random values were generated as control-data. Diagnostic Odds ratios (DOR) were computed and tested for statistical difference. Summary Receiver Oper-ating Characteristic curves were plotted. Results: 95 trials were found. Median DOR values were 1. 21 and 0. 28 for test- and control data, respectively. Wilcoxon test (z = 0. 56; p = 0. 58) and Sign test (z = 1. 38; p = 0. 17) results were statistically non-significant. The null-hypothesis was not rejected. Conclusions: Predictions based on the retention loss of resin sealants, regarding caries manifestation, was no more accu-rate than random guesses.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the oral health, {{including}} dental decay experience and use of fissure sealants, of Australian children examined by school dental service staff in 2008. The findings are drawn from the 2008 Child Dental Health Survey (CDHS), from which the data of 63, 870 children aged 6 - 12 from all states and territories, except New South Wales and Victoria, were extracted and analysed. Deciduous teeth  Approximately 52 % of children aged 6 had experienced decay in deciduous (baby) teeth, with 1 or more decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth (dmft). On average, children aged 6 had more than 2 dmft. The 10 % of children aged 6 who had the most extensive history of deciduous tooth decay had almost 10 deciduous teeth affected. This was more than 4 times the average at age 6. Permanent teeth  Among 12 -year-old children, 45. 3 % had experienced decay in their permanent teeth with 1 or more decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMFT). On average, 12 -year-old children had just over 1 affected tooth (mean DMFT = 1. 11). The 10 % of children aged 12 who had the most extensive history of permanent tooth decay had 5. 03 permanent teeth affected-this was almost 5 times the average at age 12. Fissure sealants  There was an association between age and fissure sealant use-the mean number of fissure <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> was 0. 1 at age 6, and 0. 8 at age 12. From 1989 to 2001, {{the average number of}} fissure <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> in 12 -year-olds increased threefold. Thereafter use decreased. A higher proportion of children with teeth decay had fissure sealants than those without decay. Despite the use of fissure sealants decreasing since 2001, there has been an increasing tendency to provide fissure sealants to children who are at risk of decay. Given that an account of preventive treatment data except for fissure sealants is not available in the CDHS, fissure sealant use can be considered as an indicator of preventive care...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{compare and}} {{evaluate}} the sealing ability of light cure composite and light cure GIC as coronal sealing materials. Materials and Methods: 30 extracted human teeth were divided into three experimental groups of 10 teeth each. The teeth in group I are obturated without coronal <b>seal,</b> <b>teeth</b> in group II are obturated with light cure GIC (3 M ESPE VITREMER) as coronal <b>seal</b> and <b>teeth</b> in group III are obturated with light cure composite(3 M ESPE filtek z 250) as coronal seal, after removing 2 mm of coronal gutta percha. These teeth (crown portion) are then suspended in methylene blue, sealed and kept for 72 hours, to observe the amount of dye penetration. After 72 hours teeth were removed, washed under running water, dried and sectioned longitudinally, separating buccal and lingual halves. The linear extent of dye penetration was measured from cavosurface margin of the access cavity to the most apical extent of dye penetration point. The length from the cavosurface margin to {{the apex of the}} tooth was also measured and percentage linear micro leakage was estimated. Statistical Analysis: Data was statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Post-Hoc Multiple comparison (Bonferroni). Results: In the present study specimens in group I showed the maximum percentage of linear microleakage of 31. 51 percent. The specimens in group II showed the minimal amount of linear micro leakage of 6. 49 percent.

40|$|A steped {{labyrinth}} seal was experimentally investigated {{to determine the}} effects of pressure ratio, shaft speed, number of teeth, and tooth/step location upon the leakage through the seal for incompressible flow. The dependence of the flow coefficient upon the number of throttles and pressure ratio are similar to those for straight-through {{labyrinth seal}}s. It can be noted that the axial location of the throttle with respect to the step had a special effect upon the flow coefficient. That is, the dependency of the flow coefficient upon rotation rate and the number of throttles changes with axial location. It was found that the minimum flow coefficient was obtained when the <b>seal</b> <b>teeth</b> were centered on the step surface. Axial pressure distribution measurements show that when the teeth are centered on the step, the pressure drop from cavity to cavity is almost uniform. It is speculated that the obtaining of this uniform pressure gradient is the cause for the enhanced performance of the stepped labyrinth seal when operated in that configuration...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of a nonsurgical approach to arrest occlusal non-cavitated dentin lesions through glass ionomer sealing. Methods: In this controlled clinical trial, 51 teeth with clinically non-cavitated occlusal caries radiographically located beneath the enamel-dentine junction (radiolucent area) were selected among patients presenting a moderate to high risk of caries. The teeth were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group receiving an application of Vidrion-R (SS White) glass ionomer and a control group not submitted to any clinical intervention. Caries progression was monitored by clinical and radiographic examination at 4 -monthly intervals over a period of one year.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to provide {{additional}} data to supplement the work reported in NASA/CR- 2015 - 218868 (Berdanier and Key, 2015 b). The aim of that project was to characterize the fundamental flow physics and the overall performance effects due to increased rotor tip clearance heights in axial compressors. Data have been collected in the three-stage axial research compressor at Purdue University with a specific focus on analyzing the multistage effects resulting from the tip leakage flow. Three separate rotor tip clearances were studied with nominal tip clearance gaps of 1. 5 percent, 3. 0 percent, and 4. 0 percent based on a constant annulus height. Overall compressor performance was previously investigated at four corrected speedlines (100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent, and 68 percent) {{for each of the}} three tip clearance configurations. This study extends the previously published results to include detailed steady and time-resolved pressure data at two loading conditions, nominal loading (NL) and high loading (HL), on the 100 percent corrected speedline for the intermediate clearance level (3. 0 percent). Steady detailed radial traverses of total pressure at the exit of each stator row are supported by flow visualization techniques to identify regions of flow recirculation and separation. Furthermore, detailed radial traverses of time-resolved total pressures at the exit of each rotor row have been measured with a fast-response pressure probe. These data were combined with existing three-component velocity measurements to identify a novel technique for calculating blockage in a multistage compressor. Time-resolved static pressure measurements have been collected over the rotor tips for all rotors with each of the three tip clearance configurations for up to five loading conditions along the 100 percent corrected speedline using fast-response piezoresistive pressure sensors. These time-resolved static pressure measurements reveal new knowledge about the trajectory of the tip leakage flow through the rotor passage. Further, these data extend previous measurements identifying a modulation of the tip leakage flow due to upstream stator wake propagation. Finally, a novel instrumentation technique has been implemented to measure pressures in the shrouded stator cavities. These data provide boundary conditions relating to the flow across the shrouded stator knife <b>seal</b> <b>teeth.</b> Moreover, the utilization of fast-response pressure sensors provides a new look at the time-resolved pressure field, leading to instantaneous differential pressures across the <b>seal</b> <b>teeth.</b> Ultimately, the data collected for this project represent a unique data set which contributes to build a better understanding of the tip leakage flow field and its associated loss mechanisms. These data will facilitate future engine design goals leading to small blade heights in the rear stages of high pressure compressors and aid in the development of new blade designs which are desensitized to the performance penalties attributed to rotor tip leakage flows...|$|R

Retention rates were estimated, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival probabilities; and the comparison between HR and LR groups was evaluated by Wilcoxon and log-rank test. Result The results showed that 14 % of <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> showed total loss (16 % for HR and 12 % for LR) and 46 % showed partial loss during the study (51 % for HR and 41 % for LR), in relation to the baseline sample. No difference could be demonstrated by the survival analysis between HR and LR groups (p> 0. 05). Conclusion Caries risk did not influence the retention rates of a resin-modified glass ionomer cement used as occlusal sealant in 6 - 8 -year old schoolchildren...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports a}} {{follow-up}} on 2415 occlusal sealings {{performed in a}} dental office. After nine to ten years service time, the survival rate of all sealed surfaces dropped to 69. 5 % because of either occlusal or interproximal carious activities. Retention of the sealings was intact in 91. 5 % after one year, but dropped to 58. 2 % after nine years. In the control group 49. 3 % of the grooves showed either caries or fillings during the last check-up whereas this occurred in only 7. 3 % of the <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> (ratio 7 : 1). The difference among those two groups was even bigger (45. 7 % vs. 5 %, ratio 9 : 1) when excluding all two-sided fillings. The costs of restoring one tooth surface {{in the control group}} was on average two to three times higher than for the sealings group. There is no doubt about the beneficial prophylactic effect of the use of sealants, even {{in the context of the}} private dental office, and no inconvenient side-effects have been found. The results concerning the retention rate of sealing in this study from a private dental office are comparable with the average of those reported in many papers from U. S. Dental Schools, they are even slightly better for the caries incidence...|$|R
25|$|The crabeater seal {{shares a}} common recent {{ancestor}} {{with the other}} Antarctic seals, which are together known as the lobodontine seals. These include the Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii), leopard seal (H. leptonyx) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli). These species, collectively belonging to the Lobodontini tribe of <b>seals,</b> share <b>teeth</b> adaptations including lobes and cusps useful for straining smaller prey items {{out of the water}} column. The ancestral Lobodontini likely diverged from their sister clade, the Mirounga (elephant seals) in the late Miocene to early Pliocene, when they migrated southward and diversified rapidly in relative isolation around Antarctica.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the detection of enamel-dentin occlusal caries using photostimulable phosphor plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The ability to detect enamel-dentin occlusal caries in 607 premolars and molars from 47 patients between 10 and 18 years old, referred to the School of Dentistry of the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, was evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations, using the criteria proposed in a previous study. A total of 156 bitewing digital images were obtained using Digora® (Soredex Medical Systems, Helsinki, Finland) phosphor plates. The plates were scanned and the images were captured and displayed on a computer screen. Image evaluation was done using Digora® for Windows 2. 1 software, Soredex®. The radiologists were allowed to use enhancement tools to obtain better visibility during scoring of the teeth based on the radiographic criteria proposed in a previous study. Descriptive analysis and chi-squared proportion tests were done at 5 % significance level. RESULTS: The results of clinical examination showed a higher prevalence of teeth with a straight dark line or demineralization of the occlusal fissure (score 1) and a lower prevalence of <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> (score 5). In the bitewing digital images, 47 teeth presented visible radiolucency, circumscribed, in dentin under occlusal enamel (enamel-dentin caries lesions). CONCLUSIONS: Correlating the clinical and radiographic findings, it was found that in the majority of teeth diagnosed by radiographic images as having enamel-dentin caries, no caries could be detected by clinical examination...|$|R
40|$|Dental caries {{still remains}} {{the second most}} {{prevalent}} disease after common cold, out of which occlusal caries is the most profound one. In India, more than 40 % of children {{are found to be}} affected by dental caries. Occlusal surfaces of the teeth are most susceptible sites for caries development due to their morphology. They are least benefited from fluoride application. Various efforts have been made by the preventive means to decline the rate of caries, one of which being sealant application. Sealants have come into existence long back since 1971 when first pit and fissure sealant Nuva-Caulk came into existence. There have been piles of literature stating the benefits that arrive from <b>sealing</b> the <b>teeth.</b> However, one crucial point that is being missed most of the times is the cost-effectiveness of the sealant. There are various schools of thoughts, regarding this that is controversial ones. Some of the analysts believe that always sealing may be a bit costlier, but it reduces subsequent dental treatments and hence saves money as well as time. However, some believe that why to unnecessarily <b>seal</b> the <b>teeth</b> in all cases even when the child is not at a risk to develop caries. Hence, we need to foresee both the sides of equation. For best clinical practice and decision-making, {{we need to have a}} balance of best evidence, clinical judgment, and the most important, patient needs and preferences...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The null-hypothesis tested {{was that}} there was no {{difference}} in the frequency of remnants of high-viscosity glass-ionomer sealants left behind in pits and fissures of occlusal surfaces of first permanent molars and that of resin composite and glass-carbomer sealants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the results of a sealant trial, a sample of <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> from which the material had apparently completely disappeared from at least one of the three sections into which the occlusal surface was divided, assessed through visible clinical examination, was also assessed from images of colour photographs and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) as the reference image. The sample size consisted of 112 and 120 teeth from 59 and 98 children at evaluation years 2 and 3 respectively. Two examiners performed the assessments. Fisher's Exact Test was applied to test for the differences between the dependent variable and the sealant groups. RESULTS: The remnants of sealant material left in the deeper parts of pits and fissures were assessed from colour photograph and SEM images in five sections at year 2 and in eight sections at year 3. The assessment found no sealant group effect. CONCLUSION: The frequency of remnants of glass-ionomer sealant in pits and fissures of occlusal surfaces in first permanent molars is not higher than the frequency of glass-carbomer and resin sealants after 2 and 3 years. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Contrary to the current assumption, there appears to be no significant difference in the frequency of remnants left behind in pits and fissures between glass-ionomer and resin sealants...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: School-based sealant {{programs}} (SBSPs) increase sealant use {{and reduce}} caries. Programs target schools that serve children from low-income families {{and focus on}} sealing newly erupted permanent molars. In 2004 and 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, sponsored meetings of an expert work group to update recommendations for sealant use in SBSPs {{on the basis of}} available evidence regarding the effectiveness of sealants on sound and carious pit and fissure surfaces, caries assessment and selected sealant placement techniques, and the risk of caries' developing in <b>sealed</b> <b>teeth</b> among children who might be lost to follow-up. The work group also identified topics for which additional evidence review was needed. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The work group used systematic reviews when available. Since 2005, staff members at CDC and subject-matter experts conducted several independent analyses of topics for which no reviews existed. These reviews include a systematic review of the effectiveness of sealants in managing caries. RESULTS: The evidence supports recommendations to seal sound surfaces and noncavitated lesions, to use visual assessment to detect surface cavitation, to use a toothbrush or handpiece prophylaxis to clean tooth surfaces, and to provide sealants to children even if follow-up cannot be ensured. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These recommendations are consistent with {{the current state of the}} science and provide appropriate guidance for sealant use in SBSPs. This report also may increase practitioners' awareness of the SBSP as an important and effective public health approach that complements clinical care.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the depth of curing of 10 contemporary blue light-activated dental flowable materials at several opacities, influenced by different irradiation times using FT-IR spectroscopy. Fifty-five specimens (n = 5) with a 5 -mm diameter and 1 -mm thickness of translucent (Opallis Flow T), yellowed (Master Flow A 2; Opallis Flow A 2; Natural Flow A 2; Fluroshield Yellowed), and opaque materials (Master Flow OA 2; Natural Flow O; Opallis Flow OA 3. 5; Opal lis Flow OP; Fluroshield White) were obtained at six curing times (10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 40 s, 50 s, and 60 s) using a high-intensity LED (Coltolux, Coltene/Whaledent). The degree of conversion (DC) (%) was obtained using the Nexus 470 FTIR Spectrometer (Nicolet Instruments, USA). The FTIR-ATR spectra for uncured and cured samples were analyzed using a ZnSe crystal. The top and bottom surfaces of the cured specimens were analyzed to obtain the depth of curing. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data. The highest curing depth was obtained by Natural Flow OA 2, while the lowest was shown by Master Flow OA 2. The shortest curing time generated similar depths of cure in comparison with the most extensive for Opallis Flow A 2 and Fluroshield Yellowed. Therefore, depth of curing, influenced by the irradiation time, was dependent on the materials. Using the Natural Flow OA 2 opaque sealant and the 10 -s curing time for Opallis Flow A 2 and Fluroshield Yellowed may represent alternative approaches to <b>sealing</b> <b>tooth</b> fissures...|$|R
