5000|$|This {{particular}} [...]051 {{came about}} when a special order for 300 Medallions {{was placed on}} Cox by the National Free Flight Society in the USA.

But {{the determination of the}} NFFS resulted in the deal happening, however Estes-Cox only came through with 258 engines. The NFFS engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine. These are probably the rarest of all Cox Engines due to the small size of the production run. These engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other Cox engine, before or after. The cylinder has a <b>straight</b> <b>bore</b> (0.41 inches), slit exhaust, no sub piston induction.|$|E
50|$|The Industrial Revolution brought {{significant}} {{wealth to}} entrepreneurs, {{who set up}} rapidly expanding companies and factories all over the North of England, and later elsewhere. Business were run by men who often had military experience, {{in a way that}} reflected the Services, with its own system of rank. The wealthiest factories, and coal mines provided such comforts as living quarters, and entertainment for their workers, and small bands of musicians were employed, comprising only brass and percussion instruments. The brass instruments were all related, having a conical bore, and the musical notation was written in treble clef for all instruments, except the tuba. Brass instruments are robust, and because of their conical bore (cornets, rather than trumpets, with their <b>straight</b> <b>bore)</b> this meant that the musicians could easily switch instruments, should a shortage arise of a particular instrument. There was no requirement for them to learn to read the bass clef, so the transition was all the more simple. The effectiveness of such bands in all weathers conditions, both indoors and out, was noted by military musicians, and brass instruments were quickly adopted by them, to augment the fifes, and oboes, and such instruments such as the shawm and the serpent were gradually dispensed with, for more powerful brass. The flute, and its smaller relative the piccolo, soon replaced the weaker, and limited fife.|$|E

50|$|Not all plugs are solid. Some plugs are {{bored with}} a T-junction. In these systems the plug {{extends beyond the}} {{threaded}} sleeve and is designed to form an airtight fitting with glass tubing or hosing. The shaft of the plug is bored from beyond the threaded sleeve to a T-junction just before the bevel plug contact. When the plug is fully sealed, the region beyond the bevel is separated from the plug shaft {{as well as the}} bore which leads out of its shaft. When the plug bevel contact is released, the two regions are exposed to each other. These valves have also been used as a grease-free alternative to <b>straight</b> <b>bored</b> stopcocks common to Schlenk flasks. The high symmetry and concise design of these valves has also made them popular for capping NMR tubes. Such NMR tubes can be heated without the loss of solvent thanks to the valve's gas-tight seal. NMR tubes with T-bore plugs are widely known as J. Young NMR tubes, named after the brand name of valves most commonly used for this purpose. Images of J. Young NMR tubes and a J. Young NMR tube adapter are in the gallery.|$|R
5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long <b>straight</b> <b>bore</b> that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is presented to}} calculate damping in ring seals for a compressible fluid. Results show that damping in tapered ring seals (optimized for stiffness) is less than that in <b>straight</b> <b>bore</b> ring seals for the same minimum clearance. Damping in ring seals can promote fractional frequency whirl and can, thus, be detrimental. Thus, tapered seals can benefit rotor and seal stability by having lower damping as well as higher stiffness. Use of incompressible results leads to large errors...|$|E

This evolutionary improvement became an archetype, influencing future cartridge designs. With improved firearm metallurgy available, Smith & Wesson increased the bullet weight of the new cartridge to 246 grains while retaining a heavy 23 grain black-powder propellant charge which almost equalled that of the [...]44 American and produced a muzzle velocity of roughly 750 ft/s. As a result of these changes, the [...]44 Russian generated a much higher chamber pressure of 12,000 copper units of pressure (CUP) compared to the older [...]44 American round which generated only 6-8,000 CUP.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A set of drop size {{distribution}} data is presented covering {{a wide range}} of sprinkler types including single nozzle impact sprinklers with <b>straight</b> <b>bore</b> and square nozzles, and sprayheads with various types of deflector plates. Drop sizes were measured by the laser-optical method and comparisons with other types of drop size measurement techniques are presented. Distributions are parameterized with an exponential function, and a method is provided to estimate the parameters given the sprinkler type, nozzle size, and pressure head. Keywords. Irrigation, Sprinklers, Drop size. S prinkler irrigation can be defined as any irrigation system which distributes water as discrete droplets through the air. The variety of sprinkler devices available has increased dramatically in recent years, from the conventional single or double nozzle impact sprinkler with many types of nozzles to various types of deflection-plate sprinklers which influence the drop sizes and water distribution patterns over {{a wide range of}} flow rates and pressures. Accurate knowledge of drop {{size distribution}}s for sprinklers is important because evaporation and drift losses are controlled by the extreme small size ranges and drop impact energy on the soil is determined primarily by the largest size ranges. Selection of a specific sprinkler package for a sprinkler system operating on particular soil, slope, crop, and climate conditions will be aided by knowledge of the drop sizes. Several articles have been published describing the drop size distributions of specific types of sprinklers (Kohl...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the fatigue crack growth behavior around the countersunk fastener hole. Both experimental and computational studies were carried out and the results were compared when possible. ^ In the early stage of this research, the fatigue failures at the mechanical joint specimens were investigated and characterized. The three-dimensional finite element analyses revealed that the degree of load transfer through the countersink fastener can influence the cracking behavior at the countersunk fastener hole. This finding was verified by investigating the fracture surfaces of the mechanical joint specimens. The cracking location 2 ̆ 7 s dependence on the load transfer {{can be attributed to the}} non-uniform bearing load distribution along the <b>straight</b> <b>bore</b> section caused by the load transfer. ^ Fatigue crack growth from the countersunk fastener hole under remote tensile loading was studied using the PMMA transparent material. Single edge corner crack at the bottom of the plate and single internal surface crack at the sharp intersection between the bore and the countersunk were pre-cracked in the PMMA specimen and fatigue tested subsequently. By applying the ‘back-calculation’ method, the stress intensity factors at several crack fronts were experimentally derived. For the derivation, both apparent and effective stress intensity factor ranges were used and the results were compared. The ‘back-calculation’, without the crack closure consideration near the free surface, underestimated the stress intensity factors. The experimental stress intensity factors, corrected by the crack opening load variation, agreed well with the computational results at selected crack fronts. The experimental stress intensity factors are presented in tabular forms. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} experimental rotordynamic coefficients for laminar, smooth bushing oil seals to theoretical predictions from XLLubeGT and XLAnSeal. The experimental results come from a new test rig developed at the Turbomachinery Laboratory at Texas A&M University. The two software programs were developed to predict the static and dynamic characteristics of seals. XLLubeGT is a Reynolds equation based program while XLAnSeal {{is based on a}} bulk-flow Navier- Stokes model that includes temporal and convective acceleration terms. XLAnSeal was used to predict the added-mass terms of the seals since XLLubeGT assumes those terms to be zero or negligible. The data used for input into the two seals code was the actual measured conditions from the test rig. As part of the input parameters, inlet inertia effects and thermal gradients along the seal were included. Both XLLubeGT and XLAnSeal have the capability to analyze <b>straight</b> <b>bore</b> seals with different inlet and outlet clearances ? essentially a tapered seal ? but seal expansion caused by the radial differential pressure across the seal bushing was not included. Theoretical and experimentally determined dynamic characteristics include stiffness, damping, inertia terms and Whirl Frequency Ratio (WFR). Seal static characteristics are also reported. They include: leakage, shaft center line loci and Reynolds numbers. Test conditions include three shaft speeds: 4000, 7000 and 10, 000 rpm, three test pressures: 21, 45 and 69 bar [300, 650, and 1000 psi] and multiple eccentricities from 0. 0 to 0. 7. The results for the dynamic characteristics show good correlation of the experimental data to the theoretical values up to an eccentricity of about 0. 5. At higher eccentricities, the theory generally under-predicts the dynamic characteristics. Inertia terms are greatly under-predicted. The results for the static characteristics also show good correlation to the experimental data, but they also have a tendency to be under-predicted at higher eccentricities...|$|E
