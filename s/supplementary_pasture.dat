40|$|Due to {{the high}} value of land in Brazil, it is {{necessary}} to conduct studies about the economic feasibility of the choice of production strategy. The soil expectation value determines the maximum purchase price of the bare land, considering the horizon of infinite time. Therefore, this methodology was used to assess the financial-economic feasibility of sheep production systems in pasture with either creep feeding or creep grazing termination of unweaned lambs. Six scenarios were proposed to evaluate the economic feasibility, according to the finishing strategy, the dry matter (DM) offer per kg of body weight (BW) per day (12 % or 8 %) and the corresponding percentage of white clover <b>supplementary</b> <b>pasture</b> area (30 % to 50 % - relative to the main pasture area). The soil expectation value was positive in all of the evaluated systems Creep grazing finishing system with 8 % DM offer per kg BW and with 30 % of reduction on the white glover area resulted in the largest financial return (R$ 289, 043. 71) and the highest internal return rate (1. 74 %). The most economically attractive scenario, however, was the creep feeding finishing system with 8 % DM offer per kg of BW, which allowed expenses with the land as high as R$ 22, 950. 68 per hectare. Adjustments in the main pasture offer, which do not compromise animal performance, can enable economic improvement on the feasibility of grazing sheep production systems. The soil expectation value can be used as an economic indicator in the choice of location or expansion of grazing sheep farms...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of stage of lactation (SOL) and time of year on plasmin-derived proteolytic activity in the milk of pasture-fed dairy cows in New Zealand. Four herds of 20 Friesian cows were used, one herd calving in each of January, April, July and October. Cows grazed ryegrass/white clover pasture only, except during June (winter) when all cows received <b>supplementary</b> <b>pasture</b> silage. Milk samples were collected on four occasions during the year (spring, summer, autumn and winter) from each cow in milk, to give a total of three samples per cow (early, mid and late lactation; c. 30, 120 and 220 days after calving, respectively). Milk samples were analysed for plasmin-derived proteolytic activity. There was no effect of either SOL or time of year on plasmin activity and therefore yields of plasmin followed patterns in milk yield (highest in early lactation and in summer). There were effects of both SOL and time of year on plasminogen-derived and total plasmin plus plasminogen-derived activity, both of which were highest in late lactation and in spring. Changes in plasminogen-derived activity and total plasmin plus plasminogen-derived activity due to SOL were not only due to the decrease in milk yield associated with advancing lactation, because enzyme yields were also increased with advancing lactation. Similarly, effects of time of year on plasminogen-derived activity and total plasmin plus plasminogen-derived activity could not be attributed solely to concomitant changes in milk yield, and may be influenced by the variation in the quality and quantity of feed during the year inherent in a pasture-based dairy system. Effects of SOL on proteolytic activity were greater than, and independent of, effects of time of year...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} devoted to the {{development}} of the transhumance in Spain, Italy, Southern France, and the Balkan countries. It elaborated an idealtype of evolution of transhumance within the context of medieval European economies. The ideal-type modes of organization range from the integration of sheep raising, in the business cycles of rural communities to the regulations for extensive migratory sheep raising by public institutions. The degrees of spatial interrelatedness, the separation of pastoral production and reproduction from the rural production and living units, and the disposition of the yields from transhumant sheep raising are used as criteria for characterizing each stage. Spatial relations between the places of rural and pastoral productions allege the labelling of the various stages: intra-local sheep raising (use of the common land; no supplementary pastures; division of labour between the members of the rural production unity; the head of the household is authorized to dispose of the surplus); inter-local migratory pastoral economy (<b>supplementary</b> <b>pastures</b> in different village lands; division of labour between shepherd and rural production unity; the shepherd's participation in surplus and income from sales); intra-regional migratory pastoral industry (<b>supplementary</b> <b>pastures</b> beyond the village, but within the same physiographic region; division of labour between shepherd and rural production unity or larger production unities; aside from them, owners of pasture grounds and landowners in regions through which flocks pass during their migrations participate in surplus and income from sales); inter-regional migratory pastoral industry (<b>supplementary</b> <b>pastures</b> in different physiographic regions, division of labour between shepherd and rural or larger economic unities or flock owners; also division of labour within the pastoral production unity; aside from shepherds, peasants, flock owners, owners of pasture grounds, and landowners in regions through which flocks pass during their migrations, the government or similar organizers of transhumance participate in surplus and income from sales) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many {{habitats}} in Europe {{have been}} managed by grazing {{for thousands of}} years. However, extensive grazing systems are becoming increasingly rare in the region, {{and there is a}} lack of understanding of the functioning of these systems. We carried out 147 structured interviews in 38 landscapes throughout the Carpathian Basin, with 3 – 5 informants/landscape. The number of actively grazing cattle, sheep and pigs, their year-round habitat use and the proportion of herds actively tended were documented for four characteristic historical periods (before, during and after socialist cooperatives and after EU Accession). The numbers of grazing cattle and sheep had decreased substantially by 2010 (by 71 % and 49 %, respectively), while pig grazing almost disappeared by the 1970 s. Cattle primarily grazed habitats with taller vegetation. Sheep grazed dry pastures and stubbles, while pigs were driven into marshes and forests. In general, the importance of dry and wet grasslands increased, while the significance of marshes, stubble fields, vegetation along linear elements, second growth on hay meadows, wood-pastures and forests decreased over time. Approximately half of the grazed habitats were not typical pasture grasslands, and functioned as <b>supplementary</b> <b>pastures</b> during droughts, autumn and winter. The number of habitat types grazed per month per site dropped, and herding decreased substantially, in particular in the case of cattle and pigs. Contributing factors of the economic and social changes of the examined period included the collapse of the communist-era legal framework, the intensification of livestock husbandry, EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) regulations, and the rise of a nature conservation ethic. We conclude that agricultural policies should take into account the full spectrum of habitat types necessary for the effective operation of extensive grazing systems. We argue that conservation-oriented extensive grazing should use the traditional wisdom of herders but adapted to the present situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{desirable}} forage grass seed is increasing with {{the shift from}} cash crops to forage and soil conserving crops. Areas of marginal land in the Great Plains which grew wheat during war time will undoubtedly be put back to grass. Sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes) shows promise in the vegetation of sandy soil.

This disadvantage may be overcome by growing it in pure stands as a <b>supplementary</b> warm-season <b>pasture</b> and controlling the grazing intensity.

40|$|CDATA[A {{study was}} {{conducted}} with 80 Karaka ewes and their lambs to investigate the effects of various feeding levels during mating period on the reproductive performance. Group 1 (control) was grazed only on pasture and Group 2, 3 and 4 were supplied with 200, 300, 600 g/head/day rolled barley, respectively, in addition to <b>pasture.</b> <b>Supplementary</b> feeding was initiated three weeks before mating and lasted for six weeks. There were increases (P< 0. 01) in live weights in Karaka ewes in response to supplementary feeding during feeding period. While supplementary feeding reduced infertility rate (P< 0. 05), this treatment did not affect other reproductive traits. The effects of sex, birth type and birth weight of ewe on the lamb birth weight were significant (P< 0. 01). Birth type affected weaning weight, daily live weight gain and survivability at weaning (P< 0. 05). It was concluded that supplementary feeding in addition to pasture could be utilized to improve reproductive efficiency of Karaka ewes, however, more detailed studies should be carried out to determine the appropriate supplementary feeding regimen and supplementary feeding period during mating period for this breed in regional conditions. ]]...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the economics of a planned system of <b>supplementary</b> irrigation and <b>pasture</b> improvement on a typical Richmond Valley dairy farm. In developing the plan for the farm, consideration is, given to a range of assumptions concerning the farmer's resources of labour and machinery. Similarly, three different levels of production response are considered; these represent assumed variations in the managerial skills of farmers. Thus, with a typical initial farm production of 8. 650 lb. butterfat, the gains assumed are: (1) an increase of 4, 830 lb. butterfat under "good management"; (2) an increase of 6, 040 lb. butterfat under "outstanding management"; and (3) an increase of 3, 620 lb. butterfat under "average management". For each set of assumptions, on the production gain achieved and the resource situation of the typical farmer, a credit budget is developed for a ten-year period. With "good management", when the only major investment is the irrigation plant and when the farmer does not need to employ extra labour, income gains are sufficient to ensure rapid repayment of the overdraft. If, however, the farmer is older and finds it necessary to employ a youth, the "pay back period" is much longer than ten years and the plan is clearly not attractive, except as a means of financing the return of a son to the property. Again, if {{there is no need to}} employ extra labour, the income generated is sufficient to cover investment in a tractor and implements, as well as the irrigation plant, with a pay back period of ten years, or in a herringbone milkshed in the third year of development, with a pay back period of eleven years.

40|$|Two {{factorial}} {{experiments were}} designed {{to determine the effects}} of stage of lactation, and season of the year, on cow responses to supplementary feeding. These experiments were conducted over consecutive years with 128 high genetic merit multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in early, mid and late lactation in spring, summer, autumn and winter. At each stage of lactation, and in each season of the year, cows were offered a restricted pasture allowance (25 to 35 kg dry matter (DM) per cow per day), either unsupplemented (control) or supplemented with 50 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) per cow per day in experiment 1 and 80 MJ ME per cow per day in experiment 2. Two different supplements were offered, namely, rolled maize grain (MG) and a mixture of foods (BR) formulated to nutritionally balance the diet. In experiment 2, a fourth treatment consisting solely of a generous pasture allowance (60 to 75 kg DM per cow per day, AP) was introduced. Offering MG and BR increased DM intake (DMI). At the restricted pasture allowance, increasing total ME allowance (MEA) by offering supplementary foods increased ME intake (MEI) by 0. 68 (s. e. 0. 047) MJ per extra MJ ME offered. This highly significant (P < 0. 001) linear relationship was consistent across seasons, and did not diminish at higher MEA. In experiment 2, cows in early lactation had lower substitution rates than mid and late lactation cows irrespective of season. Substitution rate was higher when higher pasture allowance or quality of pasture on offer enabled the unsupplemented cows to achieve higher DMI from pasture than at other times of the year. These results suggest that one of the key factors determining the intake response to <b>supplementary</b> foods is <b>pasture</b> allowance. Within spring calving dairying systems, the largest increases in total DMI per kg of supplement offered is likely when offering supplements to early lactation cows grazing restricted allowances of high quality pasture...|$|R
40|$|Trees with high-protein Ieaves {{are proving}} to be a {{valuable}} and practical feed resource for cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs in several Caribbean countries. In many instances one or more of a range of nitrogen-fixing species are grown to complement high energy diets based on chopped sugar cane or cane Juice. The trees and the cane have been shown to provide locally available, economical balanced rations for ruminants and pigs, and to offer ecological benefits: both crops can remain in the ground for long periods, being ratooned and coppiced respectively and do not require much, if any, disturbance of the soil. The soil conservation benefit is enhanced by the deep-rooting trees drawing nutrients and moisture from previously untapped soil profiles. in Jamaica, the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Developrnent Institute (CARDI) has demonstrated several alternative ways of utilising leucaena and gliricidia for <b>supplementary</b> cattle at <b>pasture.</b> Foliage can be stall-fed or lopped straight on to the ground in pasture where the branches are picked dean. This is particularly useful as a dry season protein reserve. Alternatively, branches may be cut and stacked to dry on a suitable surface for two or three days. The leaves drop off and be swept up to provide a leaf protein concentrate which can be stored for future use. The leaf contains 25 % crude protein, which can be mixed with cereals; a normal dairy ration contains 16 % crude protein. The system is very simple and can be done on a lugs or small scale. One smallholder dairy farmer in Jamaica is growing leucaena and making leaf protein concentrate entirely by hand. Others are mechanizing the process. In Trinidad, the Sugar Feed Centre (SFC) has developed feeding systems where leaf protein from coppiced Leuceaena leucocephala and Acacia mangium supplements chopped cane fed to growing calves and dairy animals. In Colombia, however, the preferred tree species is Trichantera gigantea, known locally as Nacedero, a forage tree of this Acathaceae family originating in the Andes. It can grow at elevations of up to 2500 metres. The leaves are highly digestible and contain a low level of non-nutritional factors, with the result that they are readily acceptable to pigs. T. gigantea has a large leaf area, rapid regrowth and 16 - 20 % crude protein. At 10, 000 trees/ha the yield is 40 - 50 tonnes of fresh matter/ha. Dr T R Preston and a team at CIPAV in Colombia have developed a system for feeding pigs and hair sheep on sugar cane for energy end T. gigantea leaf for protein (See Spore 31 page 12). The trees can be harvested for the first time eight months after planting and are then chopped every three months. This system is claimed to yield 3000 kg of meat/ha/year.

The {{effect of}} {{stage of lactation}} and season on milksolids response to supplementary feeding of dairy cows. Proceedings of the New Zealand Society of Animal Production, 58, 297 - 305. Many experiments have measured the responses of grazing dairy cows to various forms of supplementary feed, but few have studied {{the reasons for the}} large differences in responses between experiments. Two short-term, and one long-term supplementary feeding trials were designed to help understand the reasons for wide variation in responses that have been reported, and to develop a biophysical framework to improve the prediction of the response by grazing cows to supplementary feeds. Two grazing trials (trial 1 in year 1; trial 2 in year 2) were conducted with groups of cows in early, mid and late lactation in spring, summer, autumn and winter, in a partially complete Latin Square arrangement. At each stage of lactation, and in each season of the year, cows were offered either a restricted pasture allowance (25 to 35 kg DM/cow/day), or the restricted pasture allowance plus supplements offered at 50 MJME/cow/day in trial 1 and 80 MJME/cow/day in trial 2. The supplements were either rolled maize grain (MG) or a mixture of feeds formulated to nutritionally balance the diet (BR). Supplemented cows at each stage of lactation and during each season of the year were compared to their respective control groups, which received only the restricted pasture allowance. In both trials 1 and 2, offering MG and BR supplements resulted in large increases in DMI. At a restricted metabolisable energy (ME) allowance, offering supplementary feeds increased ME intake by 0. 65 MJME/MJME offered. This highly significant linear relationship was consistent across the different seasons and did not diminish at higher ME allowance. Between stages of lactation, substitution rates (SR) ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 3 (± 0. 1) during trial 1, and 0. 1 to 0. 5 (± 0. 1) during trial 2, however differences were not closely associated with either stage of lactation, season of the year or type of supplement offered. The pasture dry matter intake of the unsupplemented cows (PDMI) was closely associated with SR, with SR increasing from 0. 0 to 0. 6 kg as the PDMI increased from 1. 5 to 3. 5 % of liveweight. In trial 1, the immediate responses ranged from 2. 0 to 5. 6 g milksolids (MS) /MJME and from 0. 3 to 11. 1 g liveweight/MJME. In trial 2, the immediate responses ranged from 0. 3 to 3. 3 g MS/MJME and from 1. 9 to 6. 4 g liveweight/MJME. The immediate MS responses were consistently smaller during spring than in other seasons of the year. The carryover responses (measured during the four weeks following supplementary feeding) were about 0. 5 times the immediate effects in both trials 1 and 2. In trial 1 there was no difference (P> 0. 10) between the total milksolids responses (immediate plus carryover responses) of early and mid lactation cows, whereas in trial 2 mid lactation cows demonstrated larger (P< 0. 05) total milksolids responses than early lactation cows. In trial 1 the total milksolids responses measured in spring, summer autumn and winter were 6. 4, 6. 9, 3. 6 and 7. 5 (± 1. 17) g MS/MJME, respectively. During trial 2 the total milksolids responses measured in spring, summer autumn and winter were - 0. 1, 3. 4, 3. 6 and 4. 7 (± 0. 74) g MS/MJME, respectively. There was no difference in the total milksolids response resulting from MG or BR in trial 1, whereas during trial 2 the milksolids response from MG and BR were 1. 9 and 3. 9 (± 0. 52) g MS/MJME, respectively. Stage of lactation and season of the year accounted for little of the variation in the magnitude of the marginal milksolids response from feeding supplementary feeds. The factor that was of greatest importance was the relative feed deficit (RFD) measured by the reduction in milksolids yield (kg MS/cow/day) of the respective control groups that had occurred when the feeding treatments had been imposed. Total marginal milksolids responses were greatest when severe feed restrictions, relative to the current feed demand, resulted in large reductions in milksolids yield of the control groups. Total marginal milksolids response increased (P< 0. 01) by 0. 9 g MS/MJME offered as supplement per 0. 1 kg MS/cow/day RFD. Total marginal milksolids responses also declined (P< 0. 01) by 0. 2 g MS/MJME offered as supplement as pasture allowance increased by 10 MJME/cow/day. In the long-term trial, five spring-calving pasture-based farmlet systems were compared with the objective of measuring the long-term effects of offering large quantities of three types of supplementary feed within dairying systems. Four of five farmlets (5. 67 ha) were stocked with 25 high genetic merit Friesian cows (4. 41 cows/ha) and one farmlet was stocked with 19 cows (3. 35 cows/ha) calving between 12 July and 31 August in each year, for three complete years. Herds on the higher stocked (HS) farmlets were offered either no supplementary feed from off farm sources (Control), or supplementary feeds of rolled maize grain (MG), or whole maize crop silage (WCS), or a nutritionally balancing ration (BR). The herd grazing the lower stocked farmlet (LS) was offered <b>supplementary</b> feed of <b>pasture</b> silage that had been conserved on that farmlet from surplus spring pasture. The high stocking rate and early calving date of the supplemented herds resulted in low pasture allowances at most times of the year, requiring the use of 1. 1 to 1. 7 t DM/cow/year as supplementary feed. While some pasture substitution may have occurred, {{there was no difference between}} the annual pasture dry matter intake (DMI) of the supplemented and control herds. Feeding treatments of MG, WCS, BR and LS increased annual milksolids (MS) yield from 269 (Control herd) to 400, 363, 408 and 361 (± 15. 8) kg/cow, respectively. Differences in total dry matter and metabolisable energy intake per cow explained most of the differences in MS yield per cow between the five farmlets. Marginal responses from the MG, WCS, BR, and LS treatments averaged 7. 3, 7. 6, 7. 8, and 6. 6 g MS/MJME over the three years of the experiment. Cows in the HS supplementary feeding herds and the LS herd calved in fatter condition and maintained higher DMI in early spring, and had shorter post partum anoestrous interval and a lower incidence of anoestrous than those in the HS control herd. A model based on the data derived from the two short-term trials used RDF, pasture allowance, supplement intake and stage of lactation to predict much of the variability between some published short-term experiments, and closely agreed with the milksolids responses measured during the long-term trial...|$|R
