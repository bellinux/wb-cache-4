Klapmeier indicated that his reason for wanting {{to take over the}} project was to increase the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> Current Cirrus CEO Brent Wouters responded by saying that the company intends to proceed with the SF50 program itself, but would listen to Klapmeier's proposal.|$|E

In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the Pentagon described the J-20 as [...] "a platform capable of long range, penetrating strikes into complex air defense environments."

40|$|Neural circuit {{development}} {{requires that}} synapses be formed between appropriate neurons. In addition, for a hierarchical network, successful development involves a sequencing of developmental events. It {{has been suggested}} that one mechanism that helps <b>speed</b> up <b>development</b> <b>of</b> proper connections is an early overproduction of synapses. Using a computational model <b>of</b> synapse <b>development,</b> such as adaptive synaptogenesis, it is possible to study such overproduction and its role in speeding up development; it is also possible to study other outcomes of synapse overproduction that are seemingly new to the literature. With a fixed number of neurons, adaptive synaptogenesis can control the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> synaptic <b>development</b> in two ways: by altering the rate constants of the adaptive processes or by altering the initial number of rapidly but non-selectively accrued synapses. Using either mechanism, the simulations reveal that synapse overproduction appears as an unavoidable concomitant of rapid adaptive synaptogenesis. However, the shortest development times, which always produces the greatest amount of synapse overproduction, reduce adult performance by three measures: energy use, discrimination error rates, and proportional neuron allocation. Thus, the results here lead to the hypothesis that the observed <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> neural network <b>development</b> represents a particular inter-generational compromise: quick development benefits parental fecundity while slow development benefits offspring fecundity...|$|R
