40|$|Conventional {{reclamation}} interventions of post-smelting <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> being undertaken so far either failed or produced poor results. Certain lichens, {{especially of}} the genus Cladonia, are known as effective colonisers of bare ground in anthropogenic habitats. The paper presents preliminary results of the experiment aimed at the evaluation of lichen usefulness in reclamation interventions. The cultivation in vivo involving transplantation of lichens directly on slag substrate was established in 2015. Five species, i. e. Cladonia rei, C. cariosa, C. pyxidata, C. subulata, C. macilenta, were transplanted into 32 cuvettes filled with sterilised slag substrate. The sample weight of 2 and 6 g were used and half of cuvettes were regularly supplied with 2 % malt solution. The first important symptoms at the present stage of the experiment are as follow: the growth of thalli has appeared only {{in the case of}} first three species; C. rei shows the most effective development; cuvettes with 6 g sample weight are characterized by higher coverage of fresh lichen thalli; lichen biomass are visually higher in cuvettes treated with malt solution. The results give us reason to believe that lichens could be successfully used as an alternative element during planning of <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> reclamation in the future...|$|R
500|$|A {{field study}} of fungi growing in {{polluted}} {{sites in the}} Czech and Slovak Republics found that C.piperatus fruit bodies growing near lead smelters and on mine and <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> had the greatest ability to bioaccumulate the element antimony.

50|$|The Einasleigh Mine, {{apart from}} {{being one of the}} {{earliest}} copper mines in Queensland, can still demonstrate the industrial processes associated with, in particular, copper extraction in a remote location. Although most buildings and plant have been removed or renovated, the site still explains the copper extraction process. The <b>slag</b> <b>dump,</b> blast furnace mount and associated artefacts are significant, while the stone magazine and one room stone hut are noteworthy.|$|E
50|$|The place {{demonstrates}} the layout and processes of a mid-sized copper smelter, and contains a rare large, intact and very symmetrical <b>slag</b> <b>dump.</b> The octagonal brick chimney dominating the smelter site {{is one of}} only three octagonal mining chimneys recorded in North Queensland, the others being at Chillagoe and Sunset No 2, Ravenswood. The Pooley and Sons weighbridge is the most substantial and intact weighbridge recorded in North Queensland.|$|E
50|$|The {{vicinity}} of the smelter has been severely impacted on by drilling rigs and the 1970s mining activities. Some smelter equipment {{and parts of the}} foundation remain intact and, significant among them, are parts of a poured slag floor. It extends NE {{to the edge of the}} <b>slag</b> <b>dump</b> itself. Carefully pouring the slag, so that it retained a smooth top, ensured that the hot slag could be moved rapidly across the dump as required. Drums related to the process are scattered in adjacent areas.|$|E

During the operation, the coal is added in the coal corridor from the southeast corner and then transported into the power unit and the gasification unit. Separate <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> are in service for the power unit and gasification unit in the north. Three chimneys are in operation at the southeast corner of the power unit. The product is mainly transported by railway and a small amount by the highway.|$|R
50|$|The {{furnaces}} {{were sold}} to William Butz, who dismantled most of the buildings for scrap iron and lumber. However, the masonry structures were allowed to remain, albeit in a decayed condition. The <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> on the property were crushed, screened, and used for roofing and fill by the Lehigh Slag Company until 1958. Little-used since {{the closing of the}} furnaces, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville's line through the site was torn up in the 1940s. With industrial operations on the property long complete, it was donated by the Butz family to Lehigh County for use as a park.|$|R
40|$|<b>Slag</b> <b>dumps</b> {{occur at}} several {{historical}} smelting sites in north Queensland, Australia. The microcrystalline slags contain primary slag phases, relict flux, ore and furnace materials and secondary weathering related minerals. Common primary slag phases are glass, Zn-rich fayalite (± Zn-rich kirschsteinite) and Zn-rich hedenbergite. Other minor minerals include wollastonite, Zn-rich melilite, Zn-rich iscorite (Fe 7 SiO 10), magnetite {{as well as}} a number of sulphides (pyrrhotite, galena, bornite, sphalerite, wurtzite), metallic phases (Ag, Cu, Pb, Sb), alloys (Cu 3 Sn), and unknown metal compounds. The slag materials contain wt. % concentrations of Zn and elevated levels of Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and W. Glass, hedenbergite and fayalite/kirschsteinite are the main repositories of Zn, whereas much of the Cu and Pb is hosted by glass, sulphides, Cu 3 Sn alloys, metallic Cu and Pb, and unknown CuSb, AsSnPb and FeAsCu compounds. The slags are undergoing contemporaneous reaction with air and rainwater. The weathering results in the release of metals and metalloids from primary slag phases, particularly from glass, and the partial immobilization of these metals in secondary soluble and insoluble minerals in the slag heaps. Zinc exhibits pronounced chemical mobility and reports together with elevated Ca and sulphate into surface seepages (up to 10. 2 mg 1 - 1 Zn at pH 6. 97). The <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> represent long-term sources of metal pollutants, particularly of Zn, to local ground and surface waters...|$|R
50|$|In 1907 the Huntingdon-Heberlein {{process plant}} was erected {{at a cost}} of £60,000. Extensive {{excavations}} were done and rails laid to ore bins on the hill opposite the main smelters. The process flow involved - rock breaker, converter kettles for 12 hours desulphurising process, then to the lead furnaces. A new electric plant was also installed.A new lead furnace was blown in on 21 January 1908. However in 1908 there was hardly a mine operating outside of the company mines as an outcome of wage increases with the emergence of unions and declining copper prices. The new copper furnace was blown in on 20 February 1908 and the converter plant was operating effectively by early March that year. Much better lead recoveries were noticeable after the second converter was introduced into the line, and ores had to be preliminarily roasted as well. At a cost of £70,000 the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company Pty Limited could treat sulphide ores from its Mungana mines as well as public ore. They could also treat the Penzance (Redcap), Boomerang (Calcifer) and Calcifer <b>slag</b> <b>dump</b> material, along with self-fluxing mixture with Ruddygore ore. To achieve this the company had to extend its tramline from the Chillagoe railway at Harper Siding to the Boomerang and Calcifer <b>slag</b> <b>dump.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kuridala Township, Hampden Smelter and Mining Complex {{features}} extensive {{archaeological evidence}} relating {{to a wide}} range of mining activities. The early smelter works are the most complete works of this type in North Queensland. The Hampden Smelter is equipped with a rare, early water-jacket blast furnace, which is now unique as the only surviving example of its type in Queensland. A large, intact and well-formed <b>slag</b> <b>dump</b> at the site is second only in size to the dump at Chillagoe smelters. Archaeological examination of the smelter works will provide an understanding of the technology and practices in early copper processing in Queensland.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} grouping of the smelter, <b>slag</b> <b>dump,</b> railway and township is unique. The natural {{environment of the}} Six Mile Creek valley is a most significant and distinguishing feature of the place giving it a picturesque setting.

50|$|At the KM3 site are mines, <b>slag</b> <b>dumps,</b> ore-processing areas, {{industrial}} refuse dumps, and smelting furnaces. Smelting furnaces were abundant, although recent farming {{practices in}} the core of the industrial site had disturbed some furnaces. The KM3 furnaces are more consistent in design and contents than the KM2 furnace pits. The furnace bowls are larger and more regular in size than the KM2 furnaces, with a mean diameter of 113.8 cm, ranging only from 112 to 116 cm. The mean depth of 28 cm among KM3 furnace pits is significantly greater than the mean depth of 18 cm at KM2, a difference attributable to the more complete preservation at KM3.|$|R
30|$|Heavy metal (loid) (HM) {{accumulation}} in {{the soil}} and the HM spatiotemporal distribution have important implication for soil pollution prevention and remediation. The present study investigated the concentrations and spatiotemporal distributions of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As) in the topsoil of a coal chemical plant in Ningxia Autonomous region (Ningxia), China. Topsoil samples (n[*]=[*] 153) were obtained using the checkerboard method, and the HM concentrations were determined. The soil residual rates of the five HMs were measured with leaching experiments and were applied in a soil environmental capacity model to predict the quantitative variation of the HM concentrations. The predicted results were employed to estimate the HM spatiotemporal distribution within 20  years with the Kriging technique. The number of sampling sites, where all five HM concentrations exceed their corresponding background values in Ningxia, would be increased from 0 to 90 % within 10  years of the plant operation. In addition, Pb and Cd were distributed along the traffic routes. Mercury and As were distributed near fuel gas emission vents. Chromium was mainly accumulated in <b>slag</b> <b>dumps.</b> The study may provide the theoretical and practical foundation for future HM pollution control in coal chemical plants.|$|R

Great heaps of <b>slag</b> and <b>dumps</b> of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts of the collieries towering above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden houses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in light, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent halting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|By this time, Szilva had {{independently}} researched his idea, and {{had concluded}} that it could indeed be a viable and worthwhile project.

On December 11, 1963, he purchased 17.5 acre of land from Walter Holdich for $1,000.00 with a $25.00 down payment. The land was ideal because of its unique location between Sudbury and Copper Cliff. To the west, the large, rocky mountain provided a sensational view of the INCO mining and smelting complex, including the nightly <b>slag</b> <b>dump,</b> while to the east one had a beautiful view of the city of Sudbury.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A plan {{of action}} is {{proposed}} to develop uses of non-ferrous slag and production of certain industrial materials from this waste material. A review of chemistry of non-ferrous slags suggested {{that it can be}} reprocessed to impart "cementitious " properties and furthermore an advantage could be taken of their latent "pozzolonaic " properties to test several potential applications such as- clinker ingredient, asphalt concrete additive, cemented mine backfill and binder for base stabilization. The authors note that in the last century blast furnace slag was considered as a "waste " product whose stocks grew at an alarming rate due to decades of accumulation and iron producers had to develop uses of this material to avoid a potentially catastrophic environmental situation. Non-ferrous slag producers could emulate this example set by the iron producers who successfully converted a "waste " into a "byproduct". Environmental concerns of the new millennium demand that the industry should find ways and means of depleting the ever-growing stockpiles of non-ferrous slag. The authors conclude that serious considerations from environmental and economic fronts favor reclamation of old <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> as well as processing of new non-ferrous slag as a viable alternative to the existing dumping practice. 1...|$|R
40|$|Lichens {{appear to}} be {{essential}} and effective colonisers of bare substrates including the extremely contaminated wastes of <b>slag</b> <b>dumps.</b> This study examines the metal accumulation capacity of epilithic lichens growing directly {{on the surface of}} artificial slag sinters. Four species representing different growth forms, i. e., crustose Candelariella aurella, Lecanora muralis, and Lecidea fuscoatra and fruticose Stereocaulon nanodes, were selected to evaluate the relationships between zinc, lead, cadmium, and nickel contents in their thalli and host substrates. Bioaccumulation factors of examined crustose lichens showed their propensity to hyperaccumulate heavy metals. Contrarily, concentrations of metals in fruticose thalli of S. nanodes were, as a rule, lower than in the corresponding substrates. This indicates that the growth form of thalli and degree of thallus adhesion to the substrate has a significant impact on metal concentrations in lichens colonising post-smelting wastes. Nonlinear regression models described by power functions show that at greater levels of Pb concentration in the substrate, the ability of C. aurella, L. muralis and L. fuscoatra to accumulate the metal experiences a relative decrease, whereas hyperbolic function describes a similar trend in relation to Ni content in S. nanodes. This phenomenon may be an important attribute of lichens that facilitates their colonisation of the surface of slag wastes...|$|R
40|$|The copper {{smelting}} site S 1 in the Eisenerzer Ramsau Valley, Styria, is {{the largest}} Bronze Age copper smelting site excavated in the Eastern Alps. The site was almost completely excavated from 1992 to 2006 and ten roasting hearths, six double furnaces, a number of pits of variable size, form and function, and three separate <b>slag</b> <b>dumps</b> have been recorded. The use of this smelting site covers the whole period of the Middle Bronze Age from the 16 th to the 13 th century BC and might extend {{as far as the}} 11 th century BC. The aim of this archaeometallurgical study is the reconstruction of the smelting process at this site and the discovery of possible diachronic changes or developments in the technology of smelting during the different phases of use. Therefore slags of the different archaeological phases were analysed for their chemical and mineralogical composition. A few slags were analysed with Mössbauer spectroscopy to obtain further information about the conditions during the smelting process. The results of the analyses show that nearly all slags belong to one particular step of the smelting process which was the production of raw copper or copper matte under reducing conditions at temperatures around 1250 °C...|$|R
