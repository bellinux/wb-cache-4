25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is {{significantly related to the}} wish to be held in high esteem. <b>Sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> behavior among young men has been linked with gang membership and having delinquent peers. Research also suggests that men with <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> peers are also much more likely to report coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> peers. Gang rape is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing short skirts or frequenting bars.|$|E
25|$|Most rape {{research}} and reports of rape {{are limited to}} male-female forms of rape. Research on male-on-male and female-on-male rape is rare. Fewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported. As a group, males who have been raped by either gender often get little services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped {{to deal with this}} type of crime. Instances in which the perpetrator is female, are not clear and lead to the denial of women being sexual aggressors. This could obscure the dimensions of the problem. Research also suggests that men with <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> peers have a higher chance of reporting coercive or forced sexual intercourse outside gang circles than men without such <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> peers.|$|E
25|$|Childhood {{environments that}} are {{physically}} violent, emotionally unsupportive and characterized by competition for scarce resources {{have been associated}} with sexual violence. <b>Sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> behavior in young men, for instance, has been linked to witnessing family violence, and having emotionally distant and uncaring fathers. Men raised in families with strongly patriarchal structures {{are also more likely to}} become violent, to rape and use sexual coercion against women, as well as to abuse their intimate partners, than men raised in homes that are more egalitarian.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} a {{commercial}} success, {{though it was}} highly controversial for its portrayal of black men (many played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> towards white women, and the portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force. There were widespread African-American protests against The Birth of a Nation, such as in Boston, while thousands of white Bostonians flocked to see the film. The NAACP spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to ban the film. Griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce Intolerance the following year.|$|E

30|$|Men’s misperception of a {{potential}} female partner’s sexual interest {{is not only a}} normative phenomenon affecting a majority of men but also {{a potential}}ly clinically relevant phenomenon. Misperception is associated both theoretically and empirically among men with an increased risk of exhibiting <b>sexually</b> coercive and <b>aggressive</b> behavior, as commonly indicated by endorsement of rape-supportive attitudes (e.g., Murnen et al., 2002). Consistent with the findings observed in the two prior studies using the same continuous-rating judgment paradigm but decontextualized women (Treat et al., in press, under review), rape-supportive attitudes in the current study were associated negatively with reliance on affective information and positively with reliance on attractiveness information, both at a moderate level (ds[*]=[*]− 0.56, 0.46). In contrast, but also consistent with prior work, rape-supportive attitudes showed a weak positive association with reliance on clothing style that was not statistically significant (d[*]=[*] 0.15). New to the current work, those endorsing more rape-supportive attitudes showed a weak, non-significant tendency toward increased reliance on contextual sexual relevance when judging women’s momentary sexual interest (d[*]=[*] 0.22). Overall, {{these findings are consistent with}} theoretical perspectives suggesting that sexual-perception processes may increase risk for <b>sexually</b> coercive and <b>aggressive</b> behavior (Abbey et al., 2011; Farris et al., 2008 b). In particular, reduced focus on women’s affect and elevated focus on women’s attractiveness—that is, possibly confusing one’s own feelings of sexual interest with a potential partner’s feelings of sexual interest (Maner et al., 2005, 2012)—appear to be problematic. Fortunately, trial-by-trial feedback strongly enhanced affective utilization and moderately reduced attractiveness utilization when judging the sexual interest of decontextualized women, even among higher-risk men who endorsed rape-supportive attitudes 1 SD above the mean (Treat et al., in press).|$|R

40|$|In vertebrates, melanin-based {{coloration}} {{is often}} associated with variation in physiological and behavioural traits. We propose that this association stems from pleiotropic effects of the genes regulating the synthesis of brown to black eumelanin. The most important regulators are the melanocortin 1 receptor and its ligands, the melanocortin agonists and the agouti-signalling protein antagonist. On the basis of the physiological and behavioural functions of the melanocortins, we predict five categories of traits correlated with melanin-based coloration. A review of the literature indeed reveals that, as predicted, darker wild vertebrates are more <b>aggressive,</b> <b>sexually</b> active and resistant to stress than lighter individuals. Pleiotropic effects of the melanocortins might thus account for the widespread covariance between melanin-based coloration and other phenotypic traits in vertebrates...|$|R

25|$|Polyandry {{may also}} impose costs on females, exposing them to diseases, {{increased}} predation risk, {{time and energy}} costs, and even physical harm due to sexual harassment. Polyandrous females encounter sexual harassment when courted by males resulting to be costly to females. In {{order to reduce the}} costs to the females, females will take part in polyandry. For example, in the bee species Anthidium maculosum, like in many other species, the high cost of resisting mating may exceed the cost of accepting numerous males in a breeding if copulating takes a short time, and therefore females in some species are inclined to being polyandrous. In the polyandrous system, sexual coercion has been observed {{to be one of the}} major reasons for why females begin to mate with multiple males to outweigh the cost under different circumstances. The sexual conflict hypothesis suggest that polyandry can occur due to sexual coercion preventing females from obtaining any benefits. Sexual coercion has been seen in three different forms: forced copulation, sexual harassment, and intimidation. Forced copulation is seen in those males that cannot gain access to females for mating. As a result of the lack of access to mates, males are more likely to engage in <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> behaviors that could result in physical harm and death for females, as has been observed in elephant seals and ducks. Intimidation was seen in social primates, who coerce females into mating, therefore, pushing them to mate with their own aggressor. Males use intimidation as a method of punishment in females that do not mate with them.|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{inhibition}} {{has been}} studied extensively in insects but this research area remains very poorly developed in spiders. Once mated, females of many jumping spider species become <b>sexually</b> unreceptive and <b>aggressive</b> toward males but the mechanisms responsible for this sexual inhibition are unknown. We assessed the mating frequency of 88 Servaea incana (Araneae: Salticidae) females from maturation until death. Virgin females were highly receptive but sexual inhibition was induced immediately after their first copulation; females became aggressive towards their first mate and almost always rejected courtship from subsequent males. Even after experimental removal of their first and second batches of eggs (simulating predation), females very rarely remated. Given low levels of female remating, virgin females are at an extreme premium for male reproductive fitness. We discuss results for two sexual inhibition experiments in S. incana and propose mechanisms that might mediate sexual inhibition in this jumping spider.

5000|$|Again, in a Western context, these {{gender roles}} also {{carry over to}} dictate sexual actions and behaviours. For example, a male gender role {{suggests}} dominance and aggression, which also carries over into a male sexual role, whereby the male {{is expected to be}} <b>sexually</b> dominant and <b>aggressive.</b> These ideologies were inherent within both male and female gendered sexual roles of the 1950s and 60s, whereby a husband was expected to sexually dominate his wife. These roles, however, have changed; there is also strong evidence to suggest that they will continue to change over time. This being said, social role theory, then, seems to also suggests that any non-heterosexual identity does not properly align with these gendered sexual roles and is not as accepted. This is also known as heteronormativity, which can be defined as [...] "...the normalising of heterosexual structures and relationships and the marginalisation of everything that doesn't conform" [...] (p. 142).|$|R
40|$|The sexes {{experience}} different selective pressures, {{which can}} lead to highly divergent phenotypes that are achieved via sex-biased gene expression. The effect of sexual dimorphism on the degree of sex-bias in gene expression can be studied in species characterized by sexually selected alternative male phenotypes. We analyzed gene expression in the bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini (Acari, Acaridae), in which more <b>sexually</b> dimorphic, <b>aggressive</b> fighter males, possessing thickened legs of the third pair which are used to kill rivals, coexist with unarmored scrambler males. We sequenced transcriptomes of adult females and both types of males and de-novo assembled 114, 456 transcriptome-based gene models (TGMs). Significantly more TGMs had male-biased expression than female-biased expression. Among TGMs that were over expressed in one, but not both, male morphs (compared to expression in females), we found about four times more fighter-biased genes than scrambler-biased genes. This demonstrates that the degree of expression bias reflects the degree of sexually selected dimorphism. However, the number of sex-biased genes was much higher than the number of genes differentially expressed between male morphs, and most male-biased genes were shared between morphs, suggesting that selection pressures act similarly on males irrespective of their morph. Furthermore, we found that male-biased genes evolved at a faster rate than female-biased genes, as evidenced by a higher rate of both gene-turnover and amino acid substitution, indicating that sexual selection, acting more strongly on males, accelerates the rate of molecular evolution. Interestingly, gene turnover was relatively higher, but amino acid substitution rate relatively lower among fighter-biased genes, suggesting that different components of sexual selection may have different effects on the evolution of sex-biased genes...|$|R
500|$|Paid to Love {{is notable}} in Hawks's filmography {{as being the}} only time that he made a highly stylized, {{experimental}} film. He attempted to imitate the style of German film director F. W. Murnau, who had recently made The Last Laugh and Sunrise and was the most critically acclaimed director in Hollywood. Hawks's film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by German Expressionist cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented [...] "It isn't my type of stuff, at least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera to do those things: Now the camera's somebody's eyes." [...] Hawks worked on the script with Seton I. Miller, with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars George O'Brien as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, William Powell as his happy-go-lucky brother and Virginia Valli as Michael's flapper love interest Dolores. The characters played by Valli and O'Brien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> showgirl, who is an early prototype of the [...] "Hawksian woman", and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. Paid to Love was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927, when it was financially unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|Factors {{increasing}} men's risk {{of committing}} rape include {{alcohol and other}} drug consumption, being more likely to consider victims responsible for their rape, being less knowledgeable {{about the impact of}} rape on victims, being impulsive and having antisocial tendencies, having an exaggerated sense of masculinity, having a low opinion on women, being a member of a criminal gang, having <b>sexually</b> <b>aggressive</b> friends, having been abused as a child and having been raised in a strongly patriarchal family.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that sexual assault trials, as well as rape itself may be {{influenced}} by cultural narratives of men as sexual instigators.

50|$|A {{survey by}} the UK National Union of Teachers {{suggests}} that sexual bullying is most often carried out by boys against girls, although girls are increasingly harassing girls and boys in a sexual manner. Research shows that sexual bullying starts at primary school level and usually {{takes the form of}} verbal insults by boys directed at girls and women through demeaning <b>sexually</b> abusive and <b>aggressive</b> language. A NUT study shows that these verbal insults are generally centred on girls’ sexual status including terms such as ‘bitch’, ‘slag’, ‘tart’ and ‘slut’. Other researchers cite similar evidence. These incidents are typically dismissed as playful behaviour or justified through humour, however. The research also shows that boys are also subjected to a range of sexual bullying by other boys and by girls although this is said to be less obvious. The most prevalent issue is sexual verbal abuse and being called obscene names. The names that cause most offence to boys are homophobic terms and those that are associated with the ‘absence’ of high status masculinity. Sexual bullying can involve spreading rumours about someone's sexuality or sex life, or showing or posting sexual comments, photos, or videos, such as revenge porn.|$|R
40|$|Trait {{evolution}} via {{sexual selection}} {{has traditionally been}} viewed as isolated from life–history constraints. Recent theoretical treatments, however, predict that costly sexually selected characters should be mediated by the same allocational trade–offs that apply to more conventional aspects of reproductive investment. Participation in risky competitive behaviours, for example male–male combat, should therefore increase as the opportunity for future reproduction declines. However, the demonstration of such trade–offs {{has proven to be}} elusive due to concomitant age–based variation in the physical determinants of fighting ‘ability’. Here, I exploit the unique nature of a butterfly contest system to provide compelling evidence for lifetime partitioning of risky and <b>aggressive</b> <b>sexually</b> selected behaviours. I show that male Hypolimnas bolina become more willing to persist in contests over mating territories, and more generally accepting of injury risks, as they age. Contest persistence in this species is not mediated simply by physical condition, and I experimentally isolate the effect of ageing per se from resource ownership and previous contest experience. These results demonstrate how sexually selected behaviours can be ultimately mediated by a shifting trade–off between contemporary reproductive effort and future opportunities...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} 1962, {{what would}} become the British rock scene had started with beat groups like the Beatles, Gerry & the Pacemakers and the Searchers from Liverpool and Freddie and the Dreamers, Herman's Hermits and the Hollies from Manchester. They drew {{on a wide range of}} American {{influences}} including soul, rhythm and blues and surf music, initially reinterpreting standard American tunes and playing for dancers. Bands like the Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast, and particularly those from London like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music. Soon these groups were composing their own material, combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat. Beat bands tended towards [...] "bouncy, irresistible melodies", while early British blues acts tended towards less <b>sexually</b> innocent, more <b>aggressive</b> songs, often adopting an anti-establishment stance. There was, however, particularly in the early stages, considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies.

30|$|Inspection of the {{variance-covariance matrix}} for random participant-specific effects {{suggests}} that the underlying structure of men’s perceptions of women’s nonverbal, dating-relevant cues may be two-dimensional, rather than four-dimensional, {{as would be expected}} if participants relied completely independently on the four stimulus dimensions. Indeed, a principal components analysis of the model-estimated utilization coefficients for the four dimensions extracted two components that accounted for 86.5 % of the variability in the data (eigenvalues (λs)[*]=[*] 1.87, 1.59). Attractiveness and affect utilizations correlated 0.94 and − 0.92 with the first component, whereas clothing style and contextual sexual relevance utilizations correlated 0.90 and 0.88 with the second component, and all cross-loading correlations were less than | 0.30 |. It is interesting that the relations between rape-supportive attitudes and cue utilization that have emerged across studies are stronger for affect and attractiveness than for clothing style and for contextual sexual relevance (Treat et al., in press, under review). Pending replication of this potential cue-utilization structure, risk for exhibiting <b>sexually</b> coercive and <b>aggressive</b> behavior may be linked more strongly to the first than the second component. If so, then the conflation of utilization of affect and attractiveness information might prove to be another fruitful target for cognitive-training programs.|$|R
30|$|Sexual perception—that is, perceiving someone’s {{level of}} sexual {{interest}} in a particular person at a particular point in time—is a common, difficult, and potentially consequential task. Most of the time, a man’s misperception of a woman’s level of sexual interest will be a minor but potentially embarrassing social error, in which he either perceives a woman to be more interested than she actually is or perceives a woman to be less interested than she actually is. More importantly, however, sexual misperception also is associated both theoretically and empirically with an increased likelihood of <b>sexually</b> coercive and <b>aggressive</b> behavior toward acquaintances, whether indexed by a self-reported history of aggression or endorsement of rape-supportive attitudes (for more recent reviews of this extensive empirical literature, see Abbey, Jacques-Tiura, & LeBreton, 2011, and Farris, Treat, Viken, & McFall, 2008 a). Standardized social-perception tasks using numerous, well-characterized, full-body photographs of college women allow examination of both nomothetic and idiographic aspects of sexual perception—that is, both average (i.e., nomothetic) sexual perception and individual differences in (i.e., idiographic) sexual perception—under highly controlled conditions. To date, work under these conditions has focused primarily on characteristics of the women being perceived and of the men doing the perceiving when accounting for variability in sexual perception. The current study extends prior research by rigorously evaluating {{the role of the}} social-environmental context in sexual perception while controlling for women’s nonverbal affect, the perceived provocativeness of women’s clothing, and women’s normative attractiveness, as well as their interactions.|$|R
30|$|College men judging women’s current sexual {{interest}} rely {{not only on}} nonverbal information in women’s facial expressions and body language {{but also on the}} perceived provocativeness of women's clothing and women’s normative attractiveness. Independently of these more woman-specific influences, men also rely on the sexual relevance of the environmental context to draw inferences about women’s momentary {{sexual interest}}. Reliance on non-affective indicators of sexual interest may set the stage for unwanted advances or even <b>sexually</b> coercive or <b>aggressive</b> behavior, particularly among men at greater risk of such behavior, who rely less than their peers on affective cues and more than their peers on attractiveness. Across men, usage of attractiveness cues is strongly associated with neglect of affective cues, but use of these two cues is relatively independent of the use of cues of dress or environmental context, suggesting that an underlying structure may govern utilization of these cues. These findings underscore the potential nomothetic and idiographic utility of developing and evaluating comprehensive cognitive-training programs that are designed to enhance college men’s relative focus on women’s affect versus attractiveness and to reduce their focus on the more environmental characteristics of women’s clothing style and contextual sexual relevance. Ultimately, such training programs might prove useful as an adjunct to prevention programs for sexual aggression on college campuses, where existing approaches to this serious behavioral-health problem have proven to be inadequate (e.g., Anderson & Whiston, 2005; DeGue et al., 2014).|$|R
