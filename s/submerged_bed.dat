The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The UASB reactors demonstrated {{that they were not}} appropriate for efficiently removing the assessed compounds from the sewage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was an important parameter for the removal of the hydrophilic and less biodegradable compounds, such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The post-treatment units substantially increased the removal of most target micropollutants present in the anaerobic effluents, with a greater removal of micropollutants in simplified systems that require a large construction area, such as the <b>submerged</b> <b>bed</b> and polishing ponds, probably because of the higher HRT employed. Alternatively, compact post-treatment systems, such as trickling filters, tended to be less effective at removing most of the micropollutants studied, and the type of packing proved to be crucial for determining the fate of such compounds using trickling filters...|$|E

In this study we investigate the feasibility to constrain a fluid mechanics-based flow model for defining stream flow rating curves with remotely sensed topographic data from airborne LiDAR scanning.

Together with larger, eroded inorganic sediments and coarse organic particles, these materials comprise the sediments underlying macrophyte communities. Thirty-four littoral sites were sampled in Lake Memphremagog (Quebec-Vermont) to quantify the role of morphometry (littoral slope and site exposure) and macrophyte beds (mean biomass and biomass density) on the accumulation of sediments. An established historical marker, stable Pb, was used to date the sediments (approx. 110 years) and calculate rates of accumulation (SARs). Identifiable stable Pb profiles were obtained at two-thirds of the sites confirming the utility and robustness of littoral sediment core analysis. Multiple regression analyses showed that macrophyte parameters were the best predictors of SARs. Macrophyte mean biomass and biomass density were clearly most important in predicting the volume (total SAR) and organic content (organic SAR) of the sediments ($R sp 2 = 0. 57 rm to 0. 76 $, $P< 0. 001 $). The same macrophyte parameters, however, poorly predicted the bulk (mainly inorganic) accumulation of sediments. Biomass density was solely related to the long-term accumulation of stable Pb in the sediments supporting empirical models that credit growth form as an important factor explaining among species or among weedbed variability in sediment-plant tissue elemental concentrations.

40|$|Accurate stream {{discharge}} measurements {{are important for}} many hydrological studies. In remote locations, however, {{it is often difficult}} to obtain stream flow information because of the difficulty in making the discharge measurements necessary to define stage-discharge relationships (rating curves). This study investigates the feasibility of defining rating curves by using a fluid mechanics-based model constrained with topographic data from an airborne LiDAR scanning. The study was carried out for an 8 m-wide channel in the boreal landscape of northern Sweden. LiDAR data were used to define channel geometry above a low flow water surface along the 90 -m surveyed reach. The channel topography below the water surface was estimated using the simple assumption of a flat streambed. The roughness for the modelled reach was back calculated from a single measurment of discharge. The topographic and roughness information was then used to model a rating curve. To isolate the potential influence of the flat bed assumption, a ‘hybrid model’ rating curve was developed on the basis of data combined from the LiDAR scan and a detailed ground survey. Whereas this hybrid model rating curve was in agreement with the direct measurements of discharge, the LiDAR model rating curve was equally in agreement with the medium and high flow measurements based on confidence intervals calculated from the direct measurements. The discrepancy between the LiDAR model rating curve and the low flow measurements was likely due to reduced roughness associated with unresolved <b>submerged</b> <b>bed</b> topography. Scanning during periods of low flow can help minimize this deficiency. These results suggest that combined ground surveys and LiDAR scans or multifrequency LiDAR scans that see ‘below’ the water surface (bathymetric LiDAR) could be useful in generating data needed to run such a fluid mechanics-based model.

Salinity did not inhibit nitrification at 3. 7 g/L, while ammonia oxidation activity significantly decreased and nitrite was consequently accumulated in the SFBBR when the salt concentration was ¿ 24. 1 g/L. The sequencing of amoA genes revealed that many of the OTUs found in the control experiment were still present at the full range of NaCl studied, while concentrations of 24. 1 and 44. 1 g of NaCl/L promoted the emergence of new OTUs phylogenetically related to AOB described in saline environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{characteristics of}} a laboratory <b>submerged</b> packed <b>bed,</b> filled with a volcanic stone, pozzuolana, have been experimentally investigated through tracer tests. Sets of essays at flow rates from 1 to 2. 5 l/h in clean conditions were performed. The results showed {{a considerable amount of}} dispersion through the filter as the hydraulic loading was changed, indicating a multiplicity of hydrodynamic states, approaching its behavior to plug flow. An analytical solution for the advection-dispersion equation model have been developed for a semi-infinite system and we have considered an appropriate physical boundary condition. A numerical simulation using finite difference schemes is done taking into account this particular boundary condition that changes according to the flow rates. Proper formulation of boundary conditions for analysis of column displacements experiments in the laboratory is critically important to the interpretation of observed data, as well as for subsequent extrapolation of the experimental results to transport problems in the field...|$|R
40|$|Salinity {{is known}} to {{influence}} the performance of biological wastewater treatment plants. While its impact on bacterial communities has been thoroughly studied, its influence on fungal communities has been largely overlooked. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the effect of saline influents (0, 3. 7, 24. 1 and 44. 1. g. NaCl/L) on the community structure and diversity of fungi in a <b>submerged</b> fixed <b>bed</b> bioreactor (SFBBR). For this purpose, {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and 454 -pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified fungal 18 S rRNA gene fragments and ITS regions, respectively, were used. Significant differences in the fungal community structure were found in relation to the NaCl concentration. Fungal diversity increased as salinity increased to a concentration up to 24. 1. g. NaCl/L, but was significantly reduced at 44. 1. g. NaCl/L. Basidiomycota dominated the fungal community in the absence of NaCl but decreased in relative abundance with increasing salinity, being replaced progressively by Ascomycota. </p...|$|R
