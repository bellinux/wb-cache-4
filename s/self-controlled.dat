5|$|Van der Weyden {{may have}} drawn {{influence}} from Stefan Lochner's c.1435 Last Judgement, {{and a similar}} c.1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great Deësis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled with dread and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but <b>self-controlled</b> dignity of his best works. This is most evident {{in the manner in}} which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.|$|E

25|$|Rama {{had three}} brothers, {{according}} to the Balakhanda section of the Ramayana. These were Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. The extant manuscripts of the text describes their education and training as young princes, but this is brief. Rama is portrayed as a polite, <b>self-controlled,</b> virtuous youth always ready to help others. His education included the Vedas, the Vedangas {{as well as the}} martial arts.|$|E
25|$|The latter type, more {{formally}} {{described as}} <b>self-controlled</b> case-series studies, divide individual patient follow-up time into exposed and unexposed periods and use fixed-effects Poisson regression processes {{to compare the}} incidence rate of a given outcome between exposed and unexposed periods. This technique has been extensively {{used in the study}} of adverse reactions to vaccination, and has been shown in some circumstances to provide statistical power comparable to that available in cohort studies.|$|E
25|$|The average woman {{living in}} a rural area in India has little or no control over {{becoming}} pregnant. Women, particularly women in rural areas, {{do not have access to}} safe and <b>self-controlled</b> methods of contraception. The public health system emphasises permanent methods like sterilisation, or long-term methods like IUDs that do not need follow-up. Sterilisation accounts for more than 75% of total contraception, with female sterilisation accounting for almost 95% of all sterilisations. The contraceptive prevalence rate for 2007/2008 was estimated at 54.8%.|$|E
25|$|Though a {{significant}} percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as ASIMO and Meinü robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, <b>self-controlled</b> cars, Ernst Dickmanns' driverless car, and the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge, are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information. Most of these robots employ a GPS navigation device with waypoints, along with radar, sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar, video cameras, and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints.|$|E
25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a <b>self-controlled</b> man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} created in 1978 when Great American Recreation (GAR), the new owners of the {{recently}} combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, {{wanted to do something}} with the ski area during the off season. Two years earlier, in 1976, they had followed the trend of many other ski areas at the time and opened a -long alpine slide down very steep ski trails. Gradually, Waterworld and Motorworld came together {{at the base of the}} mountain to form one of North America's earliest modern water parks, which was originally called the Vernon Valley Summer Park. They started out with two water slides and a LOLA race car track in the summer of 1978, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year, as well as tennis courts and a softball field. Finally, Motorworld was carved out of the swampy areas the ski area owned across Route 94. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, <b>self-controlled</b> rides and 40 water slides).|$|E
500|$|The couple {{married on}} July 2, 1931, at Salt Lake City Temple. They would have four children: Margo Lynn (born 1935), Jane LaFount (born 1938), George Scott (born 1941), and Willard Mitt (born 1947). [...] The couple's {{marriage}} reflected {{aspects of their}} personalities and courtship. [...] George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note. [...] George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more <b>self-controlled</b> Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him. [...] The couple quarreled {{so much as a}} result that their grandchildren would later nickname them [...] "the Bickersons", but in the end, their closeness would allow them to settle arguments amicably.|$|E

500|$|English theologian Richard Holt Hutton {{summarized}} the poem as Tennyson's [...] "friendly {{picture of the}} insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when {{under the control of}} a luminous reason and a <b>self-controlled</b> will." [...] The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech [...] "the least plain, the most un-Homeric, which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air." [...] A bit later, journalist and apologist Gilbert Keith Chesterton saw Ulysses as a [...] "tribute to Christianity" [...] as getting {{to the heart of the}} remarkable difference between the outlook of Antiquity and the Christian-shaped modern one, remarking: [...] "The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander. But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all. He desires to get home." ...|$|E
500|$|The Joker {{is obsessed}} with Batman, the pair {{representing}} a yin-yang of opposing dark and light force; although it is the Joker who represents humor and color and Batman who dwells in the dark. Murder, theft, and terrorism, no crime is beyond the Joker, and his exploits are a theatrical performance that are funny to him alone. Spectacle {{is more important than}} success for the Joker, and if it is not spectacular it is boring. Although the Joker claims indifference to everything, he secretly craves Batman's attention and validation. The character was described as having killed over 2,000 people in [...] (1996). Despite this body count, he is always found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity and sent to Arkham Asylum, avoiding the death penalty. Many of the Joker's acts attempt to force Batman to kill; if the most orderly and <b>self-controlled</b> of humans can murder, anyone is capable of becoming a monster like the Joker. The villain displays no instinct for self-preservation, and is willing to die to prove his point. The Joker is the [...] "personification of the irrational", and represents [...] "everything Batman [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Governing (Rulers or Philosopher Kings)– {{those who}} are intelligent, rational, <b>self-controlled,</b> in love with wisdom, well suited to make {{decisions}} for the community. These correspond to the [...] "reason" [...] part of the soul and are very few.|$|E
2500|$|Doris Kearns Goodwin {{was struck}} by the emotion that the usually <b>self-controlled</b> Obama showed during the speech. [...] "He did exactly what the moment called for, {{in a way that was}} {{consistent}} with him as a cerebral president. It was a completely authentic moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1946 the USAAF {{began work}} on Project Mastiff, a nuclear armed air-to-surface drone or <b>self-controlled</b> air-to-surface missile. Northrop Corporation, Bell, and Republic Aviation were invited by the USAAF to submit {{proposals}} for Mastiff. Bell was awarded a feasibility study contract by the USAAF on 1 April 1946.

His most notable roles include the lonely policeman in [...] Chungking Express (1994), a gay Chinese expatriate living in Argentina in Happy Together (1997), and a <b>self-controlled</b> victim of adultery in In the Mood for Love (2000) for which he won the Best Actor award at Cannes. He trained for five years in wing chun to prepare {{for his role as}} Yip Man in Wong's The Grandmaster.|$|E
2500|$|After {{being turned}} into a vampire, she {{describes}} having a much clearer view of the world. She is also very <b>self-controlled,</b> being able to ignore the scent of human blood on her first hunting trip. Bella's private mind that was able to repel some vampires' mental abilities while she was human evolved after she became a vampire; her skill strengthened, allowing her to shield herself and those around her from other vampires' mental gifts. By the end of Breaking Dawn, {{she is able to}} cast the shield away from herself. She is also described by Edward as [...] "very graceful", even for a vampire, in comparison to her earlier clumsiness.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a famous}} {{scientist}} {{and director of}} the Smithsonian Institution, Henry received visits from other scientists and inventors who sought his advice. Henry was patient, kindly, <b>self-controlled,</b> and gently humorous. One such visitor was Alexander Graham Bell, who on 1 March 1875 carried a letter of introduction to Henry. Henry showed an interest in seeing Bell's experimental apparatus, and Bell returned the following day. After the demonstration, Bell mentioned his untested theory on how to transmit human speech electrically by means of a [...] "harp apparatus" [...] which would have several steel reeds tuned to different frequencies to cover the voice spectrum. Henry said Bell had [...] "the germ of a great invention". Henry advised Bell not to publish his ideas until he had perfected the invention. When Bell objected that he lacked the necessary knowledge, Henry firmly advised: [...] "Get it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{philosophical}} {{work was}} influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight. In re-animating Plato, she gives force {{to the reality of}} the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. [...] From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre and Wittgenstein ('early' and 'late'). [...] Her most central parable, which appears in The Sovereignty of Good, asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), [...] "to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a <b>self-controlled</b> Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D." [...] This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D [...] "justly or lovingly". [...] The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the 'inner' life to moral action. [...] Seeing another aright can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.|$|E

60|$|It is {{the curious}} {{instinct}} which prompts {{most people to}} rub a thing in that makes the lot of the average convert an unhappy one. Only the very <b>self-controlled</b> can refrain from improving the occasion and scoring off the convert. Most leap at the opportunity.|$|E
60|$|Michael it was, less {{travelled}} in {{the world}} than Jerry, by nature not so <b>self-controlled,</b> who threw the play-acting of dignity to the wind, and, with shrill whinings of emotion, with body-wrigglings of delight, flashed out his tongue of love and shouldered his brother roughly in eagerness to get near to him.|$|E

60|$|He stopped, half in pity of his adversary's shame, half in {{surprise}} {{of his own}} calmness.

He wondered at and partly admired his own coolness now, in the presence of his enemy's confusion.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{of the men}} sat down: {{they stood}} facing one another now across the table whereon stood a couple of tallow candles which threw fitful, yellow lights on their faces--so different, so strangely contrasted--young and well-looking both--both {{strongly}} moved by passion, yet one entirely <b>self-controlled,</b> while in the other's eyes that passion glowed fierce and resentful.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not a}} task {{to which}} many would have looked forward. Most of those who {{came into contact with}} Andrew Westley were afraid of him. He was a capable rather than a lovable man, and too <b>self-controlled</b> to be quite human. There was no recoil in him, no {{reaction}} after anger, as there would have been in a hotter-tempered man. He thought before he acted, but, when he acted, never yielded a step.|$|E
60|$|There was the {{slightest}} contraction of Mr. Blunt’s facial muscles. Very slight; but I, {{staring at the}} narrator after the manner of all simple souls, noticed it; the twitch of a pain which surely must have been mental. There was also a suggestion of effort before he went on: “I suppose {{you know how he}} got hold of her?” in a tone of ease which was astonishingly ill-assumed for such a worldly, <b>self-controlled,</b> drawing-room person.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} she gazed at him with parted lips, and {{pressing}} her handkerchief to her eyes began silently to cry.
