25|$|The Schwalbe had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, {{with its}} mainwheels on a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> sprung by rubber cords to V-struts {{from the lower}} fuselage and stabilized centrally by a transverse V-strut. There was a short, steel tailskid.|$|E
25|$|The {{two-man crew}} sat in tandem in open cockpits. The rear observer's cockpit could be {{fitted with a}} ring machine gun {{mounting}} in case of serial production. The plane had a fixed, <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage, {{in front of the}} cab. It had a maximum capacity of 210 L, but the normal capacity was 190 L.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 had a {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage formed from steel tubing with internal wire bracing. Its cockpits were open. The undercarriage used {{a pair of}} internally sprung mainwheels with balloon tyres and a tailskid. A <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> was mounted on a short V-strut below the fuselage. On the prototype, the undercarriage main legs were short, mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and assisted by short forward struts. The second prototype and production aircraft had longer legs fixed to the upper longerons. The prototype and production series aircraft were powered, as {{the rules of the}} competition required, by a 105hp (78kW) Walter Junior four-cylinder inverted inline engine, although the second prototype was fitted with the more powerful 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major of the same configuration.|$|E
50|$|In split-axle designs, {{the wheel}} {{on each side}} is {{attached}} to a separate shaft. Modern passenger cars have <b>split</b> drive <b>axles.</b> In some designs, this allows independent suspension of the left and right wheels, and therefore a smoother ride. Even when the suspension is not independent, <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> permit the use of a differential, allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns, improving traction and extending tire life.|$|R
50|$|Some low floor {{streetcar}} designs use <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> (a separate half-axle for {{the wheel}} {{on each side}} of the car). Such streetcars are unsuitable for use with single-point switches as there would be no mechanism to transfer the force from the inner to outer wheels at switches.|$|R
50|$|The mainwheels of the J-6 were {{mounted on}} <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> {{from the lower}} central fuselage, with shock {{absorbers}} fixed to the upper longerons. The wheels were spatted and the shock absorbers, though not their upper extension rods, were faired. The conventional undercarriage had a steerable, partly faired tailskid.|$|R
2500|$|... 1954 saw the {{introduction}} of [...] the BSA Quick Release 3 Speed hub gear. [...] It was a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> three speed gear intended for use with bicycles equipped with oil bath chainguards. [...] The original BSA 3 speed hub gear had been made under licence from the Three-Speed Gear Syndicate since 1907. [...] The design was later to be classified as the Sturmey-Archer 'Type X', but all BSA hub gear production ceased in 1955 ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wib 12's engine, {{the same}} [...] {{water-cooled}} V-12 Hispano-Suiza 12Hb type as {{used by the}} Wib 8, was totally enclosed and drove a two blade propeller. [...] It was cooled by a retractable, half-cylindrical radiator on the fuselage underside {{at the back of}} the engine. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided. The fighter had a fixed conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> attached to the fuselage underside, supported by a pair of V-struts; there was a small tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{aircraft}} fuelled {{to fly the}} Atlantic {{was going}} to be heavy and undercarriage design was critical, as Martinsyde found to their cost. [...] The Atlantic used a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> arrangement: on each side the short main leg extended from below the forward and innermost interplane strut. [...] There was a second member back to below the aft interplane strut and an axle from the large single wheel upwards and inwards, hinged to the lower fuselage longeron. [...] Shocks were absorbed by a combination of oleo-pneumatic and bungee elastic components. [...] At 21ft 0 in (6.40 m) the track was very wide.|$|E
25|$|The Type O had an all-steel {{tailskid}} undercarriage, {{with a pair}} of spoked mainwheels on <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> hinged {{from the}} centre of a transverse rod mounted on four longitudinal V-struts, arranged as an inverted W from the inner, under-fuselage interplane struts. Rubber springs damped the movement of the outer ends and wheels on landing.|$|R
50|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{was fixed}} with the mainwheels under aircraft fairings and on <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> centrally {{mounted on a}} transverse V-strut from the central lower fuselage. The track was 2.70 m. Short, faired legs with rubber shock absorbers and drag struts were attached to the outer lower fuselage. The steerable tailskid also had a rubber damper.|$|R
50|$|It has fixed {{landing gear}} with small mainwheels mounted 1.1 m apart on <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> hinged from a central pylon below the main {{fuselage}} frame. Gas shock absorbers lean {{in from the}} axles' extremities to the lower frame. There is a small tailwheel. The Zingalo is fitted with a ballistic parachute mounted on the sloping fuselage member ahead of the pilot.|$|R
2500|$|All metal with fabric covering, the G.4/31 {{was a large}} single-engined single-bay biplane, with unswept, unequal-span {{wings of}} marked stagger. [...] Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slots; both wings were cut back to the rear spar at the centre section for visibility. [...] A pair of struts braced the two lower wing spars to the upper fuselage, from where another pair braced the upper rear spars; a {{separate}} pair of struts linked the forward spars of the upper wings to the forward fuselage. [...] There was a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> undercarriage, necessary for torpedo launching, [...] with its main legs connected to the front spar below the fuselage struts and braced for and aft to the lower fuselage. [...] Main wheel brakes were fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the Bernard 60 was conventional with {{a rounded}} fin and rudder and a tailplane with a swept leading edge mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. It had a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> undercarriage with single mainwheels mounted on V-form struts from the lower fuselage longerons and landing loads taken by vertical struts to the wing just inboard of the engines, combined with a tailskid. The trimotor Bernard 60 was unusual in having different engines in the nose and on the wings. [...] The central engine was a nine-cylinder, [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Ady Jupiter, with five cylinder, [...] Gnome-Rhône 5Bc Titan engines on the wings. [...] The designers would have preferred about 225kW (300hp) from each of three identical engines but early in 1929 there were no available homologated types of this power.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{changes were}} made during 1924. [...] The Douglas engine was {{replaced}} with a 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub II flat twin. [...] This more powerful motor was also lighter, lacking the reduction gear of the Douglas and therefore mounted in the extreme nose with propeller and exposed cylinders at wing level. [...] At {{about the same time}} the empennage was modified with a squarer tailplane, taller, less rounded [...] fin and square tipped rudder. [...] The leaf spring undercarriage was replaced with a lighter <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> unit carrying smaller wheels and braced with conspicuous V-struts to the wing roots. There were also modifications {{to the top of the}} fuselage, including the installation of a side hinged cockpit cover with an opening just large enough to allow the pilot's head to protrude.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936 Lachassagne {{introduced}} the AL 6. This {{was a close}} relative of the AL 5 but powered by a [...] Aubier-Dunne air-cooled, twin cylinder, inverted inline two-stroke engine. It was externally similar to the AL 5, though its dimensions and weights are not known, {{but it had a}} new undercarriage with <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> hinged on a transverse V-strut from the fuselage longerons.|$|R
50|$|All the {{vehicles}} were 2 axle bogieless designs {{with the exception}} of the original Tram number 101 which had a double bogie. No.101 was sold in 1916 to Erith Urban District Council. It was replaced by another Tram 101 delivered in 1923 which was an experimental design designed by the company's manager E S Rayner with cardan shaft drive to <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> via a differential.|$|R
2500|$|Though the MB.90 was {{intended}} to be Renault powered, it was initially flown with a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III air-cooled four cylinder inverted engine. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with its main wheels on V-form <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> hinged on the lower fuselage longerons. At their outer ends, vertical shock absorbing struts reached up to the forward wing struts, strengthened at that point by two further struts to the lower and upper fuselage.|$|R
2500|$|The closely cowled {{radial engine}} set the {{diameter}} of the H.26's short nose and drove a two blade propeller behind a very large diameter domed spinner. [...] The Salmson was initially cooled with a semi-circular Botali radiator {{to the rear of the}} engine but this proved ineffective and was replaced with a pair of Chaussons, one on each forward undercarriage leg. The H.26 had a fixed conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a centrally hinged <b>split</b> <b>axle,</b> enclosed within a lift-contributing wing-like fairing and supported by N-form struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons on each side. Originally, these were reinforced by long vertical struts from the shock absorber attachments to the upper wing central section. [...] These were discarded when the interplane wires were replaced by the faired interplane struts, which extended downwards to the rear undercarriage structure; the tops of the shock absorber struts were relocated to mid-fuselage on the engine mounting.|$|E
2500|$|The TSR.38 was {{a fabric}} covered all metal machine with steel sparred wings with {{duralumin}} and steel ribs. It {{was a single}} bay biplane with staggered wings of almost equal span and sharp, 10° sweepback. [...] The airfoils were thick, the lower thicker and the upper wings carried leading edge automatic slots for low speed control. [...] The wings could be folded from the centre section for carrier stowage. The lower wing centre section had anhedral to allow a shorter undercarriage and also carried a pair of underwing radiators. [...] The undercarriage was of the fixed, <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> type required for torpedo launches, with torpedo crutches between the legs {{and there was a}} small, spatted tailwheel. [...] For carrier landing there was a hinged arrestor hook ending {{just in front of the}} tailwheel. The three crew sat in separate open cockpits, the pilot in front under a cut-out in the upper wing trailing edge, his navigator behind him and furthest aft the gunner with a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring. [...] The fin was large and rounded with a generous rudder, a little like that of the later Gladiator, with the tailplane braced from above to the fin.|$|E
2500|$|The Alizé (Tradewind in English) was {{designed}} in 1936 as a tourer/trainer, {{though in the}} end it served almost entirely as a trainer. Its flat sided, round decked fuselage seated two in open, tandem cockpits, fitted from the outset with dual control. [...] The rear cockpit was at the trailing edge of the parasol wing, which had a small cut-out for improved visibility; the forward cockpit was under the wing. [...] The wing itself was of parallel chord with rounded tips. [...] Like the rest of the Alizé, it had a wooden structure. [...] Two pairs of parallel struts joined the wing to the lower fuselage longerons, assisted by vertical ancillary struts outboard and a cabane structure with two main struts per side, another pair of thinner struts going forward to the upper rear engine mounting. Both vertical and horizontal tail surfaces were straight edged and nearly rectangular. The rudder operated in a cut-out between the elevators, carried on the strut braced stabilizers. The Alizé had a fixed, <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> conventional undercarriage. [...] The main undercarriage legs, each carrying a single mainwheel, were mounted vertically on the forward wing struts, with half-axles hinged from the centre line of the fuselage bottom. [...] Secondary struts ran forward from {{the top and bottom of}} each leg to points on the rear of the engine mounting.|$|E
50|$|The Plein Air had a flat sided {{fuselage}} which tapered to the tail. This was conventional, with {{a straight}} edged fin and rudder with a rounded top. Its tailplane was strut braced to the fin. The tourer had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage with main wheels on <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> mounted on the central fuselage underside; the legs were faired-in V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tail wheel, mounted on a telescopic leg, was also faired.|$|R
50|$|The T-2 had fixed, {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} with a track of about 2 m. The wheels were on cranked, steel <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> mounted on the fuselage central underside and enclosed in wooden streamlined fairings. The outer axle ends moved in slots {{at the ends of}} wooden V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons, restrained by rubber chord shock-absorbers. The articulated tailskid was wooden and steel shod, with another rubber shock-absorber joined to the fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|Though the MB.90 was {{intended}} to be Renault powered, it was initially flown with a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III air-cooled four cylinder inverted engine. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with its main wheels on V-form <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> hinged on the lower fuselage longerons. At their outer ends, vertical shock absorbing struts reached up to the forward wing struts, strengthened at that point by two further struts to the lower and upper fuselage.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry specification C.16/28, which required the ability to carry 30 troops and their equipment for 1,200 miles (1,930km) and was the same specification that produced the Handley Page H.P.43 and the Vickers Type 163. [...] The TC.33 was a large single bay biplane with no stagger and 7° sweepback. [...] Both wings had metal lattice spars and metal ribs with fabric covering. [...] The lower wing was unusual in that its centre section had marked anhedral so that the main spars met {{at the top of}} the fuselage, leaving the interior unobstructed. A similar arrangement, though with less anhedral was used by the slightly earlier Handley Page H.P.42 airliner. The outer end of this centre section was strut braced to the lower fuselage. The TC.33 was also unusual in having a lower wing of (slightly) greater span than the upper; most unequal span wings had a larger upper wing. The four evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines were mounted in two nacelles, each containing a tractor-pusher pair together with their steam condenser and mounted between the wings at the end of the centre section. They were each carried by two vertical struts above the nacelle, complicated strutting below and by further strutting to the lower wing roots. The wide (22ft 6 in (6.8 m)) <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> undercarriage had vertical legs from the front wing spar at the same point and bracing from the axles to the fuselage.|$|E
60|$|Dick and Tom {{were deeply}} {{interested}} in what the old farmer had told their brother, {{and as soon as}} the strapping and wiring of the <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> was completed all of the boys went into the house to ask the farmer more about the two men and the automobile.|$|E
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was very simple, with wheels {{close to the}} sides on a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> mounted within the fuselage. Rubber cord shock {{absorbers}} were used and the tailskid was also mounted elastically.|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} is flat sided. The pilot's windscreen is {{just ahead of}} the wing leading edge but the side glazing of the single-seat cabin extends back to about two-thirds chord. The cabin roof extends into raised rear fuselage decking, which drops away slowly to the tail. The Donald has a tailskid undercarriage with main wheels mounted on <b>split</b> <b>axles,</b> hinged on a shallow V-strut attached to the fuselage underside. Faired, tapered legs are mounted on the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} was rectangular {{in cross-section}} and seated three in separate cockpits. The pilot sat just {{forward of the}} wing leading edge, there was a gunner's position (with emergency dual control) midway between the trailing edge and the tail and the front gunner/bomb-aimer's position was in the nose. [...] Both gunners' positions were provided with a [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun mounted on a Scarff ring. The landing gear used two main wheels on <b>split</b> <b>axles,</b> plus a tail-skid.|$|R
50|$|The F.280 had a flat sided {{fuselage}} {{with the}} pilot's cabin under the wing, the windscreen just {{forward of the}} wings, with the third engine mounted in the nose. Square windows lit the interior. The conventional undercarriage had main legs attached vertically to the forward wing struts as extensions of the struts between the latter and the engines and with slimmer bracing to the upper fuselage longerons. <b>Split</b> <b>axles</b> hinged at the lower fuselage centre and radius arms from the lower longerons took the longitudinal loads. The single mainwheels were spatted.|$|R
50|$|The Schwalbe had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, {{with its}} mainwheels on a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> sprung by rubber cords to V-struts {{from the lower}} fuselage and stabilized centrally by a transverse V-strut. There was a short, steel tailskid.|$|E
50|$|La Mouette had a {{steel tube}} {{tailskid}} undercarriage with a track of 1.90 m. The mainwheels, enclosed by fairings {{were on a}} <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> from the fuselage centre, joined through rubber shock absorbers to faired-in V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons.|$|E
50|$|The Potez 26 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} {{undercarriage}} with mainwheels on a <b>split</b> <b>axle</b> supported centrally by a V-strut, hinged on {{another pair of}} struts to the lower fuselage and with vertical, airfoil section shock absorbers. There was a sprung tailskid.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail unit}} was conventional, with {{trapezoidal}} {{horizontal and vertical}} surfaces. The tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage and was braced to the fin by a single strut on each side. The control surfaces were unbalanced and {{the bottom of the}} rudder was cropped to allow elevator movement. The JG.40 had fixed landing gear, with <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> and drag struts hinged from the central fuselage underside and with vertical Messier oleo-legs from the forward wing spars. The mainwheels had hydraulic brakes. The castoring tailwheel was also on an oleo strut.|$|R
5000|$|The {{empennage}} was conventional, {{with the}} tailplane mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. In plan the tailplane was semi-elliptical and the elevators almost semi-circular. The fin and unbalanced rudder also had curved edges and together were rather pointed; the rudder extended to the keel and operated in an elevator cut-out.The undercarriage was of the tailskid type, with a 2.07 m track. [...] The wheels were on bent <b>split</b> <b>axles</b> mounted on the centreline of the fuselage underside, their ends rubber sprung from vertical V-struts from the wing centre section.|$|R
50|$|Structurally, the Hummel was {{a wooden}} aircraft. The wing were {{built around a}} wooden {{monospar}} with plywood covered leading edges and ailerons, with fabric covering elsewhere. The fuselage was a plywood covered wooden structure, as were the fixed tail surfaces, rudder and elevators being fabric covered. The horizontal tail surfaces were set noticeably aft of the rudder, rather like the more recent Piper PA-28. The enclosed cabin had dual controls, a single central control column being shared via horizontal extensions. There was a generous baggage space behind the seats. The fixed undercarriage had main wheels on <b>split</b> <b>axles,</b> with low pressure tyres and brakes. There was a sprung tailskid.|$|R
