40|$|Current praxis of {{software}} licensing {{has been identified}} as major obstacle for Grid computing {{a couple of years ago}} already. Recent surveys of Clouds indicate that the same holds true for Cloud computing. As a consequence, using commercial applications that require access to a license server for authorisation at run-time has been quite limited until recently in distributed computing environments. Due to the mandatory centralised control of license usage at application run-time, e. g. heartbeat control by the license server, traditional software licensing practices are not suitable especially when the environment stretches across adminis- trative domains. In this paper we present a novel approach for managing software licenses as web service resources in distributed service oriented environments. Licenses become mobile objects, which may move to the environment where required to authorise the execution of a license pro- tected application. The SmartLM solution decouples authorisation for license usage from authorisation for application execution.

40|$|The use of {{dynamical}} driving simulators is nowadays {{common in}} many different application fields, such as driver training, vehicle development, and medical studies.

The effectiveness of such devices is related to their capabilities of well reproducing the driving sen- <b>sations,</b> and hence, {{it is crucial that}} the motion control strategies generate both realistic and feasible inputs to the platform, to ensure that it is kept within its limited operation space. Such strategies are called motion cueing algorithms (MCAs). In this brief, we describe an MCA based on nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) techniques, for a nine-degree of freedom simulator based on a hexapod mounted on a flat base moved by a tripod, exhibiting highly nonlinear behavior. The algorithm has been evaluated in a simulation environment. Simulation results show that the full exploitation of the working area is achieved, while managing at best all the limitations given by the particular structure and preserving the easiness and intuitiveness of tuning, which is typical of linear MPC-based approaches...|$|R

40|$|Recent UK {{government}} policy on climate change, and wider policy movement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, emphasise {{the building of}} adaptive capacity. But what are the institutional constraints that shape capacity to build adaptive organisa- tions? The authors synthesise theory from social learning and institutional aspects of multilevel environmental governance to help unpack the patterns of individual and collective action within organisations that can enhance or restrict organisational adaptive capacity {{in the face of}} abrupt climate change. Theoretical synthesis is grounded by empirical work with a local dairy farmers group and two supporting public sector bodies that are both local actors in their own rights and which also shape the operating environment for other local actors (the Environment Agency and the Welsh Assembly and Assembly-sponsored public bodies). Providing space within and between local organi- <b>sations</b> for individuals to develop private as well as officially sanctioned social relationships is supported as a pathway to enable social learning. It is also a resource for adaptation that requires little financial investment but does call for a rethinking of the personal skills and working routines that are incentivised within organisations...|$|R
40|$|Usage CONtrol (UCON) {{model is}} the latest major enhance- ment of the {{traditional}} access control models which enables mutability of subject and object attributes, and continuity of control on usage of resources. In UCON, access permission decision is based on three factors: authorisations, obliga- tions and conditions. While authorisations and obligations are requirements that must be ful lled by the subject and the object, conditions are subject and object independent requirements that must be satis ed by the environment. As a consequence, access permission may be revoked (and the access stopped) {{as a result of}} changes in the environment regardless of whether the authorisations and obligations re- quirements are met. This constitutes a major shortcoming of the UCON model in pervasive computing systems which constantly strive to adapt to environmental changes so as to minimise disruptions to the user. To overcome this limita- tion, this paper proposes a Context-Aware Usage CONtrol (CA-UCON) model which extends the traditional UCON model to enable adaptation to environmental changes in the aim of preserving continuity of access. When the authori- <b>sations</b> and obligations requirements are met by the subject and the object, and the conditions requirements fail due to changes in the environment or the system context, CA- UCON model triggers speci c actions to adapt to the new situation. Besides the data protection, CA-UCON model so enhances the quality of services, striving to keep explicit interactions with the user at a minimum...|$|R

40|$|We examine cr itic ally the two {{traditions of}} work that have {{informed}} discursive approaches to identity : social constructionism and conversation analysis. Within both strands, identity is theorized as a � exible phenomenon that is situated in conversations. But although constructionists locate identity within the social, such work remains at a theoretical and rather abstract level and often fails to interrogate the discursive practices through which identity is constituted. Conver sely, this attention to the occasioning of identity in everyday talk is precisely {{the focus of the}} second, conver <b>sation</b> analy tic strand of work.

Despite the apparent con� ict between these approaches, we suggest that a synthes is of the two provides a comprehensive framework for analysing identity. Drawing upon the BBC Panorama interview between Martin Bashir and Princess Diana, we explore how culturally situated identities are located in this conversational context.

40|$|International audienceReliable {{estimates}} of the morbidity burden caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza (pH 1 N 1) are important for assessing {{the severity of the}} pandemic. Poisson regression models were fitted to weekly numbers of cause-specific hospitalisation in Hong Kong from 2005 to 2010. Excess hospitalisation associated with the 2009 pandemic and seasonal influenza was derived from the model by incorporating the proxy variables of weekly proportions of specimens positive for the pan- demic influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, seasonal influenza A (subtypes H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1) and B viruses. Compared with seasonal influenza, pH 1 N 1 influenza was associ- ated with higher hospitalisation rates for acute respir- atory disease (ARD) among children younger than 18 years and adults aged between 18 and 64 years, but among the elderly aged 65 years and older the hos- pitalisation rates were lower for pH 1 N 1 than for sea- sonal H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1 influenza. Hospitalisation rates for chronic diseases associated with pH 1 N 1 influenza were generally higher than those associated with sea- sonal influenza. The reported hospitalised cases with laboratory-confirmed pandemic infections accounted for only 16 % of pH 1 N 1 influenza-associated hospitali- <b>sations</b> for ARD in the age group 75 years and older, and 5 ‒ 66 % of hospitalisations for chronic diseases in those older than 40 years.

In this thesis we present a data structure based on a generalised suffix tree which is capable of solving a number of text stream mining tasks. It can be used to detect changes in the text stream, detect when chunks of text are reused and detect events through identifying when the frequencies of phrases change in a statistically significant way. Suffix trees have been used for many years in the areas of combinatorial pattern matching and computational genomics. In this thesis we demonstrate how the suffix tree can become more widely applicable by making it possible to use suffix trees to analyse streams of data rather than static data sets, opening up a number of future avenues for research. The algorithms which we present are designed to be efficient in an on-line setting by having time complexity independent of the total amount of text seen and polynomial in the rate at which text is seen. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on a large text stream comprising thousands of documents every day. This text stream is the stream of text news coming from over 600 online news outlets and the results ob- tained are of interest to news consumers, journalists and social scientists.

40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{birth of}} Jesus Christ and {{the reign of}} his church, especially regarding women The issue whether {{there is room for}} women in the special ser- vices of the church, especially as elder, is currently corespons- ible for tension within the Reformed Churches in South Africa (RCSA). The ruling task of the church is closely linked with the way God rules his people and with what the relation between Him and his people is. The book of Matthew shows that there is an essential unity but also a drastic difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament dispensations in this regard. This article investigates at what dominates both dispen- <b>sations</b> and how they differ concerning this. Sin disrupted humanness and harmony fundamentally and in the most intimate relations. In the old dispensation power was inter alia exercised by force, for example in slavery and disregard of women’s full humanness. The birth of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit from a woman without a man is the fulfilment of the Old Testament promises. All believers without difference in class or gender are recreated by Jesus Christ as the image of God and are reinstated in a personal relation with Him. Exercise of power over others, like in male domination of women and in earthly kingship and slavery makes room for being serviceable. Jesus Christ exercises his authority in a serving way. Especially his church must rule in a serving way by acknowledging Him as Head and testifying about his life, death and resurrection as contained in his Word. A believing woman is just as well equiped for this as a man...|$|R
