25|$|Two {{satellites}} {{were acquired}} {{from the company}} Spar Aerospace, model HS-376, manufactured under Hughes Space licenses. They cost about $125 million.

The satellite was stationed on the meridian 65 degrees west. Subsequent to the launch of the second generation of Brasilsat satellites, they were renamed Brasilsat A1 and A2. With the end of its life and already in an inclined orbit, the Brasilsat A1 was sold to HCI in October 1995. The antenna was redirected to North America. Control of the satellite was passed to PanAmSat on November 12, 1997.|$|E

Of the eighteen, only two were left alive the next morning—the victim of a heat-producing chemical reaction between quicklime, used to disinfect the cell, and carbon dioxide. On the same day, a steamship named <b>Satelite</b> left Rio de Janeiro for the rubber plantations in the Amazon with over a hundred former sailors and nearly three hundred [...] "vagabonds" [...] on board. Nine were executed by the crew along the way, {{and many of the}} rest died shortly after while working in the hot tropical climate, conditions described by Rui Barbosa as [...] "a place where one only dies." [...] Meanwhile, João Cândido—stricken by hallucinations from his traumatic night—was sentenced to a mental hospital. It took eighteen months before he and nine sailors faced trial for their supposed anti-government actions taken during the December 9–10 revolts; the judges found them not guilty, and all were discharged from the navy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{influential}} architectural {{critic and}} historian, Sigfried Giedion {{in his book}} Space, Time and Architecture (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show {{in the development of}} functionalism. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of expressionism brutalism had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete, was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of Le Corbusier took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his Notre Dame du Haut. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré Mathias Goeritz, published the [...] "Arquitectura Emocional" [...] (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that [...] "architecture's principal function is emotion." [...] Modern Mexican architect Luis Barragán adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project Torres de <b>Satélite</b> (1957–58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was Eero Saarinen. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as Eero Saarinen's 1962 TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's Formspiels as any other, save Jørn Utzon's Sydney Opera House. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently still, the aesthetics and tactility of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of Enric Miralles, most notability his Scottish Parliament building, deconstructivist architects such as Zaha Hadid and Daniel Libeskind, as well as Canadian Aboriginal architect Douglas Cardinal.|$|E
