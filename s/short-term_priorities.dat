This paper applies a"growth diagnostic"approach {{to understand how}} this happened {{and how it can}} be sustained. Past growth has been driven by the coincidence of a set of historical and geographic factors (including opportunistic policy responses), together with the use of natural assets (although in a non sustainable way) and the elaboration of productive sector-specific governance arrangements. Several of these factors are unfortunately not self-sustaining and the global economic crisis of 2008 - 09 is exposing these vulnerabilities. A growth diagnostic flags a number of <b>short-term</b> <b>priorities</b> to ensure the competitiveness of existing industries, as well as more medium-term priorities for the country to continue attracting foreign investment and start mobilizing more domestic savings.

40|$|The {{debate around}} {{the role that}} {{agriculture}} should play in mitigating climate change and sequestering greenhouse gases is politically complex and technically complicated. In many countries, and particularly in developing countries with a large smallholder population, the agricultural sector faces competing priorities, such as national food security goals, poverty alleviation, addressing natural resource degradation and adapting to the already visible effects of climate change. Many of these goals are closer to the immediate, <b>short-term</b> <b>priorities</b> of national decision-makers, relegating climate change mitigation to a secondary priority. It is therefore essential to implement mitigation strategies in concert with strategies that increase the resilience and increase the productivity of agricultural systems. Despite differences in the forestry and the agricultural sectors, experiences from the REDD+ process, and particularly its readiness phase, can offer useful lessons for an agricultural readiness process. The REDD+ readiness process created an overall coherent structure, framework and process of guiding countries towards developing the technical and institutional ability to integrate mitigation activities into their forestry sectors.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{implications}} of the current economic crisis for climate change trajectories and climate change policies. It is argued that, contrary to what many would expect, the economic recession negatively affects emissions reduction efforts through its discouraging effects on investments in low-carbon technologies. It is also argued that, although the growing climate change concerns justify public intervention even at times of economic hardship, there are reciprocal influences between the economic crisis and climate policy-making. Indeed, given the greater competition on scarce resources and <b>short-term</b> <b>priorities</b> for the use of those resources, the economic crisis strengthens the case for a suitable design of climate policies which leads to cost-effective emissions reductions in an intertemporal perspective. This calls for clear, long-term and stable policy frameworks in order to reduce the risks for investors. At the international level this requires more, and not less, collaboration between countries. There are also implications in terms of the choice of instruments. Traditional market-based climate policy instruments, such as taxes and emissions trading schemes are particularly attractive on their own for several reasons, but should be integrated with technology-policy instruments using the revenues of the former to fund the later. Furthermore, the economic crisis provides an opportunity to apply an environmental tax reform. Finally, the counter-cyclical effects of a low-carbon investment package should not be underestimated. ...|$|E

METHOD: This exploratory study was conducted at the medical clinic of a hospital in the State of Goiás. For data collection we convened a team comprised of six professionals involved in medication treatment: a doctor, nurse, nursing technician, pharmacist, a nursing and a risk manager. A total of 24 meetings were held, for a total of 56 hours. The data were transcribed into an electronic database within Microsoft Excel®, and the Xfmea 4 software was used. RESULT: The results indicated 52 failure modes, 79 effects of failure, and 285 causes of failure. The causes were related to: the management of organizational processes, human resources, physical and material structure. A total of 298 actions for improvement were recommended for 215 causes of high and average priority, 81. 9 % of which were <b>short-term</b> <b>priorities.</b> The simulation of the impact of the proposed interventions revealed a 79. 7 % reduction of the high-priority failure modes.

However, it has been noticed that few approaches, such as one published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), {{address the needs of}} the drinking water industry. There is also no generic approach to the selection, prioritisation and monitoring of organic contaminants in the drinking water value chain. To safeguard drinking water industry customers, it was necessary to develop a generic protocol to assist with the identification of a list of organic contaminants for monitoring in the drinking water value chain. Once the protocol was developed, it was validated in a prototype drinking water value chain. This paper describes the implementation of such a generic protocol. The exercise comprised of testing each step of the protocol, from selection of the ‘pool of organic contaminants’ (Step I) to recommending the final priority list of organic contaminants (Step VII). Successful implementation of the protocol took place in the Rand Water (South Africa) drinking water value chain (from catchment to tap). Expert judgment was emphasized during the implementation as each step was validated and the opinion of key stakeholders used to shape the process. The tailor-made prioritisation criteria, reflecting the drinking water industry perspective, proved to be successful in selecting and prioritising organic contaminants for monitoring in the drinking water value chain. The organic contaminants were successfully prioritised in 3 classes: <b>short-term</b> <b>priority</b> for analysis, medium-term priority for analysis and long-term priority for analysis. This is a very important guide to assist water utilities in optimising their resources while not compromising the role of public health protection.

During that time, {{the rule of}} the Progressive Conservatives essentially went unchallenged, with critiques of government policy falling on deaf ears and Alberta ranking behind other provinces in voter turnout. Given the province’s economic reliance on oil revenues, a symbiotic relationship also developed between government and the oil industry.

Alberta Oil and the Decline of Democracy in Canada sets out to test the “oil inhibits democracy” hypothesis {{in the context of an}} industrialized nation in the Global North. In probing the impact of Alberta’s powerful oil lobby on the health of democracy in the province, contributors to the volume engage with an ongoing discussion of the erosion of political liberalism in the West. In addition to examining energy policy and issues of government accountability in Alberta, they explore the ramifications of oil dependence in areas such as Aboriginal rights, environmental policy, labour law, women’s equity, urban social policy, and the arts.

40|$|Industry is a {{key player}} in the {{transition}} to a sustainable society, where manufacturing companies need to respond to the challenges of environmental concerns in several ways. The need for managing environmental technological change in production systems is {{and will continue to be}} a challenge for manufacturing companies, as they often tend to focus on <b>short-term</b> <b>priorities</b> to stay economically competitive, rather than developing the organisation to manage longer-term environmental competitiveness. In accordance with this, the objective of the thesis is to develop an understanding of how to manage environmental technological change in a production system. By identifying four categories of contextual preparedness, these being short-term focused, trade-off prepared, balance-seeking or long-term prepared, the thesis provides perspectives on how to manage change related to time and contextual aspects. The operation managers need to manage the projects by allocating individuals who can work systematically and build a strong knowledge base by collaborating with internal and external stakeholders. It shows that knowledge is not only about technology but also about realising the need for change and developing strong longer-term objectives. A model is developed to support operations managers with purposeful actions, such as reflecting upon their long-term capabilities and making conscious decisions when to manage their environmental technology change processes regarding their own production system. The model presents how to “zip” sustainability into operations, so as to provide guidance for operations managers on how to systematically manage long-term change in a context that needs to work with multiple time aspects - and priorities. By using the term zip it is emphasised that the long-term developments have to be consciously integrated into the organisation aligned to the short-term needs. Literature reviews, as well as four empirical case studies, have been conducted in order to explore environmental technological change. In the first two studies, the factors which affect environmental technological change in a production system have been identified. In the two subsequent studies the change processes as such were studied, leading to an increased understanding of how the production system and temporal dimensions influence the change processes.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the events of}} September 11 2001 and the growing concern for the security of ships and ports, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set up new security regulations implemented in the new Chapter XI- 2 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and in the International Ship and Port facility Security (ISPS) code on the minimum security arrangements for ships and port facilities. ISPS was transposed to the Community legal framework by the Regulation 725 / 2004, later complemented by the Directive 2005 / 65 /CE, which extended the security measures into the whole port area. Ports constitute crucial intermodal nodes in the freight and passenger transport network as well as important border control points. Their security, along with their efficient operation, is therefore of paramount importance not only because of their critical transport functions but also because of their specific role, as control points, in the regional, national and European security. Port security, cornerstone for the implementation of the new international maritime transport security regime, should be seen not only as the means for protecting the maritime vessels, the port users and the public but also as an opportunity to further automate and simplify port procedures and operations. The key for that is to embed security in all main port functionalities, primarily through the intelligent procedures and data sharing rather than seeing security as an additional overlay on top of port operations. The aim of the present paper is to analyse the problem, highlight the issues faced in a systematic way and provide a systemic framework towards a better port security with better and simpler procedures rather than penalising the trade or the port related activities. To this end: •	A basic taxonomy concerning ports, port facilities and security is established, •	The main requirements from the EU and international regulations are highlighted, •	The port facility security, basic functional block for the port security, is analysed and its  main parameters are derived, •	The current situation of EU port facilities is highlighted and some conclusions on the  <b>short-term</b> <b>priorities</b> and the way ahead are drawn.   This paper is based on the work undertaken by the JRC in direct support of the Commission services (DG MOVE and DG HOME) : 1.
