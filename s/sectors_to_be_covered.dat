40|$|The {{position}} {{and history of}} the Czechoslovak Republic {{played a key role in}} its decision to focus on the weapon industry during the interwar period. Given the unstable situation in the newly emerged countries in the Central European region and with respect to the tradition of a heavy-weapon production, Czechoslovakia began to produce arms on a much larger scale. The increasing armament in 1930 s was not even stopped by the Great Depression. Furthermore, weapon production helped the country to report higher exports and boosted the otherwise stagnating economy. The boom in the weapon production came during 1934 - 1938. Due to the quality of Czechoslovak arms and the high demand for them abroad, the Czechoslovak total export showed at least a slight increasing trend during this period. Nevertheless, large public expenditures in this <b>sector</b> had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by augmenting public debt and increased tax rates...|$|R

40|$|The main {{economic}} {{functions of}} the insurance <b>sector</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> financial risk and to mobilize long-term savings. The sector can also {{play an important role}} in developing the private sector and modernizing the securities market. But to play its economic and financial roles, the insurance sector must operate within a framework of stable, liberal regulation that provides incentives for efficiency, allows companies to innovate, and creates a contestable market with relatively free entry and exit. In most developing countries, regulation has deviated greatly from this ideal. Often dominated by state-owned companies, the insurance industry in many developing countries features: (a) strict controls on new entry; (b) prohibitions against majority ownership by foreign companies; (c) fixed premiums (especially for compulsory lines); (d) prior approval of tariff changes and new products; (e) high local retention ratios (which discourage reinsurance from overseas companies); (f) insurance reserves used as a captive source of funding for public deficits; and (g) weak prudential controls and inadequate monitoring of solvency. In recent years there has been a growing trend away from direct controls on premiums, products, and investments, and toward more monitoring of the solvency of companies, through more effective supervision and clear prudential controls. The author argues that Tunisia's insurance sector has been hampered by restrictive regulations, by the country's low incomes (which limit long-term savings capabilities), and by it pay-as-you-go social pension system. Tunisia's life insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance industry also suffers from structural problems. Worst of all, prudential regulations and standards are unequally applied, and some companies are still operating with insufficient capital(in a few cases, with greatly negative equity). What is needed? Capital-deficient companies need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restructured and recapitalized, state-owned companies need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> privatized, and the market needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> opened up <b>to</b> majority foreign-owned firms. Supervision must be strengthened and corrective measures applied more equitably and forcefully. The social pension system must <b>be</b> radically reformed, <b>to</b> include one fully funded pillar that will generate long-term savings and transform the prospects for life insurance business.
