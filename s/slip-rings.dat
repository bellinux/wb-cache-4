The analysis of a double-inverter-fed induction motor is given to derive the proposed controller. Various frequency profiles are analyzed for a direct frequency controller. A novel frequency profile is suggested to make the sensorless drive operation reliable and machine parameter independent at any rotor speed. Simula-tion and experimental results are presented from a 50 -hp drive, demonstrating that the drive can deliver full torque from 0 to 2 -p. u. speed in either direction.

50|$|In {{accordance}} with these conditions, when a conductor or conductors move through {{a magnetic field}} to cut the lines of force, electrons are enabled to enter the conduction band thereby inducing an electric pressure {{for the production of}} alternating current in an external circuit. This may be referred to as an elementary alternator, consisting of a single wire loop called an armature with each end being attached to <b>slip-rings</b> and arranged so as to revolve midway between the magnetic poles. Two copper-graphite brushes connect with the external circuit on the <b>slip-rings</b> in order to collect the alternating current, generated in the conductor when the alternator is in operation. Another machine used for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of electromagnetic induction is called a dynamo or direct current generator.|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of a stand-alone, as opposed to grid connected generation system, using a <b>slip-ring</b> induction machine as the electrical generator, is considered. In contrast to an alternator, a <b>slip-ring</b> induction machine can run at variable speed and still deliver constant frequency power to loads. This feature enables optimization of the system when the prime mover is inherently variable speed in nature eg. wind turbines, as well as diesel driven systems, where there is scope for economizing on fuel consumption. Experimental results from a system driven by a 44 bhp diesel engine are presented. Operation at subsynchronous as well as super-synchronous speeds is examined.

50|$|Traditional {{electrical}} commutators use {{slip rings}} for coupling. Slip rings however inject commutator noise into the connection. This is because as the contact points slide {{over the surface}} of the <b>slip-rings</b> they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the slip rings with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear.|$|E
50|$|The {{field is}} uniformly {{perpendicular}} to the cylindrical rotor surface and does not change polarity over the 360-degree perimeter of the cylindrical part of the rotor. That means if the field is considered entering the rotor between the <b>slip-rings</b> it must leave the rotor though the rotor's end surfaces. It is not important that the magnetic field is generated from the stator; a similar field may be generated from the rotor with the same effect (the magnetic fields would not rotate with the rotor).|$|E
50|$|The voltage {{between the}} rotor {{connections}} (<b>slip-rings)</b> is normally {{low and the}} current then must be high to generate significant power. Current in the kiloampere range was applied for larger motors. The device also works in reverse as a generator if driven. It is useful for generating very large currents at low voltage. It {{does not appear to}} comply with a simple interpretation of Maxwell's equations {{in the sense that the}} magnetic field does not at any point pass though any closed winding to generate an electromagnetic effect.|$|E

It {{has been found in}} general that operation of <b>slip-ring</b> induction motors as series connected motors is possible providing that the rotor winding is connected in a sequence opposite to that of the stator winding. This adds flexibility to the modes of operation of these motors.

40|$|In {{applications}} such as radar and wind turbines, it is often necessary to transfer power across a constantly rotating interface.

50|$|If {{connections}} to the rotor coils of a three-phase motor are taken out on <b>slip-rings</b> and fed a separate field current to create a continuous magnetic field (or if the rotor consists of a permanent magnet), the result is called a synchronous motor because the rotor will rotate synchronously with the rotating magnetic field produced by the polyphase electrical supply. Another synchronous motor system is the brushless wound-rotor doubly fed synchronous motor system with an independently excited rotor multiphase AC winding set that may experience slip-induction beyond synchronous speeds but like all synchronous motors, does not rely on slip-induction for torque production.|$|E

5000|$|This GFCS was an intermediate-range, {{anti-aircraft}} gun fire-control system. It {{was designed for}} use against high-speed subsonic aircraft. It {{could also be used}} against surface targets. It was a dual ballistic system. This means that it was capable of simultaneously producing gun orders for two different gun types (e.g.: 5"/38cal and 3"/50cal) against the same target. Its Mk 35 Radar was capable of automatic tracking in bearing, elevation, and range that was as accurate as any optical tracking. The whole system could be controlled from the below decks Plotting Room with or without the director being manned. This allowed for rapid target acquisition when a target was first detected and designated by the ships air-search radar, and not yet visible from on deck. Its target solution time was less than 2 seconds after Mk 35 radar [...] "Lock on". It was designed toward the end of World War II, apparently in response to Japanese kamikaze aircraft attacks. It was conceived by Ivan Getting, mentioned {{near the end of his}} Oral history, and its linkage computer was designed by Antonín Svoboda. Its gun director was not shaped like a box, and it had no optical rangefinder. The system was manned by crew of four. On the left side of the director, was the Cockpit where the Control Officer stood behind the sitting Director Operator (Also called Director Pointer). Below decks in Plot, was the Mk 4 Radar Console where the Radar Operator and Radar Tracker sat. [...] The directors movement in bearing was unlimited because it had <b>slip-rings</b> in its pedestal. (The Mk. 37 gun director had a cable connection to the hull, and occasionally had to be [...] "unwound".) Fig. 26E8 on this Web page shows the director in considerable detail.The explanatory drawings of the system show how it works, but are wildly different in physical appearance from the actual internal mechanisms, perhaps intentionally so. However, it omits any significant description of the mechanism of the linkage computer.

40|$|Abstract. Belt {{conveyors}} are {{a dominant}} mean of transport in modern open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are usually driven by three-phase induction <b>slip-ring</b> motors of a nominal voltage of 6 kV and nominal power from 200 to 1000 kW. Efficiency of the transport {{system is the}} crucial parameter {{of the level of}} economical exploitation of an open-pit mine as a whole. The main problem which prevent optimal transport-system efficiency is insufficient synchronization between the production and transport capacities. Since the conveyors in the open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mainly driven by three-phase induction <b>slip-ring</b> motors, the most appropriate solution to control the conveyor speed (the speed of the drive motors) is to use a subsynchronous constant torque cascade with a static voltage and frequency converter. The basic elements of the subsynchronous cascade are a diode bridge rectifier and a thyristor inverter bridge, as well as a power transformer whose nominal power depends on the control range and which sends electricity back to the power grid. The paper describes a mathematical model to calculate the subsynchronous cascade parameters used in controlling the speed of electric-motor drives for belt conveyors...|$|R
