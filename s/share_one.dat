40|$|In this paper, I {{tackle the}} {{question}} whether <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote should become a European law rule. I examine, first of all, the economic theory concerning <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote and its optimality, and the law and economics literature on dual class recapitalizations and other deviations from <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote. I also consider the agency costs of deviations from <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote and examine whether they justify regulation. I subsequently analyze the rules implementing the <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote standard in the US and Europe. In particular, I analyze the self-regulatory rules of US exchanges, the relevant provisions of the European Takeover Directive (including the well known break-through rule), and the European Court of Justice's position as to golden shares (which also are deviations from the <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote standard). I conclude that <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote is not justified by economic efficiency, as also confirmed by comparative law. Also the European breakthrough rule, which ultimately strikes down all deviations from <b>one</b> <b>share</b> - <b>one</b> vote, {{does not appear to}} be well grounded. Only transparency rules appear to be justified at EU level as disclosure of ownership and voting structures serves a pricing and governance function, while harmonisation of the relevant rules reduces transaction costs in integrated markets...|$|R

5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block <b>share</b> <b>one</b> foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E

Jacqui forgives him, and Gilly decides that he must leave the village. He confesses the rape to everyone in his life and says his goodbyes. Cheryl in particular is devastated by Gilly's abrupt departure and begs for him to stay, but he refuses.

An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and <b>share</b> <b>one</b> kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
