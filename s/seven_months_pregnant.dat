She returned to the team in a friendly win over Coventry City in July 2013, following the birth of her third son.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant,</b> was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Ng {{went to the}} United States {{and began}} {{studying}} at Ohio Dominican University in Columbus, Ohio, but later transferred to Ohio State University; she graduated with a bachelour's degree in interpersonal communications in 1997. While in the US, she read numerous children's books; these later influenced her own writings. After graduating, she spent a year working in the US before returning to Indonesia in 1998. Upon her return to Indonesia, she spent three years working in the human resources department of Hanjin Shipping but left after she had two miscarriages, the first when she was <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> and the second at seven weeks. While staying at home, she took up writing.|$|E
50|$|A {{few months}} later, {{in the summer}} of 1901, Sophie went to Friedrichshof to look after her mother, whose health {{continued}} to decline. Five <b>months</b> <b>pregnant,</b> the Crown Princess knew that the Dowager Empress was dying and, with her sisters Viktoria and Margaret, she accompanied her until her last breath on 5 August. In the space of <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> Sophia lost two of her closest relatives. However, her new maternity helped keep her from feeling sorry for herself.|$|R
500|$|Forty {{years after}} the war, two sisters who had been raped were interviewed by Deutsche Welle. Aleya stated she had been taken by the Pakistani army when she was thirteen, and was gang raped {{repeatedly}} for <b>seven</b> <b>months.</b> She states she was tortured and was five <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> {{when she returned to}} her home. Her sister, Laily, says she was pregnant when she was taken by the armed forces, and lost the child. Later she fought alongside the Mukti Bahini. Both say that the state has failed the birangona, and that all they received was [...] "humiliation, insults, hatred, and ostracism." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for the song came from Margo's then-boyfriend, Donald Clements, {{who was a member}} of a group called the Sophomores. When he broke up with her, Margo came up with the lyrics to express how she wanted to stay with him. [...] "The words came so easily. It was real," [...] she recounted to Wayne Jancik in The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders. Margo and the rest of the Tune Weavers recorded it and [...] "Ol' Man River" [...] in an 18-hour session on March 7, 1957, in Boston, with Margo eight <b>months</b> <b>pregnant.</b> <b>Seven</b> <b>months</b> later, the song reached its peak of popularity in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant.</b> The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E
5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 cover that entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Matthews {{moved to}} Nashville, Tennessee in 2001. On her arrival she began playing with Bucky Baxter, {{who had played}} lap steel guitar for Bob Dylan and Ryan Adams. She had already {{collected}} seventy-six traditional folk songs {{with the idea of}} making an album of folk covers. Her debut album, Cockahoop, ended up consisting mainly of her own songs. It was recorded in <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> and appeared on Blanco y Negro Records in the United Kingdom in May 2003. Whilst recording this album she met Seth Riddle, whom she married in Pembrokeshire in February 2003. She toured the album around Britain with minimal promotion as she was several <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> at the time. The album's Stateside Records release followed in October 2004.|$|R

25|$|Margaret was 12 {{when she}} married the 24-year-old Edmund Tudor on 1 November 1455.

He died of the plague in captivity at Carmarthen the following November, leaving a 13-year-old widow who was <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> with their child.|$|E
25|$|Things were {{contentious}} in {{the studio}} as well. She was paired with veteran producer Mick Glossop, whom she later publicly derided. They had differing visions regarding her debut album and four months'-worth of recordings were scrapped. During this time she became pregnant by her session drummer John Reynolds (who went on to drum with the band Transvision Vamp). Due largely to O'Ceallaigh's efforts of persuasion, the record company allowed O'Connor, 20 years old and by then <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant,</b> to produce her own album.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her mother. She was <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> and had her 10-month-old {{daughter}} beside her. While heading west on Highway 132 near Modesto, a car behind her began honking its horn and flashing its headlights. She pulled {{off the road and}} stopped. The man in the car parked behind her, approached her car, stated that he observed that her right rear wheel was wobbling, and offered to tighten the lug nuts. After finishing his work, the man drove off; yet when Johns pulled forward to re-enter the highway the wheel almost immediately came off the car. The man returned, offering to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car.|$|E
25|$|The {{writing and}} {{recording}} sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences. In November 2003, Dreamworks {{was acquired by}} Universal Music Group for US$100 million, and eventually folded into Geffen Records. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives. Guitarist Todd Mohney left the band during the writing sessions, was replaced by Chris Chasse of Reach the Sky. McIlrath noted that the band was nervous about teaching Chasse completely new songs in a short period. Meanwhile, McIlrath was experiencing more personal distractions. Some Rise Against fans accused the band of selling out after signing with Dreamworks. Although McIlrath felt {{that most of the}} fans would realize that the band had not changed upon hearing the album, it still bothered him knowing that some longtime fans now hated the band for switching labels. Additionally, McIlrath's wife, who was <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>pregnant,</b> went into labor {{while he was in the}} vocal booth. The band temporarily moved recording sessions from Vancouver to Chicago so that McIlrath could be with his wife.|$|E

5000|$|Gloria Swanson (1899-1983), American movie actress. They {{married in}} Paris, France, on January 28, 1925, after {{meeting on the}} set of the Swanson film Madame Sans-Gêne, on which La Falaise was working as a translator. They were officially {{divorced}} in November 1931, at which time Swanson was several <b>months</b> <b>pregnant</b> by Michael Farmer, an Irish sportsman, who would become her fourth husband. (Thinking her divorce from La Falaise was already finalized, the actress had married Farmer in August, which was technically bigamy, and was forced to remarry him, legally, in November.) Swanson conceived a child with La Falaise but had an abortion because, as The New York Times noted, in 2004, [...] "if she had given birth <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> after her marriage, her career would have been ruined". During their marriage La Falaise was employed as the California representative of Peugeot American Corp., the U.S. branch of the European automobile manufacturer.|$|R
