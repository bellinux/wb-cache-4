The first example of such a lamination was constructed by Ghys [Gh 97]. Our discussion is based on the geometric methods developed by Lyubich, Minsky and the author [LM 97], [KL 01], which rely on the observation that any affine surface A gives rise in a natural way to a hyperbolic 3 -manifold HA with a distinguished point at infinity.

40|$|Abstract. Let f be {{a smooth}} homeomorphism {{of the circle}} having one cubic-exponent {{critical}} point and irrational rotation number of bounded combinatorial type. Using certain pull-back and quasi-conformal surgery techniques, we prove that the scaling ratios of f about the critical point are asymptotically independent of f. This settles in particular the golden mean universality conjecture. We introduce the notion of holomorphic commuting pair, a complex dynamical system that, in the analytic case, represents an extension of f to the complex plane and behaves somewhat as a quadratic-like mapping. We define a suitable renormalization operator that acts on such objects. Through careful analysis {{of the family of}} entire mappings given by z ↦ → z+θ − 1 sin 2 πz, θ real, we construct examples of holomorphic commuting 2 π pairs, from which certain necessary limit set pre-rigidity results are extracted. The rigidity problem for f is thereby reduced to one of renormalization convergence. We handle this last problem by means of Teichmüller extremal methods made available through the recent work of Sullivan on Riemann <b>surface</b> <b>laminations</b> and renormalization of unimodal mappings...|$|R

40|$|The {{universal}} arithmetic {{one dimensional}} solenoid S^ 1 _Q is the Pontryagin dual of the additive rationals Q {{and it is}} isomorphic to the adèle class group A_Q/Q. It is also isomorphic to the algebraic universal covering on the unit circle S^ 1 obtained by the inverse limit of the tower of its finite coverings. It is the boundary of the <b>surface</b> <b>lamination</b> with boundary obtained as the algebraic universal covering of the punctured closed disk Δ-{ 0 }⊂C. The interior of this lamination is the inverse limit of the tower of finite coverings of the open punctured disk Δ-{ 0 }. The latter is a Riemann <b>surface</b> <b>lamination</b> denoted H_ Q and it is foliated by densely embedded copies of the hyperbolic plane H. The boundary of the leaves are densely embedded copies of R in S^ 1 _Q. In this framework the pair (S^ 1 _Q,H_Q) is the adelic version of the pair (R,H). The stage is set to develop the adelic theory of Beltrami differentials, Ahlfors-Bers theory, quasi-symmetric homeomorphisms of S^ 1 _Q and Teichmüller theory.

They follow from an analogous of the Morse lemma for geodesics, which we call Morse lemma for convex surfaces, and which {{play the role of}} a shadowing lemma.

Comparison is also made with studies carried out by Gupta in evaluating test results from various sources. Results of different tests on strength properties and joints with metal plate connected rubberwood LVL are presented, including direct comparisons with similar experimental results on selected solid rubberwood. Preliminary studies indicated that the teeth of the metal plate connector causes a certain degree of damage to the outer layer of the LVL and weaken the strength properties.

40|$|In 2002, Fomin and Zelevinsky {{introduced}} a cluster algebra; a dynamical {{system that has}} already proved to be ubiquitous within mathematics. In particular, it was shown by Fomin, Shapiro and Thurston that some cluster algebras arise from orientable surfaces. Subsequently, Dupont and Palesi extended this construction to non-orientable surfaces, giving birth to quasi-cluster algebras. The finite type cluster algebras possess the remarkable property of their exchanges graphs being polytopal. We discover that the finite type quasi-cluster algebras enjoy a closely related property, namely, their exchange graphs are spherical. Revealing yet more connections we unify these two frameworks via Lam and Pylyavskyy's Laurent phenomenon algebras, showing that both orientable and non-orientable marked surfaces have an associated LP-algebra. The integration of these structures is attempted in two ways. Firstly we show that the quasi-cluster algebras of unpunctured surfaces have LP structures. Secondly, to obtain a connection for all marked <b>surfaces,</b> we consider <b>laminations,</b> forging {{the notion of the}} laminated quasi-cluster algebra.

Third, we apply these ideas to construct sets of non-periodic irreducible automorphisms of surfaces following [14, 35, 43], so that the involved proofs do not use any differential or algebraic tools, but, accordingly, substitution and D 0 L-system theory of [11, 12, 31, 32, 37]—mainly the decidability for a D 0 L-language [12] to be strongly repetitive or not.

Fringing fluxes enter the laminated stator stack perpendicularly to {{the plane of the}} Laminated Silicon Steel Sheets (LSSS). They cause additional eddy currents and losses in the sheets. Three approaches for reducing these losses are compared experimentally with a dedicated set-up. The set-up has no moving parts and makes accurate iron loss measurement possible. The first method directly restricts the eddy-current losses by segmenting the <b>lamination</b> <b>surface.</b> The second method deflects the fringing flux by using Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the finite element (FE) failure predictions and analyses {{of a typical}} wire for civil engineering applications with various crack-like lamination types (Single and double), geometries (straight-end and inclined-end) and orientations (longitudinal, lateral and transverse). FE prediction {{and analysis of the}} failure of notched pre-cracked wires with a <b>surface</b> across-the-thickness crack-like <b>lamination</b> validated with experimental results are also presented. The FE predicted fracture shape for the notched pre-cracked wires that consists of a cup and cone fracture shape below the bottom tip of the <b>surface</b> across-the-thickness crack-like <b>lamination</b> agrees with the experimental fracture shape. Wires with the double straight-end and double inclined-end crack-like/line-type laminations exhibit a “slant-middle W” and a “zigzag” fractures respectively. Above and below the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination, the wires with the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination exhibit a combination of a transverse mid-thickness flat fracture that is perpendicular to the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination and negatively inclined slant fractures {{on each side of the}} mid-thickness flat fracture at the remaining outer edges of the wire's thickness. On both the front and back sides of the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination, the wires with the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination exhibit a combination of transverse flat fractures parallel to the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination and positively inclined slant fractures at the outer edges of the wire's thickness. FE failure analysis reveals that fracture initiations do not always begin at the termini of every longitudinal crack-like/line-type lamination as reported in a published fractographic failure analysis report of wires with longitudinal crack-like laminations. Fracture initiation only begins at the termini/tip of longitudinal inclined-end crack-like laminations and at the termini/tip of transverse and lateral laminations. FE failure analysis also reveals that wires with single straight-end, double straight-end and double inclined-end longitudinal crack-like/line-type laminations do not exhibit cup and cone fractures as reported. This work further demonstrates the need to employ FE failure analysis as a complimentary or alternative failure analysis approach where the destruction/alteration of the fracture markings by corrosion could affect the accuracy of fractographic failure analysis.

40|$|Convolute {{lamination}} is {{a common}} fold structure within turbidite beds, attributed to the deformation of sediment during or soon after deposition of the host bed. Despite the prevalence of this feature, the formational processes are still not well understood. Possible mechanisms are investigated here through redescription and analysis of convolute lamination from the Aberystwyth Grits Group (Silurian, west Wales, UK), in which "convolute bedding" was first defined. Internal bed structures have been studied in clean coastal exposures and on high-resolution optical scans of cut <b>surfaces.</b> Convolute <b>lamination</b> occurs in intervals 2 - 10 cm thick, spanning {{the top of the}} very fine sand Bouma C division through the D division of interlaminated silt and clay. Observed growth geometries confirm that the structure formed during sedimentation of the host graded bed. Folds show a down-flow asymmetry and doubly-vergent diapiric geometries ("mushroom"-shaped structures). Grain size measurements from a modern turbidite (Icod bed, ~ 165 ka, Mor occan Turbidite System) suggest there is an optimal 'window' of average grain size and mud content parameter space, within which convolute lamination develops. It is proposed that this window coincides with a bed density inversion created during deposition of a graded bed as clean sand (with pore spaces infilled by water) fines upwards into mud-rich sand (with pores infilled by an increasing proportion of mud). Porosity decreases and bulk bed density correspondingly increases. The resulting unstable density gradient may lead to vertical buoyancy-driven overturn, manifest as growing folds. Subsequent amplification of the folds due to density differences and modification due to horizontal shear imposed by the depositing turbidity current may then occur. The bed density gradient stabilises with deposition of low permeability mud, suppressing further fold development. Quantitatively, both Rayleigh-Taylor instability and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are theoretically possible in forming folds in this context...|$|R
40|$|The {{inherent}} functionality of {{a printed}} wiring board can be dramatically increased by embedding electronic components into the board. For resistors, capacitors and inductors technological turnkey solutions are offered by major manufacturers and also novel technologies are under development. Application examples for passives integration into flexible PCBs will be given. A further boost of functionality will be accomplished by the integration of active chips into the board. An overview of different approaches and the respective sets of enabling technologies for the integration of chips into the board will be given. Two of the approaches for the chip integration into the board {{will be discussed in}} detail. A prerequisite for those technologies is the chip thinning, which is now available as a commercial service for chip thicknesses down to 20 µm. In the chip in polymer (CIP) approach the thin chip is precisely positioned and soundly attached onto the board <b>surface.</b> After <b>lamination</b> of a copper coated resin foil via contacts are drilled through the laminate to the contact pads of the chip. The transfer of precise chip position parameters with respect to the board is essential for this step. The wiring on the laminate foil to the chip and to other components is subsequently structured. Process parameters and results will be presented. For the embedding of chips into flexible PCBs the chip is flipped onto the substrate surface and thermode bonded. The process implies soldering. Therefore electroless Ni(P) is deposited onto the Al bond pads of the chip which is subsequently covered with small caps of solder. The solder cap heights are in the range of 4 to 8 µm {{in order to keep the}} interconnection height low. The solder joint is realized by thermode bonding of the chip onto the structured wiring of the substrate using no-flow underfiller. The chip containing layer is then laminated and contacted to outer layers of the board by conventional through hole technique. An assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches will be given on the status of our present understanding of the technological challenges...|$|R

It is, usually without much discrimination, cited as evidence of sedimentary origin or even {{as an indication of}} the sequence of deposition. In the present paper examples are given of discordant structures simulating both deltaic and torrential cross lamination but on closer inspection obviously due to differential stretching and variable orientation of cleavage in a thinly laminated quartzphyllite which has been isoclinally folded and subsequently flattened in the bedding plane. Microfabric analysis of micaceous cleavage planes can be a valuable aid in the distinction between discordant structures of sedimentary and deformational nature, and the more so the higher their degree of recristallisation and neomineralisation provided that these processes are strictly nimetic. Workers in the metamorphic field are cautioned to be on the alert for similar features of pseudo discordant bedding which is undoubtedly common in flattened and sheared rocks of variable competence such as the phyllonites and granulites, many of which have been derived from igneous rocks with a primary planar structure. No reliable recognition of top- and bottomsets can be made where discordant bedding has been affected by deformation along existing planes of weakness such as the <b>lamination</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|We give a {{complete}} {{proof of the}} Bers-Sullivan-Thurston Density Conjecture. In {{the light of the}} Ending lamination theorem, it suffices to prove that any collection of possible ending invariants is realized by some algebraic limit of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds.

To any set of ending invariants we associate a sequence of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds and prove that this sequence has a convergent subsequence.

We prove then that the obtained algebraic limit has the desired conformal boundaries and the property that none of the filling laminations is realized by a pleated surface.

Increased surface roughness and polarity due to oxygen groups were detected, and these changes became more evident {{with the increase}} of corona treatment intensity. The number and size of spots on the surface, possibly deriving from processing aids incorporated as additives into the polymer, increase with corona treatment. The response of specimens in accelerated aging was also studied for evaluation of the outdoor stability of these composite structures. Specimens were exposed to the combined action of UV-radiation, humidity, and heat, and the stability of yellow, orange-yellow, orange, green, and bordeaux colors was determined {{as a function of the}} exposure time.

Finally, a 40 % decrease in tensile strength was observed after 216 h of ageing, accompanied with a decrease of 15 %, of modulus and an increase of 160 % in the elongation at break, possibly because of the plasticizing effect taking place during the ageing process.

Three panels {{may be used in}} conjunction as a combined measuring system. One panel consists of an upper dry surface coated aluminum sheet laminated to an ethylene vinyl acetate foam backing block having a pattern of parallel flow water channels and header channels milled into its mating <b>surface</b> prior to <b>lamination</b> to the aluminum sheet. This configuration provides a fin and channel radiator instrument whereby circulating water may be used to measure the heat loss from this panel to night sky radiation. In a second configuration, the surface of a panel without buried water channels but otherwise identical may be wetted in order to study and compare the night sky radiation from its wet surface. In this case, the measuring water is circulated over the upper face of this panel. In a third configuration, water is sprayed onto the surface of the second panel (or a similar panel) so that an evaporative cooling effect is gained in addition to the radiation effect. Initial TRNSYS simulations for the performance of all three configurations are presented and it is planned to use the panels as calibrated instruments for discriminating between the cooling effects of night sky radiation and evaporation.
