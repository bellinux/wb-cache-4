40|$|Abstract Background Cardiac iron {{overload}} is {{the leading}} cause of death in thalassemia major and is usually assessed using myocardial T 2 * measurements. Recently a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) breath-hold T 2 sequence has been developed as a possible alternative. This cardiac T 2 technique has good interstudy reproducibility, but its transferability to different centres has not yet been investigated. Methods and Results The breath-hold black blood spin echo T 2 sequence was installed and validated on 1. 5 T Siemens MR scanners at 4 different centres across the world. Using this sequence, 5 – 10 thalassemia patients from each centre were scanned twice locally within a week for local interstudy reproducibility (n = 34) and all were rescanned within one month at the <b>standardization</b> <b>centre</b> in London (intersite reproducibility). The local interstudy reproducibility (coefficient of variance) and mean difference were 4. 4 % and - 0. 06 ms. The intersite reproducibility and mean difference between scanners were 5. 2 % and - 0. 07 ms. Conclusion The breath-hold myocardial T 2 technique is transferable between Siemens scanners with good intersite and local interstudy reproducibility. This technique may have value in the diagnosis and management of patients with iron overload conditions such as thalassemia. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{the palm}} oil industry, iodine value (IV) {{has become an}} {{important}} parameter in quality control that measures the degree of unsaturation of the oils. However, {{it is difficult to}} obtain the IV chemically. In other hand, the use of instrumental analysis in IV determination accurately needs suitable data pre-processing. In this study, we proposed the strategy for pre-processing the FT-NIR and FTIR spectra data in analyzing the IV of non-fried and fried palm oils. The utility and effectiveness of four data pre-processing which are column <b>standardization,</b> mean <b>centre</b> and combination of row scaling with column <b>standardization</b> and mean <b>centre</b> were applied. The effect of data splitting methods which are duplex and kenstone was also investigated in the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression model of palm oils. From the result, the use of different data pre-processing provides different quality of prediction model. Either the application of the row scaling and column scaling individually or combination of both methods may improve the quality of the model. It is concluded that the data pre-processing is context dependent which is depend {{on the nature of the}} dataset and there can be no single method for general use...|$|R
40|$|Note on Transliteration Despite the {{introduction}} of an official Somali script in 1972, considerable variation still exists in the transliteration of Somali words and place names into other languages. In the interests of <b>standardization,</b> the Somaliland <b>Centre</b> for Peace and Development has opted for Somali spellings of all Somali terms and place names within this text. The Somali alphabet is almost entirely phonetic, although tonal accents must be learned. However, there exist some variations in orthography: native Somali words never use p, v, or z, and Somali language involves certain sounds not used in English. C a voiced pharyngeal fricative – a sound close to the Arabic ayn, involving a tightening of the throat, suggestive of slight retching (i. e. Cabdi, Burco) X a voiceless pharyngeal fricative – like a hard, aspirated “h”, involving a forced depression {{of the back of}} the tongue together with tightening of the throat (i. e. Xasan, Sallaxley) Q a voiceless uvular stop – like a soft “k”, involving a forced depression {{of the back of the}} tongue and a tightening of the throat (i. e. qaad, woqooyi) Dh a post-alveolar retroflex stop – pronounced with the tongue tip curled up slightly behind the upper teeth ridge (i. e. Badhan, Dhahar) Kh a voiceless velar or uvular fricative found only in Arabic loan-words (i. e. Sheekh) For a comprehensive introduction to Somali sounds and spelling, see R. David Zorc an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{formally}} {{defines a}} web component model enabling end-user programmers to build component-based rich internet applications (RIAs) that are tailored {{to meet their}} particular needs. It {{is the product of}} a series of previously published papers. The formal definition in description logic verifies that the model is consistent and subsumes currently existing models. We demonstrate experimentally that it is more effective than the others. Current tools propose very disparate web component models, which are based on the appropriate invocation of service backends, overlooking user needs in order to exploit these services and resources in a friendly manner. We have proposed a web model based on a detailed study of existing tools, their pros and cons, limitations and key success factors that have enabled other web end-user development (WEUD) solutions to help end-user programmers to build software to support their needs. In this paper we have verified that the proposed model subsumes and is instantiated by the models of the other existing tools that we analysed, coming a step closer to the <b>standardization</b> of end-user <b>centred</b> RIAs and development environments. We have implemented a development tool, called EzWeb, to produce RIAs that implement the proposed model. This tool enables users to develop their application following the model’s component structure based on end-user programming success factors. We report a statistical experiment in which users develop increasingly complex web software using the EzWeb tool generating RIAs that conform to the proposed component model, and other WEUD tools generating RIAs that conform to other models. This experiment confirms the applicability of the proposed model and demonstrates that more enduser programmers (EUPs) (users concerned with programming primarily for personal rather public use) successfully develop web solutions for complex problems using the EzWeb tool that implements the model, which is more efficient than existing tools that implement other models...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Previous {{work from}} other {{countries}} has shown a significant inverse relationship {{between the number of}} some surgical procedures undertaken in a hospital and in an adverse outcomes. In the light of the changing nature of the provision of joint replacements in the United Kingdom, we have examined the effects of surgical volumes and the presence/absence of training centre status, on outcomes following total joint replacement (TJR) in England. METHODS: Analysis of the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) on all hip/knee joint replacements in English National Health Service (NHS) trusts between financial years 1997 and 2002. Exposures explored were the volume of hip/knee replacements per annum in an NHS trust, training centre status and whether the admission was routine or emergency. Four surrogate measures of adverse outcome were assessed: 30 -day in-hospital mortality, length of stay in hospital, readmission within a year and surgical revision within 5 years. Age and sex were controlled for as potential confounders. RESULTS: Data from a total of 281 360 hip replacements and 211 099 knee replacements were examined. HES data show that the numbers of TJRs performed in low volume trusts are small and decreasing. Adverse outcomes were also uncommon. Nevertheless, significant associations between adverse outcomes and low volume units, and better outcomes in training centres, were detected. For example, the odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital death within 30 days of hip replacement in trusts doing < 50 hip/replacements per annum is 1. 98 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) = 1. 13 - 3. 47] compared with trusts doing 251 - 500 operations/annum. Similarly, surgery in non-training centres is more likely to result in mortality than that in training centres (OR = 1. 25, 95 % CI = 1. 05 - 1. 48). The examination of surgical revision indicated adverse outcomes in higher volume units; {{this may be due to}} case-mix. CONCLUSION: In England, there are fewer adverse events following TJR in high volume centres and in orthopaedic training <b>centres.</b> <b>Standardization</b> of procedures may account for this finding. The data have implications for private practice in the United Kingdom and for the current move to undertake TJRs in Independent Sector Treatment Centres...|$|R
40|$|Multi-centre MRI {{studies of}} the brain are {{essential}} for enrolling large and diverse patient cohorts, as required for the investigation of heterogeneous neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the multi-site comparison of standard MRI data sets that are weighted with respect to tissue parameters such as the relaxation times (T 1, T 2) and proton density (PD) may be problematic, as signal intensities and image contrasts depend on site-specific details such as the sequences used, imaging parameters, and sensitivity profiles of the radiofrequency (RF) coils. Water or gel phantoms are frequently used for long-term and/or inter-site quality assessment. However, these phantoms hardly mimic the structure, shape, size or tissue distribution of the human brain. The goals of this study were: (1) to validate the long-term stability of a human post-mortem brain phantom, performing quantitative mapping of T 1, T 2, and PD, and the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) {{over a period of}} 18. months; (2) to acquire and analyse data for this phantom and the brain of a healthy control (HC) in a multi-centre study for MRI protocol <b>standardization</b> in four <b>centres,</b> while conducting a voxel-wise as well as whole brain grey (GM) and white matter (WM) tissue volume comparison. MTR, T 2, and the quotient of PD in WM and GM were stable in the post-mortem brain with no significant changes. T 1 was found to decrease from 267 / 236. ms (GM/WM) to 234 / 216. ms between 5 and 17. weeks post embedment, stabilizing during an 18 -month period following the first scan at about 215 / 190. ms. The volumetric measures, based on T 1 -weighted MP-RAGE images obtained at all participating centres, revealed inter- and intra-centre variations in the evaluated GM and WM volumes that displayed similar trends in both the post-mortem brain as well as the HC. At a confidence level of 95 %, brain regions such as the brainstem, deep GM structures as well as boundaries between GM and WM tissues were found to be less reproducible than other brain regions in all participating centres. The results demonstrate that a post-mortem brain phantom may be used as a reliable tool for multi-centre MR studies...|$|R
