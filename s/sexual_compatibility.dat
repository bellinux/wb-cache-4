In this study, individuals of A. parasiticus from a population showing an evolutionary history of recombination were examined for sexual reproduction. Crosses between strains with opposite mating-type genes MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 resulted in the develop-ment of ascospore-bearing ascocarps embedded within stromata. Sexually compatible strains belonged to different vegetative compatibility groups. Recombination through the independent assortment of chromosomes 3 and 6 was detected using loci for mating type, aflatoxin gene cluster, and a protein-encoding gene.

The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence rate of risky behaviors among students of Dezful University of Medical Sciences in 2014. Method: This is a descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study, which cluster random sampling were used to selecting subjects. Young's Risk Behaviors Scale (YRBS) was used to evaluate risky behaviors and factors affecting it. The mean, standard deviation, Chi-square tests, t-tests and ANOVA were used to analysis of data. Results: The study was included 150 (50 %) female and 150 (50 %) male. The most frequency was the age group of 20 - 24 years old. There was a statistically significant difference between average scores of risky behaviors among female and male students (p˂ 0. 05). The results of study showed that the prevalence of risky behaviors, high speed in driving and drug consumption is different in various fields of study (p˂ 0. 05).

40|$|Citrus is {{the most}} {{extensively}} produced tree fruit crop in the world. There are two clearly differentiated markets: the fresh fruit and the processed juice market. Citrus species are essentially diploids (2 n = 2 x = 18) and were domesticated in Southeast Asia several thousand years ago and then spread throughout the world. Most of the cultivated citrus species {{are part of the}} Citrus genus containing, depending on the taxonomist, between 16 and 156 species. The relative complexity of these classifications results from the conjunction of a broad morphological diversity, total <b>sexual</b> interspecific <b>compatibility</b> within the genus and apomixis. There are four basic taxa on the basis of morphological descriptors and molecular data (C. maxima (Burm.) Merr., the pummelos; C. medica L., the citrons, C. reticulata Blanco, the andarins, and C. micrantha Wester). The other cultivated species (C. aurantium L., the sour orange; C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck, the sweet orange; C. paradisi Macf, the grapefruit; C. limon (L.) Burm. f., the lemon, and C. aurantifolia (Christm.) Swingle, the lime) appeared by recombination among the basic taxa. Most of the citrus scion cultivars result from the selection of spontaneous bud mutations identified in production orchards. Today several projects of ploidy manipulation are developed in different countries to select seedless triploid mandarins. Fruit quality (size, color, easy-peeling), seedlessness, and the extension of the harvest season are the main selection objectives for fresh market cultivars. The majority of the rootstocks used for propagation are original species or ancient natural hybrids. However, intergeneric hybrids (Citrus × Poncirus) such as citranges, citrumelos, and citrandarins have an increasing importance. The first rootstock breeding objective is adaptation to soil conditions and soil pathogens. The most widespread needs would be tolerance to CTV. Biotechnology is strongly integrated into breeding and propagation schemes. Shoot tip grafting is widely used for sanitation of the mother plants in certification propagation schemes. Somatic hybridization is an effective tool used for scion and rootstock breeding. Functional genomics studies ESTs, microarray platforms, and a full genome sequence are available. Efficient and reliable transformation systems for several economically important citrus species exist. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Mating type {{genes are}} central to <b>sexual</b> {{reproduction}} and <b>compatibility</b> in Ascomycete fungi. However the “MAT ” loci experience unique evolutionary pressures that can result in rapid divergence and enhanced inter-specific gene-flow (lateral gene transfer). In this study, molecular evolution of MAT loci was considered using the genus Fusarium (Teleomorph: Gibberella) as a model. Both MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 “idiomorphs ” from eleven species of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex were sequenced. Molecular evolution of the MAT loci from these heterothallic (self-sterile) species was {{compared with that of}} the MAT loci from nine homothallic (self-fertile) species in the Fusarium graminearum species complex. Although Fusarium has previously been thought to have the same complement of four MAT genes that are found in Neurospora, we found evidence of a novel gene, MAT 1 - 2 - 3, that may be specific to the Hypocreales. All MAT genes share a similar set of cis-regulatory motifs, although homothallic species might have recruited novel regulatory elements, which could potentially facilitate alternate expression of MAT 1 - 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 - 1. Fusarium MAT loci displayed evidence consistent with historical lateral gene-flow. Most notably, the MAT 1 - 1 idiomorph of Fusarium sacchari appears to be unrelated to those of other species in the G. fujikuroi complex. In general, Fusarium MAT genes are highly divergent. Both positive selection and relaxed selective constraint could account for this phenomenon. However, the extent of both recombination and inter-specific gene-flow in the MAT locus also appears to affect the rate of divergence...|$|R

Thus, for the land-owning aristocracy, the point of marriage was to produce a male heir to the property of the household. Since child mortality was common, women had to be more or less continuously pregnant during their marriage to guarantee a living male heir. Furthermore, this heir had to be legitimate, if disputes over inheritance were to be avoided. This legitimacy could only be ensured by the heads of households marrying virgins and ensuring the chastity of their wives {{for the duration of the}} marriage.

50|$|Red Raper was {{a pioneer}} in the study of fungal sexual genetics. He studied mating systems in {{filamentous}} heterotrophs, beginning with the aquatic genus Achlya. Once thought to be fungi because of their filamentous growth form and nutritional habits, Achlya and other water molds are now known to belong to the Kingdom Chromalveolata. Red and Carlene (Cardy), later studied the genetic control of sexual reproduction in the gilled mushroom Schizophyllum commune. Red realized early on there were fungi that differed in aspects of compatibility and attributed these to what he called incompatibility factors A and B, further differentiating α and β in each. Some fungi have two mating types, termed bipolar, and others including some Red worked on, have thousands of mating types due to a more complicated mating type determination system. These two extreme strategies are thought to be involved with manipulating the chance of out versus self-crossing as evolutionary strategies. He and Cardy studied the events preceding karyogamy, including the transition from monokaryotic to dikaryotic. Much of Red’s work has spawned many research questions about sex in fungi addressed more recently using model organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cryptococcus gattii, and Candida albicans. His research laid the foundation for the current knowledge body about somatic and <b>sexual</b> <b>compatibility</b> in fungi. Through the influence of Red's work, it is now understood that mating-type identity is determined by regions of the genome called mating type or MAT loci. These loci contain protein-coding regions for G protein-coupled receptors that sense ligands with varying specificity and signal through Mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, as well as peptide pheromones and transcription factors involved in mate sensation, selection and reproduction.|$|E

It was suggested that SCM, as a morphological characteristic, can reflect genomic type, and be used to distinguish B-genome species such as B. juncea from the related S. arvensis.

40|$|In Mexico {{and other}} countries, {{cultivation}} of pitahaya (Hylocereus spp.) is considered very promising because its fruit is well accepted {{and it is}} resistant to drought. However, new plantations in Mexico have several problems, including genetic heterogeneity of plantation material and low fruit production relative to total flower production of some genotypes. Knowing biodiversity of a plant resource allows election of strategies for better use. This motivated the study of five genotypes (1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) cultivated in southern Quintana Roo, Mexico, to characterize their morphology and evaluate their <b>sexual</b> <b>compatibility.</b> The morphological characterization was determined with quantitative variables (length and diameter) of flower, fruit, stem, seed and pollen, {{as well as with}} color of the pericarp (qualitative variable). <b>Sexual</b> <b>compatibility</b> was evaluated with self-pollination. The genotypes were differentiated mainly by the characteristics of their reproductive structures. Based on an analysis of variance, clusters and principal components, it was determined that genotypes 1, 3 and 6 have similar characteristics in their reproductive structures, while genotypes 4 and 5 have more differences. Genotypes I and 5 were self-compatible and have more productive potential for the region because of the characteristics of their fruits...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSpecies of Calonectria {{and their}} Cylindrocladium anamorphs are {{important}} plant pathogens worldwide. At present 52 Cylindrocladium spp. and 37 Calonectria spp. are recognised based on <b>sexual</b> <b>compatibility,</b> morphology and phylogenetic inference. The polyphasic approach of integrating Biological, Morphological and Phylogenetic Species Concepts has revolutionised the taxonomy of fungi. This review aims {{to present an}} overview of published research on the genera Calonectria and Cylindrocladium as they pertain to their taxonomic history.

40|$|Numerous {{populations of}} newts and {{salamanders}} are dimorphic: while some larvae become mature and thus paedomorphic, others metamorphose and become adult later. The two morphs largely differ in morphology. According to sexual selection theories, we could expect some female choice towards the alternative morphs. Although paedomorphosis can be adaptive in allowing resource partitioning and an earlier age at maturity, it is worth to determine the strength of sexual isolation between morphs. Indeed, whereas <b>sexual</b> <b>compatibility</b> may promote maintenance of polymorphism by mixing genes, sexual isolation {{could be the first}} step to sympatric speciation. We staged more than 200 encounters involving the four possible crosses within and between the heterochronic morphs of the Alpine newt, Triturus alpestris (Amphibia, Caudata). We took into account both quantitative and qualitative aspects of behaviours, with particular emphasis on the success of sperm transfer. We also determined secondary sexual characters. The success of heterotypic and homotypic encounters was similar, involving then <b>sexual</b> <b>compatibility</b> between the two heterochronic morphs. Paedomorphs and metamorphs displayed identical behavioural patterns at similar frequencies. Females {{did not appear to be}} selective against males on the basis of their epigamic characters. Our results do not support hypotheses predicting sympatric speciation from polymorphic species. On the other hand, they are in favour of the models predicting maintenance of polymorphismPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{differentiation}} among geographic isolates of the pantropical to warm-temperate red alga Digenea simplex (Wulfen) C. Agardh {{was investigated}} using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, crossing studies, and temperature tolerances experiments. Eleven isolates representing populations from the Caribbean, eastern Atlantic, and Indo-West Pacific were compared. RAPD analysis clearly revealed an Indo-West Pacific group, a Caribbean/Cape Verde Islands group, and a Canary Islands group. Crossing studies showed {{different levels of}} interfertility. In most crosses between Western Australian and Atlantic isolates, no hybrid tetrasporophytes were formed. In crosses between Caribbean and Cape Verde Islands isolates, tetrasporophytes developed, but the viability of tetraspores was reduced. Full <b>sexual</b> <b>compatibility</b> was observed among Cape Verde Islands isolates and among isolates from Bonaire. Temperature tolerance studies indicate that Pacific isolates have a broader temperature survival range than Atlantic isolates, which may be correlated to local temperature extremes. Despite the reduced level of <b>sexual</b> <b>compatibility</b> between Caribbean and Cape Verde Islands isolates, their shared position in the RAPD analysis and similar temperature responses suggest trans-Atlantic dispersal in the near geological past. In addition to their discrete position in the RAPD distance analysis, the Canary Islands isolates were significantly more cold-tolerant than the other Atlantic isolates. This {{finding is consistent with}} the hypothesis that the Canary Islands were recolonized from cold-adapted eastern Mediterranean populations after the last Pleistocene glaciation...|$|E
