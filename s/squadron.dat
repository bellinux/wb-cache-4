5|$|A {{series of}} air raids were mounted against Bardia in December, {{in the hope}} of persuading the {{garrison}} to withdraw. Once {{it became clear that the}} Italians intended to stand and fight, bombing priorities shifted to the Italian airbases around Tobruk, Derna and Benina. Air raids on Bardia resumed in the lead-up to the ground assault, with 100 bombing sorties flown against Bardia between 31 December 1940 and 2 January 1941, climaxing with a particularly heavy raid by Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 70 <b>Squadron</b> RAF and Bristol Bombay bombers of No. 216 <b>Squadron</b> RAF on the night of 2/3 January 1941. Lysanders of No. 208 <b>Squadron</b> RAF directed the artillery fire.

Exceptions are USN helicopter mine countrmeasures <b>squadrons</b> (17 MH-53), USMC composite medium tilt-rotor <b>squadrons</b> (12 MV-22s, 6 AH-1s, 4 CH-53s, 3 UH-1s, and 6 AV-8s), heavy helicopter (16 CH-53s) and light/attack helicopter (18 AH-1s and 9 UH-1s) <b>squadrons,</b> and Marine attack <b>squadrons</b> (16 AV-8s).|$|R
5|$|After {{receiving}} its new aircraft, the <b>squadron</b> was {{tasked with}} anti-shipping attacks, and it and No.100 <b>Squadron</b> cooperated {{in an attack}} on a Japanese convoy near Cape St. George on the night of 20 October during which a No.6 <b>Squadron</b> pilot claimed to have damaged a cruiser. No.6 <b>Squadron</b> also bombed Japanese positions in New Britain during October in conjunction with No.100 <b>Squadron.</b> In addition to these offensive operations, the <b>squadron</b> regularly flew anti-submarine patrols to protect Allied shipping. In November the <b>squadron</b> moved to Goodenough Island and became part of No. 71 Wing RAAF alongside No.8 and No.100 Squadrons. From November 1943 to March 1944, No.6 <b>Squadron</b> took part in attacks on the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and also struck other targets in the region to support the naval and ground forces engaged in the New Britain Campaign. From March the <b>squadron</b> mainly undertook convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols, which proved uneventful. No.6 Squadron's operations were hampered by mechanical problems with its Beauforts, which had been issued to the unit after being reconditioned following service with other RAAF squadrons, and this problem continued until October when it received an allocation of recently built aircraft.|$|E

No. 308 Polish Fighter <b>Squadron</b> and No. 306 Polish Fighter <b>Squadron</b> later joined No.303 during 1941 to form the No.1 Polish Fighter Wing. Polish Fighter Squadrons based at Northolt in 1942 took part in Operation Jubilee (the raid on Dieppe) on 19 August alongside Nos.302 and 308 from nearby RAF Heston. Reconnaissance squadrons No.16 <b>Squadron</b> and No.140 <b>Squadron</b> operating Supermarine Spitfires and de Havilland Mosquitos moved to Northolt in 1944. No.69 <b>Squadron</b> with their Vickers Wellingtons modified for photographic reconnaissance arrived later. All three reconnaissance squadrons were combined to form No.34 (PR) Wing.|$|E

Satsuma rejoined the 1st Battleship <b>Squadron</b> in 1915, was refitted at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 and served with the 1st <b>Squadron</b> {{for the rest of the}} war.

50|$|In 1948, 20 RAuxAF Regiment <b>Squadrons</b> were proposed. In the event, 12 {{were formed}} in the Light Anti-Aircraft role, {{equipped}} with 40mm anti-aircraft guns and attached to the RAuxAF flying <b>squadrons.</b> By 1955, due to the introduction into service of more sophisticated weapons, the <b>squadrons</b> were converted to Regiment Field <b>Squadrons.</b> All 12 <b>squadrons</b> were disbanded, along with the flying <b>squadrons</b> in 1957.

5|$|At 11:00 on 14 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, {{the brigade}} vanguard, {{encountered}} Turkish observation posts. The brigade ordered {{an attack on}} the main Turkish defences. The regiment was positioned to cover the left flank. Advancing by troops they came under machine-gun fire. The 3rd <b>Squadron</b> was dispatched to occupy the high ground on the regiment's right while the other squadrons took cover. Then a force of Turkish cavalry appeared to their left. McCarroll sent the 11th <b>Squadron</b> to check on their dispositions and numbers. However, the <b>squadron</b> encountered heavy rifle and machine-gun fire and could not move forward. To assist them, two troops from the 4th <b>Squadron,</b> were ordered to charge on horseback. The two troops captured the position and continued forward, occupying the high ground on the left in front of the Wellington Mounted Rifles. The 3rd <b>Squadron,</b> in reserve, provided covering fire as the 11th <b>Squadron</b> moved forward alongside the 4th on their left. Covered by the 4th <b>Squadron,</b> the 11th <b>Squadron</b> moved forward. At 14:15 the advance troops of the 11th <b>Squadron</b> located, in an orange grove, a Turkish concentration of troops that counter-attacked the regiment. McCarroll, who had kept up with his forward line of troops, ordered the rest of the regiment, including headquarters troops, to move up in support of the 11th <b>Squadron.</b> The 3rd <b>Squadron</b> galloped forward, dismounting just behind the front line, and engaged the Turkish attack with enfilade fire, forcing the Turks to retire.|$|E
5|$|At 13:59, Poling {{radar station}} {{picked up the}} German {{formations}} and reported them as 80 strong. Smaller forces ranging from 9 to 20-plus represented the German fighters moving up behind it. The British estimated the Luftwaffe attack force to be 150 aircraft strong. It was an underestimation by half. No. 10 Group RAF and No. 11 Group alerted their units from their operations rooms at Uxbridge and Box in Wiltshire. No. 10 and 11 Groups dispatched more Squadrons to support the already airborne 11 Hurricanes from No. 601 <b>Squadron.</b> 10 Group dispatched one <b>Squadron</b> each from RAF Middle Wallop, RAF Exeter and RAF Warmwell, and one each from No. 11's RAF Tangmere and RAF Westhampnett.
