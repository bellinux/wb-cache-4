60|$|Washington, Tuesday, May 5, 1863. DEAREST MOTHER--Your letter came safe, and {{was very}} welcome, and always will be. Mother, I am <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> rheumatism--if it still {{continues}} I {{think it would be}} well for me to write a line to Mrs. Piercy, and get Jeff to stop with it, so that you could take the baths again, as I am sure they are very beneficial. Dear mother, you write me, or Jeff must in the next letter, how you are getting along, whether it is any better or worse--I want to know. Mother, about George's fund in the bank; I hope by all means you can scratch along so as to leave $250 there--I am so anxious that our family should have a little ranch, even if it is the meanest kind, off somewhere that you can call your own, and that would do for Ed etc.--it might be a real dependence, and comfort--and may-be for George as much as any one. I mean to come home one of these days, and get the acre or half acre somewhere out in some by-place on Long Island, and build it--you see if I don't. About Hannah, dear mother, I hardly know what advice to give you--from what I know at present I can't tell what course to pursue. I want Han to come home, {{from the bottom of my}} heart. Then there are other thoughts and considerations that come up. Dear mother, I cannot advise, but shall acquiesce in anything that is settled upon, and try to help.|$|E

5000|$|Example: Plaintiff P slices her lip on a shard {{of glass}} that somehow {{made its way}} into a salad {{prepared}} in defendant D's restaurant.

Please don't worry about your expenses for this hospital visit, I'll write you a check for whatever your bills add up to."

5000|$|American {{professor}} of religious history Randall Balmer {{believed that the}} causes of the demise of Solid Rock were [...] "Idealism, marital difficulties, and financial naivete — as well as changing musical tastes". Stonehill opined in 1994: [...] "As artistically heady as the days at Solid Rock were ... and as good as the ideas were on paper, the business end was always very loose-knit. ... We were young guys with good ideas but {{not a whole lot of}} business sense". Norman acknowledged in a 1984 interview: [...] "I've never been really good in the business side of it. I haven't had a problem with creativity but I've never had the business side of it together." [...] In a 1998 letter to Randy Stonehill, Norman indicated: [...] "I DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT: You know I never cared about money, so it's something I never worried about. Which was probably not helpful to running a record company and keeping track of everything to the artists' satisfaction. ... I couldn't run the label without competent assistants. I trusted Philip Mangano to keep track of royalties, gave him an open checkbook, and never looked over his shoulder. I thought he was my other half. And Philip just wasn't that man. He made a lot of money ... and I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> royalties, but I ran the musical side and Philip ran the business side".|$|E
