500|$|Gygax {{immediately}} discarded {{his movie}} ambitions—his D movie {{would never be}} made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing , it was barely breaking even; {{it was in fact}} [...] in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency. After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the American Management Association by adding three [...] "outside" [...] directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck. Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share <b>stock</b> <b>option,</b> giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD book, Unearthed Arcana, a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, Saga of Old City, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams.|$|E

First, for a fixed exercise price of executive <b>stock</b> <b>options,</b> the size of the option grant decreases in the riskiness of a desired investment policy, decreases in the volatility of return from the risky project, and increases in leverage. Second, for a fixed size of the option grant, the optimal exercise price of managerial <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> increases in the riskiness of a desired investment policy, increases in the volatility of return from the risky project, and decreases in leverage.

5000|$|Supporters of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> {{say they}} align the {{interests}} of CEOs to those of shareholders, since options are valuable only if the stock price remains above the option's strike price. <b>Stock</b> <b>options</b> are now counted as a corporate expense (non-cash), which impacts a company's income statement and makes the distribution of options more transparent to shareholders. Critics of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> charge that they are granted without justification as {{there is little reason}} to align {{the interests of}} CEOs with those of shareholders. Empirical evidence shows since the wide use of <b>stock</b> <b>options,</b> executive pay relative to workers has dramatically risen.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{practice}} of granting a company’s employees, officers, and directors options {{to purchase the}} company’s stock has become widespread among American businesses. According to Information Technology Associates, 15 % to 20 % of public companies offer <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> to employees {{as a part of}} their compensation package, and over 10 million employees receive them. During the technology company boom of the 1990 s, they were especially important to start-up companies, allowing them to avoid paying large cash salaries to attract talent. Employee <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> have been extolled as innovative compensation plans benefitting companies, stockholders, and employees. They have been condemned as schemes to enrich insiders at the expense of ordinary stockholders and as tax avoidance devices. This report explains the tax treatment of various types of employee <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> recognized by the Internal Revenue Code, examines {{some of the issues that}} have arisen because of the real and perceived tax benefits accorded employee <b>stock</b> <b>options,</b> and describes key laws and regulations concerning <b>stock</b> <b>options,</b> and discusses the “book-tax” gap as it relates to <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> and S. 1375 (Ending Excessive Corporate Deductions for <b>Stock</b> <b>Options</b> Act) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of {{corporate}} scandals and excessive <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> compensation, International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) has introduced a new accounting standard, IIFRS 2 Share-based Payments. The scope of the standard extends beyond payments to employees, but {{for the purpose of}} this study, the focus is only on 'employee stock options'. IIFRS 2 requires a fair value of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> records calculated on grant date, and recognized as compensation expenses over vesting periods. Prior to the introduction of IIFRS 2, <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> were not recognized and were only disclosed in the notes to the accounts. In Malaysia, the standard is mandatory for all companies listed on or after January 1, 2006. This study assumes the requirement existed in 2003. This study examines the impact of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> expenses from 2003 to 2005, on the top 100 Malaysian companies. The three year observations show at least 24 % of the sample exceeds the 5 % materiality threshold on diluted EPS. The sectors that are impacted the most are the Trade/Service and Finance sectors. From the multiple-regression test, this study finds that fair value of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> have a negative relationship with dividend yields (input of the Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) Model). Most companies in the sample are found to pay dividends and grant <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> at the same time.
