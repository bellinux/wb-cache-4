40|$|Arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> a graph were {{introduced}} by Lorenzini as some intersection matrices {{that arise in}} the study of degenerating curves in algebraic geometry. In this article we study these arithmetical structures, in particular we are interested in the arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> complete graphs, paths, and cycles. We begin by looking at the arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> a multidigraph from the general perspective of $M$-matrices. As an application, we recover the result of Lorenzini about the finiteness of the number of arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> a graph. We give a description <b>on</b> the arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> the graph obtained by merging and splitting a vertex of a graph in terms of its arithmetical <b>structures.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, we give a description of the arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> the clique [...] star transform of a graph, which generalizes the subdivision of a graph. As an application of this result we obtain an explicit description of all the arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> the paths and cycles and we show that the number of the arithmetical <b>structures</b> <b>on</b> a path is a Catalan number.
