Come sit, says my lady; then whips up her scissar, And cuts out his coxcomb in silk in a trice, sir. Dan sat with attention, and saw with surprise How she lengthen'd his chin, how she hollow'd his eyes; But flatter'd himself with a secret conceit, That his thin lantern jaws all her art would defeat. Lady Betty observed it, then pulls out a pin, And varies the grain of the stuff to his grin: And, to make roasted silk to resemble his raw-bone, She raised up a thread to the jet of his jaw-bone; Till at length in exactest proportion he rose, From the crown of his head to the arch of his nose; And if Lady Betty had drawn him with wig and all, 'Tis certain the copy had outdone the original.

40|$|Investigators {{conducting}} a decade-long study into how Florida’s “red tide ” algal blooms affect human health have discovered several compounds that counteract the toxins {{produced by the}} red tide dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis. In an intriguing twist, they are now developing one of these compounds, brevenal, as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). In cellular and animal models brevenal appears far more potent than existing drugs for CF and COPD and exhibits the unique quality of both suppressing inflammation and boosting mucociliary clearance. 1 The investigators spent five years identifying compounds produced by K. brevis that cause classic red tide symptoms of bronchoconstriction, watering eyes, and slowed mucociliary clearance. “Then we expanded the study to characterize all the degradation products, the side products, and coproducts from the biosynthetic machinery that could also be airborne, as we thought these might have some effect on people, ” <b>says</b> <b>Dan</b> Baden, director of the Center for Marin...|$|E
