5000|$|The Capitol Theatre was {{commissioned}} {{by a group of}} Melbourne businessmen, including the Greek Consul-General Anthony JJ Lucas, and was designed by the renowned US architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, and today is considered the finest interior design work by this talented couple. Lucas had worked previously with Griffin on the development of both the Vienna Cafe as well as his own property Yamala in Frankston. The official plans for the Capitol were <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> <b>on</b> 21 November 1921, and after being approved on 9 February 1923 construction began and was completed in 1924. It was officially opened on 7 November 1924. The theatre itself and ten-storey office block above it, are registered with the Australian Heritage Commission, the National Trust and Heritage Victoria. The building belongs to the interwar period and the architectural style is Chicagoesque. It was described by the leading architect and academic Robin Boyd as [...] "the best cinema that was ever built or is ever likely to be built". [...] Originally seating 2137 (stalls 1306, balcony 633, loges and boxes 198). During the 1930s, the seating capacity was reduced to 2115 people. The theatre was considered an architectural masterpiece, and has continued to receive critical acclaim ever since its first opening.|$|E

40|$|By {{studying}} {{drugs that}} have been withdrawn from themarket for safety reasons, we can gain valuable in-sight into postmarketing surveillance {{as well as the}} process for approving new drugs. In the past decade there has been a major shift in the funding structure of the Ther-apeutic Products Directorate (TPD), the branch of Health Canada in charge of approving new drugs. Since 1994, pharmaceutical companies have been charged fees for each new drug they <b>submit</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> or have <b>on</b> the market. By 1999 these user charges were paying for close to 70 % of the cost of running the TPD. 1 In return, the industry asked for action on the speed with which new drugs are approved. 2 In the United States, user fees were also tied to speedier approvals by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The average approval time dropped from 27 months in 1993, when user fees were instituted, to 19 months i...|$|R

5000|$|In September 2014, the New York Post {{reported}} that Fox {{was planning to}} acquire KCPQ in exchange for its Chicago MyNetworkTV station WPWR—which would have given Tribune a sister station to its then-CW affiliate and flagship station WGN-TV (WGN has since dropped the CW affiliation in favor of WPWR). On September 23, Tribune announced {{that it had been}} notified by Fox that its affiliation with KCPQ would be terminated as of January 17, 2015, but that discussions between the two companies were still ongoing. The affiliation would have been terminated one day before the 2014-15 NFC Championship Game (which ended up with the Seahawks winning against the Green Bay Packers at home). Days earlier, on September 19, Fox struck a deal to buy KBCB, a station in Bellingham, for $10 million; the purchase, <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> FCC <b>approval</b> <b>on</b> October 3, was described as a [...] "strategic option" [...] for Fox by an insider. Naming KBCB as Fox's Seattle affiliate would have had immediate complications for Fox's distribution in the market, as KBCB's transmitter on Orcas Island was much closer to Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, and provides a marginal signal to Seattle proper. By the time the KBCB purchase was disclosed, talks between Tribune and Fox had deteriorated; a Wall Street Journal report on October 7 stated that Fox no longer planned to include WPWR in a potential swap for KCPQ.|$|R

And to assure there is safe transit for the FARC and to worry about the security of communities. [...] no more political deaths in Colombia."

At the best facility, the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, building engines from scratch would take at least a year. Upon learning this, Williamson suggested taking the engines from the hulk of Merrimack, recently raised from the bed of the Elizabeth River.

Porter produced the revised plans, which were <b>submitted</b> to Mallory <b>for</b> <b>approval.</b> <b>On</b> July 11, 1861, the new design was accepted, and work began almost immediately. The burned-out hull was towed into the graving dock that the Union Navy had failed to destroy. During the subsequent conversion process, the plans developed further, incorporating an iron ram fitted to the prow. The re-modeled ship's offense, in addition to the ram, consisted of 10 guns: six [...] smooth-bore Dahlgrens, two [...] and two [...] Brooke rifles. Trials showed that these rifles firing solid shot would pierce up to eight inches of armor plating. [...] The Tredegar Iron works could produce both solid shot and shell, and since it was believed that Virginia would face only wooden ships, she was given only the shell. The armor plating, originally meant to be [...] thick, was replaced by double plates, each [...] thick, backed by [...] of iron and pine. The armor was pierced for 14 gunports: four on each broadside, three forward, and three aft.
