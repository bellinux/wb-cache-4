40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis report examines {{the effect of}} including real property depreciation in the U. S. Coast Guard's overhead costs. The following accounting concepts are discussed as to the nature and appropriateness to the Yard's accounting: asset valuation, useful life determination, depreciation and asset capitalization criteria. Two methods of overhead allocation are presented and contrasted. The first method is currently used by the Yard {{and the second is}} a proposed replacement. A $ 1, 000. capitalization threshold is proposed to replace the current $ 200 threshold. The real property assets are depreciated {{on the basis of their}} historical cost and by the <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> method. Their <b>depreciation</b> costs are distributed to the appropriate cost centers. From there the costs are allocated to overhead by both allocation methods. The effect of a $ 1, 000 capitalization threshold is then added in to the calculations. A new rate structure is computed twice for both allocation methods: at the current capitalization threshold and at the $ 1, 000 capitalization threshold. The four concurring rates are applied to sample Yard projects to contrast their effects on overhead costs. This report concludes that information based on historical cost is irrelevant due to inflation. A recommendation is made to use current cost, which would produce more useful information to determine the current operating costs of the Coast Guard Yard. [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|R

We assess the different depreciation methods for CHP projects of various sizes (ranging from 1 MW to 100 MW). We evaluate the impact of different depreciation schedules on the tax shield, and the resulting tax savings to potential investors. We show that a shorter depreciation cycle could have a substantial impact on the cost of producing power, making cogeneration more attractive.

Our findings are that in practical terms for a growing perpetuity there are two options: either depreciation life is one year or there is no depreciation at all. The practical implication {{of this is that}} we have to find approximations when calculating terminal values in valuing cash flows. We examine some models and compare them with the theoretical model proposed in this note. The results based on an example are that the model with a nominal plowback ratio is the one that approximates more to the “theoretical” value when depreciation life is one year. The nearest value for typical depreciation lives is more than 95 % higher than the theoretical value. In the last part of this note we pose questions rather than solutions.

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this article is that the tax {{expenditure}} concept is grounded on an erroneous vision of the structure of an income tax system. The tax expenditure concept adopts a binary view of income taxation. It posits that there is an ideal or pure income tax system whose provisions are elements of the normal structure of that system without any influence from non-tax policy considerations. Tax provisions are described either as falling within those core provisions or outside of them. There are no other categories. To the contrary, this article contends that tax provisions lie on a continuum in which some are in the core and some are at different distances from the core. The author contends that virtually all tax provisions, including those within the core, reflect policy considerations. The decision whether to adopt or retain a provision takes into account both its proximity to the core and also the economic and societal consequences (both positive and negative) that the provision will cause. There is no universal tax system for all times. Tax laws are (and should be) constructed to coordinate with the needs and values of society as they change over time. The article also contends that there is not just one proper method of depreciation, and that accelerated depreciation is as consistent with neutral tax principles as is <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>depreciation...</b>|$|E

They believe that planners {{have to consider}} social concerns, environmental and economic impacts related to establishing the biomass systems. Leduc et al. (2008) developed a model to determine the locations and sizes of methanol plants and gas stations in Austria. The objective function of the model consisted of plant and gas station setup cost, methanol production cost, and material transportation cost. Mele et al. (2009) {{proposed a}} model that simultaneously minimizes {{the total cost of}} the network and its environmental performance over the entire life cycle of the product. Zamboni et al. (2009) proposed the bioethanol supply chain optimization in which they presented a model for the strategic design of biomass-based fuel supply networks. Finally, they applied the model for a case study in Italy. Jackson et al. (2009) found that firms using accelerated depreciation make significantly larger capital investments than firms that use <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>depreciation</b> and found {{that there has been a}} migration away from accelerated depreciation to <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>depreciation</b> over the past two decades. Finally, results suggest that a choice made for external financial reporting purposes influences managers’ capital investment decisions. Ayoub et al. (2009) proposed an optimization model for designing and evaluating integrated system of bioenergy production supply chains. Their model was applied in a case study in Japan. Rentizelas and Tatsiopoulos (2010) utilized a hybrid optimization method to find the optimum location of a bioenergy generation facility considering the maximization of the net present value (NPV) of the investment for the project’s lifetime. Velazquez-Marti and Fernandez-Gonzalez (2010) supposed two criteria for the location of established plants for producing the biofuel as: minimizing the transportation costs of biofuels and using all the energy produced by the plant. They applied the model to Spanish rural regions. Akgul et al. (2011) presented the model to optimize the locations and scales of the bioethanol production plants, biomass and bioethanol flows between regions. The purpose of this study is minimizing the total supply chain costs. Kim et al. (2011) formulated a model that enables the selection of fuel conversion technologies and capacities, biomass locations and the logistics of transportation from forestry resources to conversion, and from conversion to final markets. The objective function to be maximized was the overall profit. The revenue of the model includes selling various products in the final market and the credits for the utility energy produced at each plant location. The cost encompassed operating cost, annualized capital cost, transportation cost and biomass acquisition cost for each biomass type. Mobini et al. (2011) developed a simulation model to evaluate the cost of delivered forest biomass, the equilibrium moisture content, and carbon emissions from the logistics operations. Zhu and Yao (2011) proposed a multi-commodity network flow model to design the logistics system. They formulated a model to determine the locations of warehouses, the size of harvesting group, the types and amounts of biomass harvested or purchased, stored, and processed, and the transportation of biomass in the system. The objective function of Leão et al. (2011) consisted of investments for the production plants, transportation costs, agricultural production costs, processing costs and purchasing cost of any additional volumes of oil in the market to meet the demand of the plants. Chen and Fan (2012) developed a two-stage stochastic programming model to minimize the system cost. The system includes bioethanol production, feedstock procurement, fuel delivery, ethanol transportation and possible penalty on fuel shortage. The model was used to evaluate the economic possibility and system robustness in a case study of California. Finally, the model was solved by a Lagrange relaxation-based decomposition solution algorithm. Ayoub and Yuji (2012) utilized a demand-driven approach for optimizing biomass utilization networks cost by applying genetic algorithm to solve the network problem. Judd et al. (2012) proposed a mathematical programming to determine satellite storage locations and equipment routes to minimize the total cost of designing a feedstock logistics system. The feedstock logistics system includes transporting biomass from production fields to the bioenergy plant. Kostin et al. (2012) integrated bioethanol and sugar production supply chain under demand uncertainty. They considered several financial risk mitigation options in the supply chain model. They applied the model in the Argentinean sugarcane industry. Finally the problem was solved by applying the sample average approximation algorithm. Akgul et al. (2012) presented an optimization framework for the strategic design of a hybrid first/second-generation ethanol supply chain. The applicability of the model is demonstrated with a case study of ethanol production in the UK. The potential cost reductions of second-generation biofuel systems are likely to lead to the deployment of these technologies at a larger scale. Bio-based supply chain that was proposed by Pérez-Fortes et al. (2012) led to produce electricity or other bio-products. Their model took into account three main objectives: economic, environmental and social criteria. Biomass storage periods, location and capacity of plants, material transportation between echelons and biomass utilization to produce biofuel are determined in their model. They applied the model for a case study in Ghana. To produce a low-cost urban energy system, Keirstead et al. (2012) accomplished the trade-offs between the alternatives by considering the air pollution impacts. According to their exploration of the trade-offs, biomass energy system is the best choice. Supply chain that worked by Čuček et al. (2012) is included agricultural, preprocessing, processing, and distribution layers. Also they presented a multi-criteria optimization for the conversion of biomass to energy. Fazlollahi and Maréchal (2013) simultaneously minimized costs and CO 2 emission of integrated biomass resources using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Zhang et al. (2013) focused on switch grass as one of the best second-generation feedstock for bioethanol production. They proposed an integrated mathematical model to minimize the total switch grass-based bioethanol supply chain cost. The proposed model considered the impact of switch grass crop yield, switch grass densification, switch grass dry-matter loss during storage, and economies of scale in bio refinery capacities on the total SBSC cost.|$|E
