5|$|In the March 1932 German presidential election, the SPD {{supported}} Paul von Hindenburg for president, {{fearing that}} a <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> would hand {{the job to}} the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) candidate, Adolf Hitler. However, when the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) ran its own candidate, Ernst Thälmann, Fuchs offered to speak for him, and was expelled from the SPD. That year Fuchs and all three of his siblings joined the KPD. Fuchs and his brother Gerhard were active speakers at public meetings, and occasionally attempted to disrupt NSDAP gatherings. At one such gathering, Fuchs was beaten up and thrown into the river.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Brodeur {{finished}} {{among the}} league leaders in wins and GAA. Brodeur continued {{to lead the}} league in victories and remained a Vezina and MVP candidate. The next season, in 2002–03, Brodeur won the Vezina Trophy for the first time. He also won the Jennings Trophy again, was a Hart Memorial Trophy finalist for the league's Most Valuable Player, and was named a 1st Team All-Star and started in the All-Star Game. With {{one of the most}} impressive playoff performances of his career, Brodeur guided the Devils to their third Stanley Cup victory after seven-game series wins against the top-seeded Ottawa Senators and the 7th-seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He posted 3 shutouts against Anaheim and had a playoff total of 7 overall, breaking the NHL record of 6 that had been set by Dominik Hašek the previous year. Despite this, the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP was awarded to Anaheim goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère, who became the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since Ron Hextall of Philadelphia in 1987. Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not win because there were multiple candidates, resulting in a <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> among the sportswriters who selected the winner.|$|E

40|$|In Mixed Member Proportional systems, {{voters are}} able to <b>split</b> their <b>vote.</b> To what extent do voters use this {{opportunity}}, which voters seem to use this opportunity most {{and what are the}} potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting?</b> These questions are answered by comparatively analyzing motives for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> and factors that facilitate such behavior and apply them to the Dutch situation. Moreover, we employ various simulations based on the last three parliamentary elections in order to assess the potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> under different electoral system proposals. In general, these results indicate that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> will not have substantial effects on the distribution of seats in parliament. " (author's abstract...|$|R

[...] Lightfoot endorsed Gibson's campaign.|$|R
25|$|After {{becoming}} a separate county in 1914, the Bronx has supported only two Republican Presidential candidates. It voted heavily for the winning Republican Warren G. Harding in 1920, {{but much more}} narrowly on a <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> for his victorious Republican successor Calvin Coolidge in 1924 (Coolidge 79,562; John W. Davis, Dem., 72,834; Robert La Follette, 62,202 equally divided between the Progressive and Socialist lines).|$|E
25|$|IRV has {{the effect}} of {{avoiding}} split votes when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters. As a simple example, suppose there are two candidates with similar views, A and B, and a third with different views, C, with first-preference totals of 35% for candidate A, 25% for B and 40% for C. In a plurality voting election, candidate C may win with 40% of the votes, even though 60% of electors prefer both A and B over C. Alternatively, voters are pressured to choose the seemingly stronger candidate of either A or B, despite personal preference for the other, in order to help ensure the defeat of C. With IRV, the electors backing B as their first choice can rank A second, which means candidate A will win by 60% to 40% over C despite the <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> in first choices.|$|E
500|$|Stevens and the Devils {{once again}} had success in 2002–03, {{finishing}} {{first in the}} division. In addition, he was named as captain of the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time, and finished the season with the fewest penalty minutes over a full season in his career. The Devils played well in the playoffs, knocking off Boston, Tampa Bay, and Ottawa to face the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the Finals. Stevens and the Devils had a minor scare in Game 3 of the semifinals against Tampa Bay when a slapshot from Pavel Kubina hit {{the side of his}} head and forced him to leave the game. [...] Although there was uncertainty whether he would return for Game 4, Stevens in fact returned, and did not miss a game throughout the remainder of the playoffs. In Game 2 of the Finals, he set the record for most playoff games by a defenceman, breaking the record by his former coach, Larry Robinson. Stevens added to his list of playoff hits when he hit [...] Ducks forward Paul Kariya in Game Six. [...] However, Kariya came back shortly thereafter much to everyone's surprise and led the Ducks to a victory, forcing a seventh game. The Devils kept the Ducks scoreless in Game Seven, 3-0, to win their third Stanley Cup in nine years. [...] Stevens' appearance in Game Seven tied Patrick Roy's record for appearances in Game Sevens, with 13. Despite the play of Stevens, Martin Brodeur, Jamie Langenbrunner, and Jeff Friesen, the Conn Smythe Trophy went to Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère. [...] Some speculated that there were too many worthy Devils candidates for the trophy, resulting in a <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> among sportswriters.|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> in {{elections}} usually indicate either an instrumental electorate, or widespread disaffection {{from the major}} parties. Elections to the Russian lower house, the Duma, permit voters both party list options and single-member ballots; as a result, the 1993 and 1995 Duma elections recorded {{some of the highest}} levels of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> ever recorded. Using national survey data collected just after the 1995 Duma election, we test two major explanations for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting,</b> one based on the activities of voters, the other on the strategic behaviour of parties. The results show that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is caused by voters, and more specifically, by their weak attachments to parties. But party strategy also plays a modest role in promoting the phenomenon. In the absence of major reform of the Russian electoral system, <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is likely to remain at high levels...|$|R
50|$|Runoff {{voting is}} less {{vulnerable}} to <b>vote</b> <b>splitting,</b> yet <b>vote</b> <b>splitting</b> can occur in any round of runoff voting. Although instant runoff voting (IRV) uses ranked ballots, secondary preferences are considered in the same sequence as in multiple rounds of voting, so this method does not reduce the vote-splitting effect (compared to runoff voting).|$|R
2500|$|This {{marketing}} campaign was especially troublesome because Xigris {{has been linked}} to increased risk of serious bleeding in patients who used it as well as other concerns. [...] "Controversy surrounds both the drug study itself and the FDA approval," [...] wrote NEJM editor-at-large Richard P. Wenzel, MD in 2002. [...] The FDA approved the drug despite the advisory committee's <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> (10 to 10) due to concerns about the validity of the claimed efficacy and safety findings {{on the basis of a}} single trial.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the GGL’s {{continued}} authority, {{the city}} council was still roundly criticized for not being representative. [...] During the civil-rights furor of the 1960s, the Voting Rights Act signed into law in 1965 required that racial groups be given direct representation by political districts to assure {{the election of a}} member. Significantly, in a <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> on {{the city council}} on whether to accept a Justice Department order to establish an election plan that would provide more access to the Latino community with direct representation, or challenge the order in court, Cisneros voted to accept the order. San Antonio thus moved to single-member directly represented districts in 1977. [...] This led {{to the beginning of the}} end for the GGL and all efforts to rationalize all-city rule.|$|E
2500|$|Toynbee {{strongly}} supports state education, {{though she}} had two of her three children partly educated in the private sector, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. Although consistently critical of many of Tony Blair's New Labour reforms, she wrote in 2005 that his government [...] "remains the best government of my political lifetime". During the 2005 General Election, with dissatisfaction high among traditional Labour voters, Toynbee wrote several times {{about the dangers of}} protest voting, [...] "Giving Blair a bloody nose". She urged Guardian readers to vote with a clothes peg over their nose if they had to, to make sure Michael Howard would not win from a <b>split</b> <b>vote.</b> [...] "Voters think they can take a free hit at Blair while assuming Labour will win anyway. But Labour won't win if people won't vote for it".|$|E

2500|$|In a 1989 Houston Chronicle article Alan Bernstein {{described}} {{political support}} for Jim Westmoreland, an incumbent in an at-large position, in the Houston Heights as [...] "relatively weak." [...] In one precinct 49.4 percent of the voting residents voted for him. Westmoreland drew controversy after reports of a joke that was characterized as [...] "racist" [...] spread. Beverley Clark, the opponent and a Black teacher, defeated Westmoreland in that race. Bernstein said that the significant racial minority groups and the [...] "social tolerance" [...] trait {{may have contributed to}} backlash against Bernstein. In a 1989 Houston Chronicle article, Randy Cypret, the president of the Houston Heights Association, said that the <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> from the Houston Heights may reflect the ethnic division. Cypret added that opposition may have stemmed from Westmoreland's lack of political presence in the Houston Heights and a lack of advocacy for zoning-related issues. Cypret said that he opposed Westmoreland because of [...] "the fact that he considers being on the city council a part-time job. In the fourth largest city in the country, you should take your job more seriously." ...|$|E
60|$|Suppose, for example, {{at the end}} of the Parliamentary term, {{instead of}} the present method of electing a member of Parliament, we were, with every {{precaution}} of publicity and with the most ingeniously impartial machine that could be invented, to select a Jury by lot, a Jury sufficiently numerous to be reasonably representative of the general feeling of the community and sufficiently small to be able to talk easily together and to do the business without debating society methods--between twenty and thirty, I think, might be a good working number--and suppose we were, after a ceremony of swearing them and perhaps after prayer or after a grave and dignified address to them upon the duty that lay before them, to place each of these juries in comfortable quarters for a few days and isolated from the world, to choose its legislator. They could hear, in public, under a time limit, the addresses of such candidates as had presented themselves, and they could receive, under a limit of length and with proper precautions for publicity, such documents as the candidates chose to submit. They could also, in public, put any questions they chose to the candidates to elucidate their intentions or their antecedents, and they might at any stage decide unanimously to hear no more of and to dismiss this or that candidate who encumbered their deliberations. (This latter would be an effectual way of suppressing the candidature of cranks, and of half- witted and merely symbolical persons.) The Jury between and after their interrogations and audiences would withdraw from the public room to deliberate in privacy. Their deliberations which, of course, would be frank and conversational to a degree impossible under any other conditions, and free from the dodges of the expert vote manipulator altogether, would, for example, in the case of several candidates of the same or similar political colours, do away with the absurdity of the <b>split</b> <b>vote.</b> The jurymen of the same political hue could settle that affair among themselves before contributing to a final decision.|$|E
