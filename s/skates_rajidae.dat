5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth guitarfish and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) and <b>skates</b> (<b>Rajidae)</b> while others have them basal to all other rays except sawfishes (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the sawfishes rather than the skates.

50|$|The <b>skates</b> (<b>Rajidae,</b> Arhynchobatidae, Anacanthobatidae) are {{the only}} rays that are oviparous. Females lay egg cases onto the sea floor after {{fertilization}} occurs in utero. While in utero, a protected case forms around the embryo which is called the egg case. Studies have been done where egg cases were removed from gravid females to ensure proper identification in regard to skate species. Egg cases have distinguishable characteristic traits that are unique to that species, thus making it a great tool for identifying a skate. The two most distinguishable features on the egg case are the keel and the absence or presence of a fibrous covering. A keel runs laterally along {{both sides of the}} outer edge of the egg case; it is a flexible structure. Keels will also run the length of the horns on some skate species. Some egg cases have broad keels (greater than 10% of the maximum egg case width) while others have narrow keels (less than 10% of the maximum egg case width). Many egg cases are covered with a layer of fiber; some will have a fine layer while others have a thick layer.|$|E
40|$|<b>Skates</b> (<b>Rajidae)</b> are {{characterized}} by slow growth rate, low fecundity, and late maturity and are thus considered to be vulnerable to exploitation. Although understanding mating systems and behavior are important for long-term conser-vation and fisheries management, this aspect of life history is poorly understood in skates. Using 5 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, we analyzed egg clutches collected from 4 female Raja clavata captured in the wild to test for multiple paternity. Using the reconstructed multilocus genotypes method to explain the progeny genotype array, we showed that all 4 clutches were sired by a minimum of 4 – 6 fathers and, thus, female thornback rays are polyandrous. Whether polyandry in R. clavata is natural or a consequence of overexploitation remains uncertain. This is the first report of multiple paternity in a rajiform species and any oviparou...|$|E

40|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} thought to have a large number of {{independent}} origins of live-bearing. We examined evolutionary transitions to live-bearing and maternal input to embryos in this subclass by optimizing reproductive characters onto a composite phylogeny. Egg-laying (40 per cent of all species) is the likely ancestral reproductive mode for this clade, and there is evidence that live-bearing has evolved independently 9 – 10 times and maternal input 4 – 5 times. Most transitions (12 – 15) have been toward live-bearing with provisioning limited to yolk. These have occurred from egg-laying ancestors or live-bearing taxa that provide maternal input to embryos. Only 2 – 3 transitions have occurred in the other direction, i. e. away from yolk-only bearing. Egg-laying has evolved from live-bearing ancestors in <b>skates,</b> <b>Rajidae</b> (25 per cent of all species) and possibly in the zebra shark, Stegostoma fasciata.

40|$|Skates and {{rays are}} a common {{component}} of mixed demersal fisheries, and large quantities may be discarded. Given their biological vulnerability, understanding the fate of these elasmobranchs is of management concern. Estimates of discard survival are needed for modelling the possible benefits of management measures. In this study, {{the focus is on}} the Bristol Channel skate fishery, where on-board holding tanks were used to assess the short-term rates of survival of trawl-caught <b>skates</b> (<b>Rajidae).</b> From monitoring the survival rates of 162 fish kept in specially designed on-board holding tanks for periods of up to 72 h, the short-term rate of survival was 55 %. Visual inspection of "health" at time zero was a good indicator of survival, because 79 % of skates with a poor health score did not survive. Mortality rates for fish of moderate health and good "health" were 16 % and 5 %, respectively. This information allows one to predict the consequences of fishing practice on discard survival using a larger dataset on fish scored for health before tagging and release. The proportion in poor condition on capture is positively correlated with estimated codend weight, so technical modifications to fishing gear aimed at reducing unwanted by-catch would increase the survival of discarded skates. Combined with information on discarding rates in the study area, the results indicate that discard mortality removes almost as many fish from the skate stock as are landed commercially...|$|E

40|$|<b>Skates</b> (<b>Rajidae)</b> {{have been}} commercially {{exploited}} in Europe {{for hundreds of}} years with some species’ abundances declining dramatically during the twentieth century. In 2009 it became “prohibited for EU vessels to target, retain, tranship or land” certain species in some ICES areas, including the critically endangered common skate and the endangered white skate. To examine compliance with skate bans the official UK landings data for 2011 – 2014 were analysed. Surprisingly, it was found that after the ban prohibited species were still reported landed in UK ports, including 9. 6 t of common skate during 2011 – 2014. The majority of reported landings of common and white skate were from northern UK waters and landed into northern UK ports. Although past landings could not be validated as being actual prohibited species, the landings’ patterns found reflect known abundance distributions that suggest actual landings were made, rather than sporadic occurrence across ports that would be evident if landings were solely due to systematic misidentification or data entry errors. Nevertheless, misreporting and data entry errors could not be discounted as factors contributing to the recorded landings of prohibited species. These findings raise questions about the efficacy of current systems to police skate landings to ensure prohibited species remain protected. By identifying UK ports with the highest apparent landings of prohibited species and those still landing species grouped as'skates and rays’, these results may aid authorities in allocating limited resources more effectively to reduce landings, misreporting and data errors of prohibited species, and increase species-specific landing compliance...|$|E
40|$|Competition {{for food}} {{could be a}} major force driving changes in the {{community}} structure of <b>skates</b> (<b>Rajidae)</b> subjected to fishing exploitation. Under this hypothesis, small skates are released from competition with larger skates after fishing has depleted the larger species. Here, we compare the abundance patterns of two sympatric skates with similar niches but different life histories, Bathyraja albomaculata (larger and slow-reproducing) and Bathyraja macloviana (smaller and faster-reproducing), before (1971, 1978) and after (1998 - 2004) a 108 % increase in industrial bottom trawling on the southeastern South American shelf {{in order to test}} the prediction that B. macloviana should competitively exclude B. albomaculata after the increase in fishing mortality. In 1971 and 1978, there was no relationship between the abundance of both species, indicating that they coexisted over large scales. In 1998 - 2004, the relationship between the abundances of these skates was bell-shaped, indicating that both species increased in abundance at low densities until peaking, after which B. albomaculata decreased when B. macloviana became more abundant, consistent with resource competition. We tested whether food may be a potential limiting resource by comparing the diet of both species. The two species consumed mostly polychaetes, differing only in the consumption of polychaetes from the family Nephthyidae, which was much higher for B. macloviana. Bathyraja macloviana could replace B. albomaculata at high densities when food resources may become scarce. These results support the hypothesis that competition release is an important factor explaining the changes in skate communities in overexploited areas...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of sensitive fish {{species such as}} <b>skates</b> (<b>Rajidae)</b> is essential for implementation of conservation measures. With insufficient survey data available for these species in Portuguese Continental waters, this study shows that fishery-dependent data associated with fishers' knowledge {{can be used to}} identify potential Essential Fish Habitats (EFH) for seven skate species. Sites with similar geomorphology were associated with the occurrence of juveniles and/or adults of the same group of species. For example, sites deeper than 100 m with soft sediment include predominantly adults of Raja clavata, and are the habitat for egg deposition of this species. Raja undulata and R. microocellata are the more coastal species, preferring sand or gravel habitats, while coastal areas with rocks and sand seabed are potential nursery areas for R. brachyura, R. montagui and R. clavata. The main output of this study is the identification of preferential fishing sites enclosing potential EFH for some species, associated with egg-laying and nursery grounds. The location of these areas will be considered for future seasonal closures, and studies will be conducted to evaluate the biological and socio-economic impacts of such measures. As in the past, fishermen will collaborate in the process of evaluating those impacts, since they have practical and applied knowledge that is extremely valuable for evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} such closures. In conclusion, this study is a first contribution to the understanding and identification of EFH for skate species, associated with nursery and egg deposition sites, with direct application to management...|$|E

Pelvic fin {{movements of}} juvenile individuals of P. motoro were recorded in ventral view by a high-speed camera at 250 - 500 fields/s- 1. Potamotrygon motoro presented synchronous, alternating and unilateral {{movements of the}} pelvic fins, similar to those reported in skates. Synchronous movements were employed during straightforward motion for pushing the body off the substrate as well as for strike feeding, whereas unilateral movements were used to maneuver the body to the right or left during both locomotion and prey capture. Alternating movements of the pelvic fins are similar to bipedal movements in terrestrial and semi-aquatic tetrapods. The pelvic fins showed coordinated movements during feeding even when stationary, indicating that they have an important function in maintaining body posture (station holding) during prey capture and manipulation. The use of pelvic fins during prey stalking may be advantageous because it results in less substrate disturbance when compared to movements generated by pectoral fin undulation. The range of pelvic fin movements indicates more complex control and coordination of the pelvic radial muscles...|$|E

The continental shelf and upper slope (0 – 500 m) of the GOA support a rich demersal fish fauna dominated by arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), and Pacific Ocean perch (Sebastes alutus). Average catch {{per unit of}} effort (CPUE) of all groundfish species combined increased with depth and had a significant peak near the shelf break at 150 – 200 m. Species richness and diversity had significant peaks at 200 – 300 m. The western GOA was characterized by higher CPUEs and lower species richness and diversity than the eastern GOA. Highest CPUEs were observed in Shelikof Strait, along the shelf break and upper slope south of Kodiak Island, and on the banks and in the gullies northeast of Kodiak Island. Significant differences in total CPUE among surveys suggest a 40 % increase in total groundfish biomass between 1984 and 1996. A multivariate analysis of the CPUE of 72 groundfish taxa revealed strong gradients in species composition with depth and from east to west, and a weak but significant trend in species composition over time.

40|$|Predator {{avoidance}} {{is fundamental}} for survival {{and it can}} be particularly challenging for prey animals if physical movement away from a predatory threat is restricted. Many sharks and rays begin life within an egg capsule that is attached to the sea bed. The vulnerability of this sedentary life stage is exacerbated in <b>skates</b> (<b>Rajidae)</b> as the compulsory ventilatory activity of embryos makes them conspicuous to potential predators. Embryos can reduce this risk by mediating ventilatory activity if they detect the presence of a predator using an acute electrosense. To determine how early in embryonic life predator elicited behavioral responses can occur, the reactions of three different age groups (1 / 3 developed, 2 / 3 developed, and near hatching) of embryonic thornback rays Raja clavata were tested using predator-type electric field stimuli. Egg capsules were exposed to continuous or intermittent stimuli in order to assess varying predator-type encounter scenarios on the ventilatory behavior of different developmental stages. All embryos reacted with a “freeze response” following initial electric field (E-field) exposure, ceasing ventilatory behavior in response to predator presence, demonstrating electroreceptive functionality {{for the first time at}} the earliest possible stage in ontogeny. This ability coincided with the onset of egg ventilatory behavior and may represent an effective means to enhance survival. A continuous application of stimuli over time revealed that embryos can adapt their behavior and resume normal activity, whereas when presented intermittently, the E-field resulted in a significant reduction in overall ventilatory activity across all ages. Recovery from stimuli was significantly quicker in older embryos, potentially indicative of the trade-off between avoiding predation and adequate respiration. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The {{survival}} of fish discarded after being caught {{can be improved}} by simple gear-based technical measures aimed at reducing discards. We look at the effects of three different codends on the initial health and short-term {{survival of}} trawl-caught <b>skate</b> (<b>Rajidae),</b> using a control codend (80 mm diamond mesh used as standard in the fishery) and two experimental codends (100 mm diamond mesh and 100 mm diamond mesh turned on the square). Both experimental nets reduced discarded numbers of fish by ~ 70 %, with no commercial loss. This reduction in discards had an effect in reducing the total weight of the experimental codends {{by as much as}} 80 %. We also placed 278 skate in onboard holding tanks for 48 h and evaluated the survival rates of fish caught in the different codends. Visual inspection of "health" at time zero was a good indicator of survival, because 86 % of skate with a good health score survived (p < 0. 01). From a further 1539 skate assessed for health, we show that fish caught in the control codend have the lowest proportional good health score (25 %), followed by the 100 mm diamond mesh codend (34 %) and the 100 mm square mesh codend (47 %). The health of the fish caught is related to codend weight (p = 0. 01). We conclude that technical measures aimed at reducing discards have an additional benefit; they indirectly increase discard survival, and the benefits of mitigating discards through by-catch reduction devices may be a more powerful tool in fisheries management than previously thought...|$|R
