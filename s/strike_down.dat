5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he meant that the common law courts {{have the power to}} completely <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by the FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at {{his home}} that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons {{lightning}} to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> nearby cattle. The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.|$|E
25|$|Frankfurter continued, {{arguing that}} if the Court is {{frequently}} <b>striking</b> <b>down</b> laws it is circumventing the democratic process since the Court cannot work to reach a compromise. It either <b>strikes</b> <b>down</b> a law or lets it stand; it cannot simply modify or qualify a law as a legislature can.|$|R

5|$|Judicial: India has {{a unitary}} three-tier {{independent}} judiciary that comprises the Supreme Court, {{headed by the}} Chief Justice of India, 24 High Courts, {{and a large number}} of trial courts. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre; it has appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts. It has the power both to declare the law and to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> union or state laws which contravene the constitution, as well as to invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Justice Harlan {{supported}} {{many of the}} Warren Court's landmark decisions {{relating to}} {{the separation of church}} and state. For instance, he voted in favor of the Court's ruling that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office in Torcaso v. Watkins. He joined in Engel v. Vitale, which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools. In , similarly, he voted to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.|$|E

5|$|The broad {{heading of}} {{judicial}} review of illegality may {{be divided into two}} sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion wrongly even though it was empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly, it may <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> the decision on the basis of illegality.|$|E
5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{judiciary}} {{plays an}} important role in interpreting laws and has the power to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since 2000 by the Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (the first female Chief Justice). Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with nongovernmental legal bodies. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of the local {{processing}} ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials. Examples of Supreme Court decisions in this vein are set out in its Carbone decision. They include Minnesota v.

Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82 (1984) (<b>striking</b> <b>down</b> an Alaska regulation that required all Alaska timber to be processed within the State prior to export). The Court has defined [...] "protectionist" [...] state legislation as [...] "regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors".

5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> a law as unconstitutional. The amendment, which ultimately failed, was offered {{in the aftermath of}} a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States declaring an occupying claimant law to be unconstitutional; Rowan personally disagreed with the Court's decision. Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts would be subject to state laws when carrying out the decisions of the federal courts. After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} flag code of India did {{not allow}} private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> the restriction {{on the use of}} the flag by private citizens, arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.|$|E
5|$|After winning {{re-election}} by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama {{was sworn}} in {{for a second term}} in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating. He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.|$|E

In order to make this statistic more widely known, Falle founded Sex Trade 101. She began offering training for police and partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit. Falle {{was one of the main}} proponents of Member of Parliament (MP) Joy Smith's private member's bill, Bill C-268, which was passed in June 2010 as An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years), and she helped the Canadian government formulate their appeal of the decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bedford v. Canada to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> various prostitution laws. Falle advocates adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which would decriminalize the selling of sex and criminalize the purchasing of sex.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of {{an offense that}} helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E
5|$|Although Democratic-Republicans held {{a narrow}} {{majority}} in the Senate, the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause. Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic-Republicans and newly elected president, Thomas Jefferson. His proposed repeal of the Federalist-supported Judicial Act of 1801, which had {{increased the number of}} federal courts and judges, was particularly controversial. On January 4, 1802, he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts and judges were unnecessary. Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional; once established, courts were inviolate, he maintained. On January 20, Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments. South Carolina's John E. Colhoun, a Democratic-Republican, voted with the Federalists, and the result was a 15–15 tie. Empowered to break the tie, Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, voted with the Federalists. The five-man committee consisted of three Federalists, enough to prevent the bill's return to the floor, but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley, who had traveled home because of a family illness, returned to the chamber, the Democratic-Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition. In one last attempt to derail the legislation in debate, Federalists argued that the judiciary would <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> the repeal as unconstitutional; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power to invalidate an act of Congress. On February 3, the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16–15, with the House concurring a month later.|$|E

5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to <b>strike</b> <b>down</b> a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E

Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them.
