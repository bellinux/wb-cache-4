2500|$|In March 1997, Diana visited South Africa, {{where she}} met with President Nelson Mandela. On 2 November 2002, Mandela {{announced}} that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund would be teaming up with the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to help victims of AIDS. They had planned {{the combination of the}} two charities a few months before her death. [...] "When <b>she</b> <b>stroked</b> the limbs of someone with leprosy or sat on the bed of a man with HIV/AIDS and held his hand, she transformed public attitudes and improved the life chances of such people," [...] Mandela said about the late Princess. Diana had used her celebrity status to [...] "fight stigma attached to people living with HIV/AIDS", Mandela said. In October 2017, the Attitude magazine honoured Diana with its Legacy Award for her HIV/AIDS work. Prince Harry accepted the award on behalf of his mother.|$|E

[...] the Duchess laughed; [...] "but one can't know the dear soul, of course, without knowing that she has set up, for the convenience of her friends, a little office for consultations. She listens to the case, <b>she</b> <b>strokes</b> her chin and prescribes--" ...|$|R

50|$|<b>She</b> {{suffered}} a <b>stroke</b> in January 1950, {{which led to}} her relocating to 1 Herbert Park, Ballsbridge. She died on 30 January 1954, aged 63, after suffering another <b>stroke.</b> <b>She</b> was buried in St Maelruen's graveyard in Tallaght.|$|R

40|$|Short single axioms for ortholattices, orthomodular lattices, and modular ortholattices are presented, all {{in terms}} of the <b>She</b> er <b>stroke.</b> The ortholattice axiom is the {{shortest}} possible. Other equational bases {{in terms of}} the <b>She</b> er <b>stroke</b> and in terms of join, meet, and complement are presented. Proofs are omitted but are available in an associated technical report. Computers were used extensively to nd candidates, reject candidates, and search for proofs that candidates are single axioms. The notion of computer proof is addressed. ...|$|R

25|$|The nude {{woman is}} in fact not perched side-saddle on the horse. As others have pointed out (Antliff and Leighten), and as emerges upon close examination, the nude woman is seated on {{what appears to be}} a {{rectangular}} block or cube, perhaps a model's pedestal (visible to the left). The horse occupies the upper right-hand quadrant as if observed from above. Its head is turned toward the monumental nude while <b>she</b> <b>strokes</b> the horses right ear with her left hand. She cups her hand underneath the horse's mouth, as if feeding the horse a piece of fruit.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stroked</b> his hand, her honest, {{intelligent}} eyes bent {{upon him}} in a look of pity--and to indulge this pity for him, she forgot how much herself she needed pity.|$|E

60|$|Slowly <b>she</b> <b>stroked</b> his hair. Shocked out of himself, he cried, and {{the tears}} hurt in every fibre of his body. Suddenly he stopped, but he dared not lift his face out of the bedclothes.|$|E
60|$|Afterward {{she went}} {{around and around}} that horse; she patted his smooth sides; she looked, with admiration, at his strong, well-formed legs; <b>she</b> <b>stroked</b> his head; she {{smoothed}} his mane; she was brimful of joy.|$|E
60|$|Lightly {{and quickly}} <b>she</b> <b>stroked</b> {{his face to}} show him that she bore no ill-feeling, the gesture was {{scarcely}} more than suggested; then she {{jumped out of the}} cab and let herself into her house.|$|E

60|$|Her {{voice was}} natural again, natural and companionable and brave. She laughed as <b>she</b> <b>stroked</b> her wet {{shoulder}} {{and held his}} hand, sitting quietly and bidding him listen to the soft forlorn sound of the rain on the thatch.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stroked</b> and caressed his hair, tremblingly {{clasped his}} head against her breast, as if she would never release him; then she bent to kiss his forehead. He took her in his arms, and they were still for awhile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is it? What is the matter? Tell me thy sorrow that I may bear it with thee, or, it may be, help thee!' Then {{the king}} told her {{everything}} that had befallen him, and <b>she</b> <b>stroked</b> his hair the while.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why?' <b>she</b> said, <b>stroking</b> {{his hand}} from wrist to {{fingertips}} with one soft finger. 'You mustn't be miserable. You and me have never done such a thing before; have we? Was it that wretched old Flu?' ...|$|R
50|$|The physicality of the queen’s LHF follows. <b>She</b> <b>strokes</b> {{a mature}} larva with her antennae, then holds the {{posterior}} end with all six legs, {{lying on her}} side and placing her lower mouthparts on the body. She turns the body around, feeling with her mandibles until she finds the “larval hemolymph tap” in the fourth abdominal segment. The lack of lapping movements of the queen’s mouthparts {{and the lack of}} larval muscles along the duct organ suggest that the hemolymph is ingested via the queen’s effort. Hemolymph flow would cease by itself when the queen released the larva or by the hemolymph congealing at the opening.|$|R
50|$|She was euthanized after {{suffering}} a series of <b>strokes.</b> <b>She</b> was 14 years old.|$|R
