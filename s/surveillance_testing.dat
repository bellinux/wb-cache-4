While preventing a natural disaster is impossible, risk management measures such as avoiding disaster-prone situations and good planning can help.

For these purposes the U.S. Army's Special Operations Command (SOC) was assigned to assist the CIA in the development, testing, and maintenance procedures for the biological agents and delivery systems (1952). Both the CIA and SOC also modified guns that fired special darts coated with biological agents and various poisonous pills. The darts would serve to incapacitate guard dogs, infiltrate the area that the dogs were guarding, and then awaken the dogs upon exiting the facility. In addition, the SOC was also designated to research the potentials for using biological agents against other animals and crops.|$|E

The test is used to estimate IgG antibody levels in oral fluid directed against Bordetella pertussis pertussis toxin (PT). Since 2002 the HPA has been providing a realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) service for infants admitted to hospital (now available for infants aged under 1 year) with suspected pertussis; and sero-diagnosis by detection of raised serum IgG antibodies to pertussis toxin (PT) for patients who have been coughing for two weeks or more [1]. Clinicians who are aware of these methods may still be reluctant to take blood in this patient group, so they may content themselves with notifying the infection but not confirming it by laboratory testing.

Acute-care facilities are {{to establish a}} protocol, {{in conjunction with the}} guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, to detect nonsusceptibility and carbapenemase production in Enterobacteriaceae, in particular Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, and immediately alert epidemiology and infection-control staff members if identified. All acute-care facilities are to review microbiology records for the preceding 6-12 months to ensure that there have not been previously unrecognized CRE cases. If they do identify previously unrecognized cases, a point prevalence survey (a single round of active surveillance cultures) in units with patients at high risk (e.g., intensive-care units, units where previous cases have been identified, and units where many patients are exposed to broad-spectrum antimicrobials) is needed to identify any additional patients colonized with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli.

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} potential {{associations between}} fetal <b>surveillance</b> <b>tests</b> and acidosis at birth in pregnancies with abnormal but positive end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery. Methods: A prospective case-control study [group 1 : pH = 7. 2] including 46 fetuses with abnormal but positive end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery was conducted between February 2007 and March 2009. Outcome variables {{were evaluated by}} univariate analysis and compared between the two groups. Clinically relevant and statistically significant variables were analyzed by logistic regression. Results: Abnormal nonstress test, presence of deceleration, and absent fetal breathing movements were statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis revealed that fetal heart rate (FHR) deceleration in the nonstress test is the only predictor of fetal acidosis at birth (p = 0. 024; OR = 8. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 52). Conclusions: In fetuses with positive end-diastolic flow velocity, acute variables of the antenatal <b>surveillance</b> <b>tests</b> are correlated with acidosis at birth and FHR deceleration in the nonstress test is the only predictor of fetal acidosis...|$|R

40|$|The 2 D/ 1 D {{synthesis}} methodology {{has been}} used to calculate the fast neutron (E[*]>[*] 1. 0 [*]MeV) exposure to the beltline region of the reactor pressure vessel. This method uses the DORT 3. 1 discrete ordinates code and the BUGLE- 96 cross-section library based on ENDF/B-VI. RAPTOR-M 3 G (RApid Parallel Transport Of Radiation-Multiple 3 D Geometries) which performs full 3 D calculations was developed and is based on domain decomposition algorithms, where the spatial and angular domains are allocated and processed on multi-processor computer architecture. As compared to traditional single-processor applications, this approach reduces the computational load as well as the memory requirement per processor. Both methods are applied to <b>surveillance</b> <b>test</b> results for the Korea Standard Nuclear Plant (KSNP) -OPR (Optimized Power Reactor) 1000 [*]MW. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the results of the KSNP surveillance program between 2 D/ 1 D synthesis and RAPTOR-M 3 G. Each operating KSNP has a reactor vessel surveillance program consisting of six surveillance capsules located between the core and the reactor vessel in the downcomer region near the reactor vessel wall. In addition to the In-Vessel surveillance program, an Ex-Vessel Neutron Dosimetry (EVND) program has been implemented. In order to estimate <b>surveillance</b> <b>test</b> results, cycle-specific forward transport calculations were performed by 2 D/ 1 D synthesis and by RAPTOR-M 3 G. The ratio between measured and calculated (M/C) reaction rates will be discussed.
