50|$|Interior {{stairs in}} the duplex suites {{make use of}} {{materials}} originally engineered for exterior applications. The custom designed stairs are constructed of COR-TEN B steel (ASTM A 588), giving them a durable rustic appearance. The rustic theme is also mirrored in the wood grain patterns imprinted in the concrete walls. All concrete structures are constructed using concrete forms, usually made of steel. The resulting finish of steel <b>shuttered</b> <b>concrete</b> can be extremely precise, an example of which is Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. The cost is high, however, because each steel form needs to be custom made, and then positioned accurately. Moravola's walls used wooden forms, which, {{in addition to the}} cost savings, allowed easy fabrication within the existing historical 10th-century structure.|$|E

50|$|The airy South Mall leading {{north is}} {{sheltered}} by a translucent roof and lined {{with a mix}} of shops. Leading off is the library and offices on three floors which was converted from a former departmental store. In the library, memorial boards to local people, from the old Town Hall can be viewed. The Market Square is a covered area (originally open to the elements) lit by clerestory windows. The market stalls today are permanent fixtures. The big, bustling no-frills market is popular with shoppers with a good range of goods, particularly - greengrocery. The North Mall is treated differently, in the harder spirit of the late 1960s: a concrete coffered roof alternates with open light-wells, and ends in an open square, with two levels of shops and two stories of flats above; brutalistic, dark brick and <b>shuttered</b> <b>concrete.</b> The backdrop rising from the deck above North Mall is composed of huge slabs of system-built flats which the borough built so keenly at the time.|$|E
30|$|Among {{lightweight}} concretes, only concrete using wood-made cement {{is currently}} used for its acoustical qualities. It absorbs more than 75 % {{of the incident}} sonic wave energy at intermediate frequencies. Some materials such as bricks and <b>shuttered</b> <b>concrete</b> are not very permeable and do not let sound waves penetrate. Aerated concrete absorbs no more than 35 % of the sound waves that intercept it. For scoria concretes with dosages equal to 350  kg/m 3, the absorption coefficients range from 0.32 to 0.44. These values are high compared {{to those of other}} building materials such as bricks (from 0.03 to 0.05), <b>shuttered</b> <b>concrete</b> (from 0.01 to 0.02), and aerated concrete (from 0.23 to 0.32).|$|E

They were specifically designed to protect the nearby Maidstone to London railway line. The buildings are examples of the 'Type 24 ' Pill Box. The six sided structures have one doorway, facing south-west, flanked by two windows. The remaining walls all have a central window providing all round visibility.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) beams {{which are}} insufficient {{in terms of}} shear and flexural capacities are strengthened by various methods. Steel and fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) plate bonding methods are very widely used in strengthening of beams. Strengthening methods such as bonding steel and FRP plates have deficiencies as corrosion, fire and buckling. In this work, it is aimed strengthening of damaged RC beams using prefabricated RC rectangular and U cross-sectional plates. The rectangular cross-sectional plates were bonded to the bottom sides of the beams by rods and epoxy. The plates having U cross-section were bonded to the three sides of the beams. The strengthened beams were incrementally loaded up to maximum load capacities. The load carrying capacity of the beams increased 41 % with the strengthening rectangular cross-sectional plates, however when the U crosssectional plates were used, the capacity increased up to 76 %. The experimental results were compared with the theoretical values. In addition, post-elastic strength enhancement and displacement ductility of beams were investigated. The advantages of this method do not require <b>shuttering,</b> <b>concrete</b> and steel workmanships in situ. Also, the application of this method is very easy and economic. For these reasons, this method should be preferred against other methods...|$|R

40|$|Outwith is a {{collaboration}} between Sally Underwood and Roxy Walsh. Their ongoing research explores co-habitation, shelter, dwelling and time, exploring how gallery space is inhabited and lived by the bodies within it. Dwellings and small architectures are central to these explorations: artworks sited within other artworks. UnderwoodWalsh were invited by Jessica Kenney to make a site specific installation for Art Exchange, the gallery of the University of Essex, for January/February 2015. The campus is a spectacular collection of largely brutalist buildings set in Wivenhoe park, rolling parkland made famous by John Constable’s 1816 painting. The predominant materials on campus are concrete and engineering brick. Though faced with 1980 ’s (bijou postmodern) brick patterns, the building that houses Art Exchange has a heart of concrete like the others. At Art Exchange, ‘shelter’ or location was provided a putative tree, echoing both the parkland of the campus and the <b>shuttered</b> <b>concrete</b> structure at {{the centre of the}} gallery building. Its exposed roots were bracketed by small walls of engineering brick and kindling in response to the spectacular use of engineering brick in the North Towers. The thin blue light of winter was echoed in watercolour above, and painted panels punctuated the space - sometimes pictorially but more often spatially, alongside large passages of painting directly onto the walls. Parkland outside of the gallery was made visible again by the uncovering of a picture window that had been walled in for a number of years. An accompanying text was commissioned from George Vase...|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho tem por objetivo estudar o comportamento de lajes de concreto com fôrma permanente de bambu - LCFP - simplesmente apoiadas e submetidas à flexão. Estas lajes têm um vão de 350 cm, alturas entre 11 cm a 13 cm e larguras de 60 cm a 71 cm que dependem do diâmetro dos bambus utilizados. Foram consideradas duas espécies de bambu disponíveis, Dendrocalamus giganteus e Guadua angustifolhia. Nas - LCFP - os conectores tem uma função importante. Neste estudo utilizaram-se dois tipos de conectores os quais consideram meio e diafragma inteiro do colmo de bambu. Com o objetivo de impermeabilizar o bambu e aumentar aderência entre os materiais foi utilizado o produto SIKADUR- 32 GEL. Para estabelecer a eficiência dos conectores e do tratamento, realizaram-se ensaios PUSH-OUT. Com os resultados, estes foram caracterizados como flexíveis. Os ensaios de flexão foram levados a cabo até as cargas de colapso. Pela instrumentação das três lajes foram registrados e analisados os diagramas dos principais parâmetros. Os resultados foram comparados com os obtidos teoricamente. Nas análises foram estudadas as cargas criticas e as de serviço com base em critérios e metodologias recomendadas. Finalmente algumas variáveis são determinadas para estudos futuros. The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the behavior of bamboo permanent <b>shutter</b> <b>concrete</b> slab BPSCS subjected to four points bending test. The boundary conditions of the slabs are simply supported and have 350 cm free spans, with the height between 11 cm to 13 cm and the widths of 60 cm to 71 cm respectively depending on the diameter of bamboo used. Two most commonly available bamboo species Dendrocalamus giganteus and Guadua angustifolhia are considered. In the BPSCS the connectors have an important function. In this study two types of connectors considering half and the entire diaphragm of the whole bamboo culm was used. To improve bonding between bamboo and concrete in addition to create an impermeable surface of the bamboo SIKADUR- 32 GEL was applied. To establish {{the efficiency of the}} connectors and the considered treatment PUSH-OUT tests were carried out. The test results proved that both types of the connectors are flexible. The tests were carried out up to the failure loads. Through the instrumentation of the three tested slabs the load deflections, stress- strain curves of the slabs at different points were registered and analyzed. The results in turn were compared with those obtained theoretically. In the analyses both resistance and serviceability criteria were studied. Based on the findings preliminary design methods are recommended. Finally the variables to be studied in future are given...|$|R
