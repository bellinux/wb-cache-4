50|$|Melophagus ovinus, or the <b>sheep</b> <b>ked,</b> is a brown, hairy fly {{that resembles}} a tick. This {{wingless}} fly is about 4 to 6 mm long and has a small head; it is a fly from the family Hippoboscidae. They are blood-feeding parasites of sheep. The <b>sheep</b> <b>ked</b> feeds on the blood of its host by inserting its sharp mouthparts into capillaries beneath the skin. The legs of the <b>sheep</b> <b>ked</b> are very strong and tipped with claws. Sheep keds live their whole lives in the wool of sheep. They are most commonly found on the neck, shoulders, and underbelly of the host animal. Although they are {{often referred to as}} the “sheep tick”, sheep keds spend their entire lifecycle on their hosts, which is distinguishable from the characteristics of a true tick. Additionally, sheep keds have six legs, whereas true ticks have eight legs.|$|E
50|$|Despite this key, however, Linnaeus grouped insects {{together}} that shared other affinities. His genus Coccus, containing the scale insects, he placed among the 4-winged Hemiptera, along with aphids and other plant-attacking insects, even though females have no wings, and males have two wings. Similarly, the <b>sheep</b> <b>ked</b> Hippobosca ovina (now Melophagus ovinus) was correctly placed among the Diptera, despite being wingless.|$|E
50|$|Adult keds can {{be killed}} using {{treatment}} dips and sprays most commonly containing ivermectin or pyrethrin. However, the pupal stage is resistant to treatment, so treatment must be repeated at 24- to 28-day intervals. Using insecticides with a 3- to 4-week residual activity would also eliminate emerging adult keds. Additionally, because both adult keds and pupae stages {{live in the}} wool of the sheep, shearing can dramatically reduce the ked population. It would be most beneficial to shear before insecticide treatment. Most modern treatments used to control sheep lice will also control <b>sheep</b> <b>ked</b> infestations.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>sheep</b> <b>ked,</b> Melophagus ovinus, is a wingless, reddish-brown fly that parasitizes sheep. The Neotropical deer ked, Lipoptena mazamae, is {{a common}} {{ectoparasite}} of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the southeastern United States. Both winged and wingless forms may be seen. A common winged species is Hippobosca equina, called [...] "the louse fly" [...] among riders. Species in other genera are found on birds, for example, Ornithomya bequaerti has been collected from birds in Alaska. Two species of Hippoboscidae - Ornithoica (Ornithoica) podargi and Ornithomya fuscipennis are also common parasites of the tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) of Australia.|$|E
5000|$|In lambs, the <b>sheep</b> <b>ked</b> {{may cause}} anemia and reduce weight gain. It feeds {{on the blood}} of its host, so causes {{irritation}} to the sheep, leading it to rub, producing both loss and damage of the wool. It also makes firm, hard nodules that develops on the skin called a cockle, this will reduce {{the value of the}} hide. The ked feces also stains the sheep's wool reducing its value. [...] They also transmit Trypanosoma melophagium nonpathogenic protozoan parasite of sheep. A sheep’s immune response to keds reduces capillary flow to the skin. Although this response is trying to combat the ked infestation, it also results in a less abundant and lower quality fleece.|$|E

Shadduck wrote five books, Idaho <b>Sheep</b> <b>King,</b> Doctors with Buggies, Snowshoes and Planes, At the Edge of the Ice, Rodeo Idaho, and The House that Victor Built. An amateur artist, she promoted the arts throughout her life. Shadduck was celebrated throughout Idaho for her reputation of never forgetting a name or a person’s story. One of her fondest joys was helping young people begin their college or professional careers and it is this person-to-person friendship that is most often credited as the source of her tremendous political power behind a great deal of Idaho’s history. She lived 92 years, and because she never married she was active full-time to speaking engagements and snowplowed her own road up to within months of her death. A publisher’s proof of her last book, The House that Victor Built was brought to her death bed.|$|R

5000|$|Apart from Reo Larauco (Reus of Larouco) the epithets {{share an}} -aik- element {{interpreted}} as an adjectival marker familiar from Lusitanian inscriptions in the dedications to Reo Paramaeco (Reus of Paramo) Amoaego Arcunii, Anabaraeco, and Alabaraico Sulensi. The first element Reo/Reus {{is very similar to}} the name Reue appearing on the Lusitanian Cabeço das Fráguas inscription, part of which reads INDI TAVROM IFADEM REVE T..., usually interpreted as [...] "and (or thereafter) a fertile(?) bull for Reue" [...] with the epithet lost. Reue therefore also seems to be a dative in the Lusitanian form of the name. Reue appears again on the Ribeira da Venda inscription, including an epithet, as REVE AHARACVI - this time the deity is receiving a sacrifice of ten <b>sheep.</b> <b>K</b> T Witczak derives the name from earlier *diewo, suggesting that the Lusitanian language changed the Proto-Indo European d to r, making Reo a sky deity similar to (and having a name cognate with) the Greek Zeus and Roman Jupiter, something which may be supported by dedications to him near mountains which also allude to Roman Jupiter; however other authorities such as Blázquez and Villar suggest he may have been a deity linked to rivers and that the name derives from a root meaning a flow or current.|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study aimed at determining the prevalence and identifying the major species of external parasites in small ruminants {{was carried out}} in seven localities (peasant associations) of Wolmera district from October 2008 to April 2009. External parasites were collected manually by hand or using forceps (for ticks). Specimens were preserved in 70 % ethanol and subsequently examined in the laboratory for identification. Out of 322 sheep and 130 goats examined, 99. 38 % of sheep and 96. 92 % goats were infested with one or more external parasites. Seven genera of external parasites were identified in both sheep and goats which belong to lice, ticks, fleas and <b>sheep</b> <b>ked.</b> Damalinia ovis (83. 23 %) was the most dominant of all external parasites identified in sheep while Amblyomma variegatum (66. 15 %) was the uppermost of other external parasites in goats. Moreover, external parasites like Damalinia caprae, Linognathus ovillus, Linognathus stenopsis, Boophilus decoloratus, Rhipicephallus evertsi, Melophagus ovinus and Ctenocephalides species were detected at different degrees of magnitude. This finding has unveiled that external parasites are major problems in small ruminants in the study area. Lacks of awareness about the significance of the problems among owners and inaccessibility for control schemes have contributed to the widespread nature of external parasites in the area. In view of the significance of skin and hide production as a main source of foreign currency to the country and the ever increasing demands of livestock market, the high prevalence of external parasites prevailing in small ruminants in the area requires serious attention at the district level to minimize the effect of the problem...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the presence of Acinetobacter and Rickettsia species DNA in lice and Melophagus ovinus (<b>sheep</b> <b>ked)</b> of animals from Oromia Regional State in Ethiopia. From September through November 2011, a total of 207 cattle, 85 sheep, 47 dogs and 16 cats were examined for ectoparasites. Results of morphological identification revealed several species of ectoparasites: Linognathus vituli (L. vituli), Bovicola bovis (B. bovis) and Solenopotes capillatus (S. capillatus) on cattle; B. ovis and Melophagus ovinus (M. ovinus) on sheep; and Heterodoxus spiniger (H. spiniger) on dogs. There was a significantly (p# 0. 0001) higher prevalence of L. vituli observed in cattle than both S. capillatus and B. bovis. Molecular identification of lice using an 18 S rRNA gene analysis confirms the identified lice species by morphological methods. We detected different Acinetobacter species among lice (11. 1 %) and keds (86. 4 %) including A. soli in L. vituli of cattle, A. lowffii in M. ovinus of sheep, A. pittii in H. spiniger of dogs, 1 new Acinetobacter spp. in M. ovinus and 2 new Acinetobacter spp. in H. spiniger of dogs using partial rpoB gene sequence analysis. There was a significantly higher prevalence of Acinetobacter spp. in keds than in lice (p# 0. 00001). Higher percentage of Acinetobacter spp. DNA was detected in H. spiniger than in both B. ovis and L. vituli (p# 0. 00001). Carbapenemase resistance encoding genes for blaOXA- 23, blaOXA- 24, blaOXA- 58, blaNDM- 1 and blaOXA- 51 were not found in any lice and keds. These findings suggest that synanthropic animals and their ectoparasites might increase the risk of human exposure to zoonotic pathogens and could be a source for Acinetobacte...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{kinetic study}} of K:Cl cotransport in hyposmotically swollen low <b>K</b> <b>sheep</b> {{red blood cells}} was carried out to characterize {{the nature of the}} outwardly poised carrier. The kinetic parameters were determined from the rate of K efflux and influx under zero-K-trans conditions in red cells with cellular K altered by the nystatin method and with different extracellular K or Rb concentrations. Although apparent affinities for efflux and influx were quite similar, the maximal velocity for K efflux was approximately two times greater than for influx. Furthermore, at thermodynamic equilibrium (i. e., when the ion product of K and Cl within the cell was equal to that outside) a temperature-dependent net K efflux was observed, approaching zero only when the external product reached approximately two times the internal product. The binding order of the ions to the transporter was asymmetric, being ordered outside (Cl binding first, followed by K) and random inside. K efflux but not influx was trans-inhibited by KCl.

Despite repeated unsuccessful attempts to identify chemically the target thiol group, at physiological pH, NEM may form adducts with thiols within protein kinases that phosphorylate KCC at specific serine and threonine residues primarily within the C-terminal domain of the transporter. The ensuing dephosphorylation of KCC by protein phosphatases leads to activation of KCC.|$|R
