5|$|Railroad Gazette was a trade journal first {{published}} in April 1856 that focused on railroad, transportation and engineering topics.

5|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended to promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United States and its allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> with its close allies.|$|E

5|$|Life with PlayStation was a Folding@home {{application}} {{available for}} PlayStation 3 which connected to Stanford University’s Folding@home distributed computer network {{and allowed the}} user to donate their console's spare processing cycles to the project. Folding@home is supported by Stanford University and volunteers {{make a contribution to}} society by donating computing power to this project. Research made by the project may eventually contribute to the creation of vital cures. The Folding@home client was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment in collaboration with Stanford University. Life with PlayStation also consisted of a 3D virtual view of the Earth and contained current weather and news information of various cities and countries from around the world, as well as a World Heritage channel which offered information about historical sites, and the United Village channel which is a project designed to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> about communities and cultures worldwide. As of PlayStation 3 system software update version 4.30 on October 24, 2012, the Life With PlayStation project has ended.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{coherence}} directories track <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> at a cache-line granularity. In practice, however, as {{data sharing}} occurs at a coarser granularity {{in a large}} region of memory, common sharing patterns tend to be observed across multiple proximate lines. Hence, the directory entries for the lines replicate the same <b>sharing</b> <b>information,</b> resulting in inefficient use of space, power, and energy. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate "region-level sharing pattern locality", that is, {{a small number of}} distinct sharing patterns are observed across proximate lines within a large region of memory, e. g., a page unit. We leverage this phenomenon to propose a new representation of <b>sharing</b> <b>information,</b> called Region-level <b>Sharing</b> <b>information</b> Tracking (RST), that dynamically maintains common <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> in a space-efficient manner at a region-level. Our experimental results based on conventional parallel and server workloads show that RST reduces over 75 % of the area (and hence energy) compared to conventional directory caches, with almost negligible performance overhead...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{systematic}} empirical analysis of how asymmetric information and {{competition in the}} credit market affect voluntary <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> between lenders. We study an experimental credit market in which <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> can help lenders to distinguish good borrowers from bad ones. Lenders may, however, also lose market power by <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> with competitors. Our results suggest that asymmetric information in the credit market increases the frequency of <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> between lenders significantly. Stronger competition between lenders reduces <b>information</b> <b>sharing.</b> In credit markets where lenders may fail to coordinate on <b>sharing</b> <b>information,</b> the degree of information asymmetry, rather than lender competition, drives actual <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior. ...|$|R

Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19.

5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and <b>share</b> <b>information</b> on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies <b>share</b> <b>information.</b> Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E

We show that our measure leads to a new nonnegative decomposition of the mutual information $I(S;X_ 1 X_ 2) $ into shared, complementary and unique components.

Recasting the findings of 94 studies (total number of groupsÂ =Â  5596; total N approximatelyÂ =Â  19, 702) into this framework reveals three key insights. First, virtuality improves the <b>sharing</b> of unique <b>information,</b> but hinders the openness of <b>information</b> <b>sharing.</b> Second, unique <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> is more important to the performance of face-to-face teams than is open <b>information</b> <b>sharing,</b> whereas open <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> is more important to the performance of virtual teams than is unique <b>information</b> <b>sharing.</b> Third, the effects of virtuality on <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> are more curvilinear than linear - such that low levels of virtuality improve <b>information</b> <b>sharing,</b> but high levels hider it.
