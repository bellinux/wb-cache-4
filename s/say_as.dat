5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E

25|$|Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on 8 February 1942, shortly after a meeting with Hitler in East Prussia.

As a result, there has been some speculation that Todt's death was a covert assassination, but this has never been substantiated.|$|E

25|$|The bird {{remained}} {{rare and}} highly coveted. The first captive breeding {{occurred in the}} 1950s in Brazil, in the aviaries of the late Alvaro Carvalhaes, an aviculturist from Santos. He hatched numerous chicks, some reports <b>say</b> <b>as</b> many as 24, one of which {{ended up at the}} Naples Zoo (Italy), where it remained alive until the late 1980s. Most of his birds died of poisoning in the 1970s. Some of these birds were the likely source of rumored Brazilian Spix owners in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

This initiative was launched after he obtained the unequivocal support of black leadership at the time, especially and including the late former president Nelson Mandela.

25|$|Note {{that the}} domain and codomain {{are in fact}} part of the {{information}} determining a morphism. For example, {{in the category of}} sets, where morphisms are functions, two functions may be identical as sets of ordered pairs (may have the same range), while having different codomains. The two functions are distinct from the viewpoint of category theory. Thus many authors require that the hom-classes hom(X, Y) be disjoint. In practice, this is not a problem because if this disjointness does not hold, it can be assured by appending the domain and codomain to the morphisms, (<b>say,</b> <b>as</b> the second and third components of an ordered triple).|$|E
25|$|Some {{time before}} 1565 (some sources <b>say</b> <b>as</b> early as 1500), an {{enormous}} deposit of graphite was discovered on {{the approach to}} Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England, which the locals found very useful for marking sheep. During the reign of Elizabeth I (1533–1603), Borrowdale graphite {{was used as a}} refractory material to line moulds for cannonballs, resulting in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired farther, contributing to the strength of the English navy. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and soft, and could easily be cut into sticks. Because of its military importance, this unique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the Crown.|$|E
25|$|While {{these early}} efforts in orchestrated merengue {{generally}} succeeded only in scandalizing their audiences, the political changes {{that occurred in}} the Dominican Republic {{over the next few years}} made a resurgence of the merengue possible. The resented North American invasion of 1916 seems to have made the general public more disposed to support autochthonous rhythms over imported ones, though the raucous rural accordion sound was still unacceptable to high-society tastes. Nevertheless, when Rafael Leonidas Trujillo took power in 1930, he imposed the merengue upon all levels of society, some <b>say</b> <b>as</b> a form of punishment for the elites that had previously refused to accept him. The soon-to-be dictator must also have realized the symbolic power of the rural folk music and its potential for creating support among the masses, since he took accordionists with him around the Republic during his campaign tours from the very beginning.|$|E

25|$|Early Christianity {{spread from}} city to city in the Hellenized Roman Empire and beyond into East Africa and South Asia. Apostles {{traveled}} extensively, establishing communities in major cities and regions throughout the Empire. The original church communities were founded by apostles (see Apostolic see) and numerous other Christians soldiers, merchants, and preachers in northern Africa, Asia Minor, Armenia, Arabia, Greece, and other places. Over 40 were established by the year 100, many in Asia Minor, such as the seven churches of Asia. By the end of the 1st century, Christianity had already spread to Greece and Italy, some <b>say</b> <b>as</b> far as India, serving as foundations for the expansive spread of Christianity throughout the world. In AD 301, the Kingdom of Armenia became the first to declare Christianity as its state religion, following the conversion of the Royal House of the Arsacids in Armenia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{production}} system, machines and apparatuses {{play an important}} role. What {{is referred to as}} capital is nothing other than these machines and apparatuses, together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should <b>say</b> <b>as</b> important as labor. By the help of machines and apparatuses, the human being got a tremendous production capability. These machines, apparatuses and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.|$|E
25|$|That you <b>say</b> <b>as</b> {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E

25|$|Appointments {{of judges}} and Judicial Commissioners (JCs) of the Supreme Court {{are made by}} the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. The Prime Minister thus {{possesses}} the {{primary power of appointment}} of judges of the Supreme Court. Although the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs, and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments, these are relatively small roles played in the final <b>say</b> <b>as</b> to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, it is said that the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges who believe in the same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers. On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles are inevitably intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.|$|E
25|$|England {{needed a}} victory {{to keep the}} five-match One-day International series alive, and with Australia needing six runs off the last over, {{it looked like the}} Australians would secure the series with two matches to spare. However, Katherine Brunt had the last <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> she first had Cathryn Fitzpatrick stumped and then helped to run out Julie Hayes for a duck. Suddenly, Australia needed four from the last ball to win, and they could only get one, as England went into scenes of jubilation - having secured their first victory over the Australian women since 1993. Earlier, Claire Taylor had lifted England to 200 for 7 with her 82, taking on Fitzpatrick who conceded 61 runs in her 10 overs. All the six Australian bowlers got one wicket, however, with the seventh being a run out. Australia's opener Belinda Clark {{recorded}} another poor score with a six-ball duck, and Australia continued to lose wickets at regular intervals. Yet, at 195 for 5 with an over to spare, the wise money would normally have been on the tourists, but thanks to Brunt, it went England's way instead.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{traveled}} to Pittsburgh on June 24 {{to open a}} four-game series against the Pirates at PNC Park. Nick Tepesch was promoted from AAA to make a spot start and he allowed five runs on seven hits in only four innings to put the team in a hole they never recovered from. Corey Seager had four hits in the game but the Dodgers lost 8–6. Kershaw allowed four runs in a game {{for the first time}} all season as his 10 start unbeaten streak came to an end with a 4–3 loss to the Pirates on June 26. In the final game of the series, the Pirates jumped out to a four run lead in the first inning but the Dodgers came from behind to win 5–4 to avoid the sweep. Urías picked up his first major league win on June 28 with a 6–5 victory over the Brewers at Miller Park. Junior Guerra shut down the Dodgers bats the next <b>say</b> <b>as</b> rookie Brock Stewart had a rough debut, allowing five runs in the second inning as the Dodgers lost 7–0. The Dodgers received some bad news as the month ended, with Kershaw heading to the disabled list due to a herniated disc in his back. Meanwhile, the team won the final game of the month, 8–1. Maeda allowed only one run on three hits in six innings and the Dodgers hit three home runs.|$|E
