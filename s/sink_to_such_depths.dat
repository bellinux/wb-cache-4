6000|$|Poor Sweden, {{since it}} shot Karl XII. in the {{trenches}} at Fredericshall, {{could not get a}} King again; and is very anarchic under its Phantasm King and free National Palaver,--Senate with subaltern Houses;--which generally has French gold in its pocket, and noise instead of wisdom in its head. Scandalous to think of or behold. The French, desirous to keep Russia in play during these high Belleisle adventures now on foot, had, after much egging, bribing, flattering, persuaded vain Sweden into this War with Russia. [...] "At Narva they were 80,000, we 8,000; and what became of them!" [...] cry the Swedes always. Yes, my friends, but you had a Captain at Narva; you had not yet shot your Captain when you did Narva! [...] "Faction of Hats," [...] "Faction of Caps" [...] (that is, NIGHT-caps, as being somnolent and disinclined to France and War): seldom did a once-valiant far-shining Nation <b>sink</b> <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths,</b> since they shot their Captain, and said to Anarchy, [...] "THOU art Captaincy, we see, and the Divine thing!"

But first he sent an emissary to Captain Jansen for a fathom of calico with which to cover his royal nakedness. Meanwhile he lingered in the canoe alongside. The regal dirt on his chest I swear was half an inch thick, while {{it was a good}} wager that the underneath layers were anywhere from ten to twenty years of age. He sent his emissary on board again, who explained that the big fella marster belong Suava was condescendingly willing enough to shake hands with Captain Jansen and me and cadge a stick or so of trade tobacco, but that nevertheless his high-born soul was still at so lofty an altitude that it could not <b>sink</b> itself <b>to</b> <b>such</b> a <b>depth</b> of degradation as to shake hands with a mere female woman. Poor Charmian! Since her Malaita experiences she has become a changed woman. Her meekness and humbleness are appallingly becoming, and I should not be surprised, when we return to civilization and stroll along a sidewalk, to see her take her station, with bowed head, a yard in the rear.|$|R

50|$|Elephant seals have a {{very large}} volume of blood, {{allowing}} them to hold {{a large amount of}} oxygen for use when diving. They have large sinuses in their abdomens to hold blood and can also store oxygen in their muscles with increased myoglobin concentrations in muscle.

5000|$|Merely in {{financial}} terms, [...] "the nature of California's agriculture made {{the owners of}} farm land cry for peon labor," [...] a situation that Steinbeck found despicable. The sheer scope and conditions of California agriculture required cheap labor of a kind that white Americans felt was not worth of their dignity. Steinbeck writes that [...] "with the depression, farm wages <b>sank</b> <b>to</b> <b>such</b> a low level {{in the southern part}} of the state that white labor could not exist on them." [...] Farm owners simply made greater profits because immigrant laborers accepted lower wages; therefore, they were constantly seeking out foreign labor rather than trying to pay white Americans a fair wage.|$|R

Rokoff must have known that I frequently passed through the Rue Maule.

2500|$|Due to its {{riverside}} location, Rome has occasionally suffered serious flooding.

Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths</b> <b>to</b> extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|R

30|$|To {{assess the}} {{sensitivity}} to the initial model, we created a synthetic model using a modified PREM with a seafloor depth of 4.2  km, crustal thickness of 6.6  km, and ± 3  % uniform velocity perturbations. The results suggest that shear wave velocities at depths shallower than 50  km are not well recovered if the initial model is substantially different from the synthetic model (Fig.  6 e, f). Rayleigh waves {{in the range of}} periods analyzed are less sensitive <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths,</b> so final models resemble the initial model at shallow depths. Small misfits to the synthetic models, less than 0.03  km/s, are also observed at depths greater than 50  km, which compensate the misfits shallower than 50  km. In the present study, we focus on shear wave models at depths greater than 50  km.|$|R

She had not even known that a living wife was being displaced till her arrival at Knapwater put retreat out of the question, and had looked upon personation simply as a mode of subsistence a degree better than toiling in poverty and alone, after a bustling and somewhat pampered life as housekeeper in a gay mansion.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason that}} polychelids {{remained}} unknown {{for so long}} is that they live on the sea-floor, often at great depths; the family {{as a whole has}} a depth range from less than 100 m to over 5000 m.

50|$|A light-acquisition problem {{exists for}} aquatic algae since {{submergence}} can reduce light intensity and dampen photosynthesis. For land plants, full-spectrum of sunlight, from blue to red light, {{is available for}} chlorophyll absorption. However, red light is absorbed in the few meters of water closest {{to the surface of}} an aquatic environment and the light environment beneath these few meters is mainly blue-green in quality. Algal cells are likely to be transported <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depth</b> of water, and many have evolved a mechanism to better absorb blue-green light. A Nannochloropsis species isolated from Singapore's coastal water was investigated under different light wavelengths (red, green, blue, and white) and intensities to determine the optimal condition for biomass productivity and lipid production. The maximum fatty acid yield was achieved for both phototrophic (sunlight is the only energy source) and mixotrophic (utilize both sunlight and energy from carbon source) cultures at 55.15 and 111.96 mg/L, respectively, under cell exposure to blue light (470 nm). The biomass productivity of the algae also peaked under blue light for both cultures.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermal evolution of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's subsurface in the Seth_ 01 region, where active pits {{have been observed}} by the ESA/Rosetta mission. Our simulations show that clathrate destabilization and amorphous ice crystallization can occur at depths corresponding {{to those of the}} observed pits in a timescale shorter than 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's lifetime in the comet's activity zone in the inner solar system. Sublimation of crystalline ice down <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths</b> is possible only {{in the absence of a}} dust mantle, which requires the presence of dust grains in the matrix small enough to be dragged out by gas from the pores. Our results are consistent with both pits formation via sinkholes or subsequent to outbursts, the dominant process depending on the status of the subsurface porosity. A sealed dust mantle would favor episodic and disruptive outgassing as a result of increasing gas pressure in the pores, while high porosity should allow the formation of large voids in the subsurface due to the continuous escape of volatiles. We finally conclude that the subsurface of 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is not uniform at a spatial scale of similar to 100 - 200 m...|$|R
40|$|Bending of oceanic plates at {{subduction}} zones {{results in}} extension and widespread normal faulting(1) in the upper, brittle {{part of the}} slab(2, 3). Detailed seismic surveys at trenches reveal that {{this part of the}} oceanic plate could be pervasively hydrated for several kilometres below the crust-mantle boundary(4 - 7). Similarly, heat-flow surveys indicate active fluid circulation within the slab(8). Yet, the mechanisms that enable fluids <b>to</b> percolate <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>depths</b> in spite of their natural buoyancy remain unclear. Here we use two-dimensional numerical experiments to show that stress changes induced by the bending oceanic plate produce subhydrostatic or even negative pressure gradients along normal faults, favouring downward pumping of fluids. The fluids then react with the crust and mantle surrounding the faults and are stored in the form of hydrous minerals. We suggest that this process is the dominant mechanism of deep slab hydration, although it may be locally aided by the enhancement in porosity due to prefailure dilatancy(9), pre-existing cracks(10) and migrating fluid-filled cracks(11). Our results have implications for the transport of water into the deeper parts of the mantle(12), and for further clarifying the seismic anisotropy of slabs(13) ...|$|R
60|$|One general {{superficial}} circumstance we remark with praise: {{the force}} of Politeness. <b>To</b> <b>such</b> <b>depth</b> has the sense of civilisation penetrated man's life; no Drouet, no Legendre, in the maddest tug of war, can altogether shake it off. Debates of Senates dreadfully in earnest are seldom given frankly to the world; else perhaps they would surprise it. Did not the Grand Monarque himself once chase his Louvois {{with a pair of}} brandished tongs? But reading long volumes of these Convention Debates, all in a foam with furious earnestness, earnest many times to the extent of life and death, one is struck rather with the degree of continence they manifest in speech; and how in such wild ebullition, there is still a kind of polite rule struggling for mastery, and the forms of social life never altogether disappear. These men, though they menace with clenched right-hands, do not clench one another by the collar; they draw no daggers, except for oratorical purposes, and this not often: profane swearing is almost unknown, though the Reports are frank enough; we find only one or two oaths, oaths by Marat, reported in all.|$|R
