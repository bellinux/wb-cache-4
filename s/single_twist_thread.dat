40|$|The {{question}} addressed here is "How can a <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> correct itself?". We {{consider a}} theoretical model where the studied math- ematical object represents a <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> linking two points. We intro- duce a random process {{such that the}} thread reorganizes itself to become a line between these two points. The modifications are local and also the decision to make a modification is based only on local arguments. Thus, this paper presents a self-organization process which constructs a line between two points. From the practical side, this paper is a generaliza- tion of previous results {{which is part of}} a study of cooling processes in crystallography. From the theoretical side, this paper improves mathematical tools used to analyze random processes in cellular automata. Note that, the random processes studied on cellular automata were used in the conception of the model of cooling processes...|$|R

Support from STFC for PKB and AWH is also acknowledged (grant numbers ST/L 000768 / 1 and ST/N 000609 / 1). Context: Heating the solar corona requires dissipation of stored magnetic energy, which may occur in twisted magnetic fields. Recently published numerical simulations show that the ideal kink instability in a <b>twisted</b> magnetic <b>thread</b> may trigger energy release in stable twisted neighbours, and demonstrate an avalanche of heating events. Aims: We aim to construct a Taylor relaxation model for the energy release from two flux ropes and compare this with the outcomes of the simulations. We then aim to extend the model to large numbers of flux ropes, allowing the possibility of modelling a heating avalanche, and calculation of the energy release for ensembles of <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> with varying <b>twist</b> profiles. Methods: The final state is calculated by assuming a helicity-conserving relaxation to a minimum energy state. Multiple scenarios are examined, which include kink-unstable flux ropes relaxing on their own, as well as stable and unstable flux ropes merging into a single rope {{as a result of}} magnetic reconnection. We consider alternative constraints that determine the spatial extent of the final relaxed state. Results: Good agreement is found between the relaxation model and the magnetohydrodynamic simulations, both for interactions of two <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> and for a multi-thread avalanche. The model can predict the energy release for flux ropes of varying degrees of twist, which relax individually or which merge through reconnection into a single flux rope. It is found that the energy output of merging flux ropes is dominated by the energy of the most strongly twisted rope. Conclusions: The relaxation approach provides a very good estimate of the energy release in an ensemble of <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> of which one is kink-unstable. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

Karamiori is an old and highly respected textile production method. The Japanese divide karaori into three basic styles based on structure: sha (紗), ro (絽), and ra (羅). Sha is the basic leno weave, Ro adds additional areas of flat or twill weaves and Ra maintains the concept of <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> but allows both warp and weft to be freed and recombined to form highly intricate weaves.|$|R

50|$|In a {{spinning}} mule, the roving is pulled off bobbins and sequentially fed through rollers operating at several different speeds, thinning the roving at a consistent rate. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cop as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than ring spinning. Spinning by the mule machine is an intermittent process as the frame advances and returns. It is the descendant of a device invented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, and produces a softer, less <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> that is favored for fines and for weft.|$|R
