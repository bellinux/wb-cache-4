40|$|In {{the large}} scale map of urban area, obvious {{difference}} in geometric position often tend {{to exist in}} multisource habitation data, which increases the difficulty and uncertainty of habitation matching. A new matching method for areal habitation by using the <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh of blank region is proposed to solve the above problem. Firstly, the one-to-one mapping relationship between <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh and habitation is established based on <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> network of blank region so that the matching object is transformed from habitation to <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh. Secondly, the dual graph of <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh is constructed by the connective topology, and the centrality indexes of each node in the dual graph can be calculated. Then the matching model of <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh is established by polarization transformation and analytic hierarchy process, accordingly the matching results of <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh can be obtained. Finally, the matching results of <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh can be transformed into habitation matching results by the mapping relationship. The transformation of matching object, dual graph construction and polarization transformation of the <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> mesh can add the constraint conditions of topology and relative position to the matching process, so that the influence on matching caused by the obvious geometric position difference can be reduced significantly. Comparison experiments and analysis with other areal matching methods indicate that the proposed method can solve the matching problem among the areal habitation data of the large scale urban map with obvious geometric position difference effectively...|$|E

However, traditional visual inspection to monitor the concrete cracks has disadvantages such as subjective inspection nature, associated time and cost, and possible danger to inspectors. To alter the visual inspection, a complete procedure for automated crack assessment based on adaptive digital image processing has been proposed in this study. Crack objects are extracted from the images using the subtraction with median filter and the local binarization using the Niblack's method. To adaptively determine the optimal window sizes for the median filter and the Niblack's method without distortion of crack object, an optimal filter size index (OFSI) is proposed.

A road network matching method that takes the similarity of the roads' neighborhood habitation cluster into consideration is proposed, which draws on the experience of the human spatial cognitive characteristics for the unfamiliar environment. Firstly, the neighborhood habitation cluster of the road is extracted by the urban <b>skeleton</b> <b>line</b> network; Then by calculating the spatial relation similarity and geometry characteristic similarity of the neighborhood habitation cluster, the matching results can be obtained. The advantage of this method is that for the road data which have obvious location or rotation differences, the similarity of their neighborhood habitation clusters can be treated as a proper matching index. Actually, roads' neighborhood habitation cluster can be a constraint of the road matching process and enhance its robustness.

The primary objective of this study is to compare the results obtained by two different methods. Firstly, the skeleton lines are derived with respect to the algorithm developed by Aumann et al.

Two reheat temperatures were selected to study the effect of prior austenite grain size. The properties of air cooled samples are compared with those of specimens cooled at two different rates; in each case, cooling was interrupted at one of three different temperatures. The textures were measured by x-ray diffractometry and are presented in the form of ODF plots and <b>skeleton</b> <b>lines.</b> The yield strengths were measured by carrying out tensile tests along directions inclined at increasing angles to the rolling direction. The state of the pancaked austenite before transformation was characterized in terms of the effective interfacial area. It is shown that this parameter determines the sharpness of the transformation texture because it accounts for both the amount of pancaking strain applied to the austenite before transformation and the austenite grain size. Another important factor affecting texture development during transformation is the rate of cooling, as it determines the dislocation density present on each active slip system. The results of hardness testing, texture measurement, and mechanical testing showed that a moderate cooling rate and a medium cooling interruption temperature lead to the best combination of a fine microstructure and a desirable texture. It is shown that accelerated cooling increases both the yield strength and the planar anisotropy of the yield strength, the latter property rising to a maximum in the samples associated with the lowest cooling interruption temperature. Comparison between the experimental results and model predictions of the yield strength ratio indicates that the pancake and lath models are in the best agreement with the measured values...|$|R
