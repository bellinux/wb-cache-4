Natural materials are continuously active with dynamic processes occurring, such as growth, shrinkage and transport mechanisms under the consumption of energy. Extending the knowledge on out-of- equilibrium self-assembly will open new opportunities for programmable and self-healing materials. In this thesis a new design approach for out-of-equilibrium formed <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> is described and tested experimentally. A key development is the chemical fuel driven self-assembly of molecular gelators and colloidal particles.

40|$|The {{importance}} of noncovalent interactions {{in the realm}} of biological materials continues to inspire efforts to create artificial supramolecular polymeric architectures. These types of <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> hold great promise as environmentally stimuli-responsive materials because they are capable of adjusting their various structural parameters, such as chain length, architecture, conformation, and dynamics, to new surrounding environments upon exposure to appropriate external stimuli. Nevertheless, in spite of considerable advances in the area of responsive materials, it has proved challenging to create synthetic <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> that respond to highly disparate analytes and whose environmentally induced changes in structure can be followed directly through both various spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses. Herein, we report a new set of artificial <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> obtained by simply mixing two appropriately chosen, heterocomplementary macrocyclic receptors, namely a tetrathiafulvalene-functionalized calix[4]pyrrole and a bis(dinitrophenyl) -meso-substituted calix[4]pyrrole. The resulting polymeric materials, stabilized by combination of donor–acceptor and hydrogen bonding interactions, undergo dynamic, reversible dual guest-dependent structural transformations upon exposure to two very different types of external chemical inputs, namely chloride anion and trinitrobenzene. The structure and dynamics of the copolymers and their analyte-dependent responsive behavior was established via single crystal X-ray crystallography, SEM, heterocomplementary isodesmic analysis, 1 - and 2 D NMR, and dynamic light scattering spectroscopies. Our results demonstrate the benefit of using designed heterocomplementary interactions of two functional macrocyclic receptors to create synthetic, <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> for the development of “smart” sensory materials that mimic the key biological attributes of multianalyte recognition and substrate-dependent multisignaling...|$|R

These theoretical considerations are complemented with examples from recent literature that illustrate the potential of the different type of block copolymers to prepare (functional) supramolecular materials.

40|$|<b>Self-assembling</b> <b>materials</b> are the {{building}} blocks of bottom-up nanofabrication processes, but they need to be templated to impose long-range order and eliminate defects. In this work, the self-assembly of a thin film of a spherical-morphology block copolymer is templated using an array of nanoscale topographical elements that act as surrogates for the minority domains of the block copolymer. The orientation and periodicity of the resulting array of spherical microdomains are governed by the commensurability between the block copolymer period and the template period and is accurately described by a free-energy model. This method, which forms high-spatial-frequency arrays using a lower-spatial-frequency template, will be useful in nanolithography applications such as the formation of high-density microelectronic structures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Halogen bonding, {{due to its}} {{directionality}} and tunable strength, {{is being}} increasingly utilized in <b>self-assembling</b> <b>materials</b> and crystal engineering. Using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics (OPLS/CM 1 Ax) calculations, multiply halogen bonded complexes of brominated imidazole and pyridine are investigated along with their potential in construction of self-assembling architectures. Dimers with 1 − 10 halogen bonds are considered and reveal maximal binding energies of 3 − 36 kcal/mol. Cooperative (nonadditive) effects are found in complexes that extend both along and perpendicular to the halogen bonding axes, with interaction energies depending on polarization, secondary interactions, and ring spacers. Four structural motifs were identified to yield optimal halogen bonding. For the largest systems, the excellent agreement found between the DFT and OPLS/CM 1 Ax results supports {{the utility of the}} latter approach for analysis and design of self-assembling supramolecular structures.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the supramolecular organization of two series of peptide-based diblock oligomers is reported. The diblock oligomers are comprised of an α-helical oligopeptide rod, which is either based on γ-benzyl-L-glutamate or ε-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine, and a short oligo(styrene) coil. The unique feature of these rod-coil molecules is that the conformation of the α-helical peptide rod is sensitive to temperature. As a result, the supramolecular organization of these rod-coil oligomers can be manipulated not only via changes in the block length ratio or chemical composition but also via temperature-induced conformational changes in the rod segments.

Microstructural characterization of their aggregates has been determined in pure water and in pseudo-physiological conditions through DLS and SANS experiments. In all cases stable vesicles, with mean hydrodynamic radii ranging between 120 nm and 250 nm have been revealed. Biological validation of the nucleolipidic nanocarriers was ensured by evaluation of their toxicological profiles, performed by administration of the nanoaggregates to a panel of different cell lines.

Phase separation and microdomain evolution are explored in a rather wide range of temperatures (190 - 340 degrees C) using a rapid thermal processing (RTP) system. The maximum processing temperature that enables the ordering of block copolymers without introducing any significant degradation of macromolecules is identified. The reported results clearly indicate that the range of accessible temperatures in the processing of these <b>self-assembling</b> <b>materials</b> is mainly limited by the thermal instability of the grafted random copolymer layer, which starts to degrade at T > 300 degrees C, inducing detachment of the block copolymer thin film.

40|$|The {{presence}} of regular patterns in natural and technological phenomena is pervasive, often being present in both time and space. To increase {{our understanding of}} many phenomena where patterns are present, measurable quantities or metrics are typically defined and used for quantitative analysis. In many fields of study, methods for robustly computing these metrics do not exist, impeding further progress in these areas. <b>Self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> is one area where significant advances in microscopy techniques have enabled the generation of detailed imaging of self-assembled domains. Unfortunately, image analysis methods to quantify self-assembly patterns in this imaging data either do not exist or are severely limited in their applicability. With the ability to acquire this data but not quantify it, scientists and engineers face significant challenges in determining relationships between structure and properties of these materials. In this work, a generalized method for the quantitative analysis of pattern images is developed which addresses many of the existing challenges, specifically for the field of <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials.</b> The presented method is based upon a family of localized functions called shapelets and is fundamentally different from existing approaches. The method is composed of sets of shapelets reformulated to be "steerable" filters and a guided machine learning algorithm.
