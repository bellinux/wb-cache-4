In the past, the phin-phia was the instrument used by youths to court the maidens of their village. Few musicians still play it.

25|$|Modern Northern Sudanese {{music has}} its roots in haqibah (pronounced hagee-ba). It {{originated}} in the early 1920s, and was originally derived from the Muslim musical style known as madeeh. Haqibah is essentially an harmonic a cappella and vocal style, with percussion coming from the tambourine-like riq and from other instruments. Occasionally tonal instruments such as the piano and the qanun (a <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument)</b> are used.|$|E
25|$|Lyric {{poetry is}} a formal type of poetry which expresses {{personal}} emotions or feelings, typically spoken {{in the first}} person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument</b> known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic.|$|E

25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{triangular}} frame harp in Europe is contested. The first instrument associated with the harping tradition in the Gaelic world {{was known as a}} cruit. This word may originally have described a different <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument,</b> being etymologically related to the Welsh crwth. It has been suggested that the word clàrsach / cláirseach (from clàr / clár, a board) was coined for the triangular frame harp which replaced the cruit, and that this coining was of Scottish origin.|$|E
25|$|The {{hurdy-gurdy}} is a <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument</b> {{that produces}} sound by a hand crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions {{much like a}} violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound {{similar to those of}} a violin. Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangentssmall wedges, typically made of woodagainst {{one or more of the}} strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a sound board and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.|$|E
25|$|The bass guitar is a <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument</b> played {{primarily}} with the fingers or thumb (either by plucking, slapping, popping, tapping, or thumping), or {{by using a}} plectrum. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four, five, or six strings. In 1936, the Audiovox bass, the earliest electric solidbody bass guitar made out of walnut and neck-through construction, was invented by Paul Tutmarc of Seattle, Washington. Later in 1951, the bass guitar was perfected when Leo Fender introduced the precision bass, a fretted, solidbody instrument.|$|E

25|$|The cittern or cithren (Fr. cistre, It. cetra, Ger. zitter, zither, Sp. cistro, cedra, cítola) is a <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument</b> {{dating from}} the Renaissance. Modern {{scholars}} debate its exact history, but it is generally accepted that it is descended from the Medieval citole, or cytole. It looks much like the modern-day flat-back mandolin and the modern Irish bouzouki. Its flat-back design was simpler and cheaper to construct than the lute. It was also easier to play, smaller, less delicate and more portable. Played by all classes, the cittern was a premier instrument of casual music-making much as is the guitar today.|$|E
25|$|Native American {{music in}} North America {{is almost entirely}} monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends {{on the length of}} the wood used and the hand span of the {{intended}} player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is a single <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E
25|$|The crank became {{common in}} Europe {{by the early}} 15th century, seen {{in the works of}} those such as the {{military}} engineer Konrad Kyeser (1366after 1405). A rotary grindstone − the earliest representation thereof − which is operated by a crank handle is shown in the Carolingian manuscript Utrecht Psalter; the pen drawing of around 830 goes back to a late antique original. A musical tract ascribed to the abbot Odo of Cluny (ca. 878−942) describes a fretted <b>stringed</b> <b>instrument</b> which was sounded by a resined wheel turned with a crank; the device later appears in two 12th century illuminated manuscripts. There are also two pictures of Fortuna cranking her wheel of destiny from this and the following century.|$|E
