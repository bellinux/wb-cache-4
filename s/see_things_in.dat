500|$|In {{discussing}} his lyrics, Jimi Hendrix was characteristically enigmatic. [...] In a 1967 interview, he explained [...] "Most ballads come across in different ways. [...] Sometimes you <b>see</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> different ways {{than other people}} see it. [...] So then you write it in a song. [...] It could represent anything". [...] In different interviews, he acknowledged an American Indian-influence on his songs [...] "I Don't Live Today", [...] "May This Be Love", and [...] "Little Wing". [...] He described [...] "Little Wing" [...] as being [...] "based on a very, very simple Indian style", perhaps referring to some Native American mythologies in which spirits inhabit nature and animals, including birds. [...] In one interview, he saw it as self-explanatory: [...] "That's exactly what it's about, like 'She's walking through the clouds'", ...|$|E

"Padre Pio {{looked at}} Lefebvre very sternly and said: [...] "Never cause discord among your {{brothers}} and always practise {{the rule of}} obedience; above all when it seems {{to you that the}} errors of those in authority are all the more serious. There is no other road than that of obedience, especially {{for those of us who}} have made this vow."... It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not <b>see</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father." [...] Padre Pio looked at him intensely and, seeing what would soon happen, said: [...] "No! You will forget it! You will tear apart the community of faithful, oppose the will of your superiors and even go against the orders of the pope himself and this will happen quite soon..." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." [...] Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: [...] "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can <b>see</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]" [...] While Moore {{wanted to write about}} [...] "power politics" [...] and the [...] "worrying" [...] times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would [...] "switch off" [...] if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he [...] "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy." ...|$|E

5000|$|Whether {{or not it}} was {{possible}} to see God, was one of the common issues discussed at the time of al-Hadi who believed it was impossible to see Him. He argued that [...] "seeing is not possible if there is no air (space) between the seer and the <b>seen</b> <b>thing</b> through which sight goes through. If there is no air and no light between the seer and the <b>seen</b> <b>thing,</b> there will be no sight. When the seer equals the <b>seen</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the cause of sight between them, sight takes place, but those who compare the seer (man) to Allah, they are mistaken because they liken Allah to man…for effects must relate to causes." ...|$|R
