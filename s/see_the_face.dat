For example, British businessman Greville Wynne, who was imprisoned in the Lubyanka prison in 1962 for his connection to KGB defector Oleg Penkovsky, {{stated that he}} had talked to, but could not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of, a man {{who claimed to be}} a Swedish diplomat. Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on Wrangel Island in 1962. An eyewitness asserted that she had seen Wallenberg in the 1960s in a Soviet prison.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Leipzig for {{the feast of}} St. Michael (Michaelmas); it is his third and last of his extant cantatas for the feast, a feast celebrating the archangel and all angels. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the Book of Revelation, Michael fighting the dragon (...) , and from the Gospel of Matthew, heaven belongs to {{the children and the}} angels <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of God (...) [...] St. Michael, the archangel, has a prominent position in Lutheranism, as in Judaism. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted all of Bach's church cantatas in 2000 on the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, notes that the Sanctus, composed for Christmas 1724 in close relation to the text by Isaiah, and much later integrated to Bach's Mass in B minor, shows the relevance of angels for Bach's Lutheranism.|$|E
500|$|Bartley and ÓBriain {{showed the}} film to Chávez in February 2003. They {{recalled}} his response as [...] "quite emotional". BSÉ waived Venezuelan licensing fees for the film; on 13April, it was screened simultaneously with the television broadcast at a cinema in Caracas, before which Chávez made a speech saying, [...] "Watch this film and you will <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the coup." [...] Pro-Chávez activists also distributed the film unofficially. The Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador screened the film in New York City, where Bolivarian Circle members [...] "accepted donations" [...] for bootleg copies. El Universal said the Venezuelan government had 10,000 copies made, and according to National Review, the Venezuela Information Office (VIO) [...] "encouraged art-house theaters" [...] to screen the film. Government representatives aided the film's distribution officially and unofficially. Venezuelan filmmaker Wolfgang Schalk said the film counted on the worldwide support of Venezuelan embassies and a public relations effort to show the film free at universities and theaters {{in cities such as}} San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Peace Action New York was given permission for a screening during a fund raiser in the Lincoln Center, where 250 people paid $35 (€30) each to see the film and take part in a [...] "question-and-answer session" [...] with guests such as Leonor Granado, the Venezuelan Consul General. The consulate office made DVDs of the film available to [...] "anyone who wanted a copy", as Granado said the film was vital to [...] "building support in [...] for the Venezuelan government".|$|E

Her commission of the portrait would later be called the [...] "earliest recorded evidence of British admiration for Napoleon."

2500|$|Renoir {{was largely}} raised by Gabrielle Renard, his nanny and his mother's cousin, {{with whom he}} {{developed}} a strong bond. Shortly before his birth, {{she had come to}} live with the Renoir family. She introduced the young boy to the Guignol puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs My Life and My Films, [...] "She taught me to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the cliché." [...] Gabrielle was also fascinated by the new motion-picture invention, and when Renoir was only a few years old she took him to see his first film.|$|E

2500|$|More than 2000 people {{gathered}} {{to watch the}} burning prefectural office, but no one dared to extinguish the fire. They {{were looking at the}} burning office absentmindedly, thinking of the future of Japan, according to a newspaper. Another document recorded that people who had endured the government policy and Mabiki sokai (forced evacuation of houses), shouted, [...] "This is the Heaven's punishment against the evacuation of my house, I want to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of those who performed the bad policy {{in the name of the}} emperor."

Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life. ("Epilogue – Valjean's Death"). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother.

[...] Colonel Cody was to be its godfather, and the baby was named after the reigning Queen of England. [...] The child’s full name was to be Alexandra Birmingham Cody Standing Bear. [...] The next morning Cody {{came to me and}} asked if my wife and baby could be placed in the side-show.

[...] I gave my consent, and the afternoon papers stated that the baby and mother could be seen the following afternoon.

[...] The people filed past, many of them dropping money in a box for her. [...] It was a great drawing card for the show; the work was very light for my wife, and as for the baby, before she was twenty-four hours old she was making more money than my wife and I together." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Egypt cousin {{marriage}} {{may have}} been even more prevalent than in Arabia in past periods, with one source from the 1830s observing that it was common among Egyptian Arabs but less so in Cairo than in other parts of Egypt. Reportedly the husband and wife would continue to call each other [...] "cousin" [...] because the tie of blood was seen as indissoluble while the marriage was not. In the upper and middle classes the young man was seldom allowed to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of his female cousin after she reached puberty. Cousin marriage was not only common among Muslims but also among Egyptian Copts in the past although to a small extent not exceeding 7% of all Coptic marriages. Estimates from the late 19th and early 20th century state variously that either 80 percent of the Egyptian fellahin marry first cousins or two-thirds marry them if they exist. Cousin marriage was also practiced in the Sinai Peninsula, where a girl is sometimes reserved by her cousin with money long before puberty, and among Bedouins in the desert between the Nile and the Red Sea. Cousin marriage was practiced in Medina during Muhammad's time, but out of 113 recorded marriages in one sample only 15 were between abnaa 'amm or paternal cousins of any degree.|$|E
