40|$|Returns to cattle feeders {{should move}} {{back into the}} profit column during most of 1982. but feeding margins will remain narrow, <b>says</b> <b>Mike</b> Sands, {{extension}} economist specializing in livestock marketing at K-State. “Most of the improvement in profitability compared with last year will result from lower feed and feeder prices, rather than a dramatic rise in fed cattle prices. " he points out. With Choice steer prices expected to average in the $ 64 - 66 cwt. range during January-June. feeding returns should average on the positive side, {{in sharp contrast to}} the average $ 95 -per-head losses suffered during the first half of 1981. Sands believes. Total commercial cattle slaughter reached 34. 9 million head in 1981. about 3 % larger than a year earlier. Although fed cattle marketings dropped about 1 % from 1980 levels, the decline was more than offset by a 14 % rise in nonfed steer and heifer and cow slaughter. "Certainly, the lack of growth in consumers' inflation-adjusted incomes during the past year has contributed to the dismal economic performance of the cattle industry," Sands comments. "But, perhaps more importantly, total red meat and poultry supplies climbed to a record 53. 1 billion lbs. in 1981. about 1. 5 % more than the year-earlier record...|$|E

There {{are a number}} of places where we've strengthened our engineering and our processes, <b>says</b> <b>Mike</b> Kahn, ATK Thiokol vice president of space launch systems. Protecting the booster against corrosion in the humid Florida environment is one area that has been addressed. Since the loss of Columbia, ATK Thiokol and the Marshall Space Flight Center have completely reevaluated the shuttle solid rocket motor's design certification and found no major problems, Kahn said. The Thiokol solid motors did not {{play a role in the}} 2003 Columbia accident, but the motor's older field joint design (since replaced) was the primary cause of the 1986 Challenger accident that killed seven astronauts. The 129 X 12 -ft. ATK Thiokol reusable solid rocket motor forms the core of the shuttle's two solid rocket boosters (SRBs). United Space Alliance (USA) has overall responsibility for the booster's nose-mounted systems such as recovery parachutes and aft-mounted thrust vector control systems that increase the length to 149 ft. USA and its subcontractors have also reaffirmed quality control on systems such as the booster's Hamilton Sundstrand hydraulic power units for critical thrust vector control. And to ensure greater safeguards against booster debris jeopardizing the orbiter, a bolt-catcher system to restrain the large bolts, severed at booster separation, was also redesigned...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to research the Bridge-Transition Program and find out if students feel that this program has been beneficial to them and if it has assisted them in their transition from high school to college. To find this information out, I interviewed about six people. Four were Bridge-Transition students and one was a teacher who taught over the summer bridge component, and lastly the Director of the program. I used myself as a source within this paper because I was accepted to the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign through the Bridge-Transition program. My thoughts about this problem started out negative but as I continued to interview my fellow peers they turned my negative opinions into positive ones. I now see that Bridge-Transition has actually been beneficial to me on some many levels. But as I stated earlier I interviewed students and staff who were affiliated with this program. There were three main questions I sought answers for throughout these interviews, which were; does the Bridge-Transition program own up to what it is designed to accomplish, does this program only target minorities and why, and is the transition to college through Bridge-Transition easier academically speaking. Surprisingly, many of the students did feel as if this program did do exactly what is set out to achieve the success of incoming ???at risk??? freshmen. As far as targeting minority, this program does not set out to ???only??? target minority it offers equal opportunity for all but unfortunately there are many factors that {{play a major role in}} this situation, but ???it is certainly still related to the deep racial and ethnic divides that persist in terms of who receives quality secondary education in our nation??? <b>says</b> <b>Mike</b> Odom the coordinator of Bridge-Transition for college reading/study skills.

40|$|On May 21, 2016, 250 {{participants}} and 70 volunteers came {{together for the}} second Amy’s Ride/Run/Walk, which raises money for pancreatic cancer research in honor of Amy Cygan Spier. One of 11 siblings, Amy was just 54 {{years old when she}} succumbed to pancreatic cancer in November 2014. For the brothers and sisters she left behind, the event is a labor of love. The idea for a fundraiser began to take shape after the Cygans learned how comparatively little money is devoted to pancreatic cancer research. With a number of cyclists in the family, a bike ride seemed like a logical choice. Given Amy’s great love for family, they wanted to include a walk, as well, making the event family friendly. Since then, they’ve planned and executed two successful events in Quakertown Memorial Park—raising more than $ 54, 000 for researchers in the Jefferson Department of Surgery. As one brother, Mike Cygan, explains, half of the siblings are either business owners or project managers, making their skills a natural fit for planning the event. To pull it all off, the siblings convene for biweekly and then weekly planning calls, and use online tools to collaborate from multiple locations. Mike adds that while the events have been successful in raising money for the cause, the process of supporting Amy—both during and after her battle—has had another benefit: bringing the Cygan siblings closer. “As the oldest sibling, I have to admit that in the younger side of the family, I didn’t know my siblings as adults until now,” <b>says</b> <b>Mike.</b> “I’ve learned a lot about them over the past few years. ” Amy’s sister, Celeste Cygan Vaughn, agrees, and notes that community support has been another blessing: “I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the generosity of people we know—in terms of time and money. It’s amazing. ” The Cygans believe that generosity also extends to the Jefferson clinicians, including Harish Lavu, MD, who was Amy’s surgeon, and Ashwin R. Sama, MD, who served as her medical oncologist. “All of us individually got to know some of the staff at Jefferson through Amy’s battle,” explains another brother, Tony Cygan. “It’s just an incredible bunch of folks and an incredible program. They’ve supported us with this initiative and been terrific. ” The event has been especially meaningful to Mike’s next-door neighbor, Nancy Parry, whose husband, Al, was also a pancreatic cancer patient at Jefferson. “When I arrive at the event and see Al’s oncologist and nurse and surgeon, I don’t have to go over to them and say, ‘Hi, do you remember me?’ They come and seek me out and greet me with bear hugs and inquire about how I’m doing,” says Nancy. “I’m overwhelmed by that. ” Planning for the third event—scheduled for Saturday, May 20, 2017 —is already underway. The Cygans encourage everyone to participate. After all, this is a family that’s big: in number, in support and in love.
