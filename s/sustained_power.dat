25|$|The Il-18B was {{powered by}} four Ivchenko AI-20A Series 1 turboprops, each {{providing}} a takeoff power of 2,985kW (4,000 shp) and <b>sustained</b> <b>power</b> of 2,090kW (2,800 shp) at cruise altitude. Early Il-18A production had initially been fitted with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, {{but they were}} soon exchanged for AI-20s. Later Il-18B production featured AI-20A Series 2 engines, with the same power ratings, but with technical improvements, thus older machines were updated with the Series 2 powerplants. The AI-20s drove four-bladed variable pitch reversible props with a diameter of 4.5 meters (14 feet 9 inches), featuring prominent propeller spinners, and hydraulic actuation for prop pitch. The engines were mounted above the wing and featured integrated fire extinguishers. The engines were started with electric motors, the power for the motors being provided by a ground cart.|$|E

It is this <b>sustained</b> <b>power</b> of creating a vast natural stage and peopling it with elemental men, the pioneers of a strong nation, that largely accounts for Cooper's secure place among the world's fiction writers.|$|E

50|$|Plasma {{gases and}} plasma {{performance}} The minimum <b>power</b> to <b>sustain</b> an induction plasma depends on pressure, frequency and gas composition.

Once diatomic gas is {{introduced into the}} plasma, the <b>sustaining</b> <b>power</b> would be drastically increased, because extra dissociation energy is required to break gaseous molecular bonds first, so then further excitation to plasma state is possible. The major reasons to use diatomic gases in plasma processing are (1) to get a plasma of high energy content and good thermal conductivity (see Table below), and (2) to conform the processing chemistry.|$|R
