These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered <b>square</b> <b>knot.</b> Other advancement and recognitions—such as the 50-miler award, Crime Prevention Awards, Emergency Preparedness Award and World Conservation Award—are available to Scouts who show proficiency in special areas. BSA's National Court of Honor is responsible for lifesaving and meritorious awards. All Courts of Honor for Eagle Scout rank are convened as National Courts of Honor also.|$|E

30|$|Although {{the flat}} <b>square</b> <b>knots</b> are {{considered}} very secure with low failure rates across {{a variety of}} suture materials [4], sliding knots are the most frequently used in surgery. Gynaecologic surgeons also prefer sliding knots, because of the advantage that one suture end can be kept under constant tension while tying in the narrow deep spaces of the vagina and the pelvis. Therefore this study examined the performance of different types of sliding knots made with modern, resorbable suture materials.|$|R

25|$|Eagle Scout hat pins were {{produced}} from 1921 through 1958 with several variations. Eagle Scouts who earned additional merit badges were recognized using Eagle Palms, introduced in 1927. Adults who had earned Eagle Scout {{began to be}} recognized in 1934 with a red, white and blue ribbon bar. In 1940, a small eagle pin {{was added to the}} bar. Ribbon bars were replaced by embroidered <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> patches in 1947. Over the years, the knot was produced with various background colors to match the different uniforms. Although the Venturing and Sea Scout programs use different uniform shirts, the current knot is available only with a tan background that matches the Boy Scout uniform. When the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) was created in 1969, a gold-colored eagle device was introduced for wear on the Eagle Scout <b>square</b> <b>knot.</b> The Eagle Scout Mentor pin was introduced in early 2004 in a gold-colored version. In early 2006 it was changed to a silver-colored antique finish to match the mother and father pins but in 2007 was changed back to gold-colored. In 2008, the National Eagle Scout Association (NESA) introduced a knot recognizing those Eagle Scouts who are life members of NESA; it uses the standard knot emblem with a silver border.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the time}} of the first awards in 1940, fewer than 1000 Distinguished Service Awards have been presented. This alone is a {{testament}} to its high standard of excellence. The award is a sterling silver arrowhead, bearing an arrow pointing upward and to the wearer's right, suspended from a white neck-ribbon upon which are embroidered red arrows (the first awards were suspended from a forest green ribbon– the current ribbon has been in use since the 1960s). A white <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> embroidered upon red cloth is available for uniform wear, and a miniature silver arrowhead lapel pin is available for civilian wear.|$|E
25|$|The award {{given by}} the {{religious}} organization consists of a unique medal for each program— usually only worn on formal occasions. The award is also recognized by the wear of an embroidered <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> emblem— silver on purple for youth and purple on silver for adults. The knot emblem is universal in {{that it does not}} represent any specific religion or religious award program. Each medal is designed and produced by the religious institution, while the knot emblems are produced by the BSA. Many Protestant churches use The PRAY Program, formerly God and Country, series consisting of God and Me, God and Family, God and Church, and God and Life; although they use the same program, the medals are unique in design according to each denomination.|$|E

If within the time limit the knot was successfully executed, the score was the time actually used (1 – 300).

25|$|The WOSM emblem and {{membership}} badge is the World Scout Emblem, a purple, circular logo with a fleur-de-lis in the center, {{surrounded by a}} length of rope tied with a reef knot (also called a <b>square</b> <b>knot).</b> Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts {{on the path to}} service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law. The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law. The bond {{at the base of the}} fleur-de-lis symbolizes the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement.|$|E

The requirements include an Eagle Scout Service Project where the Scout must further demonstrate service and leadership. Eagle Scouts are recognized with a medal and a cloth badge that visibly recognizes {{the accomplishments of}} the Scout. Eagle Palms are a further recognition, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements. Typically adult volunteers who have received the Eagle award as a youth wear a smaller patch depicting a <b>square</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{right-hand}} court of Kenilworth Castle {{is occupied by}} the castle garden. For most of Kenilworth's history {{the role of the}} castle garden, used for entertainment, would have been very distinct from that of the surrounding chase, used primarily for hunting. From the 16th century onwards there were elaborate knot gardens in the base court. The gardens today are designed to reproduce as closely as possible the primarily historical record of their original appearance in 1575, with a steep terrace along {{the south side of the}} gardens and steps leading down to eight <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> gardens. In Elizabethan gardens [...] "the plants were almost incidental", and instead the design focus was on sculptures, including four wooden obelisks painted to resemble porphyry and a marble fountain with a statue of two Greek mythological figures. A timber aviary contains a range of birds. The original garden was heavily influenced by the Italian Renaissance garden at Villa d'Este.|$|E

One third of the tendon was passed through the Endobutton CL loop and the remaining two thirds was folded onto itself and the free end with whip stitch was secured to the Endobutton CL loop with a surgical knot consisting of four <b>square</b> <b>knots.</b> Luggage tag stitch {{was placed on the}} folded end to facilitate graft holding (Fig. 1).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The stick {{index of}} a knot {{is the least}} number of line {{segments}} required to build the knot in space. We define two analogous 2 -dimensional invariants, the planar stick index, which is the least number of line segments in the plane to build a projection, and the spherical stick index, which is the least number of great circle arcs to build a projection on the sphere. We find bounds on these quantities in terms of other knot invariants, and give planar stick and spherical stick constructions for torus knots and for compositions of trefoils. In particular, unlike most knot invariants,we show that the spherical stick index distinguishes between the granny and <b>square</b> <b>knots,</b> and that composing a nontrivial knot with a second nontrivial knot need not increase its spherical stick index. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Claire Zeisler (April 18, 1903 - September 30, 1991) was a noted American fiber {{artist who}} {{expanded}} the expressive qualities of knotted and braided threads, pioneering large-scale freestanding sculptures in this medium. Throughout her career Zeisler sought to create [...] "large, strong, single images" [...] with fiber. Zeisler's non-functional structures were constructed using traditional weaving and avant-garde off the loom {{techniques such as}} <b>square</b> <b>knotting,</b> wrapping, and stitching. Zeisler preferred to work with natural materials such as jute, sisal, raffia, hemp, wool, and leather. The textiles were often left un-dyed, evidence of Zeisler's preference for natural coloration that emphasized the fiber itself. When she used color, however, Zeisler gravitated towards red. Her work is influenced by and has influenced fiber artists in the 1960s and 70s such as Kay Sekimachi, Barbara Shawcroft, Lenore Tawney, Magdalena Abakanowicz, and Sheila Hicks.|$|R
