40|$|Legumes are {{characterized}} as keeping stable nutrient supply under nutrient-limited conditions. However, few studies examined the legumes' stoichiometric advantages over other plants across various taxa in natural ecosystems. We explored differences in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry of different tissue types (leaf, stem, and root) between N 2 -fixing legume <b>shrubs</b> and non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs</b> from 299 broadleaved deciduous shrubland sites in northern China. After excluding effects of taxonomy and environmental variables, these two functional groups differed considerably in nutrient regulation. N concentrations and N:P ratios were higher in legume <b>shrubs</b> than in non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs.</b> N concentrations were positively correlated between {{the plants and}} soil for non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs,</b> but not for legume <b>shrubs,</b> indicating a stronger stoichiometric homeostasis in legume <b>shrubs</b> than in non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs.</b> N concentrations were positively correlated among three tissue types for non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs,</b> but not between leaves and non-leaf tissues for legume <b>shrubs,</b> demonstrating that N concentrations were more dependent among tissues for non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs</b> than for legume <b>shrubs.</b> N and P concentrations were correlated within all tissues for both functional groups, but the regression slopes were flatter for legume <b>shrubs</b> than non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs,</b> implying that legume <b>shrubs</b> were more P limited than non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs.</b> These results address significant differences in stoichiometry between legume <b>shrubs</b> and non-N 2 -fixing <b>shrubs,</b> and indicate the influence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) on plant stoichiometry. Overall, N 2 -fixing legume <b>shrubs</b> are higher and more stoichiometrically homeostatic in N concentrations. However, due to excess uptake of N, legumes may suffer from potential P limitation. With their N advantage, legume <b>shrubs</b> could be good nurse plants in restoration sites with degraded soil, but their P supply should {{be taken care of}} during management according to our results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{the survey}} {{it was found}} the total 30 numbers of <b>shrubs</b> in and around Rourkela which is locally {{available}} and used {{by the people of}} the villages. All the 30 dicot <b>shrubs</b> belong to 18 families. Among the <b>shrubs</b> studied, Calotropis gigantea, Vitex negundo, Lawsonia inermis were of highly medicinal values. The other remaining <b>shrubs</b> were also found with medicinal values for different diseases. Out of the 30 <b>shrubs,</b> most of the plants were used for cough, cold and fever. Then these <b>shrubs</b> are also used for malaria, dysentery, skin diseases, eye problems, and also for other diseases...|$|R

5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of <b>shrub</b> that grows in southwest Western Australia. An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7ft) high, but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading <b>shrub.</b> First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E
5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody <b>shrub</b> of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as a dense <b>shrub</b> up to 2m (7ft) tall, has serrated leaves and unusual red, pendent (hanging) inflorescences which are generally hidden in the foliage. First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus.|$|E
5|$|Banksia lemanniana, {{commonly}} known as the yellow lantern banksia or Lemann's banksia, is a species of woody <b>shrub</b> of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as an open <b>shrub</b> or small tree to five metres (15ft) high with stiff serrated leaves, and unusual hanging inflorescences. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning grey and developing the characteristic large woody follicles. It occurs within and just east of the Fitzgerald River National Park on the southern coast of the state. Banksia lemanniana is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.|$|E

40|$|Published by International Association For Vegetative ScienceQuestion: How do two <b>shrubs</b> with {{contrasting}} lifehistory characteristics influence {{abundance of}} dominant plant taxa, species richness and aboveground biomass of grasses and forbs, litter accumulation, nitrogen pools and mineralization rates? How are these <b>shrubs</b> ??? and thus {{their effects on}} populations, communities and ecosystems ??? distributed spatially across the landscape? Location: Coastal hind-dune system, Bodega Head, northern California. Methods: In each of 4 years, we compared vegetation, leaf litter and soil nitrogen under canopies of two native <b>shrubs</b> ??? Ericameria ericoides and the nitrogen-fixing Lupinus chamissonis ??? with those in adjacent open dunes. Results: At the population level, density and cover of the native forb Claytonia perfoliata and the exotic grass Bromus diandrus were higher under <b>shrubs</b> than in shrub-free areas, whereas they were lower under <b>shrubs</b> for the exotic grass Vulpia bromoides. In contrast, cover of three native moss species was highest under Ericameria and equally low under Lupinus and shrub-free areas. At community level, species richness and aboveground biomass of herbaceous dicots was lower beneath <b>shrubs,</b> whereas no pattern emerged for grasses. At ecosystem level, areas beneath <b>shrubs</b> accumulated more leaf litter and had larger pools of soil ammonium and nitrate. Rates of nitrate mineralization were higher under Lupinus, followed by Ericameria and then open dune. At landscape level, the two <b>shrubs</b> ??? and their distinctive vegetation and soils ??? frequently had uniform spatial distributions, and the distance separating neighbouring <b>shrubs</b> increased as their combined sizes increased. Conclusions: Collectively, {{these data suggest that}} both <b>shrubs</b> serve as ecosystem engineers in this coastal dune, having influences at multiple levels of biological organization. Our data also suggest that intraspecific competition influenced the spatial distributions of these <b>shrubs</b> and thus altered the distribution of their effects throughout the landscape...|$|R

5|$|The {{second most}} {{prevalent}} hunting strategy observed is hover gleaning, {{in which the}} tit-tyrant flies upwards from its perch and then hovers midair while grabbing prey from the vegetation.

Prey can be grabbed either close to the bird's perch or at a short distance, which often requires the bird to pursue its prey. When pairs flycatch cooperatively, one bird quietly lurks within the <b>shrub</b> while the other snatches nearby insects; after about a dozen attacks, the birds switch positions.|$|E
