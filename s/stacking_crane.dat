40|$|International {{transportation}} is rapidly growing. Even {{during the recent}} recession, trade growth percentages world-wide exceeded 5 - 10 %. As a consequence, container handling capacity is rapidly growing as well. Larger vessels, bigger container terminals: {{it appears to be}} an on-going process of which the limits have not yet been reached. At the same time, there is an increasing emphasis on cost and environmental control, which forces terminal operators to search for innovative solutions. Solutions that require less space and cost less per handled container. Here robotization and automation come into play, as they allow reducing labour by a significant amount, and allow decreasing the space usage of a terminal by percentages up to 50 %. However, this comes at a cost: the terminals that have implemented large-scale robotization and automation, have suffered from lower productivity than aimed for, as well as significant start-up problems. Many of these problems are on behalf of the terminal control software, as case research has shown us. In detail, we analysed the establishment of the ECT-DSL terminal in Rotterdam, which among others showed that: ? The occurrence rate of system failures had been underestimated, which led to inefficient recovery procedures. ? The time pressure in the project led to a focus on getting the system to run, instead of realising the functional specifications. This caused much of the specified functionality not to be implemented. ? The interfaces between various control system components were a result of a negotiation process between various design groups, instead of a rational architecture design. ? The terminal was used in a different way than planned by the terminal operator. ? The terminal was not designed from a holistic point of view, which led to sub-optimisation and components that did not work properly together. Besides, literature and other recent case studies taught us that: ? A large gap exists between functional design of automated terminals and the technical design and software realisation. ? There is a lack of interaction between the design of robotized equipment and its control software, leading to sub-optimisation of each component. Even the equipment design is fragmented, which leads to different solutions for similar problems. ? Too little attention is paid to the interaction between the operator of the automated system and the system. ? A gap exists between aggregate, strategic targets, like throughput volumes and vessel service times, and operational, day-to-day, hour-to-hour operational targets, such as quay crane productivity and truck service times. ? There are no tools available to provide insight into the operation of automated equipment and/or automated terminals, including solutions for process control systems. ? A common-off-the-shelve process control system (PCS) for automated terminals does not exist (yet), which increases the risk of realising an automated terminal. ? There is a lack of integration between cost analysis tools and performance analysis tools. ? Current design approaches do not address the activities after commissioning, apart from monitoring and post-evaluation. Thus, the container handling industry and in particular container terminals, are arrived at a point where new solutions are required; solutions that provide higher performance at lower cost and less space usage. Here, robotization and large-scale automation is the way to go. However, up to now, robotized terminal development has suffered from problems during and after the design-engineering process. Therefore, we defined the following objective for our research: To develop an approach for designing robotized, marine container terminals, which addresses the specific characteristics of such terminals, and considers the specific properties of terminal environments. We have explored and pursued this objective within the boundaries of marine, robotized container terminals. In our design process, we focus on the reduction of risk of development of robotized terminals, and intend to include the innovative nature within the design-engineering process. The research methodology follows the inductive hypothetic cycle. Based on inductive case studies we have designed a framework of guidelines, and developed based on these guidelines an approach for designing robotized container terminals. The approach is accompanied by an extensive suite of (simulation) models that we developed and applied in many projects (see Dobner et al. 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004). The model suite has a building-block based architecture (Verbraeck et al., 2002), which basically means that each component is defined by its interface, whereas the implementation internally may vary according to the scope of the analysis for which the model is used. Throughout the design process, the interfaces remain unchanged, but the behaviour may change, independent of the implementation of other components. The approach and model suite have been applied in a number of case studies during which we have gained experience with its applicability and contribution to the design process and the suite of models. We have also questioned an expert panel on the main guidelines about their usefulness. As a starting point for our approach we chose a simulation approach (Sol, 1982), which {{has proven to be a}} solid problem solving approach for complex problems. The approach we have designed is founded on four main activities within the design-engineering process: ? Functional design ? Technical design ? Implementation ? Commissioning and operations. In each activity we propose applying a simulation approach, which means that for design and engineering issues a problem solving approach is used. This approach heavily relies on the use of models, especially simulation models. For this purpose we developed a model suite that may support the entire design-engineering process until the terminal has been commissioned. Even during operations, the model suite may be used for fine-tuning, or problem solving when the operational conditions change. The basis of the approach consists of a framework of guidelines, which are the following: ? Using an object-oriented world-view. ? Applying a holistic, layered view on the terminal processes. ? Mirroring the real systemâs architecture into the modelâs architecture. ? Taking uncertainty and process variability into account. ? Using the operational processes as a leitmotiv for the design. ? Integrating the design of manual operations and automated operations. ? Integrating hardware and software design. ? Defining comprehensive and measurable objectives to assess the design. ? Basing the decisions within the design process on performance measurements. ? Continuing monitoring and measuring after commissioning. These guidelines have been elaborated into a detailed approach, including a stepwise, iterative approach to design a terminal, supported by a model suite that can be applied during the various activities, providing a way to manage the process. The design process consists of the following main steps: ? Defining the function of the terminal, the throughput capacity, and the services the terminal should provide. ? Designing the terminalâs key components, i. e. quay wall length, terminal geometry, layout of the stack, handling system, and logistical control concept. ? Designing the equipment and the process control system. After the functional design of the terminalâs components, they can be further detailed into the technical design (and specification). Subsequently, they are built (hardware) and implemented (software). After the implementation, commissioning takes place to verify whether every component works as it should. If this is successful, operations may start, during which a period of fine-tuning will take place. The entire process, here described in a nutshell, is completely performed following a simulation approach. This means that in all activities the use of models to evaluate and assess the quality in terms of the objectives of the terminal â at various levels of detail. During the functional design, the typical questions to be answered are to determine the right quay length, the required number of quay cranes, the required storage capacity, and the rail and gate capacity. Subsequently, the handling system is selected by assessing various alternatives, and the logistical control concept is being developed to match with the handling system. During the technical design, the process control system (or terminal operating system â TOS) is designed at a more detailed level, prototyping control algorithms, specifying the parameters, and configuring the terminal. As for most robotized terminals, there is no common-off-the-shelf software yet; much of it has to be designed and developed. During the realisation and implementation work, a simulation approach is used to provide a test-environment for components, i. e. equipment and software components. Because during this process, components become available piece by piece, the models may provide the remainder. This can be the rest of the TOS, or the real-life input from operators, or the equipment, or the representation of arrivals of vessels and/or trucks at the terminal. The model system provides an environment, manageable by the designers to create realistic circumstances to try out and test, especially from a performance point of view. During commissioning and operations, a simulation approach may be used to find bottlenecks, to perform quick analyses in case something appears not to work as planned. It may also fulfil a role as yardstick for the production software, as the software should provide the same performance level as the model system under the same conditions. Throughout this process, a suite of models is used that has an architecture similar to the real systemâs architecture. This makes it possible to exchange model components with real components, and to link various modes of implementation to each other without needing to change any of them. The approach has been applied in various cases. In the software re-design and replacement project at ECT, the approach so-far has been applied to support the functional design, technical design, and software implementation. The research can be classified as action research as we have been involved in the process ourselves. However, we have found the approach well applicable in terms of finding the solutions that contribute to the terminalâs objectives, and in terms of finding the problems in the software that may hamper performance during the operation. Besides, the feedback from the functional design teams and the software development teams has been very positive so-far. The second case, in which the approach has been applied, is the design of a high density <b>stacking</b> <b>crane,</b> an overhead bridge crane. Here, the simulation approach has supported an integrated design of all components of the <b>stacking</b> <b>crane.</b> The crane has been modelled â both on behalf of equipment kinematics, as well as control software rules - at a very detailed level. The result was that many components could be optimized from a holistic point of view, i. e. aiming at the craneâs performance as part of an entire terminal system. This approach has saved a significant amount of money and has led to a more productive crane. Finally, the approach has been discussed, via a remote expert survey, with various experts on behalf of container terminal and/or the use of simulation. Most of the concepts that underpin the approach are considered a contribution to the quality of the design-engineering process. As a result the research has led to the following conclusions with regard to the research questions: ? In order to create an effective simulation approach, the models need to represent the TOS in particular, because the functionality of the TOS is a critical success factor. Representing the TOS of an automated terminal means â as compared to the representation of the TOS at manned terminals â the modelling of the software that controls the automated equipment, i. e. routing, collision avoidance, deadlock avoidance, et cetera. On top of the representation of the functionality of the TOS, it is also important to represent the technical behaviour of the TOS, i. e. response times, asynchronous behaviour, and limited possibilities to optimize decisions. ? In order to reduce the risk of automation in terms of performance loss in the operation, the approach we propose focuses on the achievement of the performance goals throughout the process, i. e. including the development and realisation processes. Secondly, our approach proposes to test software in an early stage by linking it to a realistic test environment containing the specific dynamic elements that make an operation at a container terminal so complicated. As such, complex interaction can be found and dealt with as early as possible. Thirdly, the simulation environment allows for testing the system including the interaction with an operator. ? In order to ensure that the insight provided by the simulation approach during the process is correct, the models need to be valid. In cases where a system of a novel nature is built, especially on behalf of the TOS, the simulation can be considered a prototype of the TOS. However, during the implementation, one has to be sure that the software is built after the prototype, either by working closely together with the software supplier, or by developing a detailed software specification combined with performance requirements based on the prototype and the achieved performance levels in the design phase. ? The design approach should be independent of the technology of the solutions that are designed, compared, and assessed, to assure a comparison in the same formats and driven by the same set of variables. The set of guidelines we propose appears valid for any container terminal design, as most variables are similar to any container terminal design project. On top of the model suite we developed as part of this research, it may require additional model development in case of a completely new container terminal design. Currently most of the common handling systems at container terminals have been covered, but as technology progresses, new systems may arise. However, the basic structure of the model environment is not likely to change, just as the function of a container terminal is not likely to change. Therefore, we may presume that the model environment will be able to depict future container terminal systems as well. With regard to applying a simulation approach throughout the entire design-engineering process, the following concluding observations can be made: ? First, we experienced that simulation is still associated to a large extent with indicative sayings rather than accurate assessments, which would make them principally unsuited for precise tasks such as prototyping and/or testing of software. However, we argue this not to be true for the model systems that we developed during our research, which contain a high level of detail to represent operations at a container terminal with sufficient realism to provide the possibility to prototype software components. This is an approach that is â based literature review â not often followed (see e. g. Wysk, 2001), which also contributes to the fact that a simulation approach is not commonly used for purposes and/or decisions to be taken further in the design process. ? Secondly, a simulation approach requires additional time, especially in the beginning of the project. This additional time is invested with the promise of a return on investment by means of better solutions that reduce the risk of the investment. However, the time needed, is not always available. Especially during the development of software, the time it takes to provide the feedback, may be longer than feasible, which leads to decisions made on perceptions rather than scientific analysis. ? Thirdly, the professional environment within container terminals can be characterised as primarily focussed on operations. Although we observe a trend of an increasing level of education within the managerial staff of container terminals, many positions are still occupied by people that come from operations. These people are less trained in using scientific approaches when solving problems, finding bottlenecks and taking decisions: they rather depend on observations in the operations. Although this leads to good results in many cases, the risk of taking the wrong solution, or a solution that is less effective than expected, is relatively large. Moreover, when it concerns solutions of a novel nature, as is the case in robotized container terminals, experience from the past is not always the best advisor. In the two test cases â as well as many other projects we carried out over the last years -, we have gathered concrete experiences with most of the guidelines as proposed in our design approach: ? The approach proved applicable to new developments, terminal extensions, and terminal improvement programmes. The scope and the set of feasible solutions are determined by the type of project, but in terms of the methodology, we conclude that a simulation approach from start to finish appears to be viable. Even in projects where product-based TOS software is being implemented, many questions have to be answered, and many uncertainties concerning performance and technical robustness remain to be answered during the design and implementation process. ? A crucial contribution of a simulation approach in the context of an entire design-engineering project appears to be the see-throughs that have to be made, when creating the functional design. This process of elaboration on specific solutions â these may be equipment specifications, but also software components or algorithms - provides not only feedback to the functional design; it also provides an outlook to the technical design in terms of a prototype. Especially when the prototype (within the simulation environment) is built in accordance with the architecture of the real system â both hardware and software -, it can provide useful input to the technical specification and the implementation. ? Said prototyping functionality by means of simulation models is of high added value because most terminals are similar, which allows for re-use of components in the model suite. Here, a building block based approach appears to be valuable, as it allows changing components internally without affecting its interface. ? Our initial choice to apply a building block based architecture of our model suite has proven to be very valuable to enable the support throughout the design-engineering process. It clearly reduces development time, and therefore reduces the response time whenever a question pops up, especially during the software development. It also allows for a stable architecture of the model system during the process, where in the beginning a more aggregate behaviour is modelled, which is more detailed in later stages. However, the interface of each component remains unchanged. For particular purposes, it may even be the case that some components are applied in a detailed implementation, whereas others are present in a more aggregated mode. This significantly reduces development time, and speeds up the experimentation. ? The use of a simulation approach fosters continuous attention for performance issues. As every project is under time pressure, it is common that during implementation/realisation the focus of the people involved â including the managerial level â moves from the functional requirements to the basic requirement of getting the terminal running. The attention for performance issues is then deliberately delayed to a later point in time. However, this may cause changing things at this later point in time to be impossible, because of decisions made to bring the system to work. When a model system is available allowing the people involved to assess whether these decisions would affect performance, different solutions can be sought and decisions can be carried out knowing the consequences. Of course, it is essential to make sure that this model system is valid and trustworthy for these kinds of assessments. ? In addition to the previous point, the simulation approach can not only be used to keep the focus on performance (parallel to getting the system to work), but it also can be used to test the system under all kinds of operational circumstances. This means that the likelihood of huge performance losses in the case of break-downs, or other disrupting factors becomes less, herewith reducing the risk for the terminal operator. When the results of these tests are shared with the people that will operate the terminal after going live, the negative effects are likely to be smaller during the start-up of operations. ? A prerequisite to the success of the approach proposed in this research is the cooperation and coordination between the simulation group and the software engineering team. We have experienced that this process is not always easy because of two reasons. The main reason is the difference in objectives. The prototype in the simulation environment is built to assess the contribution to performance, rather than to develop a piece of software that can be used in an operational environment. Although the two can go together, it is not always the case, which may lead to a solution that works perfectly in the model system, but difficult to transfer to the production software. The second reason is the concurrency between the simulation approach and the actual software engineering and development. As the simulation approach continues during th...|$|E

Stacking rules that take the workload of the automated <b>stacking</b> <b>cranes</b> into account outperform rules that do not. The experiments conducted with the simulation model show that it can capture the amount of detail required and that it is flexible enough to support the evaluation of the stacking rules. ...|$|R

The scheduling model consists of the assignment of jobs to resources and the temporal arrangement of the jobs subject to precedence constraints and sequence-dependent setup times. We demonstrate how the model {{can be applied to}} solve several different real-world problems from container terminals in the port of Hamburg (Germany). We consider scheduling problems for straddle carriers, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), <b>stacking</b> <b>cranes,</b> and workers who handle reefer containers. Subsequently, we discuss a simple dispatching heuristic as well as a more advanced genetic algorithm for the general model. Based on a tailored generator for experimental data, we examine the performance of the heuristics in a computational study. We obtain promising results that suggest that the genetic algorithm is well suited for application in practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{horizontal}} handling transport in automated container terminals {{is not fully}} consistent {{in comparison with the}} automation of <b>stacking</b> <b>cranes</b> at the storage yard. Often the decision of automated system that connects the berth with the yard area is not clear and terminal operators tend to use not automated systems (straddle-carrier systems). The goal of this paper is providing an economical analysis to figure out under which conditions an automated horizontal transport is more efficient than a straddle-carrier. The study provided several simulation models to calculate the optimal equipment necessary to connect storage and berth subsystems in a maritime container terminal in fully automated and semi-automated scenarios. For that purpose, the data from the semi automated container terminal at Port of Barcelona has been used. After a cost analysis, some guidelines on what might be the best alternative considering labor costs, throughput movements per quay crane and year and different quay cranes productivities are provided.

40|$|The {{containerized}} trade market is growing rapidly with the uprising of the Far East. Container ports {{worldwide should be}} responsive by developing tools to handle these massive volumes of containers in order to retain their level of competitiveness. One of the areas in a container terminal that is highly affected by {{the increase in the}} demand of containers is the stack. The stack is used to temporarily store containers upon further transport to their destination. This study is concerned with scheduling sea and landside storages and retrievals in a stack with two cooperating automated <b>stacking</b> <b>cranes</b> working in a single block. We present a mathematical model to minimize the makespan for both cranes. Both an algorithm to derive a lower bound for the makespan and a simulated-annealing based heuristic are proposed to efficiently solve the problem.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{container}} terminal operations and logistics have {{kept pace with}} technological development. On the DELTA terminals in the port of Rotterdam, state-of-the-art quay cranes, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV's) and Automated <b>Stacking</b> <b>Cranes</b> (ASC's) - co-ordinated by computerized control â are working in concert to achieve the necessary service levels for present day carriers. The automated {{container terminal}} with its highly mechanized features and sophisticated control is, we believe, the direction for the future. Not only in situations where skilled labour is scarce and expensive, but in general where reliability, flexibility, and superior performance are required. In high throughput situations with adequate pre-arrival information, the extra capital costs will rapidly be offset by lower operational costs and faster turnaround times.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{containers}} shipped through ports has increased substantially {{in recent years and}} has stimulated research and development of ways to improve storage yard operations. The productivity of a portÃ¢ s storage yard depends, in part, on the cranes that are working in storage blocks. Each crane follows a route described primarily by the order to move each container that enters or leaves a block and the position to stack each container in the block. Each container that leaves (enters) the block must be unloaded (loaded) in a limited capacity transfer point before (after) a given time. This thesis is the first to develop Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) to prescribe routes for one and two equal sized Automated <b>Stacking</b> <b>Cranes</b> (ASCs) in a single block working with straddle carriers to load and unload containers from the transfer points. Using real world data, we construct test problems varying both the number of container bays (length) and excess capacity of each block. We find one ASC working alone over four hours requires up to 70 % more time than two ASCs working together to accomplish the same required container movements. ILP solution time is typically only a few seconds...|$|R
40|$|This work tackles {{the problem}} of {{controlling}} operations at an automated container terminal. In the context of large supply chains, {{there is a growing}} trend for increasing productivity and economic efficiency. New optimization models and algorithms are provided for scheduling and routing equipment that is moving containers in a quay area, loading/unloading ships, transporting them via Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to Automated <b>Stacking</b> <b>Cranes</b> (ASCs), organizing them in stacks. In contrast with the majority of the approaches in the related literature, this work tackles two dynamics of the system, a discrete dynamic, characteristic of the maximization of operations efficiency, by assigning the best AGV and operation time to a set of containers, and a continuous dynamic of the AGV that moves in a geographically limited area. As an assumption, AGVs can follow free range trajectories that minimize the error of the target time and increase the responsiveness of the system. A novel solution framework is proposed in order to tackle the two system dynamics. Various metaheuristic algorithms are tested to solve the problem in a near-optimal way. Computational experiments are presented in order to show the feasibility of the proposed framework on a practical case study, and to assess the performance of advanced scheduling and routing algorithms on numerous system settings. </p...|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Konecranes {{launched}} the world's first hybrid reach stacker for container handling. Its lifting capacity is 45 tons {{and it will}} cut fuel consumption by around 10 litres per hour. In March 2013 Konecranes launched a Remote Monitoring and Reporting tool, TRUCONNECT. It allows lift truck operators to track the usage, efficiency and productivity of their lift trucks through a remote connection. The data is transmitted wirelessly to the Konecranes Remote Data Center, where it is analysed and compiled in online views and reports, accessible 24/7 through a password-protected customer portal. In June 2013, Konecranes launched a new Automated RTG (ARTG) system. It copes with wide range of surface variations in RTG container yards. In November 2013, Konecranes developed an auto start-stop feature that turns off the lift truck engine when it idles {{for a period of}} time. This function helps reduce fuel consumption by 5-15% along with CO2 emissions. In 2013 Konecranes got a contract to deliver the first automated container yard for Indonesia state owned terminal operator, Indonesia Port Corporations, PT Pelabuhan Indonesia III (Pelindo III).

40|$|We study an {{automated}} container terminal in which Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) {{are used to}} internally transport containers and Automated <b>Stacking</b> <b>Cranes</b> (ASCs) to store and retrieve containers. In designing container terminals, the terminal management has to consider the choice for interrelated AGV and ASC dispatching rules and {{the layout of the}} stack. In this paper, we, therefore, examine the joint decision problem of dispatching containers to AGVs, selecting ASCs and the layout of the stock. In choosing a certain combination of dispatching rules and layout, we have considered criteria, such as, unloading times of a ship, number of vehicles required and utilisation of equipment. From this specific study, we can conclude that hardly any differences in unloading times can be obtained if we choose another combination of AGV and ASC dispatching rules. However, savings of approximately 20 % in the number of AGVs can be obtained, if we apply the nearest-AGV-first rule in combination with the cyclic ASC rule. The results of the layout experiments only show small variations in unloading times, but they justify further research to the options for ASCs to span a wider stack. From the sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded that Quay Cranes should be distributed as evenly as possible over the stip and that twin-load AGVs can be used to obtain significant savings in unloading times and up to 50 % reductions in the number of AGVs required.

40|$|Containerized {{transportation}} {{has become}} {{an essential part of}} the intermodal freight transport. Millions of containers pass through container terminals on an annual basis. Handling a large number of containers arriving and leaving terminals by different modalities including the new mega-size ships significantly affects the performance of terminals. Container terminal operators are always looking for new technologies and smart solutions to maintain efficiency. They need to know how different operations at the terminal interact and affect the performance of the terminal as a whole. Among all operations, the stacking area is of special importance since almost every container must be stacked in this area for a period of time. If the stacking operations of the terminal are not well managed, then the response time of the terminal significantly increases and consequently the performance decreases. In this dissertation, we propose, develop, and test optimization methods to support the decisions of container terminal operators in the stacking area. First, we study how to sequence storage and retrieval containers to be carried out by a single or two automated <b>stacking</b> <b>cranes</b> in a block of containers. The objective is to minimize the makespan of the cranes. Finally, we study how to minimize the expected number of reshuffles when incoming containers have to be stacked in a block of containers. A reshuffle is the removal of a container stacked on top of a desired container. Reshuffling containers is one of the daily operations at a container terminal which is time consuming and increases a ship's berthing time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{are three}} crucial {{resources}} at container terminals; the yard, cranes and the vehicles. The main {{objective of the}} terminal is the efficient use of these resources while performing different operations. The yard is a temporary storage area where containers remain until transported to their next location by truck, train or vessel. Containers are stacked {{on top of each}} other in order to utilize the yard space efficiently. However, <b>stacking</b> <b>cranes</b> can only directly access those containers at the top of the stack. As a result, reshuffling/shifting occurs, defined as an unproductive move of a container required to access another container stored underneath. We focus on increasing the efficiency of the yard via consideration of the container stacking optimization problem for transshipment, inbound and outbound containers at a container terminal. The objective of the problem is to minimize container storage and retrieval times through avoidance of reshuffles, resulting in more efficient loading/unloading operations, and in turn minimizing the dwell time of containers. The main inputs are the type, weight, discharge port/location, destined vessel/vehicle of the container, and the expected departure time. Different stacking policies are proposed in this study, and we also investigate the problem of allocating the transit container to outbound vessels to minimize dwell time at the terminal. Transit containers require multiple sea-trips to reach their final destination. Vessels departing from the terminal and destined for the same port may provide exchangeable trips for this type of container, based on their several attributes and capacity restrictions. We consider this problem taking into account several factors that affect container/trip allocation decisions. The solution of this problem also has implications for the stacking problem...|$|R

Problems discussed, are, for example: (i) the determination of the number of vehicles required to transport all loads in time (ii) scheduling of storage and retrieval requests. Techniques from Operations Research are used to model and solve above mentioned problems. Firstly, a polynomial time algorithm (minimum flow algorithm) is developed {{to solve the problem of}} the determination of the minimum number of vehicles to transport all loads at known time instants. An extension of this problem is the determination of the minimum number of vehicles required if every job has a time window. In this case, a release time and a due time are given for every job. This problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming model and a set partitioning model. A dynamic programming model is developed to solve the scheduling of retrieval and storage requests for a storage and retrieval machine working in multiple parallel aisles. All developed methods will be applied within a semi-automated container terminal. For the internal transportation of containers from ship to stack (storage) and vice versa and for inter terminal transport Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) will be used. Also stacking will be done in an automatic way by Automated <b>Stacking</b> <b>Cranes</b> (ASCs). Simulation studies are performed to test the methods developed...|$|R
