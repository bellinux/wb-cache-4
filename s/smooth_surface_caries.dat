40|$|To {{report the}} use of spectroscopic {{analysis}} of dental fluorescence excited with a blue InGaN laser diode operating at 405 nm. Method The spectra resulting from three classifications of <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> non-cavitated <b>caries</b> lesions (dull, shiny, brown) with 20 samples in each group were examined using the ratio of integrated fluorescence intensity in two spectral bands. Results All lesions demonstrated spectra which were significantly different from sound tooth structure. As expected, the ‘brown’ lesions demonstrated a significantly different spectral profile from the two white spot lesion classifications. Dull and shiny lesions had significantly different spectral measurements when examining {{the ratio of the}} integrated fluorescence in spectral bands between 480 – 500 and 620 – 640 nm.

40|$|Protection against <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> dental <b>caries</b> was {{investigated}} in fifteen young rhesus monkeys which were immunized subcutaneously with Streptococcus mutans serotype c in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Monkeys immunized with killed whole organisms developed significantly less caries than control animals. Monkeys immunized with pronase-treated cell walls developed significantly more caries than control animals while monkeys immunized with untreated cell walls showed no such enhancement of caries. Haemagglutinating and complement-fixing antibodies to cell walls and culture supernatant antigens (SN Ag) of S. mutans developed in the sera of all immunized animals to a similar degree. Antibodies to lipoteichoic acid and to an insoluble dextran preparation were found in all immunized animals and showed no relationship to the prevalence of caries. Antibodies to the serotype c polysaccharide were also found in animals immunized with whole cells and pronase-treated cell walls. However, precipitating antibody levels to partially purified antigens I/II and II, derived from SN Ag, but present also in cells, {{were related to the}} development of caries. Animals immunized with whole cells and with untreated cell walls developed a brisk antibody response to antigen I/II, while those immunized with pronase-treated cell walls responded more slowly. The results suggest that immunization may induce both caries reduction and enhancement, depending on the antibody response which is developed...|$|R
40|$|Three {{animal studies}} were {{performed}} to investigate {{the influence of the}} macromolecular structure of milk casein on caries incidence and the possible ecological changes of the oral microbiota by such casein fractions. Towards this end, rats were infected with mixed bacterial suspensions of Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176 and Actinomyces viscosus Ny 1. Various milk protein fractions were incorporated into carefully balanced powdered cariogenic diets to constitute the sole major protein component. Diets containing micellar casein had a pronounced and highly significant effect on almost all clinical and microbiological parameters examined. Both the formation of advanced dentinal fissure (B) and <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> (E) <b>caries</b> lesions was inhibited by diets containing micellar casein; this caries-inhibiting effect appeared to be due mainly to modifications within the plaque microbiota. The proportion of S. sobrinus in the oral cavity of rats was reduced (73 - 80 %) by micellar casein-containing preparations, whereas the A. viscosus population was increased. Both these microbiological parameters were always negatively correlated. This appears to be the first example of a food component other than dietary sugars, selectively modifying the composition of the dental plaque microbiota of rats {{in such a way as}} to reduce its pathogenic potential. It also demonstrates the importance of establishing a molecular basis for the role of food components, which prove to be beneficial to oral health...|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} dentistry {{proper treatment}} of caries lesions is {{highly dependent on}} diagnostic accuracy. Aim The present dissertation aimed at the evaluation and comparisons between several modem methods for caries detection and quantification. Methods The employed methods for detection and quantification of caries lesions may {{be divided into two}} categories, namely laser fluorescence based methods and radiographic methods. Laser fluorescence The performance of the DIAGNOdent device was studied in vitro with respect to its validity and reliability on quantification of both occlusal caries and <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries.</b> The diagnostic accuracy of DIAGNOdent on occlusal caries detection was compared with that of film radiography using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. A comparison was also performed between DIAGNOdent and Quantitative Laser/Light induced Fluorescence (QLF), a well established fluorescence-based technique, for quantification of <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries.</b> Furthermore, an in vivo study on QLF was carried out concerning its reproducibility and repeatability. Radiography Under the part of radiographic methods, a new color scale was developed that may improve visual perception as compared to the conventional gray scale and thereby improve caries detection. The new color scale was constructed by taking into consideration both physical properties of colors and psychological properties of the human visual system. Color-coded radiographs were compared with digital radiographs employing the so called perceptibility curve test. Then, color-coded radiographs were applied to the detection of approximal caries lesions, and the diagnostic accuracy of the colored radiographs was compared with that of black-and white radiographs {{as well as with the}} DIAGNOdent technique. An additional modem radiographic method that was included in the present research work was Tuned Aperture Computed Tomography (TACT®), which is a tomosynthetic technique. By generating a series of cross sectional images of an object and then combine them, the third dimension may be presented with the TACT® technique, which overcomes the drawback of conventional radiography that displays the three dimensional object in two dimensional images. TACT® imaging was used to assess occlusal caries detection and was compared with film radiography employing ROC analysis. Results In vitro studies of the DIAGNOdent method on occlusal and <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries</b> diagnosis showed that it is a reliable method in terms of both reproducibility and observer agreement. DIAGNOdent had a good correlation with histological examinations and had a higher diagnostic accuracy than film radiography on occlusal caries detection indicating that DIAGNOdent may be a very helpful tool for occlusal caries detection and quantification. For <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries</b> quantification, QLF had a higher correlation with mineral loss as compared to DIAGNOdent. A clinical reproducibility and repeatability study showed that QLF had an extremely high correlation coefficient between and within examiners. Thus, QLF proves to be a suitable method for longitudinal studies of mineral changes in caries lesions. Color-coded radiographs demonstrated a certain advantage over black-and-white radiographs based on the perceptibility curve test. However, this advantage did not result in a significant difference when applied to approximal caries detection. Here, perceptual leaming when observers were confronted with a new type of radiographs may have played an important part. TACT® had significantly higher diagnostic performance on occlusal caries detection as compared to film radiography. Conclusion It may be concluded that all the above modem methods have their own specific advantages over conventional methods. If properly applied and correctly interpreted these techniques should improve caries diagnosis and, therefore, the selection of proper treatment...|$|E

All of the serotype representatives successfully infected, colonized, and emerged in the oral ecology of animals, independent of the carbohydrate supplementation of the diet. However, the sucrose-containing diet supported higher percentages of S. mutans of all the serotypes in the plaque and greater amounts of plaque on the teeth. <b>Smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries</b> was essentially S. mutans dependent and sucrose dependent; fissure caries, although it was neither dependent on S. mutans infection nor sucrose consumption, was augmented by both.

40|$|A mutant of Streptococcus mutans 6715 HSR, {{which is}} {{defective}} in serotype antigen and designated C 307, {{was shown to}} exhibit full virulence on buccal, sulcal, and proximal surfaces {{similar to that of}} 6715 HSR. In addition, this bacterium caused significant decay on the lingual surfaces. Its colonial morphology and certain biochemical activities which may be related to caries production were distinct from those of 6715 HSR. This mutant adsorbed to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite beads in greater amounts and aggregated in the presence of either sucrose or dextran in excess of that seen with the parent strain. The abilities of C 307 to grow and to produce acid from sucrose and to adhere to glass surfaces were similar to that of 6715 HSR. Although revertants of C 307 exhibited biological activities and a content of serotype g antigen similar to that of 6715 HSR, the virulence pattern was still unlike the parent strain. These results suggest that the serotype g antigen is not required for the adherence of cells to <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> or for <b>caries</b> formation and that the loss of this antigen may alter the surface of cells causing enhanced ability of the cells to aggregate and to adsorb to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite beads...|$|R
40|$|Dental caries, a biofilm-related oral disease, is {{a result}} of {{disruption}} of the microbial ecological balance in the oral environment. Streptococcus mutans, {{which is one of the}} primary cariogenic bacteria, produces glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) that synthesize extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs). The EPSs, especially water-insoluble glucans, contribute to the formation of dental plaque, biofilm stability, and structural integrity, by allowing bacteria to adhere to tooth surfaces and supplying the bacteria with protection against noxious stimuli and other environmental attacks. The identification of novel alternatives that selectively inhibit cariogenic organisms without suppressing oral microbial residents is required. The goal of the current study is to investigate the influence of an oxazole derivative on S. mutans biofilm formation and the development of dental caries in rats, given that oxazole and its derivatives often exhibit extensive and pharmacologically important biological activities. Our data shows that one particular oxazole derivative, named 5 H 6, inhibited the formation of S. mutans biofilms and prevented synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides by antagonizing Gtfs in vitro, without affecting the growth of the bacteria. In addition, topical applications with the inhibitor resulted in diminished incidence and severity of both <b>smooth</b> and sulcal <b>surface</b> <b>caries</b> in vivo with a lower percentage of S. mutans in the animals' dental plaque compared to the control group (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Glucosyltransferases from Streptococcus mutans {{are thought}} to play an {{important}} role in bacterial adherence to the tooth surface. The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of the deletion of the gtfC gene, which encodes a glucosyltransferase that catalyses primarily the formation of insoluble glucan (mutan), on colonization of S. mutans in a mixed-species biofilm model of supragingival plaque. A gtfC deletion mutant of S. mutans UA 159 grew poorly in biofilms on a polystyrene surface in Todd-Hewitt medium containing sucrose, but biofilm formation in the semi-defined fluid universal medium (FUM) was not affected. The S. mutans gtfC mutant colonized with the same efficiency as the wild-type strain when grown together with five other species in a mixed-species biofilm on hydroxyapatite in a mixture of FUM and saliva with pulses of sucrose and showed the same ability to demineralize enamel in vitro. Colonization of mutant and wild-type strains was also equal in an association experiment in specific-pathogen-free rats. However, the gtfC mutant gave rise to more dentinal fissure lesions and <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries</b> than the wild-type strain; this could be caused by a change in diffusion properties as a result of to the lack of mutan...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus mutans is a {{principal}} etiologic agent {{in the development of}} dental caries due to its exceptional aciduric and acidogenic properties, and its ability to adhere and accumulate in large numbers on tooth surfaces in the presence of sucrose. Sucrose-dependent adherence is mediated by glucans, polymers of glucose synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferase (Gtf) enzymes. S. mutans makes several proteins that have the property of binding glucans. We hypothesized that three of these glucan-binding proteins (Gbps), Gbps A, C and D, contribute to the cariogenicity of S. mutans. A specific pathogen-free rat model was used to compare the cariogenicity of S. mutans UA 130 and a panel of mutants with individual or multiple gbp gene deletions. The mutants were also evaluated in vitro for properties related to cariogenicity, such as acidogenicity, aciduricity, and adhesion to glucan. Only a subset of Gbp mutants were attenuated for cariogenicity, with the combined loss of Gbps A and C most affecting <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries.</b> The attenuation of Gbp mutant strains was unlikely due to differences in acid-related properties since the mutants were at least as acidogenic and acid-tolerant as the parental strain. Additionally, loss of Gbps did not reduce adhesion to a pre-formed biofilm of S. sanguinis. Analyses of the caries data with in vitr...|$|E

Lack of rapid antibiotic sensitivity determination of the dental pathogen is a rate limiting step {{in the field of}} Dental Microbiology. Approach: The culture dependent analysis was used for the study of oral microflora from five healthy individuals as well as three caries infected buccal cavity (one with pit and fissure caries and two with <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries).</b> Results: The study revealed 101 - 106 times higher bacterial count in healthy buccal cavity. The molecular community analysis mostly revealed Klebsiella sp, Staphylococcus sp, Bacillius sp., Streptococcus sp. and Granulicatella sp in caries infected samples.

40|$|Previously, we have {{described}} peptide constructs from two regions of glucosyltransferase (GTF) of mutans streptococci. A putative catalytic {{site in the}} amino-terminal half of the molecule and a repeated glucan-binding site in the carboxyl-terminal half of GTF were the regions upon which sequences were based. The present study explored the effects of immunization with these peptide constructs (called CAT or GLU) and with streptococcal GTFs from Streptococcus sobrinus and S. mutans on immunological, microbiological, and disease parameters. Groups of immunized Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with either 10 (8) S. sobrinus 6715 or 10 (8) S. mutans SJ 32 organisms. Serum immunoglobulin G antibody levels, determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, to the respective peptide constructs and to the appropriate streptococcal GTF were significantly increased (after immunization) prior to infection {{and at the end}} of the experiment. Also, serum antibody from CAT-, GLU-, and S. sobrinus GTF-immunized rats inhibited S. sobrinus GTF-mediated insoluble glucan synthesis (all) and S. mutans GTF-mediated soluble glucan synthesis (all except anti-GLU) from sucrose. Immunization with the CAT or GLU peptide construct resulted in significantly reduced <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> and sulcal <b>caries</b> after infection with S. sobrinus. Sulcal dental caries after infection with S. mutans SJ 32 were also significantly reduced in CAT- and GLU-immunized rats.

40|$|In {{addition}} to occasional opportunistic colonization {{of the oral}} mucosa, Candida albicans is frequently found in carious dentin. The yeast’s potential to induce dental caries {{as a consequence of}} its pronounced ability to produce and tolerate acids was investigated. Eighty caries-active Osborne-Mendel rats were raised on an ampicillin-supplemented diet and exposed to C. albicans and/or Streptococcus mutans, except for controls. Throughout the 28 -day test period, the animals were offered the modified cariogenic diet 2000 a, containing 40 % various sugars. Subsequently, maxillary molars were scored for plaque extent. After dissection, the mandibular molars were evaluated for smooth surface and fissure caries. Test animals exposed to C. albicans displayed considerably more advanced fissure lesions (p < 0. 001) than non-exposed controls. While S. mutans yielded similar results, a combined association of C. albicans and S. mutans had no effect on occlusal caries incidence. Substituting dietary sucrose by glucose did not modify caries induction by C. albicans.

ECC {{is defined by the}} American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry as the presence of one or more decayed (non cavitated or cavitated), missing teeth (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth in a child up to 71 months of age or younger. Severe ECC (S-ECC) is any sign of <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries</b> seen in children younger than 3 years of age; from ages 3 to 5, 1 or more cavitated, missing (due to caries) or filled smooth surfaces in primary maxillary anterior teeth or decayed, missing or filled score of ≥ 4 (age 3), or ≥ 5 (age 4), or ≥ 6 (age 5) surfaces constitute SECC 2.

Because higher caries prevalence is associated with lower salivary concentrations of CA VI in humans, we tested whether CA VI protects enamel surfaces from caries induced by Streptococcus mutans, using Car 6 −/− mice, in which salivary CA VI expression is absent. We detected aberrant Car 6 type A transcripts in Car 6 −/− mice, likely targets for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Expression of the intracellular stress-induced isoform of CA VI encoded by type B transcripts was restricted to parotid and submandibular glands of wild type mice. The salivary function of Car 6 −/− mice was normal as assessed by the histology and protein/glycoprotein profiles of glands, salivary flow rates and protein/glycoprotein compositions of saliva. Surprisingly, total <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries</b> and sulcal caries in Car 6 −/− mice were more than 6 -fold and 2 -fold lower than in wild type mice after infection with S. mutans strain UA 159.

Histologic examination using special stains and polarized light revealed both initial and early initial stage enamel caries, as well as root <b>surface</b> <b>caries.</b> Knoop hardness measurements confirmed these findings, considered the first documented cases of feline caries...|$|R
40|$|Immature male rats fed a wheat flour-containing ration {{similar to}} diet 256 of McClure were retarded in growth and ex-hibited {{pathologic}} {{changes in the}} tibia and alveolar bone. A supplement of 8 % fish protein concentrate promoted an increment in body weight {{comparable to that of}} rats fed a natural food stock ration and pre-vented the changes in the tibia and alveolar bone. McClure ' and others 2 ' 3 have reported that immature rats fed a ration consisting of 80 % nonheat-processed whole wheat flour, 18 % dextrose, 2 % whole liver powder, and supplements of vitamins A, D, and E (diet 256) had retarded growth and, after 60 or 90 days, a high incidence of <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries.</b> It was also observed that rats fed this diet had extensive pathologic changes in the tibias and alveolar bone. 4 Diet 256 of McClure ' is deficient in a number of essen-tial nutrients. It is inadequate in total pro-tein, which is present at approximately an 11 % level in the ration, and is particularly low in the amino acid lysine. It is also defi-cient in calcium " and sodium, 3 which are present at levels of approximately 0. 03 % and 0. 01 % in the diet, respectively. In pre-liminary studies 5 in which fish protein con-centrate (FPC) was incorporated in diet 256 at a 8 % level in place of an equal amount of dextrose, the FPC supplement completely counteracted the growth retar-dation and prevented the pathologic changes in the tibias and alveolar bones of rats fed This investigation {{was supported in part by}} Alpin...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of an alcohol diet on Streptococcus of the mutans group and on dental caries in the oral cavity of rats. Forty animals were divided into 3 groups according to the following liquid diets: 20 % ethanol solution (Alcohol Group, AG), 27 % sucrose solution (Isocaloric Group, IG), and water (Control Group, CG). After 56 days, samples were collected and plated on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar to assess the number of colony forming units (CFU/mL) of Streptococcus of the mutans group. The animals were sacrificed and the jaws were removed in order to assess the occurrence of dental caries on the smooth and occlusal surfaces using stereomicroscopy. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test. The average numbers of CFU/mL (10 3) were: 8. 17 (AG), 9. 78 (IG), and 5. 63 (CG). There was no significant difference among the groups for the occurrence of occlusal caries. Regarding <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries,</b> in the upper jaw, the caries number in the IG (1. 58) was similar to that in the AG (2. 06) and in the CG (1. 14), and the number of caries in the AG was higher than in the CG; in the lower jaw there was significant difference among the 3 groups: AG (1. 14), IG (2. 00) and CG (0. 43). The diets with the alcohol and sucrose solutions presented a tendency of increasing the colonization by Streptococcus of the mutans group and of increasing the occurrence of smooth surface dental caries in rat molars when compared to the control diet...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Dental caries is {{a chronic}} disease worldwide, caused mainly by microbes. The orthograde {{approaches}} still remain {{the only option}} of treatment. Lack of rapid antibiotic sensitivity determination of the dental pathogen is a rate limiting step {{in the field of}} Dental Microbiology. Approach: The culture dependent analysis was used for the study of oral microflora from five healthy individuals as well as three caries infected buccal cavity (one with pit and fissure caries and two with <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> <b>caries).</b> Results: The study revealed 10 1 - 10 6 times higher bacterial count in healthy buccal cavity. The molecular community analysis mostly revealed Klebsiella sp, Staphylococcus sp, Bacillius sp., Streptococcus sp. and Granulicatella sp in caries infected samples. Microbial isolates from surface caries of one of the subjects (DS 5 and DS 6) showed resistance to most of the drugs except Polymyxin B, while Ampicillin resistance was common for all. Most of the consortia from both the healthy and infected individualsâ revealed presence of plasmids. Two step cultivation based antibiotic sensitivity detection gave consistent result within 18 - 20 h as opposed to the conventional 48 - 72 h. A model for oral application of antibiotic to tooth surface was worked out to inhibit demineralization. Conclusion/Recommendation: This study reports a rapid antibiotic sensitivity detection system for selection of treatment regime. It also proposes a model antibiotic applicator for treatment of surface caries. Detection of antibiotic sensitivity before administration of antibiotic can prevent misuse of antibiotic therapy leading to enhancement of multi drug resistance. The therapy conducted {{on the basis of the}} sensitivity data can prevent the demineralization and escaping of the isolates into the blood stream during tooth extraction...|$|E
