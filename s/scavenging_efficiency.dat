The simulated SEs of all species except nitric acid (HNO_ 3) are highly sensitive to the values specified for the fractions retained in ice when cloud water freezes.

Understanding such interaction is mandatory to improve model description of aerosol lifetime and ageing. We analyzed the aerosol–water interaction at high relative humidity during fog {{events in the}} Po Valley {{within the framework of}} the Agenzia Regionale per la Prevenzione e l'Ambiente (ARPA) – Emilia Romagna supersite project. For the first time in this area, the changes in particle chemical composition caused by fog are discussed along with changes in particle microphysics. During the experiment, 14 fog events were observed. The average mass <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> was 70 % for nitrate, 68 % for ammonium, 61 % for sulfate, 50 % for organics, and 39 % for black carbon. After fog formation, the interstitial aerosol was dominated by particles smaller than 200 nm D va (vacuum aerodynamic diameter) and enriched in carbonaceous aerosol, mainly black carbon and water-insoluble organic aerosol. For each fog event, the size-segregated <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> of nitrate and organic aerosol (OA) was calculated by comparing chemical species size distribution before and after fog formation. For both nitrate and OA, the size-segregated <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> followed a sigmoidal curve, with values close to zero below 100 nm D va and close to 1 above 700 nm D va. OA was able to affect <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> of nitrate in particles smaller than 300 nm D va. A linear correlation between nitrate scavenging and particle hygroscopicity (κ) was observed, indicating that 44 – 51 % of the variability of nitrate scavenging in smaller particles (below 300 nm D va) was explained by changes in particle chemical composition. The size-segregated scavenging curves of OA followed those of nitrate, suggesting that organic scavenging was controlled by mixing with water-soluble species. In particular, functional group composition and OA elemental analysis indicated that more oxidized OA was scavenged more efficiently than less oxidized OA. Nevertheless, the small variability of organic functional group composition during the experiment did not allow us to discriminate the effect of different organic functionalities on OA scavenging...|$|E

We differentiate riming- versus WBF-dominated in-cloud scavenging based on liquid water content (LWC) and temperature. Specifically, we implement an implied WBF parameterization using either temperature or ice mass fraction (IMF) in mixed-phase clouds based on field measurements. We find that at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland, and Abisko, Sweden, where WBF dominates in-cloud scavenging, including the WBF effect strongly reduces the discrepancies of simulated BC <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> and washout ratio against observations (from a factor of 3 to 10  % and from a factor of 4 – 5 to a factor of 2). However, at Zeppelin, Norway, where riming dominates, simulation of BC <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency,</b> BC air, and washout ratio become worse (relative to observations) when WBF is included. There is thus an urgent need for extensive observations to distinguish and characterize riming- versus WBF-dominated aerosol scavenging in mixed-phase clouds and the associated BC <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Our model results show that including the WBF effect lowers global BC <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency,</b> with a higher reduction at higher latitudes (8  % in the tropics and up to 76  % in the Arctic). The resulting annual mean BC air increases by up to 156  % at high altitudes and at northern high latitudes because of lower temperature and higher IMF. Overall, WBF halves the model–observation discrepancy (from − 65 to − 30  %) of BC air across North America, Europe, China and the Arctic. Globally WBF increases BC burden from 0. 22 to 0. 29 – 0. 35  mg m − 2  yr − 1, which partially explains the gap between observed and previous model-simulated BC burdens over land. In addition, WBF significantly increases BC lifetime from 5. 7 to [*]∼[*]  8  days. Additionally, WBF results in a significant redistribution of BC deposition in source and remote regions. Specifically, it lowers BC wet deposition (by 37 – 63  % at northern mid-latitudes and by 21 – 29  % in the Arctic), while it increases dry deposition (by 3 – 16  % at mid-latitudes and by 81 – 159  % in the Arctic). The resulting total BC deposition is lower at mid-latitudes (by 12 – 34  %) but higher in the Arctic (by 2 – 29  %). We find that WBF decreases BC snow at mid-latitudes (by [*]∼[*]  15  %) but increases it in the Arctic (by 26  %) while improving model comparisons with observations. In addition, WBF dramatically reduces the model–observation discrepancy of washout ratios in winter (from a factor of 16 to 4). The remaining discrepancies in BC air, BC snow and BC washout ratios suggest that in-cloud removal in mixed-phased clouds is likely still excessive over land...|$|E

From this work it is inferred that respirable dust is scavenged with relative difficulty by coagulation, condensation and gravitational settling. This added complexity means that predicting deposition from the basic theory is much more difficult, and we must rely to a greater extent on experimental data and empirically derived equations.

First, we analyze and simulate the first Amazon Basin-wide aircraft measurements of O 3 during both the dry-to-wet and wet-to-dry transition seasons. Extremely low background values were observed in remote regions in both seasons and in all regions during the wet-to-dry transition, while elevated O 3 was seen during the dry-to-wet transition {{to the east and}} south of Manaus, where biomass burning emissions of O 3 precursors were present. WRF-Chem simulations represent observed O 3 profiles in polluted conditions, but overestimate O 3 in clean conditions, despite lacking the predominant NO source from soil.

These gases may be scavenged by hydrometeors within the eruption column, and high uncertainties remain regarding the proportion of volcanic gases, which eventually reach the stratosphere. These are caused by the difficulties of directly sampling explosive volcanic eruption columns and {{by the lack of}} laboratory studies in the extreme parameter regime characterizing them. Using the nonhydrostatic nonsteady state plume model Active Tracer High Resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM), we simulated an explosive volcanic eruption. We examined the <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the climatically relevant gases within the eruption column. The low concentration of water in the plume results in the formation of relatively dry aggregates. More than 99 % of these are frozen because of their fast ascent to low-temperature regions. Consideration of the salinity effect increases the amount of liquid water by one order of magnitude, but the ice phase is still highly dominant. Consequently, the <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> for HCl is very low, and only 1 % is dissolved in liquid water. However, scavenging by ice particles via direct gas incorporation during diffusional growth is a significant process. The salinity effect increases the total <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> for HCl from about 50 % to about 90 %. The sulfur-containing gases SO 2 and H 2 S are only slightly soluble in liquid water; however, these gases are incorporated into ice particles with an efficiency of 10 to 30 %. Despite scavenging, more than 25 % of the HCl and 80 % of the sulfur gases reach the stratosphere because most of the particles containing these species are lifted there. Sedimentation of the particles would remove the volcanic gases from the stratosphere.

The behavior of gaseous species and their chemical transformation in clouds are difficult to observe experimentally given the complex nature of clouds. During a winter field campaign at the summit of the Puy de Dôme (central France, 1465 m a. s. l), we have deployed an experimental set-up to provide a quantification of phase partitioning of both organic (CH 3 COOH, HCOOH, H 2 C 2 O 4) and inorganic (NH 3, HNO 3, SO 2, HCl) species in clouds. We found that nitric and hydrochloric acids can be considered close to Henry's law equilibrium, within analytical uncertainty and instrumental errors. On another hand, for NH 3 and carboxylic acids, dissolution of material from the gas phase is kinetically limited and never reaches the equilibrium predicted by thermodynamics, resulting in significant sub-saturation of the liquid phase. On the contrary, S IV is supersaturated in the liquid phase, in addition to the presence of significant aerosol-derived S VI transferred through nucleation scavenging. Upon droplet evaporation, a significant part of most species, including S IV, tends to efficiently return back into the gas phase. Overall, gas contribution to the droplet solute concentration ranges from at least 48. 5 to 98 % depending on the chemical species. This is particularly important considering that aerosol <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are often calculated assuming a negligible gas-phase contribution to the solute concentration. Our study emphasizes the need to account for the in-cloud interaction between particles and gases to provide an adequate modeling of multiphase chemistry systems and its impact on the atmospheric aerosol and gas phases...|$|R
30|$|Response of gold {{nanoparticles}} exposure on growth, {{yield and}} expression profile of microRNA of A. thaliana {{has been studied}} [3]. A. thaliana exposed to 80 and 10  μg mL− 1 of gold nanoparticle showed flowering 15 and 5  days earlier than the non-treated plants. The number of seed per pod, the pod length and total number of seeds were much higher in plants treated with 10  μg mL− 1 of gold nanoparticle than those treated with 80  μg mL− 1. Increasing concentration of nanoparticles above 10  μg mL− 1 does not increase the growth or yield of the plants. Gold nanoparticle exposure of seedlings with 10 and 80  μg mL− 1 showed 3.54 - and 2.59 -folds higher inhibition of ROS which suggests the free radical <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency</b> of gold nanoparticle. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, namely ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase, was significantly increased.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Daily aerosol and wet-only {{precipitation}} {{samples were}} collected, between January 1992 and January 1994 at a permanent station established on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Collected aerosol and rain samples were analyzed for major ions {{and a host}} of trace elements using a combination of analytical techniques, including ion chromatography, atomic absorbtion spectrometry and instrumental neutron activation analysis. The results have demonstrated that concentrations of parameters studied are higher than corresponding concentrations measured in the western Mediterranean and western parts of the Black Sea due to longer transport distances to source regions of particles and precipitation scavenging from atmosphere. Elemental composition of aerosols and rain differ due to different scavenging efficiencies of elements associated with coarse and fine particles. Temporal behaviour of elements were explained by variations in source strengths and variations in <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|E
40|$|Electron {{transfer}} reactions between several electron donors, including common antioxidants such as ascorbate, reduced glutathione and trolox, and {{the lowest}} triplet excited state of Rose Bengal (RB) lead {{to the formation of}} free radicals that are capable of reducing molecular oxygen and redox-active metal ions. We studied RB-photosensitized redox reactions and the formation of hydroxyl radicals by direct electron spin resonance (ESR) and ESR-spin-trapping techniques respectively. Our data indicate that the free-radical pathway of RB-photosensitized oxidation reactions (PORs) can, under certain conditions, compete efficiently with the singlet oxygen route. The protective action of antioxidants in PORs may be compromised by their ability to serve as primary electron donors in photosensitized electron transfer. Owing to its metal ion sequestering ability and free-radical <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiency,</b> melanin exhibits powerful antioxidant action that may reduce the damaging efficacy of photodynamic phenomena in pigmented cells...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} an aerosol processing and evolution event from 21 – 22 July {{during the summer}} 2009 Field Intensive Study at Queens College in New York City (NYC). The evolution processes are characterized by three consecutive stages: (1) aerosol wet scavenging, (2) nighttime nitrate formation, and (3) photochemical production and evolution of secondary aerosol species. Our results suggest that wet scavenging of aerosol species tends to be strongly related to their hygroscopicities and also mixing states. The scavenging leads to {{a significant change in}} bulk aerosol composition and average carbon oxidation state because of <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in the following order: sulfate > low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA) > semi-volatile OOA (SV-OOA) > hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA). The second stage involves a quick formation of nitrate from heterogeneous reactions at nighttime. During the third stage, simultaneous increases of sulfate and SV-OOA were observed shortly after sunrise, indicating secondary aerosol formation. Organic aerosol particles become highly oxidized in ~half day as the result of photochemical processing, consistent with previously reported results from the CO-tracer method (OA/ΔCO). The photochemical reactions appear to progress gradually associated with a transformation of semi-volatile OOA to low-volatility species based on the evolution trends of oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio, relationship between f 44 (fraction of m/z 44 in OA) and f 43 (fraction of m/z 43 in OA), and size evolution of OOA and HOA. Aerosols appear to become more internally mixed during the processing. Our results suggest that functionalization by incorporation of both C and O {{plays a major role in}} the early period of OA oxidation (O/C < 0. 5). Our results also show that photochemical production of LV-OOA during this event is approximately a few hours behind of sulfate production, which might explain the sometimes lack of correlations between LV-OOA and sulfate, two secondary aerosol species which often exist in internal mixtures over regional scales...|$|R
30|$|Nonenzymatic {{lipid peroxidation}} can clearly be noticed when ox brain {{phospholipid}} liposomes were incubated with FeCl 3 and ascorbic acid. In {{the presence of}} reducing agent such as ascorbic acid, Fe+ 3 produces OH radical (Burits and Bucar 2000). Estimation of the pink pigment, lipid peroxidation (Aruoma 1996) is widely accepted, and it is generated through reaction of 2 -thiobarbituric acid with malondialdehyde (MDA) (Kosugi et al. 1987). Figure  2 represents a concentration dependent (0 – 8  μg/ml) OH radical scavenging effect of ME and VO extracts from NS seed oil and TQ, {{which resulted in a}} strong inhibition of nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation in phospholipid liposomes by reducing the formation of MDA. These results are clearly supported by plasma •OH scavenging property of thymoquinone rich fraction (TQRF) and TQ (Ismail et al. 2010). The data revealed that ME exhibited a profound antioxidant effect and only at 1.62  μg/ml, it could inhibit 50 % lipid damage, followed by TQ and VO extract with IC 50 values of 1.72 and 3.15  μg/ml, respectively. These results are consistent with the data in Table  1, where ME exhibited a 2 -fold higher radical scavenging activities compared to VO extract. The combined results presented in Table  1 and Figure  2, established the order of <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (IC 50 values) against the above four free radicals was ME[*]>[*]TQ[*]>[*]VO[*]>[*]NS seed oil[*]>[*]LMN, however, LMN exhibited a highly poor radical scavenging/antioxidant capacity. The ME exhibited a two-fold greater antioxidant capacity in comparison to VO extract, which is apparently due to the presence of the antioxidant compounds as well as additional mixture of phenolic compounds as explored by their GC-MS analysis (Table  2). Houghton et al. (1995) have reported that the fixed oil of the NS seed possessed greater antioxidant capacity than TQ. Thus, ME enriched with the radical scavenging agents plus good amount of mixture of phenolic compounds, which evidently contributed independently or synergistically with TQ to substantially enhance its antioxidant efficiency.|$|R
40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that the climate impact of large explosive volcanic eruptions results from reduction of solar radiation following atmospheric conversion of magmatic SO 2 emissions into H 2 SO 4 aerosols. Thus, understanding {{the fate of}} SO 2 in the eruption plume is crucial for better assessing volcanic forcing of climate. Here {{we focus on the}} potential of tephra to interact with and remove SO 2 gas from the eruptive plume. Scavenging of SO 2 by tephra is generally assumed to be driven by in-plume, low-temperature reactions between H 2 SO 4 condensates and tephra particles. However, the importance of SO 2 gas–tephra interaction above the dew point temperature of H 2 SO 4 (190 – 200 °C) has never been constrained. Here we report the results of an experimental study where silicate glasses with representative volcanic compositions were exposed to SO 2 in the temperature range 25 – 800 °C. We show that above 600 °C, the uptake of SO 2 on glass exhibits optimal efficiency and emplaces surficial CaSO 4 deposits. This reaction is sustained via Ca 2 + diffusion from the bulk {{to the surface of the}} glass particles. At 800 °C, the diffusion coefficient for Ca 2 + in the glasses was in the range 10 − 13 – 10 − 14 cm 2 s− 1. We suggest that high temperature SO 2 scavenging by glass-rich tephra proceeds by the same Ca 2 + diffusion-driven mechanism. Using a simple mathematical model, we estimated SO 2 <b>scavenging</b> <b>efficiencies</b> at 800 °C varying from < 1 % to 73 %, depending mainly on exposure time and tephra matrix glass Ca 2 + content. Our results imply that large explosive eruptions with a deep magma fragmentation depth are likely to be affected by significant gas–tephra interaction at temperature above 600 °C. This SO 2 sequestration mechanism should be considered when constraining volcanic S budgets, and when coupling the initial magmatic SO 2 content and the induced climatic response in some of the Earth’s largest eruptions...|$|R
