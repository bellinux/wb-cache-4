5|$|At the {{floodplain}} at {{the confluence of}} Ithan Creek and Darby Creek, the main trees species include <b>silver</b> <b>maple,</b> black willow, boxelder, and red maple. In the wetlands at this site, the main tree species include scattered black willow and <b>silver</b> <b>maple.</b> There are also patches of silky dogwood and wild rose, which are surrounded by assorted wetland plants, including herbs, grasses, sedges, and rushes. However, numerous exotic plants also inhabit the site.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} (but not all) species of maple (Acer) are also {{sometimes}} used {{as sources of}} sap for producing maple syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo), the <b>silver</b> <b>maple</b> (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar syrups may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the core}} collections. One site {{contains}} Red Maple (Acer rubrum), Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum), <b>Silver</b> <b>Maple</b> (Acer saccharinum), and Striped Maple (Acer pensylvanicum). Another contains an overstory of Acer x freemanii with an understory of shade-loving maples, including snakebark maples (Acer davidii and Acer tegmentosum) and small trees similar to the Japanese maple, such as Acer shirasawanum and Acer pseudosieboldianum. A third site consists primarily of small Asian Maples.|$|E

50|$|According to the Columbus Audubon website, Calamus Swamp has {{a unique}} plant community. Because of the moist soil, trees such as the American Elm, Green Ash and, in places, Red and <b>Silver</b> <b>maples</b> make up the swamp forest.|$|R
50|$|Nearby the Pomeranian Philharmonic {{building}} stand red horse-chestnuts and umbrella hornbeam. In {{the same}} way, abutting the Main building of Bydgoszcz Music Academy grow <b>silver</b> <b>maples,</b> a large English oaks and rare conifer species (Douglas-fir, {{eastern white pine}} and savin juniper).|$|R
5|$|The {{area in the}} {{vicinity}} of Keyser Creek has experienced habitat loss due to abandoned mine impacts. What remains of the creek's riparian buffer in some reaches is overrun with invasive plants. The understory in the creek's riparian area is covered in knotweed. However, some reaches have riparian buffers containing red maple, <b>silver</b> <b>maple,</b> and river birch.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek lacks a {{riparian}} buffer in some places. However, the Mahoning Creek floodplain and {{the nearby}} slopes are listed as a Locally Significant site on the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory. Eastern hemlock trees inhabit the slopes and river birch, <b>silver</b> <b>maple,</b> and silky dogwood inhabit the floodplain itself. American basswood also grows {{in the vicinity of}} the creek here. Additionally, spring wildflowers grow in this area. The site has a high level of plant biodiversity. However, many trees in the area are affected by an aphid species known as the hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin <b>Silver</b> <b>Maple,</b> it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the <b>silver</b> <b>maple.</b>|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (<b>silver</b> <b>maple),</b> Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella bombycina is a {{saprobic}} species. Fruit bodies grow singly or {{in small}} groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods. Favored species include sugar maple, red maple, <b>silver</b> <b>maple,</b> magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years. Despite its preference for hardwoods, {{it has been reported}} growing on rare instances on coniferous wood. An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to pick it. Variety microspora is known from Venezuela, while V.bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the park}} is also rich in trees less common in London. Opposite the {{entrance}} to the art gallery is a Walnut tree (Juglans regia) and a series of three or four <b>Silver</b> <b>Maples</b> (Acer saccharinum). There is as also a Red Oak (Quercus rubra) close to these maples. Next to the duck pond and the garden area there are three Swamp Cypresses (Taxodium distichum), although without the distinctive wooden 'knees' which sometimes surround trees of this variety.|$|R

25|$|Indiana bats {{were found}} {{in a variety of}} plant {{associations}} in a southern Iowa study. Riparian areas were dominated by eastern cottonwood, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and <b>silver</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer saccharinum). In the forested floodplains, the dominant plants included black walnut (Juglans nigra), <b>silver</b> <b>maple,</b> American elm (Ulmus americana), and eastern cottonwood. In undisturbed upland forest, the most common plants were black oak (Quercus velutina), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). Black walnut, American basswood, American elm, and bur oak dominated other upland Indiana bat sites.|$|E

25|$|The interwar years saw {{the first}} of what would be many {{contentious}} fights over trees in Falls Church. Increasing traffic caused the state highway department to plan to cut the beautiful <b>silver</b> <b>maples</b> lining Falls Church’s Broad Street. As community opposition to the plans grew, even the Parent-Teacher Association became involved—on the side of the trees, of course. Both sides managed victory: the aging trees were cut and the street was widened, and the state highway department planted new shade trees to line it.|$|R
50|$|Following WWII, <b>silver</b> <b>maples</b> were {{commonly}} used as a landscaping and street tree in suburban housing developments and cities due to their rapid growth, especially {{as a replacement for}} the blighted American Elm. However, they fell out of favor for this purpose because of brittle wood, unattractive form when not pruned or trained, and tendency to produce large numbers of volunteer seedlings, and nowadays it is much less popular for this purpose to the point where some towns and cities banned its use as a street tree.|$|R

The river starts in flat swamp vegetation with flora common to most Minnesota wetlands. Prairie-type grasses and flowers are then encountered {{on the banks}} and fields above the river. Near the Spring Hill County Park, a naturally restored prairie field is preserved. Oaks, elms, <b>silver</b> <b>maples</b> and willows {{are the most common}} trees through most of the valley. One of the most interesting sights along the Sauk is an elevated tamarack bog on the north bank of the river near Rockville, providing beautiful golden scenery in the fall.|$|R

It is covered in a forest of river birch, <b>silver</b> <b>maple</b> and sycamore trees. Milton State Park is a haven for migrating birds and waterfowl.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} {{particularly}} suited for exploiting recently disturbed sites. Vegetation {{with the potential}} for rapid growth can quickly take advantage of the lack of competition. In the northeastern United States, shade-intolerant trees like pin cherry and aspen quickly fill in forest gaps created by fire or windstorm (or human disturbance). <b>Silver</b> <b>maple</b> and eastern sycamore are similarly well adapted to floodplains. They are highly tolerant of standing water and will frequently dominate floodplains where other species are periodically wiped out.|$|E
50|$|Piss Pot Island is {{an island}} on the South Branch Potomac River west of Romney in Hampshire County, West Virginia. Piss Pot Island {{received}} its unflattering name before 1755, the year it was included on Joshua Fry's and Peter Jefferson's Carte de la Virginie et du Maryland. Uncommon for islands of its size and geologic nature, Piss Pot Island has remained approximately the same size since the eighteenth century. The island is forested primarily with American sycamores and <b>silver</b> <b>maples.</b> It continues to be popular with fishermen and canoers on the South Branch Potomac River. Mill Creek empties into the South Branch to its western shore and Wergman Run enters the river to its northeast.|$|R
