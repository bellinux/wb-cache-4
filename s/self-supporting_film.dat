30|$|Translucent {{films were}} formed by casting and drying the AHC {{suspensions}} on petri dishes. Although self-supporting films with AHC contents of 0.5 and 1.0  mg/cm 2 could be peeled from the dishes, the instrument for tensile testing required {{the film to}} be prepared with an AHC content of ≥ 2.0  mg/cm 2. The average thickness of film prepared with an AHC content of 2.0  mg/cm 2 was 12  μm. The AHC-X fraction produced a more transparent film than the AHC fraction. However, the film from AHC-X was difficult to remove from the dishes without any additives such as plasticizer or separating compound. Some previous investigations suggested the addition of 10 – 40  % of plasticizer, (w/w of polysaccharide) of glycerol or sorbitol to obtain self-supporting films from xylan [7, 8]. Addition of these plasticizers, glycerol or sorbitol to the AHC-X solution resulted in a sticky <b>self-supporting</b> <b>film</b> that was easily peeled from the dish. To reduce {{the large amount of}} additives we used a method for oblate preparation, in which a small amount of edible oil and lecithin from soybean were included to improve the flexibility of the film and enhance detachability from a surface [26]. Lecithin from soybean was added to the AHC-X solution at various concentrations. When 0.5  % (w/w of AHC-X) lecithin was added, the film was difficult to peel from the dish; therefore, 1  % of lecithin was added. The film prepared from AHC-M was easily peeled from the dishes and required no additives. The films from AHC-M were most opaque and cracks were prevalent along the edges of the dishes. The whole hemicellulose fraction (AHC) was the best manageable fraction to obtain thin self-supporting films without additives. The polysaccharide component ratio of AHC might be in good order to form <b>self-supporting</b> <b>film.</b> The films from AHC-X and AHC-M prepared using 2  mg/cm 2 of hemicellulose met the conditions necessary for tensile testing. The average film thicknesses of AHC-X and AHC-M were 12 and 10  μm, respectively.|$|E

The water-soluble fraction of the P. densiflora hemicellulose was mainly composed of arabino- 4 -O-methylglucuronoxylan according to a sugar analysis and NMR spectroscopy. The water-insoluble fraction contained more mannan-related polysaccharide than water-soluble fraction. Whole hemicellulose and the water-insoluble fraction formed stable films when they were dispersed in water, cast into petri dishes without additives, and dried. The water-soluble fraction formed the most transparent film, and it required a 1  % (w/w of polysaccharide) lecithin additive, while it was peeling off from the dish {{to be used as}} a <b>self-supporting</b> <b>film.</b> The 10 – 12  μm thick films had an average tensile strength of 36 – 43  MPa, and 2.1 – 2.5  % elongation at break.

In 0. 01 M NaNO 3, significant amounts of Zn were sorbed within the first 5 min of reaction at both pHs.

The novel pyrenyl-functionalized AuNPs (P-AuNPs) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, with surface functionalization confirmed by infrared and UV–visible spectroscopic analyses. Mixing solutions of the P-AuNPs and a π-electron-deficient polydiimide resulted in the formation of electronically complementary, chain-folded and π–π-stacked complexes, so affording a new supramolecular nanocomposite network which precipitated from solution. The P-AuNPs bind to the polydiimide via π–π stacking interactions to create supramolecular cross-links. UV–visible spectroscopic analysis confirmed the thermally reversible nature of the complexation process, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the supramolecular-nanocomposite material. The supramolecular polymer network is insoluble at room temperature, yet may be dissolved at temperatures above 60 °C. The thermal reversibility of this system is maintained over five heat/cool cycles without diminishment of the network characteristics.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of polymers with stimuli responsive physical properties is a rapidly expanding area of research. At {{the forefront of}} the field are self-healing polymers, which, when fractured can regain the mechanical properties of the material either autonomically, or in response to a stimulus. It has long been known {{that it is possible to}} promote healing in conventional thermoplastics by heating the fracture zone above the Tg of the polymer under pressure. This process requires reptation and subsequent re-entanglement of macromolecules across the fracture void, which serves to bridge, and ‘heal’ the crack. The timescale for this mechanism is highly dependent on the molecular weight of the polymer being studied. This process is in contrast to that required to affect healing in supramolecular polymers such as the plasticised, hydrogen bonded elastomer reported by Leibler et al. The disparity in bond energies between the non-covalent and covalent bonds within supramolecular polymers results in fractures propagating through scission of the comparatively weak supramolecular interactions, rather than through breaking the stronger, covalent bonds. Thus, during the healing process the macromolecules surrounding the fracture site only need sufficient energy to re-engage their supramolecular interactions in order to regenerate the strength of the pristine material. Herein we describe the design, synthesis and optimization of a new class of supramolecular polymer blends that harness the reversible nature of pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions to produce <b>self-supporting</b> <b>films</b> with facile healable characteristics. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a novel technique for measuring the phase velocity of elastic waves in <b>self-supporting</b> thin <b>films.</b> One {{edge of the film}} is fixed to an interdigital transducer (IDT) acting as a transmitter, while another IDT, the receiver, moves freely above the film. The coupling between the receiver and the film is made through a liquid bond. This allows a continuous variation of the path length, and the resulting change in phase and amplitude of the received continuous-wave (CW) signal permits a simultaneous and accurate measurement of the phase velocities of the different vibrational modes present in the foil.

40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS), d. c. conductivity {{measurements and}} the scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) {{are used to}} study through-film electronic percolation and sacrificial protection in zinc-rich organic coatings. Two types of zinc powder, exhibiting spherical and flake particle morphologies, are dispersed in an ethanolic solution of polyvinyl butyral. The resulting dispersions are cast onto glass to produce <b>self-supporting</b> zinc-rich organic <b>films.</b> The same dispersions are cast onto an iron substrate to form strongly adherent zinc-rich organic coatings. Through-film d. c. electrica conductance is found to increase sharply near the critical percolation volume fraction of zinc; that is the lowest zinc volume fraction at which long range electronic conduction becomes possible {{as a result of}} particle-particle contact. The critical percolation volume fraction is the same for both flake and powder particles. However, at any given zinc concentration near the critical percolation volume fraction, through-film conductivity is significantly higher {{in the case of the}} zinc flake. EIS is used to measure the through-film electrical impedance of <b>self-supporting</b> zinc-rich <b>films.</b> EIS data is not readily related to electronic charge percolation arising from zinc particle-particle contact but provides additional information on through-pore electrolytic conductivity and interfacial charge transfer-diffusion phenomena. The sacrificial protection afforded b...|$|R
40|$|Stearic acid or {{eicosanoic acid}} mixed with di- or {{oligomeric}} amines in specific molar ratios form stable gels in water. The formation of such hydrogels {{depends on the}} hydro-phobicity of the fatty acid, and also {{on the type of}} amine used. The gelation properties of these two-component systems were investigated using electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, $^ 1 H$ NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and both single-crystal and cast-film X-ray diffraction. Results of FTIR spectral analysis suggest salt formation during gelation. $^ 1 H$ NMR analysis of the gels indicates that the fatty acid chains are immobilized in the get state and when the gel melts, these chains regain their mobility. Analysis of DSC data indicates that increase in the spacer length in the di-/oligomeric amine lowers the gel-melting temperature. Two of these gelator salts developed into crystals and structural details of such systems could be secured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structural information of the salts thus obtained was compared with the XRD data of the <b>self-supporting</b> <b>films</b> of those gels. Such analyses provided pertinent structural insight into the supramolecular interactions that prevail within these gelator assemblies. Analysis of the crystal structure confirmed that multilayered lamellar aggregates exist in the gel and it also showed that the three-dimensional ordering observed in the crystalline phase is retained in only one direction in the gel state. Finally, the hydrogel was used as a medium for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were found to position themselves on the fibers and produced a long, ordered assembly of gel-nanoparticle composite...|$|R
40|$|A new, healable, supramolecular {{nanocomposite}} material {{has been developed}} and evaluated. The material comprises a blend of three components: a pyrene-functionalized polyamide, a polydiimide and pyrenefunctionalized gold nanoparticles (P-AuNPs). The polymeric components interact by forming well-deﬁned p–p stacked complexes between p-electron rich pyrenyl residues and p-electron deﬁcient polydiimide residues. Solution studies in the mixed solvent chloroform–hexaﬂuoroisopropanol (6 : 1, v/v) show that mixing the three components (each of which is soluble in isolation), results in the precipitation of a supramolecular, polymer nanocomposite network. The precipitate thus formed can be re-dissolved on heating, with the thermoreversible dissolution/precipitation procedure repeatable over at least 5 cycles.
