40|$|Controversy {{continues}} {{regarding the}} mechanism of coronary restenosis. While neointimal thickening was initially considered the major cause, recent studies suggest that changes in arterial size, or remodeling, plays an important or even dominant role in late lumen loss. Moreover, neointimal thickness and remodeling may be interrelated. The field has been {{complicated by the fact}} that remodeling analyses have not used consistent definitions or methods. In this editorial we thus describe a quantitative paradigm for remodeling analyses: as arterial plaque or neointima forms in an artery, it is accompanied by luminal encroachment, artery expansion or gradations of either. In this manner, remodeling is generally defined as any arterial <b>size</b> change (<b>enlargement</b> or contraction), independent or dependent of neointimal thickening. Standardization of definitions and quantitative methods may improve understanding of the components of restenosis resulting from artery size changes, neointimal thickening and their impact on lumen size...|$|R

40|$|Thick {{films of}} {{functional}} oxides are currently substituting counterparts bulk ceramics, {{as in the}} case of low loss dielectrics. For SrTiO 3 (ST) based compositions it is demonstrated that electrophoretic deposition (EPD), using acetone as a suspension media with iodine addition, is a suitable technology to fabricate 12 mu m thick films. The microstructural analysis of the films sintered at 1500 degrees C shows that highly densified microstructures can be obtained and, by slightly varying the Sr/Ti stoichiometry in the powder composition, increased densification and grain <b>size</b> and <b>enlargement</b> of the distribution with decreasing Sr/Ti ratio can be observed. In spite of the high densification of the films, it is also demonstrated that due to the constraint imposed by the substrate a smaller grain size is observed in thick films as compared to equivalent bulk ceramics. In addition, a preferential vertical pore orientation is observed in ST thick films. These results may have broad implications if one considers that the dielectric losses and dielectric tunability is affected by pore orientation, since it affects the electric field distribution.
