5000|$|The output gas {{temperature}} from the engines {{had to be}} below 400 °C for the helicopter's stainless steel rotor ducts, so a bypass design was used. This also blew [...] "cold" [...] air from the compressor, rather than purely hot turbine exhaust gas. In order to give a compact installation, rather than using an oversized compressor with a bypass around the turbine (as commonly used in the turbofan engine), the Oryx used an auxiliary compressor coupled to the turbine. This was mounted behind the turbine, with its gas flow {{in the opposite direction}} to the main engine core. The two gas streams were deflected through 90° in a collector chamber, then exited vertically upwards. Gas flow through this collector was arranged so that each stream remained separate, the cold air from the auxiliary compressor passing through a bifurcated duct, so as to wrap around the hotter turbine outlet. By this means, the duct was further protected from the hot exhaust. <b>Separator</b> <b>plates</b> inside each duct split the stream into a number of flows and deflected each one separately, thus preserving the flows approximately constant across the whole duct. When the flows finally merged, they were flowing parallel and at approximately the same velocity, thus reducing turbulence and energy loss.|$|E

The pressure drop across the cylinder increased as the fin space decreased, the increase being very rapid at fin spaces smaller than approximately 0. 20 inch. Fin width had little effect on the pressure drop for the range of widths tested. The pressure drop across the cylinder was nearly halved by increasing the skirt-approach radius from 3 / 4 inch to 1 - 1 / 4 inches, but fillets and a <b>separator</b> <b>plate</b> at the rear of the cylinder had little effect on the pressure drop.

40|$|The {{friction}} transmission {{model of}} wet clutch is established {{to analyze the}} friction transmission mechanism of its engagement. The model is developed by applying both the average flow model and the elastic contact model between the friction disk and <b>separator</b> <b>plate.</b> The key components during wet clutch engagement are the <b>separator</b> <b>plate,</b> friction disk, and lubricant. The one-dimension transient models of heat transfer in radial direction for the three components are built {{on the basis of}} the heat transfer theory and the conservation law of energy. The friction transmission model and transient heat transfer models are coupled and solved by using the Runge-Kutta numerical method, and the radial temperature distribution and their detailed parametric study for the three components are conducted separately. The simulation results show that the radial temperature for the three components rises with the increase of radius in engagement. The changes in engagement pressure, lubricant viscosity, friction lining permeability, combined surface roughness RMS, equivalent elasticity modulus, difference between dynamic and static friction coefficients, and lubricant flow have important influence on the temperature rise characteristics.

50|$|<b>Plate</b> <b>separators,</b> or Coalescing <b>Plate</b> <b>Separators</b> {{are similar}} to API separators, {{in that they are}} based on Stokes Law principles, but include {{inclined}} plate assemblies (also known as parallel packs). The underside of each parallel plate provides more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Coalescing <b>plate</b> <b>separators</b> may not be effective in situation where water chemicals or suspended solids restrict or prevent oil droplets coalesce. In operation it is intended that sediment will slide down the topside of each parallel plate, however in many practical situations the sediment can adhere to the plates requiring periodic removal and cleaning. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the parallel plates can enhance the degree of oil-water separation for oil droplets above 50 micron in size.

The mathematical model calculates the drag torque on the disks and the 2 D axisymmetric solver verifies the solution. The surface pressure distribution on the plates is also verified. Then, 3 D models of one grooved and one flat disk are tested using CFD, experiments and an approximate 3 D mathematical model. The number of grooves, depth of groove and clearance between the disks are studied to understand their effect on the torque. The study determines the pressure field that eventually affects aeration incipience (not studied here).

In the modeled fuel cell stack, forced air flow supplies oxidant as well as cooling. Conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy are solved in the oxidant channel, while energy equation is solved in the entire domain, including the gas diffusion layers and <b>separator</b> <b>plates,</b> which {{play a significant role}} in heat transfer.

The {{new structure}} SPA promoted the smooth volatilizing and complete burning of the organic compounds in the matrix. It was effective and reliable to press the stack with a suitable stacking pressure. It was facile and simple to assemble a stack by using electrode-SPA. With the electrode-SPAs, two NICK stacks were assembled in co-flow and counter-flow, respectively. The performance of Stack B in counter-flow was higher than that of Stack A in co-flow at the same current density.

At low dynamic pressure ratios a convective instability is shown to appear for which {{the frequency of the}} waves in the primary atomization region is influenced by both liquid and gas velocities. For large dynamic pressure ratios an asymptotic regime is obtained in which frequency is solely controlled by gas velocity and the instability becomes absolute. The transition from convective to absolute is shown to be influenced by the velocity defect induced by the presence of the <b>separator</b> <b>plate.</b> We show that in this regime the splitter plate thickness can also affect the nature of the instability if it is larger than the gas vorticity thickness.

40|$|From {{previous}} study, we {{know that}} oxidation of the coal surface will decrease the efficiency of electrostatic beneficiation by increasing the negative charge of the carbon particles. The polarity and magnitude of charge acquired by the nonconducting particles varied depending {{on the state of}} ``oxidation`` of the surfaces and the work function relative to the metal surface. The formation of oxide layer on the coal particles are rather rapid, therefore, the grinding and charging processes are needed to be carried out in a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. It is clear that impaction efficiency between coal particle and charger will decrease with decreasing particle size and particle velocity.

40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} are {{an important}} safety feature in most electrical circuits, and they act to prevent excessive currents caused by short circuits, for example. Low-voltage current limiting circuit breakers are activated by a trip solenoid when a critical current is exceeded. The solenoid moves two contacts apart to break the circuit. However, {{as soon as the}} contacts are separated an electric arc forms between them, ionising the air in the gap, increasing the electrical conductivity of air to that of the hot plasma that forms, and current continues to flow. The currents involved may be as large as 80, 000 amperes. Critical {{to the success of the}} circuit breaker is that it is designed to cause the arc to move away from the contacts, into a widening wedge-shaped region. This lengthens the arc, and then moves it onto a series of <b>separator</b> <b>plates</b> called an arc divider or splitter. The arc divider raises the voltage required to sustain the arcs across it, above the voltage that is provided across the breaker, so that the circuit is broken and the arcing dies away. This entire process occurs in milliseconds, and is usually associated with a sound like an explosion and a bright ash from the arc. Parts of the contacts and the arc divider may melt and/or vapourise. The question to be addressed by the Study Group was to mathematically model the arc motion and extinction, with the overall aim of an improved understanding that would help the design of a better circuit breaker. Further discussion indicated that two key mechanisms are believed to contribute to the movement of the arc away from the contacts, one being self-magnetism (where the magnetic field associated with the arc and surrounding circuitry acts to push it towards the arc divider), and the other being air flow (where expansion of air combined with the design of the chamber enclosing the arc causes gas flow towards the arc divider). Further discussion also indicated that a key aspect of circuit breaker design was that it is desirable to have as fast a quenching of the arc as possible, that is, the faster the circuit breaker can act to stop current flow, the better. The relative importance of magnetic and air pressure effects on quenching speed is of central interest to circuit design...|$|E

At present, thanks to the efforts of the leading countries that develop fuel cell technologies power plants on the basis of molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are really close to commercialization. One of the problems that are to be solved for practical implementation of MCFC and SOFC is a problem of corrosion of metal components of stacks that are assembled of a number of fuel cells. One of the major components of MCFC and SOFC stacks is a bipolar <b>separator</b> <b>plate</b> (BSP) that performs several functions - it is separation of reactant gas flows sealing of the joints between fuel cells, and current collection from the surface of electrodes.
