5|$|Glacial {{conditions}} ended suddenly, 11,550 years BP, {{when the}} Gulf Stream current was re-established. Periglacial processes in seasonal freeze-thaw conditions, both present and past, have produced sorted stone <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> solifluction lobes and sheets {{on the summit}} ridge of Helvellyn.

40|$|The global poultry {{industry}} has been faced with emerging broiler breast meat quality issues known as white <b>striping</b> <b>and</b> woody breast. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of white <b>striping</b> <b>and</b> woody breast hardness on meat quality traits in broiler breast fillets. Birds were processed at 8 wk (Exp. 1) and at 6 and 9 wk of age (Exp. 2), whereas deboning was carried out at 4 and 2 h postmortem in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. Fillets were categorized as: normal for both white <b>striping</b> <b>and</b> woody breast (NORM); mild for white <b>striping</b> <b>and</b> woody breast (MILD); severe for white <b>striping</b> <b>and</b> mild for woody breast (WS); severe for woody breast and mild for white striping (WB); or severe for both white <b>striping</b> <b>and</b> woody breast (BOTH). Sarcomere length, gravimetric fragmentation index (GFI; Exp. 1 only), marination uptake, cook loss, and Meullenet-Owens razor shear energy (MORSE) values on non-marinated and marinated fillets were assessed. Sarcomeres tended to be longer (P≤ 0. 07) with increasing severity of white <b>striping</b> <b>and</b> woody breast in both experiments, but GFI was not impacted (P= 0. 49). Marinade uptake decreased (...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} and investigation on {{a large number of}} <b>striped</b> <b>and</b> checked patterns in silk fabric of the Republic of China (1912 - 1949) and some relevant historical records, this paper mainly reviews the types of <b>striped</b> <b>and</b> checked patterns in silk fabric of the Republic of China. It also discusses the use of weave design in <b>striped</b> <b>and</b> checked patterns, and points out that <b>striped</b> <b>and</b> checked patterns turned {{to be one of the}} most popular patterns in silk fabric during this period, only ranking second to floral pattern. The influence of western design, changes in fashion and technological innovations are main reasons for this transition...|$|R

5|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Belarus from the Soviet Union, the country resurrected national symbols that were used before the Soviet era. These included a flag of red and white <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> a coat of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback. These national symbols were replaced by Soviet-era symbols in a disputed 1995 vote. Those two symbols, along with the national anthem, are the constitutionally defined national symbols of Belarus.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} allele {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' amaryllis, Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|Since 1936, Thistle {{have played}} in their {{distinctive}} red-and-yellow jerseys of varying designs, with hoops, <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> predominantly yellow tops with red trims having been used, although in 2009 a centenary kit was launched in the original navy-blue style to commemorate 100 years at Firhill. Since 1908 the club have won the Scottish Second Division once and the Scottish First Division (second tier, now the Scottish Championship) six times, most recently in 2013. Thistle have won the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup in 1921 and 1971 respectively.|$|E

5|$|The first {{calls for}} {{independence}} from the Spanish crown came on 10 August 1809; a plain red flag was flown by the rebels. The independence movement was defeated in November 1812 {{at the hands of}} Spanish officer Juan Sámano. On 9 October 1820, a new flag, a blue and white bicolour, with five horizontal alternating <b>stripes,</b> <b>and</b> three white stars in the middle stripe, was raised for the first time. The three stars represent Guayaquil, Portoviejo and Machala. This flag was later adopted by the Guayas Province.|$|E
5|$|The first {{football}} {{match at}} Goodison Park was on 2 September 1892 between Everton and Bolton Wanderers. Everton wore its new club colours of salmon and dark blue <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> won the exhibition game 4–2. The first league game at Goodison Park {{took place on}} 3 September 1892 against Nottingham Forest; the game ended in a 2–2 draw. The stadium's first competitive goal was scored by Forest's Horace Pike and the first Everton goal scored by Fred Geary. Everton's first league victory at their new ground came in the next home game with a 6–0 defeat of Newton Heath {{in front of an}} estimated 10,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other Cordyline species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: Cordyline australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, {{and a range of}} variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other Cordyline species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.|$|E

5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host {{is not an easy}} task though, despite the fact that several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal <b>stripes,</b> <b>and</b> may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these domes are bright in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and <b>stripes,</b> <b>and</b> many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented snow from piling on the roof.|$|E
5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey <b>stripes</b> <b>and</b> the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E

Juveniles are orange or red and long and thin. Rarely, some adults will retain the juvenile coloration.|$|R
