50|$|A steel doors {{leads to}} the {{entrance}} of the observatory segment, where there is a stairway to the second floor and a small lavatory. A set of airlock style doors leads to a temperature controlled room with two of the four Riefler clocks on one of the piers. In the clock vault there were 58 light bulbs positioned on the floor. The bulbs would go on and off in accordance to the demand for temperature. The vault was to be maintained at a constant 81 degrees F. These bulbs along with a ventilation shaft could maintain a temperature to within a half of a degree of 81. The two Riefler clocks found in the vault was No. 220 and No. 224. Above the room is a Warner & Swasey celestial transit instrument, on its own pier. The observatory segment is a two-story, concrete, domed octagon, covered with sheet metal. A 3 ft opening allows observations by the telescope. Steel shutters can close this through a system of chains. Each <b>steel</b> <b>shutter</b> weighed one-half a ton. It was written that the gearing used to open the doors were so easy a child of six could do it.|$|E
50|$|Damage {{can occur}} during the casting and de-{{shuttering}} processes. For instance, {{the corners of}} beams can be damaged during the removal of shuttering because they are less effectively compacted by means of vibration (improved by using form-vibrators). Other physical damage {{can be caused by}} the use of <b>steel</b> <b>shuttering</b> without base plates. The <b>steel</b> <b>shuttering</b> pinches the top surface of a concrete slab due to the weight of the next slab being constructed.|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of {{construction}} Wetherby lacked mains electricity and so the cinema was powered by a 400 volt gas-powered generator. This and the inflammable nature of the nitrate film used in the early days, meant that the projection room required <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> to contain any potential fire. These remain today.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} {{method used}} for the flats was new for Australian standards with the external walls constructed from stripped concrete a technique already much established in Switzerland. For formwork they used 600 square <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> and poured in 600 lifts whilst for the curved balconies and for variation in texture corrugated formwork was used.|$|R
50|$|The barracks of the Black and Tans in Kilbrittain was {{the target}} chosen by the Brigade to launch its attack. The barracks itself was {{strongly}} fortified and held; it had <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> in place of windows and was surrounded by barbed wire entanglements. The only way the volunteers {{would be able to}} take the barracks would be by planting a mine against a door or wall and then storm it immediately after the explosion.|$|R
50|$|Permanent <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> {{were added}} to the landward side of the lantern room some time after 1897, when {{concussion}} from the 6-inch guns at newly built Fort Rodd Hill caused cracks to appear in the lantern windows. The last keeper to actually live full-time at Fisgard was George Johnson; Josiah Gosse, Fisgard's final keeper, had permission from the lighthouse authority to live ashore (nearby on Esquimalt Lagoon), and row out to Fisgard every evening.|$|R
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind <b>steel</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beyond this, the {{original}} design of the locks had yet another safety feature, emergency dams that could be swung across the locks at {{the upper end of}} every flight. These consisted of swinging bridges, from which girders were lowered to the lock floor; <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> could then be run down these girders to block the flow of water. Monthly drills were held, by night and day, to make sure that these dams could be deployed in an emergency.|$|R

50|$|Batchelor was a {{watercolour}} {{painter of}} many subjects. His studio was the entertainment {{room at the}} side of a detached house, a sparsely furnished, bow-windowed room with cocktail bar and <b>steel</b> <b>shutters.</b> He spent his last years mainly in one small room equipped with a chaise longue and two televisions, one colour, the other monochrome, rented from Granada TV Rental at Knowle, Bristol. His housekeeper communicated with visitors and tradesmen. His son Richard took over the business of results prediction. Following his death in 1977, The Times published his will on 3 March of that year, showing he left just under £150,000.|$|R
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning (for he was early awake after an uncomfortable night upon the floor) he saw cause to adopt a {{different}} explanation. The blinds rose, one after another, {{by means of a}} spring in the interior, and disclosed <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> such as we see on the front of shops; these in their turn were rolled up by a similar contrivance; and for the space of about an hour the chambers were left open to the morning air. At the end of that time Mr. Vandeleur, with his own hand, once more closed the shutters and replaced the blinds from within.|$|R
5|$|Shinano was {{designed}} to load and fuel her aircraft on deck where it was safer for the ship; experiences in the Battles of Midway and the Coral Sea had demonstrated that the existing doctrine of fueling and arming their aircraft below decks was a real danger to the carriers if they were attacked while doing so. Much of Shinanos hangar was left open for better ventilation, although <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> could close off most of the hangar sides if necessary. This also allowed ordnance or burning aircraft to be jettisoned into the sea, something that the earlier carriers could not do with their enclosed hangars.|$|R
6000|$|The porter, whom he consulted, {{could afford}} him little information; but, {{such as it}} was, it had a mysterious and {{questionable}} sound. The person next door was an English gentleman of extraordinary wealth, and proportionately eccentric in his tastes and habits. He possessed great collections, which he kept in the house beside him; and it was to protect these that he had fitted the place with <b>steel</b> <b>shutters,</b> elaborate fastenings, and CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE along the garden wall. He lived much alone, in spite of some strange visitors with whom, it seemed, he had business to transact; {{and there was no}} one else in the house, except Mademoiselle and an old woman servant ...|$|R
50|$|Ground {{was broken}} in 1902 for a brick library {{building}} at 82 Touro Street, {{which would be}} attached to the Sabbatarian Meeting House (previously acquired by the society). The new building provided office space for the society, a fireproof vault for historic documents, and a library. In 1915, the meeting house was detached from the library and moved {{to the rear of the}} lot. A three story brick building was constructed between the library and the meeting house. Brick veneer, a slate roof, and <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> were added to the exterior of the meeting house to make its exterior covering consistent with the adjoining structures, and to provide added protection from the weather and the threat of fire.|$|R
5|$|A {{defensible}} barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured <b>steel</b> <b>shutters.</b> The {{first floor of}} the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|Interior {{stairs in}} the duplex suites {{make use of}} {{materials}} originally engineered for exterior applications. The custom designed stairs are constructed of COR-TEN B steel (ASTM A 588), giving them a durable rustic appearance. The rustic theme is also mirrored in the wood grain patterns imprinted in the concrete walls. All concrete structures are constructed using concrete forms, usually made of steel. The resulting finish of <b>steel</b> <b>shuttered</b> concrete can be extremely precise, an example of which is Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. The cost is high, however, because each steel form needs to be custom made, and then positioned accurately. Moravola's walls used wooden forms, which, {{in addition to the}} cost savings, allowed easy fabrication within the existing historical 10th-century structure.|$|R
5000|$|The SYNus shares its {{powertrain}} {{design with}} the Ford Mondeo. The engine is a diesel powered, 16 valve, turbocharged, 2.0L DOHC 4-cylinder Duratorq TDCi Diesel engine that produces 134 horsepower (100 kW). The SYNus has a five-speed manual transmission. Its wheels are 18 inches (457 mm) in diameter. It has an IEEE 802.11g compliant wireless LAN hub. The SYNus {{was designed to}} maximize safety, and derives its aesthetic from modern bank vaults. The car's windows and frame are bullet-resistant. It has no rear window, and instead displays a video feed on a large LCD monitor installed {{in the back of the}} car's interior. Also, when in [...] "lockdown mode" [...] <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> close around the front windshield, windows and the exterior lights.|$|R

2500|$|In late January the FLN {{called an}} 8-day general strike across Algeria commencing on Monday 28 January. The strike {{appeared}} to be a success with most Muslim shops remaining shuttered, workers failed to turn up and children didn't attend school. However Massu soon deployed his troops and used armored cars to pull the <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> off shops while army trucks rounded up workers and schoolchildren and forced them to attend their jobs and studies. Within a few days the strike had been broken. The bombings however continued and in mid-February female FLN operatives planted bombs at the Municipal Stadium and the El-Biar Stadium in Algiers killing 10 and injuring 45. After visiting Algiers, a clearly shocked defense minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury told General Massu after the bombings: [...] "We must finish these people off!".|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{standard}} gates, the stadium had solid corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> {{at the bottom}} of tunnels that connected the street level, via several flights of steps, to the seating areas above. These shutters were closed as they normally were at every game. Panicked spectators moving down the enclosed stairways pressed those in the lead against the closed shutters, but this was not visible to the crowd pushing down the stairwells from behind. The shutters finally burst outward as a result of pressure from the crush of bodies inside. All of those that died were killed in the stairwells down to the street level, most from internal haemorrhaging or asphyxia. No one who stayed inside the stadium died. In the street, the crowd caused destruction on private property around the stadium.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1993 and 2003, over 13% of the machiya in Kyoto were {{demolished}}. Roughly {{forty percent}} of those demolished were replaced with new modern houses, and another 40% were replaced with high-rise apartment buildings, parking lots, or modern-style commercial shops Of those machiya remaining, over 80% have suffered significant losses to the traditional appearance of their facades. Roughly 20% of Kyoto's machiya have been altered in a process called kanban kenchiku (看板建築, lit. [...] "signboard architecture"); they retain the basic shape of a machiya, but their facades have been completely covered over in cement, which replaces the wooden lattices of the first story and mushikomado windows and earthwork walls of the second story. Many of these kanban kenchiku machiya have also lost their tile roofs, becoming more boxed-out in shape; many have also had aluminum or <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> installed, as are commonly seen in small urban shops around the world.|$|R

Several staff attempt to flee the building, but <b>steel</b> <b>shutters</b> suddenly rise up, sealing off the outside walls and doors and locking them all in. They ignore the announcement at first, believing {{it to be a}} prank, but four employees die when explosives hidden in their trackers detonate and blow their heads apart. The employees believe the deaths are due to sniper fire at first, but Mike realizes the actual cause and attempts to remove his tracker with a box cutter.
