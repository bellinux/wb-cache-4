5|$|According to Takahashi, the amyloid spores, the cheilocystidia {{covered with}} one or more, knob-like, apical excrescences, the diverticulate {{elements}} in the cortical layer of cap and stem, and the diverticulate caulocystidia <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes, {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
5|$|Additional varve counts {{from the}} Lake Missoula Basin, Sanpoil River, and Latah Creek <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> time between floods was 30-40 years on average.|$|E
5|$|Aqua regia, {{a mixture}} {{consisting}} of hydrochloric and nitric acids, prepared by dissolving sal ammoniac in nitric acid, {{was described in}} the works of Pseudo-Geber, a 13th-century European alchemist. Other references <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first mention of aqua regia is in Byzantine manuscripts dating {{to the end of the}} 13th century.|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies have}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> family Ascoviridae {{evolved from the}} Iridoviridae.

5000|$|John Koch <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} form of Imanuentius's name {{may have been}} *Mannuētios. He also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Welsh mythological figure Manawydan may derive from an earlier *Mannuētiagnos, [...] "son of Mannuetios".|$|R
5000|$|Although Haswell-Smith <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{name means}} [...] "yew island", the {{preponderance}} of Norse names in <b>the</b> Outer Hebrides <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second element of [...] "Iubhard" [...] may be a corruption of fjord/firth.|$|R
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{made with}} the Hubble Space Telescope <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85°. The inclination of f is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Chromium deficiency, {{involving}} {{a lack of}} Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as glucose tolerance factor is controversial. Some studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> biologically active form of chromium (III) in an oligopeptide called low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr), which might {{play a role in}} the insulin signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|Differences in {{architectural}} style between elite residential complexes {{and in the}} activities carried out at them <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aristocracy of Motul de San José was divided into several distinct classes, including the royal family resident in Group C, royal courtiers and low to middle rank nobles.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> second {{equation}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Strouhal {{number is}} a weak negative function of Reynolds number. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dynamic similarity approximation is reasonable. The fluctuating force exerted on the cylinder {{is a result}} of the flow circulation around it caused by the alternate vortex separation as suggested in the third figure. <b>The</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vortices are not directly behind <b>the</b> cylinder <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> force vector has both a lift and drag component resulting in lift and drag dipoles.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genetic {{distance}} between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe is anomalously {{lower than it}} would be if the two populations had been evolving independently. <b>The</b> study <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lower {{genetic distance}} between Europe and Africa can be explained by genetic admixture.|$|R
50|$|Fossil {{evidence}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nyala {{has been}} a separate species {{since the end of}} the Miocene (5.8 million years ago). Genetic evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proto-nyala had some early hybridization with the proto-lesser kudu, but the two have remained separate long after this crossing.|$|R
5|$|Field {{observations}} <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mushroom associates mycorrhizally {{with the}} plant Castanopsis fissa, a deciduous tree {{found only in}} the southern provinces of China, such as Guangdong, Yunnan and Hunan. Mushroom fruitings are abundant in the warm spring rains of March and April, although they are also seen in May to July.|$|E
5|$|No drug is {{currently}} approved {{for the treatment}} of smallpox. However, antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> antiviral drug cidofovir might be useful as a therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered intravenously, however, and may cause serious kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|On this hypothesis, the {{molecular}} data <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old, while the Meliponini (and thus the clade {{that includes the}} Bombini and Meliponini) are 81 to 96 million years old, {{about the same age}} as the corbiculate group.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, in {{a letter}} to the British medical journal The Lancet, it was <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution leader Maximilien Robespierre had sarcoidosis, and <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{condition}} caused him a notable impairment during his time as the head of the Reign of Terror.|$|R
50|$|The German Egyptologists Hermann Junker {{had dated}} the pair statue {{to the end}} of the Old Kingdom, and it has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statue dates to the 5th dynasty.

5|$|The {{changing}} {{styles of}} architecture and iconography at Takalik Abaj <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> site has been occupied by changing ethnic groups. The archaeological finds of the Middle Preclassic period <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> population of Takalik Abaj may have been affiliated with the Olmec culture of the Gulf Coast lowlands region who {{are thought to have}} been speakers of a Mixe–Zoquean language. In the Late Preclassic period, Olmec art styles were exchanged for Maya styles and presumably this shift was accompanied by an influx of ethnic Maya, speaking a Mayan language. There are some hints from the indigenous chronicles that the inhabitants of the site may have been the Yoc Cancheb, a branch of the Mam Maya. The Kooja lineage of the Mam, an ancient noble line, may have had a Classic Period origin in Takalik Abaj.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of fault scarp cliffs by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Moon has shrunk {{within the past}} billion years, by about 90 metres (300ft). Similar shrinkage features exist on Mercury.|$|E

5|$|The {{disposition}} of the substructures of the layer pyramid is extremely similar to that found in the Buried Pyramid of Sekhemket. Consequently, Mark Lehner and others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two pyramids must have been constructed very close in time.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the egret's eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity.
