The objective of this study is to develop a new correlation to estimate the <b>static</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> from the well log data for carbonate rocks (limestone and dolomite).

3000|$|These {{relationships}} for all {{the thermal}} damage cases are adequately described by a negative power function. In the initial phase, the ratios of the mechanical properties exhibited a remarkable decrease until the nonlinearity parameter ratios increased to 10 for the HNP (α) and 200 for the nonlinearity parameter ([...] D [...]) (approximately before 400  °C); this is illustrated in Fig.  8. In the following phase, relatively widespread values of the nonlinearity parameters are apparent with marginal variations in the mechanical properties. Generally, this widespread section {{can be attributed to}} the fire-damage to the concrete when subjected to a temperature of approximately 600  °C. This implies that the variations in the nonlinearity parameter ratios increase with temperature to a significantly higher degree than the variations in the strength ratios and <b>static</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> ratio. In addition, it can be observed that the compressive strength ratio, splitting tensile strength ratio, and <b>static</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> ratio converged to approximately 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1, respectively. This implies that among the three parameters, the <b>static</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> is most sensitive to elevation in temperature, followed by the splitting tensile strength and compressive strength.|$|R

30|$|Idel (1936), Brace (1965), and Walsh (1966) {{stated that}} the {{difference}} between the <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>modulus</b> is strongly affected by the rock microstructure (natural fractures and pores) and the confining stress. High stresses might close the microcracks and result in increase in the velocity waves as the rock is compacted. The faster waves will be interpreted as a higher elastic modulus (dynamic modulus). Zisman (1933) explained the difference between the <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>modulus</b> by the loss of energy that the wave pulse might suffer when passing through the rock pores (intergranular pores or natural fractures) due to reflection and refraction at the fluid/rock interfaces (Howarth 1984). <b>Static</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> is often used in the wellbore stability and in situ stress applications (Ledbetter 1993; Hammam and Eliwa 2013). However, collecting cores from the well to measure the moduli in the laboratory is expensive and usually not feasible.|$|R

It is possible {{to reduce the cost}} of open-pit coal mining using overburden rock in constructing temporary pit roads. The purpose of the work is to justify the possibility of using overburden rock for the construction of temporary technological roads. To this end, we set the tasks to determine the rational granulometric composition of crushed rock, dependences of its unit weight, <b>static</b> elastic <b>modulus,</b> and ultimate shear resistance. This study justifies the most efficient granulometric composition of crushed rock based on theoretical studies of the optimal structure of granular materials, taking into account the probability theory of particle-particle packing, laboratory studies of the dependence of the unit weight and the <b>static</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> on the content of par-ticles of different sizes, and also the calculation of ultimate shear resistance of crushed rocks. As a result of the conducted studies, it has been established that the optimal granulometric composition of crushed rock, which at the same time ensures high values of unit weight, <b>static</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> and ultimate shear re-sistance, is achieved when the content of particles larger than half of the maximum is 40 to 55 % and increases integrally with decreasing of the average particle diameter...|$|R

30|$|The {{estimation}} of the in situ stresses is very crucial in {{oil and gas industry}} applications. Prior knowledge of the in situ stresses is essential in the design of hydraulic fracturing operations in conventional and unconventional reservoirs. The fracture propagation and fracture mapping are strong functions of the values and directions of the in situ stresses. Other applications such as drilling require the knowledge of the in situ stresses to avoid the wellbore instability problems. The {{estimation of}} the in situ stresses requires the knowledge of the <b>Static</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> of the rock. Young’s modulus can be determined using expensive techniques by measuring the Young’s modulus on actual cores in the laboratory. The laboratory values are then used to correlate the dynamic values derived from the logs. Several correlations were introduced in the literature, but those correlations were very specific and when applied to different cases they gave very high errors and were limited to relating the dynamic Young’ modulus with the log data. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop an accurate and robust correlation for <b>static</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> to be estimated directly from log data without the need for core measurements. Multiple regression analysis was performed on actual core and log data using 600 data points to develop the new correlations. The <b>static</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> was found to be a strong function on three log parameters, namely compressional transit time, shear transit time, and bulk density. The new correlation was tested for different cases with different lithology such as calcite, dolomite, and sandstone. It gave good match to the measured data in the laboratory which indicates the accuracy and robustness of this correlation. In addition, it outperformed all correlations from the literature in predicting the <b>static</b> Young’s <b>modulus.</b> It will also help in saving time as well as cost because only the available log data are used in the prediction.|$|R

A total of 90 cubical and cylindrical specimens each were cast and tested at 7, 14, 28, 90, 120 and 180 days. The results revealed that the PSA met the minimum chemical and physical requirements for class C Pozzolans.
