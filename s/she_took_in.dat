5|$|Final Destination 3 is a 2006 American supernatural horror film {{directed}} by James Wong {{and the third}} installment in the Final Destination film series. The screenplay was written by Wong and Glen Morgan, both of whom had worked on the franchise's first film in 2000. Final Destination 3 stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, and is set {{five years after the}} first film.

Wendy realizes the photos <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> the amusement park contain clues about how her classmates will die, and tries to use them to save the rest of the survivors and foil Death's design.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E
