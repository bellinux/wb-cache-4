It is more common to use a three-wheeled vehicle similar to a conventional three wheeled forklift. The drive wheel is the turning wheel. It is more precise in following the programmed path than the differential speed controlled method. This type of AGV has smoother turning. <b>Steered</b> <b>wheel</b> control AGV {{can be used in}} all applications; unlike the differential controlled.

If the <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> has n slots, it advances by 360°/n per full rotation of the propeller wheel.|$|E
50|$|The {{caster angle}} or castor angle is the angular {{displacement}} of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> in a car, motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line {{that runs through the}} centre of the upper ball joint to the centre of the lower ball joint) and vertical. Car racers sometimes adjust caster angle to optimise their car's handling characteristics in particular driving situations.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic or {{electric}} actuators add controlled {{energy to the}} steering mechanism, so the driver can provide less effort to turn the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> when driving at typical speeds, and reduce considerably the physical effort necessary to turn the wheels when a vehicle is stopped or moving slowly. Power steering can also be engineered to provide some artificial feedback of forces acting on the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

50|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and even}} death wobble are all words and phrases used to {{describe}} a quick (4 - 10 Hz) oscillation of primarily just the steerable wheel(s) of a vehicle. Initially, {{the rest of the}} vehicle remains mostly unaffected, until translated into a vehicle yaw oscillation of increasing amplitude producing loss of control. Vehicles that can experience this oscillation include motorcycles and bicycles, skateboards, and in theory any vehicle with a single steering pivot point and a sufficient amount of freedom of the <b>steered</b> <b>wheel,</b> including that which exists on some light aircraft with tricycle gear where instability can occur at speeds of less than 50 mph; this does not include most automobiles. The initial instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels and aircraft landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual king pin angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the scrub radius of the <b>steered</b> <b>wheel.</b> This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply dished wheel so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less dished wheel, which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|E

A 4 DOF model with nonlinear tire and SBW subsystem is presented using {{hardware in the loop}} method. Since some space variables cannot be measured, an estimator is used to extract the measurable variables from the simulated model and convert them to the required variables of the controller. These variables are transmitted to the controller and then it adopts itself with new conditions and applies the best modification on the steering.

50|$|Brake fade {{failures}} can cascade. For example, {{a typical}} 5-axle truck/trailer combination has 10 brakes. If one brake fades, brake load {{is transferred to}} the remaining 9 brakes, causing them to work harder, get hotter, and thus fade more. Where fade is non-uniform, fade may cause a vehicle to swerve. Because of this, heavy vehicles often use disproportionately weak brakes on <b>steered</b> <b>wheels,</b> which hurts the stopping distance and causes brakes on non-steered wheels to work harder, worsening fade. An advantage of low-fade brakes such as disc brakes is <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> can do more braking without causing brake steer.|$|R

40|$|A {{variation}} in the camber of an automotive wheel is desired to compensate a side-slip force change owing to normal load transfer when the car is cornering. The camber of a <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> can be varied by adjusting caster or lean angle which are the representations of steering axis orientation. Thus, a smart camber can be created by a variable caster or lean angle. Choosing which parameter among the two angles to be variable is very important and dependent on its different effects. Here, homogeneous transformation is employed to establish camber {{as a function of}} caster, lean angle, and steering angle in the general case. A comparison between caster and lean angle based on different criteria is then made. The comparison shows that a variable caster is much better and more feasible than a variable lean angle in generating a smart camber...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the field}} of {{providing}} mobility to the elderly or disabled one aspect that remains largely unresolved is that of providing mobility into “barrier present” environments. Perhaps the most formidable and yet common barrier to a wheelchair is the boarding of a secondary form of transportation, often a van of some form, representing a single step of height ranging 60 to 80 cm. At present vehicles intended for transporting powered wheelchairs are equipped with specialized and often expensive lifting apparatus. Building on the design concepts detailed by the authors in previous papers, “towards a “barrier free ” wheelchair ” focuses on major redesign extending the author’s stairclimbing wheelchairs ability to make direct vehicle boarding possible.

The connection between {{the steering wheel and}} <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> is no more than mechanical or hydraulic.

Summary Wheel Loader is the largest amount of engineering machinery in the world, because of its convenient operation, moving fast, cheap and easy to repair. It has become important earthwork construction tools in China and many other countries. In 2003 China, wheel loader enterprise's production and sales volume has reached the world's first[1].

In this paper, the design of the control scheme for SbW systems is faced. Two schemes are considered: one is derived from the model of conventional steering equipment whilst the other one exploits the features of a SbW system to cope with the interaction of the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> to the road surface.

40|$|The {{lateral force}} of a tyre is a {{function}} of the sideslip and camber angles. The camber angle can provide a significant effect on the stability of a vehicle by increasing or adjusting the required lateral force to keep the vehicle on the road. To control the camber angle and hence, the lateral force of each tyre, we can use the caster angle of the wheel. We introduce a possible variable and controllable caster angle in order to adjust the camber angle when the sideslip angle cannot be changed. As long as the left and right wheels are steering together according to a kinematic condition, such as Ackerman, the sideslip angle of the inner wheel cannot be increased independently to alter the reduced lateral force because of weight transfer and reduction of the normal load F z A variable caster mechanism can adjust the caster angle of the wheels to achieve their top capacity and maximise the lateral force, when needed. Such a system would potentially increase the safety, stability, and maneuverability of the vehicles. Using the screw theory, this paper will examine the kinematics of a variable caster and present the required mathematical equation to calculate the camber angle as a function of suspension mechanism parameters and other relevant variables. Having a <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> about a tilted steering axis will change the position and orientation of the wheel with respect to the body of the car. This paper provides the required kinematics of such a suspension and extracts the equations in special practical situations.

40|$|Developing a {{specific}} {{model for a}} tractor-trailer system subject to slips in real working environment is essential for understanding its system behavior. More importantly, the demand for autonomous agricultural vehicles {{in the form of}} a tractor pulling a trailer is increasing because of the decrease in the labor supply involved in farming. For such autonomous tractor-trailer, one of its critical elements is the controller. Thus, this thesis analyzes comprehensively the kinematics of a tractor towing a steerable implement under the influence of inevitable sliding effects caused by the ground onto the implements and wheels. Furthermore, various nonlinear design methods are also studied in order to find the most suitable ones of synthesizing controllers for the agricultural vehicle to track a predetermined path. The study firstly presents a kinematic model of the tractor-trailer in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties. An error model is then derived, based on the open-loop kinematic model and the desired reference path. By applying basic theory of engineering mechanics for rigid body with slips, in the form of extra velocities and angles, exerting on rear axles and <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> as well as the trailer's implements, the open-loop kinematic model is primarily established. Secondly, with the derived error model, control laws for steering of both the tractor and trailer are constructed to make the car-like mobile robot towing an implement follow either a circle or a straight line. Such controllers are developed by utilizing not only recursive design methods for nonholonomic systems but also a nonlinear proportional integral (PI) scheme. The obtained control laws guarantee the closed-loop plant's stability and robustness against ambient working environment perturbations as well as uncertainties existing inside the system. In establishing of a kinematic model for the tractor-trailer, provided that the current state of the vehicle and random disturbances of the environment are known with bounds, the next states of the system can be estimated, the vehicle running path is predicted, along with setting a basis for further controller design. This thesis also provides additional techniques to adjust responses of the car-like mobile robot towing an implement. Furthermore, constructed controllers can be implemented to make current agricultural vehicles operate autonomously...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and validation {{of a new}} multibody joint that constrains a body to follow a spatial path and an orientation defined by a user is presented. The resulting joint has a single degree of freedom (DOF), and maintains equivalent kinematic behaviour when compared to higher-fidelity models. As such, it {{is referred to as}} a single-DOF equivalent kinematic (SEK) joint. The primary application of this joint is in the reduction of complex multibody systems, specifically vehicle suspensions. The first formulation of the joint is developed using the user interface of MapleSim. Starting with a planar particle joint, the theory is extended to a full 3 D rigid body constraint. At each development stage, the joint is successfully validated against conventional models in both Adams and MapleSim. This formulation of the joint results in the kinematic pair being represented by a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) which is not the desired functionality, and so a second formulation is developed. By removing the constraint of using the MapleSim user interface, the formulation can be developed from first principles. Using the path-length as the coordinate for the joint, and the Frenet-Serret equations to compute the motion and reaction spaces, the kinematic pair can be represented by a single ordinary differential equation (ODE). The theory is implemented in the MapleSim source code using the symbolic computing language Maple. The theory of the SEK joint can be extended to create different joints. The first is the compliant SEK joint. In this version of the joint, the body is constrained to move along a spatial path using a simple linear bushing model. The compliant SEK joint is useful for modeling the suspension systems of passenger cars as bushings are used extensively in these systems to increase passenger comfort. The second extension is to add an additional DOF to the SEK joint to created the double-DOF equivalent kinematic (DEK) joint. The DEK joint is useful for modelling steered suspension systems as the steering introduces an additional DOF to the suspension. The envelope of motion for the <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> is a surface rather than a spatial line. Once the joints are successfully validated, three example applications of the joint are shown. In the first, rigid, compliant and steered suspension models are developed and compared against high-fidelity models in Adams/Car and MapleSim. Next, a full vehicle model is assembled using the suspension models and compared against an equivalent high-fidelity full vehicle model built in MapleSim. The comparisons show the accuracy of the SEK joint as well as the simulation speed improvements it can offer compared with conventional modelling techniques. The second example, from the domain of biomechanics, shows a knee model created using the SEK joint. Finally, a roller coaster model is created to demonstrate the flexibility of the path generation algorithm to create splines that represent complex paths...|$|E

50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|R

However, powerful cars rarely use the FF layout because weight transference under acceleration reduces the weight on the front wheels and reduces their traction, limiting the torque which can be utilized.

The Velayo uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it was produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles steered all wheels; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels.
