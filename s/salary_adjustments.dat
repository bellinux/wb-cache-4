The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyse theoretically the implications of increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) on the wages of workers and on the profits of firms in the local country which is previously studied in Saglam and Sayek (2011). In this study, we modify the Kelso and Crawford’s <b>salary</b> <b>adjustment</b> process. Firstly, capacity constraint of firms is introduced into the Kelso and Crawford’s <b>salary</b> <b>adjustment</b> process. Secondly, we study the process where workers make offers. Existence of stable matching is explored. In the process where firms offer, the matching converges to a stable matching {{but in the process}} where workers offer, stability may not hold. While analysing the implications of increasing FDI on the wages and on the profits in the local country, we use the firm-proposing <b>salary</b> <b>adjustment</b> process with capacity constraint. Our analysis shows that under certain assumptions workers and foreign firms benefit from increasing presence of foreign direct investment while domestic firms may lose profits. Özcan, ElifM. S...|$|R

Because some affected employees would receive a reduced salary, their retirement contributions would also be slightly reduced, resulting in a reduction in revenues.

Although not as prevalent, {{there have been some}} recent instances where male faculty have claimed—with some degree of success—that the process used by their institutions to make <b>salary</b> <b>adjustments</b> for females was unfair and led to reverse pay discrimination. In this paper, we examine some of the legal issues and statistical approaches surrounding claims of reverse sex discrimination in pay in the field of higher education. We begin by reviewing the way in which legal cases examine sex discrimination in pay in academe and the different approaches that institutions can take to remove pay disparities for women. We show that across-the-board <b>salary</b> <b>adjustments</b> for women are less likely than individualized <b>salary</b> <b>adjustments</b> to raise concerns about the salary determination process and possibly reverse discrimination, and lead to lower costs to the institution. These differences arise regardless of the salary model specification used by an institution when making <b>salary</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Finally, we use a model developed by the plaintiffs in a salary equity study at one institution to demonstrate the effects of using different adjustment methods on the total cost to the institution when making salary equity adjustments for both genders.

Due pro-cess characteristics and employee characteristics were differentially related to two dimensions of procedural justice. Specifically, perceived validity of performance criteria, knowledge of performance criteria, and organizational level of employees were related to system procedural justice, whereas perceived performance feedback and fair hearing were each positively related to rater procedural justice.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between technological changes in business and industry and vocational teacher in-service training. Data were collected from 134 vocational teachers from the nursing, welding, automotive, and secretarial technologies in 12 Oregon community colleges. Questionnaires were used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics and discriminant analysis were used to compare the training patterns to the patterns of change. Subjects were classified as "responsive to technical change" if the pattern of the number of hours of technical in-service education over the prescribed five-year period coincided with the implementation of the technological change in their field. They were "non-responsive" if the pattern of the number of hours of technical in-service education did not coincide with the technical change. Approximately 62 percent of the subjects participated in responsive in-service training while approximately 38 percent appeared not be responsive by not having patterns in the number of hours of training that coincided with the patter of the implementation of the change into the majority of their field. Approximately 32 percent of the respondents reported no training during any year, although only 11 percent of the subjects did not participate in technical in-service over the five year period. The most popular methods of in-service training were manufacturer's workshops and seminars, reading technical publications, and college course-work. Factors influencing responsiveness were (1) educational attainment, (2) contact coordinator availability, (3) perception of their schools' ability to provide <b>salary</b> <b>adjustments,</b> (4) perception of their schools' ability to help in locating training sites, and (5) training site availability. It was concluded that training site availability, help in locating training sites, and contact coordinator availability were related to the use of training sites. <b>Salary</b> <b>adjustments</b> were perceived to be important to the non-responsive group but were perceived as unimportant by the responsive group. Individuals in the responsive group were more likely to have lower educational attainment than the non-responsive group. It was further concluded that Oregon community colleges need to designate and utilize a contact coordinator to coordinate in-service training. They also need to establish closer relationships with business and industry to facilitate better training site acquisition and utilization...|$|E
