40|$|The role of {{disturbance}} in community ecology {{has been studied}} extensively and is thought to free resources and reset successional sequences at the local scale and create heterogeneity at the regional scale. Most studies have investigated effects on either the disturbed patch or on the entire community, but have generally ignored any effect of or on the <b>community</b> <b>surrounding</b> disturbed patches. We used marine fouling communities to {{examine the effect of}} a <b>surrounding</b> <b>community</b> on species abundance within a disturbed patch and the effect of a disturbance on species abundance in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community.</b> We varied both the magnitude and pattern {{of disturbance}} on experimental settlement plates. Settlement plates were dominated by a non-native bryozoan, which may have established because of the large amount of initial space available on plates. Percent cover of each species within the patch were affected by the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community,</b> confirming previous studies??? predictions about edge effects from the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community</b> on dynamics within a patch. Disturbance resulted in lower percent cover in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community,</b> but there were no differences between magnitudes or spatial patterns of disturbance. Disturbance lowered population growth rates in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community,</b> potentially by altering the abiotic environment or species interactions. Following disturbance, the recovery of species within a patch may be affected by species in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community,</b> but the effects of a disturbance can extend beyond the patch and alter abundances in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community.</b> The dependence of patch dynamics on the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community</b> and the extended effects of disturbance on the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community,</b> suggest an important feedback of disturbance on patch dynamics indirectly via the <b>surrounding</b> <b>community...</b>|$|R

5|$|Temple-building {{continued}} into the third centuryAD, but as the empire weakened, imperial donations to the temple cults dried up. Cult activities continued, relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from <b>surrounding</b> <b>communities.</b> In the following centuries, Christian emperors issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples. Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples, as in the plundering of the Serapeum and other temples in Alexandria in AD 391 or 392. Through some combination of Christian coercion and loss of funds, temples ceased to function at various times. The last temple cults died out in the fourth through sixth centuriesAD, although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased.|$|E
