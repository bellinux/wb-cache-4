METHODS: In order to evaluate the performance of chip seal materials, the <b>sweep</b> <b>tests</b> and Vialit Plate Shock tests were conducted on the mixtures with five emulsion asphalt binders and three aggregate types. The <b>sweep</b> <b>tests</b> was intended to investigate the change of bonding properties between emulsion asphalt and aggregate with curing time. The Vialit Plate Shock test was used to evaluate the bonding properties of chip seal materials at low temperatures. RESULTS:Results from <b>sweep</b> <b>tests</b> showed that polymer modified emulsion asphalt can reduce the curing time by 1. 5 hour comparing with typical emulsion asphalt.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this study}} is the introduction of a method to quantify fatigue damage accumulation of asphalt binders using a short-duration test procedure that can be easily implemented into current practice. This was made possible by integrating results from the testing into an analysis procedure based on Viscoelastic Continuum Damage (VECD) concepts. The use of VECD analysis to characterize asphalt mixtures has been in use by researchers for a number of years, and it has been successfully applied in the field of asphalt mixtures to both monotonic and constant applied load amplitude cyclic (time <b>sweep)</b> <b>tests.</b> However, the application of these methods to asphalt binders has encountered a number of challenges. Monotonic testing of binders showed that, in some cases, the undamaged material response to loading is difficult to predict when some types of binder modification are used (e. g. polymers). The duration of time <b>sweep</b> <b>tests</b> is undefined, since it monitors the change in material properties with respect to number of loading cycles, and some high-performing binders can take many hours to show enough degradation to accurately assess their fatigue properties. These challenges in applying VECD concepts to binders have been resolved by using the Linear Amplitude <b>Sweep</b> (LAS) <b>test.</b> By selecting a specific ramping sequence of strains, and by combining the results with the results of a frequency sweep, {{it has been shown that}} estimation of the fatigue performance of asphalt binders can be correlated to mixture performance in the laboratory and to field fatigue performance. The accelerated loading scheme is found to give highly repeatable results and it takes less than 10 minutes to perform. The estimation of binder fatigue behavior was first validated against binder time <b>sweep</b> <b>testing,</b> followed by comparisons with asphalt mixture fatigue results, and finally with in-service (field) pavement fatigue performance. A subsequent draft standard procedure is provided, along with recommendations for inclusion of the LAS procedure for specification use...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibration}} load {{subjected to}} many products {{is the combination}} of several random processes corresponding to different application conditions, such as the various field road load inputs for automotive components.

It is therefore important to correctly correlate the <b>sweep</b> <b>test</b> to the field vibration. This work presents a tool for transferring the measured field random vibrations into a sinusoidal <b>sweep</b> <b>test</b> by using the damage equivalence technique.

As an alternative to classic bitumen modification with polymers, we herein propose the use of thiourea, which has proved to efficiently enhance the binder thermo-rheological properties in a broad temperature interval.
