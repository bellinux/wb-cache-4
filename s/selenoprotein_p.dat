During an investigation into whether SeIPLP was a bovine substitute for SeIP or uniquely bovine, its mRNA was found to consist of multiple variants with different length tandem repeat, namely p(0) with (CAYYCC) 11, p(− 4) lacking (CAYYCC) 4, p(− 8) lacking (CAYYCC) 8, and p(− 9) lacking (CAYYCC) 9. Although they were encoded on a single gene locus, neither classicalGT-AG nor minor classAT-AC donator-acceptor sequences for alternative splicing were identified. A subsequent S 1 protection assay using oligonucleotides, whose sequence may occur as variants, performed against bovine poly(A) +RNA identified a total of nine variants. Judging from the sequence of these variants and the branch point mapping, the consensus sequence for recognition of the donator was CACCCCCAC and of the acceptor and the branch point A nucleotide,ACCCCCAT orACCCCCATCCCCAT. Furthermore, when the p(0) insert mRNA was expressed in COS- 7 cells derived from an African green monkey kidney, cDNAs corresponding to p(− 8) and p(− 9) could be isolated. Therefore, the bovine SeIPLP mRNAs consisted of multiple variants probably due to a novel splicing mechanism which was not bovine-specific but common to other mammals...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{carried out}} in this thesis and the results obtained in this way {{are concerned with the}} prostate gland, an organ that during the last years has been increasingly affected by diseases. For this purpose analytical, biochemical methods and immunohistochemical procedures have been applied. By means of INAA the contents of the trace elements As, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Rb, Sb, Se and Zn were determined in the prostate and prostate cytosol of laboratory rats with a different selenium status. AAS and ICP-MS have been used to measure the concentration of the elements As, Cd, Cu, Mn and Se. The comparison of the data showed an inverse relationship between Se and As (The As concentration increased with decreasing Se levels). There was only a slight effect of the Se status on the contents of Fe and Zn, and no effect was observed with regard to the other elements investigated. Each of the methods applied was best suited to the determination of certain elements, but INAA as a method for multielement analysis was the most versatile procedure and should be applied in the first place. The proteins in the prostate cytosols of the rats with different selenium status and in the human prostate cell line Du 145 were separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). By online coupling of the HPLC with the inductively plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) the elements in the protein fractions were then determined by mass spectrometry. The chromatographic profiles obtained in this way for As, Co, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Sn and Zn in the rate prostate cytosols indicate that all these elements were bound to proteins. In case of the human cell line Du 145 Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Sn and Zn were analysed in the cytosolic fractions after the cells had been incubated separately with these elements. The chromatographic profiles demonstrated that these elements were likewise bound to proteins. As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se und Zn are known to be essential components of many redox enzymes. The elements Co, Ni and Sn were detected {{for the first time in}} the prostate cytosol. The results suggest that these elements may be components of proteins not yet identified. The investigation by light microscopy showed a decreased growth rate of the cells incubated with the different elements as compared with the control cells. This is understandable as these elements are slightly toxic in this concentrations without additional selenium supplementation. Experiments on rats with different selenium status labelled in vivo with 75 Se led to the identification of selenoproteins in the homogenates and in the nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal and cytosolic fractions by separation of the proteins by means of SDS-PAGE in these samples and determination of selenium in the proteins by means of autoradiography. In the Se(+) -animals as well as in the Se(-) -animals all selenoproteins present in the molecular mass range between 10 and 70 kDa were detected, whereas the distribution of the selenoprotein bands in the subcellular fractions and cytosols differed from micro organelle to micro organelle. The 2 D-electrophoresis with a very good resolution for the protein bands with PI-values between 3. 5 and 9. 0 and molecular masses between 10 kDa and approximately 80 kDa then allowed the accurate identification of these selenoprotein bands. The analysis of the protein expression in the homogenates of the Se(+) - and Se(-) -animals by using an appropriate computer program called Proteomweaver showed 42 differences in the expressed protein spots. 28 of these protein spots were expressed significantly stronger in the Se(+) - homogenate than in the Se(-) -homogenate. In the cytosol were 33 proteins differently expressed whereas in Se(+) -cytosol 17 proteins were expressed significantly stronger than in the Se(-) -cytosol. By tryptic fragmentation of some proteins spots (1 - 4) of the Se(+) -homogenate, determination of the masses of several peptides by MALDI-MS and comparison with the theoretical data for the peptides or proteins the proteins cGPx, carbonyl reductase 3, disulfid-isomerase and the tumor rejection antigen gp 96 were identified. The identification of some further proteins could not be completed in time to be included in this thesis. By means of immunochemical investigations several metal-containing proteins and selenoproteins were detected in the homogenate and in subcellular fractions of the prostate of adequately fed rats and in the homogenate of the prostate cell line Du 145. The used antibodies adjusted against defined proteins, showed positive signals for the <b>selenoproteins</b> Sel <b>P,</b> Sel T, cGPx and the acid 15 kDa-selenoprotein, which is a specific prostatic protein as well as for the metal-containing proteins MT, LOX, SOD and for dermatopontin, a protein which for the first time was identified as a Cu- containing protein. By application of chromatographic procedures the known protein dermatopontin was purified from pork skin and antibodies against this protein were produced which were applied in the detection of this protein in several fractions of the prostate. After production of 64 Cu in the BER II (HMI), the isolated proteins LOX and dermatopontin, proteins, treated with EDTA prior to the incubation, were incubated with 64 Cu and separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein-bound tracer was then determined in both proteins by autoradiography. The result confirmed our hypothesis that dermatopontin may be a Cu-binding protein and suggests that dermatopontin is a Cu-supplier for the Cu-Enzyme LOX, a Cu-binding protein which co-eluates with Dermatopontin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSelenoprotein P and {{glutathione}} peroxidase are selenoproteins that are synthesized by hepatocytes.

40|$|Abstract Selenium is an {{essential}} micronutrient that function through selenoproteins. Selenium deficiency results in lower concentrations of selenium and selenoproteins. The brain maintains it's selenium better than other tissues under low-selenium conditions. Recently, the selenium-containing protein <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> (Sepp) {{has been identified as}} a possible transporter of selenium. The targeted disruption of the <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> gene (Sepp 1) results in decreased brain selenium concentration and neurological dysfunction, unless selenium intake is excessive However, the effect of <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> deficiency on the processes of memory formation and synaptic plasticity is unknown. In the present studies Sepp 1 (-/-) mice and wild type littermate controls (Sepp 1 (+/+)) fed a high-selenium diet (1 mg Se/kg) were used to characterize activity, motor coordination, and anxiety as well as hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.

Sepp−/ − mice fed a normal or low selenium diet develop severe motor impairment and die, but Sepp−/ − mice fed a high selenium diet remain clinically unimpaired. As an initial step to evaluate the effect of <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> deletion on central nervous system architecture, the brains and cervical spinal cords of Sepp−/ − and Sepp+/+ mice fed low or high selenium diets were examined by light and electron microscopy.

No axonal lesions were observed in the Sepp+/+ mice fed either diet. Electron microscopy demonstrated that the enlarged axons in the Sepp−/ − mice were packed with organelles, suggesting a deficit in fast axonal transport. The similar severity of axonal lesions observed in Sepp−/ − mice fed the 2 diets suggests that axonal dystrophy is a common phenotype for deletion of <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> regardless of selenium intake and that additional studies {{will be required to}} determine the pathogenesis of the neurological signs and mortality observed in Sepp−/− mice fed a low selenium diet...|$|E

40|$|Selenocysteine is {{incorporated}} into proteins via “recoding” of UGA from a stop codon {{to a sense}} codon, a process that requires specific secondary structures in the 3 ′ untranslated region, termed selenocysteine incorporation sequence (SECIS) elements, and the protein factors that they recruit. Whereas most selenoprotein mRNAs contain a single UGA codon and a single SECIS element, <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> genes encode multiple UGAs and two SECIS elements. We have identified evolutionary adaptations in <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> genes {{that contribute to the}} efficiency of incorporating multiple selenocysteine residues in this protein.

Further investigations on trangenic mice with neuron-specific inactivation of selenoprotein biosynthesis support a role for selenoproteins in brain development. It is still unclear whether mutations in selenoproteins or disturbed selenoprotein expression represents a pathogenetic mechanism in human neurodegenerative disease. A group of children suffering from inborn intractable seizures without any known cause, but with low plasma selenium levels, showed a significant clinical improvement when supplemented adequately with selenium. Therefore, we hypothesized that a disruption in the biosynthesis of selenoproteins could be responsible for the neuronal disfunction observed in these patients. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to analyze their genes for <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> as well as those for four other essential cofactors in selenocysteine metabolism: the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor EFSec; SBP 2 and RPL 30, proteins involved into the selenocysteine insertion into the peptide chain; and the ß-lyase Scly, catalyzing the decomposition of selenocysteine. Apart from some synonymous base exchanges in the translated parts and some heterozygous polymorphisms in the untranslated regions of the studied genes, several already published single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found in some of the patients. In spite of their high allelic frequency in the general population, neither a relevance due to compound heterozygocity nor an influence on protein expression by a modified gene regulation can be fully excluded.

40|$|International audienceImmunoaffinity {{chromatography}} {{has been}} investigated for fractionation of serum into selenoalbumin and true selenoproteins. Among several albumin-depletion kits tested, a multiaffinity column specifically binding albumin and five other major serum proteins provided the best results. It extracted ca 95 % of both albumin and selenoalbumin, which enabled interference-free determination of glutathione peroxidase, <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P,</b> and selenoalbumin by size-exclusion chromatography combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC-ICPMS). The efficiency of the multiaffinity column did not vary {{over a period of}} 18 months. The purity of fractions separated by immunoaffinity LC was confirmed by elution-volume matching with standards in SEC-ICPMS and by selenopeptide mapping in capillary HPLC-ICPMS. Quantification of the selenium distribution among the different proteins in human serum from a control group and from a person on a selenium-rich diet revealed that 67 % of the supplemented selenium was incorporated into albumin, 30 % into glutathione peroxidase, and 3 % into <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} of selenium in mammals has been recently {{shown to be}} mediated primarily by <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P.</b> Even {{in the absence of}} <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P,</b> selenium is distributed from the liver into all organs and tissues when supplemented in the diet. The form of selenium that is actively taken up by mammalian cells at trace concentrations has yet to be determined. We used a human keratinocyte model to determine whether reduction of the oxyanion selenite (SeO 32 -) to the more reduced form of selenide (HSe−) would affect uptake. Indeed a reduced form of selenium, presumably selenide, was actively transported into keratinocytes and displayed saturation kinetics with an apparent Km of 279 nM. ATPase inhibitors blocked the uptake of selenide, as did the competing anions molybdate and chromate, but not sulfate. These results suggest that the small molecule form of selenium that is distributed in tissues is hydrogen selenide, despite its sensitivity to oxygen and reactivity to thiols...|$|E

40|$|Objectives : This {{study was}} carried out to examine {{protective}} effect of wild ginseng extract on HepG 2 human hepatoma cell line against tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) -induced oxidative damage. Methods : To evaluate protective effect of wild ginseng extract against t-BHP induced cytotoxicity, LDH level and activity of glutathione peroxidase and reductase were measured. Gene expression was also measured using DNA microarray. Results : Wild ginseng extract showed a significant protective effect against t-BHP-induced cytotoxicity in HepG 2 cell line. It is not, however, related with the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Analysis of gene expression using DNA chip, demonstrated that 28 genes were up-regulated in t-BHP only group. Five genes - <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P,</b> glutathione peroxidase 3, sirtuin 2, peroxiredoxin 2, serfiredoxin 1 homolog - may be related with the protective effect of wild ginseng extract. Conclusions : Based on the results, a protective effect of wild ginseng extract against t-BHP-induced oxidative damage in HepG 2 cell line is not associated with the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, but with the expression of <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P,</b> glutathione peroxidase 3, sirtuin 2, peroxiredoxin 2, and serfiredoxin 1 homolog...|$|E
40|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{constitutes a}} risk factor for the incidence and negative course of severe diseases including sepsis, stroke, autoimmune diseases or cancer. In this study, hypoxia is identified as a powerful stimulus to redirect selenoprotein biosynthesis causing reduced <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> expression and diminished selenium export from hepatocytes in favour of increased biosynthesis of the essential protective intracellular phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase GPX 4. Specifically, hypoxia decreases transcript concentrations of central factors controlling selenium and selenocysteine metabolism including selenophosphate synthetase- 2, phosphoseryl-tRNASerSec kinase and selenocysteine lyase, which are all proven to be rate-limiting enzymes in selenoprotein biosynthesis. These effects are paralleled by a general decline of selenoprotein expression; however, not all selenoproteins are affected to the same extent by hypoxia, and GPX 4 constitutes an exception as its expression becomes slightly increased. Supplemental selenium is able to overcome the hypoxia-dependent down regulation of selenoprotein expression in our cell culture model system, supporting the concept of using selenium as an adjuvant treatment option in severe diseases. Although it remains to be tested whether these effects constitute a hepatocyte-specific response, the selenium-dependent decline of <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> biosynthesis under hypoxic conditions may explain the progressive selenium deficit developing in severe diseases.

Thirty-one patients with CD were enrolled in this study. All patients were placed on an enteral nutrition regimen with Elental® (Ajinomoto pharmaceutical. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Serum selenium, zinc and copper concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Serum <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> levels were determined by an ELISA system. Average serum levels of albumin, selenium, zinc and copper were 4. 1 ± 0. 4 g/dl, 11. 2 ± 2. 8 µg/dl, 71. 0 ± 14. 8 µg/dl, and 112. 0 ± 25. 6 µg/dl, respectively. In 9 patients of 31 CD patients, serum albumin levels were lower than the lower limit of the normal range. Serum selenium, zinc and copper levels were lower than lower limits in 12 patients, 9 patients and 1 patient, respectively. Serum selenium levels significantly correlated with both serum <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> levels and glutathione peroxidase activity. Supplementation of selenium (100 µg/day) and zinc (10 mg/day) for 2 months significantly improved the trace element status in CD patients. In conclusion, serum selenium and zinc levels are lower in many CD patients on long-term enteral nutrition. In these patients, supplementation of selenium and zinc was effective in improving the trace element status...|$|E
40|$|Selenium is {{essential}} in mammalian embryonic development. However, in adults, selenoprotein levels in several organs including liver can be substantially reduced by selenium deficiency without any apparent change in phenotype. To address the role of selenoproteins in liver function, mice homozygous for a floxed allele encoding the selenocysteine (Sec) tRNA [Ser]Sec gene were crossed with transgenic mice carrying the Cre recombinase {{under the control of}} the albumin promoter that expresses the recombinase specifically in liver. Recombination was nearly complete in mice 3 weeks of age, whereas liver selenoprotein synthesis was virtually absent, which correlated with the loss of Sec tRNA [Ser]Sec and activities of major selenoproteins. Total liver selenium was dramatically decreased, whereas levels of low molecular weight selenocompounds were little affected. Plasma <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> levels were reduced by about 75 %, suggesting that <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> is primarily exported from the liver. Glutathione S-transferase levels were elevated in the selenoprotein-deficient liver, suggesting a compensatory activation of this detoxification program. Mice appeared normal until about 24 h before death. Most animals died between 1 and 3 months of age. Death appeared to be due to severe hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis with concomitant necrosis of peritoneal and retroperitoneal fat. These studies revealed an essential role of selenoproteins in liver function...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} found that mercury (Hg) {{exposure}} is associated with selenium (Se) accumulation in vivo. However, human studies are limited. To study the interaction between Se and Hg, we investigated the total Se and Hg concentrations in body fluids and serum Se-containing proteins in individuals exposed to high concentrations of Hg. Our objective was to elucidate the possible roles of serum Se and selenoproteins in transporting and binding Hg in human populations. We collected data from 72 subjects: 35 had very low Hg exposure as evidenced by mean Hg concentrations of 0. 91 and 1. 25 ng/mL measured in serum and urine, respectively; 37 had high exposure (mean Hg concentrations of 38. 5 and 86. 8 ng/mL measured in serum and urine, respectively). An association between Se and Hg was found in urine (r = 0. 625; p < 0. 001) but not in serum. Hg exposure may affect Se concentrations and selenoprotein distribution in human serum. Expression of both <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was greatly increased in Hg miners. These increases were accompanied by elevated Se concentrations in serum. In addition, <b>selenoprotein</b> <b>P</b> bound more Hg at higher Hg exposure concentrations. Biochemical observations revealed that both GSH-Px activity and malondialdehyde concentrations increased in serum of the Hg-exposed group. This study aids in the understanding of the interaction between Se and Hg. Selenoproteins play tw...|$|E
