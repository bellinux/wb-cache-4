Pressure from London sugar merchants fearing a decline in sugar prices forced a series of negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less {{than a year after}} Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for Cuba on France's recommendation to Spain, The French advised that declining the offer could result in Spain losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British. This led to disappointment in Britain, as many believed that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and Britain's other gains in the war.|$|E

2500|$|Countries rich in {{resources}} - such as Congo - {{have been}} affected by the phenomenon called [...] "resource curse". This is a phenomenon where countries that are rich in resources have worse economic development than countries that have fewer resources. This phenomenon does not allow for the Congolese to have a balanced and <b>sustained</b> <b>development.</b> It also indicates a clear relationship between the wealth of resources [...] "…and the likelihood of weak democratic development, corruption, and civil war". Such high levels of corruption lead to great political instability and issues because whoever controls the assets (mainly the political leaders, and the government in Congo) can use them to their own benefit. These resources generate wealth for these people which they use to stay in power [...] "…either through legal means, or coercive ones (e.g. funding militias)". The rise in the importance of coltan as a mineral crucial to technological products [...] "occurred as warlords and armies in the eastern Congo converted artisanal mining operations…into slave labour regimes to earn hard currency to finance their militias". When much of eastern Congo came under the control of Rwandan forces from the 1990s, Rwanda became a major exporter of coltan, benefiting from the weakness of the Congolese government.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue conceptually, that {{globalization}} entails challenges, opportunities and realities. It integrates and extends existing theory, focusing on the three pillars of sustainable development into a general framework presenting the fundamental importance of sustainable development strategies in a globalized world. Moreover, the objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework for globalization and how <b>development</b> can be <b>sustained.</b> A critical review of the multidisciplinary literature on globalization and sustainable development reveals a lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding sustainable development and accompanying strategies for <b>sustaining</b> <b>development.</b> Through a schematic representation of the relationships of the three pillars of sustainable development the paper concludes that a lasting solution to the impact of globalization on sustainable development can be crafted when current debate shifts from theory to the development of strategies to <b>sustain</b> <b>development.</b> The model if empirically evaluated, could serve as a blue print to guide policy and global discourse on how to achieve sustainable development; particularly so in developing economies...|$|R
