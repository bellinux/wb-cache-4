40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{an outbreak of}} multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections (MRPA-BSI) {{that occurred in the}} haematology ward of a tertiary academic hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, and determine risk factors for acquisition of MRPA-BSI. Methods: The outbreak investigation included a search for additional cases, review of patient records, environmental and <b>staff</b> <b>screening,</b> molecular typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multi-locus sequencing (MLST) and a retrospective case-control study. Results: Ten MRPA-BSI cases occurred in the haematology ward between January 2010 and January 2011. The case fatality rate was 80 %. <b>Staff</b> <b>screening</b> specimens were negative for MRPA and an environmental source was not identified. PFGE showed that 9 / 10 isolates were related. MLST showed that 3 of these 9 isolates belonged to Sequence type (ST) 233 while the unrelated isolate belonged to ST 260. Conclusion: We have described an outbreak of MRPA-BSI occurring {{over an extended period of}} time among neutropenic haematology patients.

Neonatal outbreaks have already been reported; however, our outbreak highlights the potential for SSSS following neonatal health promotion measures such as intra-muscular vitamin K administration and metabolic screening (heel prick) as well as effective case containment measures {{and the value of}} <b>staff</b> <b>screening.</b> Between February and June 2007, five confirmed cases of neonatal SSSS were identified in full-term neonates born in an Irish regional maternity hospital. All infants were treated successfully. Analysis of contact and environmental screening was undertaken, including family members and healthcare workers. Molecular typing on isolates was carried out. An outbreak control team (OCT) was assembled and took successful prospective steps to prevent further cases. All five Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested positive for exfoliative toxin A, of which two distinct strains were identified on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. Two cases followed staphylococcal inoculation during preventive measures such as intra-muscular vitamin K administration and metabolic screening (heel prick). None of the neonatal isolates were methicillin resistant. Of 259 hospital staff (70 % of staff) screened, 30 % were colonised with S. aureus, and 6 % were positive for MRSA carriage. This is the first reported outbreak of neonatal SSSS in Ireland. Effective case containment measures and clinical value of OCT is demonstrated.

40|$|Objectives: To {{report an}} {{outbreak}} of colonization with linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in an intensive therapy unit (ITU). Methods: An outbreak of colonization with linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis affecting 16 patients in an ITU was investigated using PFGE. Environmental and <b>staff</b> <b>screening</b> was carried out {{as part of the}} investigation. Usage of linezolid in the hospital and in the ITU was reviewed. Resistant strains were screened for the presence of the G 2576 T mutation using PCR-RFLP genotyping. The interventions made to control the outbreak were restriction of linezolid prescription and specific infection control measures, including isolation of colonized patients and increased environmental cleaning. Results: Linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis strains from the 16 colonized patients were genetically related. The same strain was also cultured from environmental samples in the ITU. An increase in linezolid usage in the hospital and in the ITU occurred in the 6 months prior to the emergence of the resistant strain. Infection control measures and restriction of linezolid prescription controlled the outbreak. All resistant isolates contained the G 2576 T mutation.

40|$|International audienceMeticillin-resistant (MRSA) {{infections are}} of {{increasing}} importance to clinicians, public health agencies and governments. Prevention and control strategies must address sources in healthcare settings, {{the community and}} livestock. This document presents the conclusions of a European Consensus Conference {{on the role of}} screening and decolonisation in the control of MRSA infection. The conference was held in Rome on 5 - 6 March 2010 and was organised jointly by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the International Society of Chemotherapy (ISC). In an environment where MRSA is endemic, universal or targeted screening of patients to detect colonisation was considered to be an essential pillar of any MRSA control programme, along with the option of decolonising carriers dependent on relative risk of infection, either to self or others, in a specific setting. <b>Staff</b> <b>screening</b> may be useful but is problematic as it needs to distinguish between transient carriage and longer-term colonisation. The consequences of identification of MRSA-positive staff may have important effects on morale and the ability to maintain staffing levels. The role of environmental contamination in MRSA infection is unclear, but screening may be helpful as an audit of hygiene procedures. In all situations, screening procedures and decolonisation carry a significant cost burden, the clinical value of which requires careful evaluation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{relationship}} between love of money, pressure to perform and unethical marketing behavior in the cosmetic industry in Uganda. The methodology was cross-sectional and correlational. A questionnaire was administered to collect data on a sample of 169 marketers selected randomly from five cosmetic companies in Uganda. Results indicate that if the salespersons are willing to perform unprofessional assignments for monetary gain or if they have a burning desire for success regardless of how they should succeed, this is bound to result into unethical marketing behavior. Furthermore, the present study reveals that as pressure to perform increases through the achievement of targets and deadlines, unethical behavior increases and moves in the same direction as a result of the effect. Unrealistic targets combined with fixed deadlines promote and strengthen unethical marketing behavior. Thus love of money through its components, Success, Motivator, Evil, Budget and Equity can be moderated by management control - as management control improves, unethical marketing behavior is minimized. Even if the cosmetics industry in Uganda is very much in its infancy with only five manufacturers and this may limit generalizability, this study argues that companies should employ staff with good working experience in the marketing profession and there should be continuous <b>staff</b> <b>screening</b> of their behaviors over the years.

40|$|Background: Major {{depression}} and delirium are prevalent, underrecognized, and undertreated in hospice and palliative care settings. Furthermore, {{they are both}} associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Objective: A screening study of patients receiving inpatient hospice care was conducted {{in order to determine}} the ease of screening for {{depression and}} delirium in patients with advanced, life-threatening illnesses by hospice social workers and nurses, respectively. Methods: A two-question depression screening tool was administered to 20 consecutive patients on admission to a hospice general inpatient care center by social work staff during their initial assessment. A delirium-screening tool was administered daily to 22 consecutive patients admitted to the ICC daily by nursing <b>staff.</b> <b>Screening</b> results were collected, as were patient and staff feelings about the burden of the screening process. Results: Of the 20 patients screened on admission for depression by social work, 70 % (14 / 20) screened positive. Of the 22 patients screened daily for delirium by nursing, 64 % (14 / 22) screened positive at least once during their admission. Screening for both conditions was considered relatively easy to accomplish by the hospice staff. There were no significant associations between a positive screen of depression or delirium and patient gender, age, ethnicity, terminal diagnosis, or marital status. Discussion: These results support the notion that depression and delirium are very common in hospice in-patients, and that screening for both is relatively easy and practical for hospice clinicians to conduct.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The low {{prevalence}} of infection and colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in The Netherlands is ascribed {{to a national}} "search-and-destroy" policy. We describe the measures that were implemented to control widespread MRSA colonization and infection in a Dutch hospital. DESIGN. Descriptive intervention study. SETTING. Teaching medical center with a capacity of 679 beds, including 16 intensive care beds. INTERVENTIONS. MRSA colonization and infection were identified using conventional culture with a selective broth. Isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Measures to control the epidemic included screening of contacts (patients and hospital <b>staff),</b> <b>screening</b> of patients at readmission or discharge, strict isolation of MRSA-positive patients, decolonization of colonized staff and patients, {{the development of an}} electronic signal identifying MRSA-positive patients, {{and the development of a}} culture information-system for hospital personnel. results. Awareness of uncontrolled dissemination of MRSA began in November 2001. Because the clone involved had a low minimum inhibitory concentration for oxacillin, at first it was not recognized as MRSA. In February 2002, when major screening efforts started, it appeared that MRSA had spread all over the hospital and that many staff members were colonized. By the end of December 2005, a total of 600 patients and 135 staff members were found to be newly colonized. The yearly incidence of cases of MRSA colonization and infection decreased from 351 in 2002 to 56 in 2005. Typing of the isolates showed that 3 MRSA clones were predominant. Outbreaks of colonization involving these clones did not occur after 2003. CONCLUSION. Our observations show that strict application of "search-and-destroy" measures can effectively control a huge epidemic of MRSA colonization and infection...|$|E

Although many older people can maintain a reasonable diet, {{those who do not}} are at nutritional risk. Left unaddressed, nutritional risk can lead to the state of malnutrition, a harmful condition that is difficult to treat. Malnutrition screening can lead to improved nutritional status by identifying and addressing risk factors. However, malnutrition is often overlooked in this population as indicated by an estimated prevalence of 10 - 30 %. Accredited Practising Dietitians were invited to complete an online survey regarding screening practices. At the end of the survey, dietitians were presented with two open questions asking them to specify perceived enablers and barriers to malnutrition screening within their organisation. Responses to these questions yielded considerable data that warranted separate reporting which is presented here. Ninety-two dietitians provided written comments to the open-ended survey questions. Textual data were analysed and reviewed by two authors using content analysis, resulting in four key categories of organisational, <b>staff,</b> <b>screening</b> and CLOA factors. Although the majority of dietitians (80 %) indicated screening occurred within their organisation, a higher proportion of responses related to barriers.

Trained pathology <b>staff</b> <b>screened</b> participants for DR using undilated, non-stereoscopic colour fundus photography. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients who spoke English, were aged at least 12 years, had type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and did not undertake biannual DR screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of patients who {{do not participate in}} biannual DR screening; proportion of patients who accept DR screening while attending a PCC; proportion of gradable images; patient acceptance of the screening model; and effectiveness of the follow-up pathway. RESULTS: Over 6 months, 289 English-speaking patients with diabetes attended the PCC, of whom 99 (34. 3 %) had not undertaken biannual DR screening. Of these, 93 (93. 9 %) accepted our screening service. Overall, retinal images were sufficient for interpretation in 88 patients (94. 6 %) and the median time for photography was 6 minutes (interquartile range, 10 minutes).

Methods. Inpatients {{with a history of}} MRSA infection or colonization enrolled between December 2010 and September 2011 were randomized to either passive (nonintervention arm; n = 202; observation with local standard of care) or active screening (intervention arm; n = 405; study <b>staff</b> <b>screened</b> using culture and commercial PCR). The primary outcome was discontinuation of CPs by trial arm based on 3 negative cultures. In the intervention arm, sen-sitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the first PCR were compared to cultures. Results. CPs were discontinued significantly more often (rate ratio [RR], 4. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 3 %– 7. 1 %) in the intervention arm, including in an intent-to-screen analysis (RR, 2. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 5 %– 4. 7 %).
