40|$|A cycled {{aerospace}} nickel hydrogen (Ni/H 2) cell {{was subjected}} to destructive physical analysis to determine the reason for a capacity loss after 5, 967 cycles at 60 percent depth of discharge. The positive plates in the cell were analyzed in terms of chemical composition, active material utilization, charge efficiency, and thickness increase. The microstructure of {{a cross section of}} the positive plate was determined by backscattered electron image analysis. The results suggest that the capacity loss in the cell is caused by low charge acceptance and low active material utilization at the positive plate. The oxidized nickel species content of the positive plate increased due to corrosion of the nickel <b>sintered</b> <b>skeleton.</b> This appears to circumvent the orderly reaction of the active material. Microstructural analysis has indicated that a new phase of active material is formed with cycling...|$|E
40|$|We {{study in}} this paper the {{conversion}} of CaO-based CO 2 sorbents when subjected to repeated carbonation/calcination cycles {{with a focus on}} thermally pretreated/doped sorbents. Analytical equations are derived to describe the evolution of conversion with the cycle number from a unifying model based on the balance between surface area loss due to sintering in the loopingcalcination stage and surface area regeneration as a consequence of solid-state diffusion during the looping-carbonation stage. Multicyclic CaO conversion is governed by the evolution of surface area loss/regeneration that strongly depends on the initial state of the pore skeleton. In the case of thermally pretreated sorbents, the initial pore skeleton is highly sintered and regeneration is relevant whereas, for nonpretreated sorbents, the initial pore skeleton is soft and regeneration is negligible. Experimental results are obtained for sorbents subjected to a preheating controlled rate thermal analysis (CRTA) program. By applying this preheating program in a CO 2 enriched atmosphere, CaO can be subjected to a rapid carbonation followed by a slow rate controlled decarbonation, which yields a highly <b>sintered</b> <b>skeleton</b> displaying a small conversion in the first cycle and self-reactivation in the next ones. Conversely, carbonation of the sorbent at a slow controlled rate enhances CO 2 solid-state diffusion, which gives rise, after a quick decarbonation, to a highly porous skeleton. In this case, CaO conversion in the first cycle is very large but it decays abruptly in subsequent cycles. Data on CaO conversion retrieved from the literature and from further experimental measurements performed in our work are analyzed as influenced by a variety of experimental variables such as preheating temperature program, preheating exposition time, atmosphere composition, presence of additives, and carbonation/calcination conditions. Conversion data are well fitted by the proposed model equations, which are of help for a quantitative interpretation on the effect of experimental conditions on the multicyclic sorbent performance as a function of sintering/ regeneration parameters inferred from the fittings and allow foreseeing the critical conditio...|$|E

40|$|Spherical Nb-Ti based {{alloy powder}} was {{prepared}} by the combination of plasma spheroidization and mechanical alloying. Phase constituents, microstructure and surface state of the powder, and pore characteristics of the resulting porous alloy were investigated. The {{results show that the}} undissolved W and V in the mechanically alloyed powder is fully alloyed after spheroidization, and single Î² phase is achieved. Particle size of the spheroidized powder is in the range of 20 â 110 Â Î¼m. With the decrease of particle size, a transformation from typical dendrite solidification structure to fine cell microstructure occurs. The surface of the spheroidized powder is coated by a layer of oxides consisting mainly of TiO 2 and Nb 2 O 5. Probabilities of sinter-neck formation and particle coalescence increases with increasing <b>sintering</b> temperature. Porous <b>skeleton</b> with relatively homogeneous pore distribution and open pore channel is formed after vacuum sintering at 1700 Â Â°C, and the porosity is 32 %. The sintering kinetic analysis indicates that grain boundary diffusion is the primary mass transport mechanism during sintering process.

The microstructural study, analyses of thermal diffusivity, as well as copper- and oxygen concentration of W-Cu composites were carried out {{using a combination of}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser flash method and chemical composition analysis respectively. The results indicate that the addition of BTO can increase the porosity of the W-skeleton. As a consequence, copper concentration can be increased in W-Cu composites. The other beneficial effect is the formation of an open pore structure with the addition of BTO. The relative density is higher than 99 % for W- 25 Cu composites with the addition of BTO and the corresponding theoretical thermal conductivity is 231 W/(m K). Furthermore, the BTO addition does not result in any increase of oxygen content of the W-skeleton. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTitanium and its alloy foams {{have been}} {{receiving}} a growing interest for biomedical industry {{due to their}} biocompatibility and high potential in dental, spinal, joint and hip implant applications. Near net shape production and reproducibility of a product require {{a full understanding of}} the processing parameters' effect on manufacturing and final properties. The shape complexity of titanium surgical implants, for example dental implants, necessitates a good control in compaction and <b>sintering</b> of metal <b>skeletons</b> containing macropores for near-net shape manufacturing. In this study, effects of processing parameters such as spacer powder size and amount on compaction, sintering and final structural properties were investigated. Commercially pure cellular titanium with porosities ranging between 35 and 75 % and pore sizes between 100 mu m and a few millimeters were produced via powder metallurgy with spacers. Architectural parameters of the foams, before and after sintering, were quantitatively characterized via X-ray computed microtomography. Addition of fine spacer powders enhanced compaction and densification of the foam structure. Pore walls were observed to get thicker during sintering. The use of coarser space holders resulted in thicker pore walls and a wider pore wall thickness distribution. The results indicated that strength and stiffness tend to increase with increasing pore size. Among the structural features that spacer size altered, pore wall thickness and pore face roughness were found to be the most dominant effects on strength and stiffness. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Three-Dimensional Printing (3 DP) {{is a solid}} {{freeform}} fabrication process being developed for the direct manufacture of functional tooling and prototypes from a computer solid model. One of its many important applications is the fabrication of metal tooling for plastic injection molding. In order to achieve a fully dense 3 DP metal tool, the <b>sintered</b> powder <b>skeleton</b> is infiltrated with a molten alloy, which has a melting point lower than the skeleton material. However, the choices of materials systems are limited by the interactions of the metal powders and infiltrants during the infiltration process. Currently, the materials system with the best wear resistance for 3 DP metal tooling consists of 420 stainless steel powder and bronze infiltrant. However, it only has an overall hardness of 25 HRC because the bronze infiltrant is soft and not hardenable. A hardenable 3 DP metal system is desirable. The main goals of this thesis research are: 1) to improve the flexibility of choice of metal powders and infiltrants by using a diffusion barrier to isolate them; and 2) to demonstrate the diffusion-barrier approach with steel and hardenable copper-alloy infiltrant. The model materials systems in this study consist of stainless steel and tool steel powder skeletons with Cu- 20 Ni- 20 Mn infiltrant. It was demonstrated that TiN coating deposited on steel substrates by CVD successfully prevented the reaction between the steel and molten Cu- 20 Ni- 20 Mn at 1200 ° C. In general, TiN coating on tool-steel substrates demonstrated better diffusion-barrier behavior than the stainless-steel substrates. The optimum thickness of the TiN coating {{was determined to be}} in the range of 0. 5 to 1 [mu]m. Fracture strength of the TiN coating as high as 560 MPa can be achieved for a 0. 5 [mu]m thick TiN coating on 440 C stainless steel bar. A 0. 8 [mu]m TiN-coated H 13 tool-steel powder skeleton was successfully infiltrated with Cu- 20 Ni- 20 Mn infiltrant. Age hardening at 450 ° C for one day resulted in a high macrohardness of 40 HRC, surpassing the current 3 DP metal system for injection molding tooling. Future works on the study of other diffusion barrier materials and fluidized-bed CVD for metal powders could result in more 3 DP metal systems with better properties and ease of processing. by Cheong Wing Yuen.

40|$|Biocompatible {{artificial}} cellular ceramics {{can be used}} as scaffolds for {{tissue engineering}} in substitution of natural bone, in force of a better reproducibility of the microstructure, potentially higher mechanical performance and ease of forming components of the desired geometry. An innovative gel-casting procedure was selected for the production of both dense and highly porous (about 60 %) structures made of pure hydroxyapatite (Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2, HA). Suspensions of commercially available HA powders (solid loading of 60 - 68 wt. %), were mixed with solutions of 2 wt % agar, selected as gelling agent. The slurries were cast into PMMA molds under vacuum, and gelation occurred during slow cooling down to room temperature. The gelled specimens were de-molded and dried in controlled relative humidity conditions. For the production of porous components, commercial polyethylene spheres (355 - 420 µm diameter) were used as pore-forming agents and added to the suspensions before casting. After drying, samples were submitted to a controlled thermal treatment for the decomposition of the organic compounds and the densification of the ceramic <b>skeleton.</b> <b>Sintering</b> was performed at 1280 °C for 3 h. A complete mechanical characterization was carried out both on dense and porous samples. Uniaxial compression, four point bending and indentation tests were performed in order to determine Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile stress, compressive strength and fracture toughness (KIC). Microstructural characterization evidenced the presence of spherical macro-pores, yielded by PE decomposition, and a diffused micro-porosity on the HA walls, caused by incomplete densification during sintering. A digital image based finite element analysis (DIB-FEA) procedure was applied to gel-cast cellular ceramics. Such an approach allows to build up a FE model that includes all the relevant microstructural features of a material (distribution of pores, presence of isolated defects, micro-cracks…) starting directly from real micrographs of its cross-sections. A simulation of the mechanical behavior or real components can thus be carried out on the designed model. A good agreement was evidenced between experimentally derived and calculated values of elastic modulus, thus validating the simulation procedure and opening the way to the possibility of predicting the mechanical behavior of cellular components characterized by different amounts of macro-porosity...|$|R
40|$|Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) is {{a process}} for the rapid {{fabrication}} of three dimensional parts directly from computer models. A solid object is created by printing a sequence of two dimensional layers. The creation of each layer involves the spreading of {{a thin layer of}} powdered material followed by the selective joining of powder in the layer by printing binder material. In the current process, metal skeletons are produced by printing a polymeric binder into stainless steel powder. Subsequent heat treatments de-bind and lightly <b>sinter</b> the printed <b>skeletons</b> which are then infiltrated with a molten metal alloy to make a final part. The growth of the necks during the sintering step causes a shrinkage of the part which, in general, is not uniform and has a certain amount of error associated with it. With this method, the magnitude of the shrinkage is 1. 5 % and the uncertainty is 0. 2 %. The 3 DP process can compensate for predicted shrinkage by beginning with a larger part. However, the uncertainty in the amount of shrinkage causes loss of dimensional control of the parts. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} improve the dimensional control of metal parts produced by 3 D Printing. The current work investigates the reduction of the average shrinkage by eliminating the sintering in the base powder. The concept under investigation is an alternative method of forming the skeleton where metallic necks are formed from material printed in a binder slurry. The material in the binder is a < 3 [mu]m fine slurry of a 1) metal and activator, 2) nickel braze, or 3) a eutectic metalloid. In category 1), one promising binder slurry for tungsten skeletons is 1 [mu]m W with 0. 5 wt% lpmNi, which achieved 68. 5 ± 6. 3 % density and 26. 6 ± 2. 3 % linear shrinkage at 1200 °C, 1 hour. Two < 5 [mu]m powders, W with wt%: 13 Ni, 4. 9 Fe, 3 Co and W with wt%: 13 Ni, 4. 9 Fe, 3 Co, 0. 06 B, were more than 90 % dense under the same conditions. In category 2), a 66 [mu]m Mo skeleton with a 9 wt% Nickel Phosphorus binder (wt%: 11 P) had a linear shrinkage of 0. 02 + 0. 18 and a 31 [mu]m Mo skeleton with this binder shrank 0. 30 ± 0. 17 %, both at 1025 °C for 1 hour. These shrinkages are comparable to those of a reference AgNO 3 salt binder (0. 35 ± 0. 01 % and 0. 14 ± 0. 03 %, respectively), though the uncertainties are much higher. In category 3), AuGe was selected from a set of criteria for experiments. Investigation of a 66 [mu]m Mo skeleton with 2 vol% 30 - 100 [mu]m AuGe fired at 700 °C for 1 hour show that fracture occurs at the Mo and Mo-AuGe interface rather than in the necks themselves. This is due to Ge diffusion into the Mo powder. by Diana Buttz. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2001.
