40|$|Methods: Nine volunteers wearing {{standardised}} {{clothing and}} rigid neck collars were secured on to a backboard and vacuum mattress using a standard strapping arrangement. An operating department table {{was used to}} tilt the volunteers from 45 degrees head up to 45 degrees head down, and additionally 45 degrees laterally. Movements of the head, sternum, and pubic <b>symphysis</b> (<b>pelvis)</b> from a fixed position were then recorded. The comfort level during the procedure was assessed using a 10 point numerical rating scale (NRS) where 1 =no pain and 10 =worst pain imaginable...|$|E
40|$|In this study, three {{adult male}} {{hedgehogs}} (Erinaceus europaeus Linnaeus) {{were used to}} investigate the bones of hind limb. The spina iliaca ventralis caudalis was absent. The <b>symphysis</b> <b>pelvis</b> was formed by symphysis pubis {{and it was an}} interpubic ligamentous tissue in hedgehogs. The average Vialleton angle was measured as (8 º). Average distance between the midacetabulum and tuber coxae was 39. 2 mm and average distance between the midacetabulum and ischial tuberosity (tuber ischiadicum) was 13. 8 mm. There were three trochanters on the femur. The tibia and fibula were fused almost in the distal half. There were 7 tarsal bones and the pedis was complete with five digits.

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the stability and comfort afforded by the long spinal board (backboard) and the vacuum mattress. Methods: Nine volunteers wearing standardised clothing and rigid neck collars were secured on to a backboard and vacuum mattress using a standard strapping arrangement. An operating department table was used to tilt the volunteers from 45 degrees head up to 45 degrees head down, and addition-ally 45 degrees laterally. Movements of the head, sternum, and pubic <b>symphysis</b> (<b>pelvis)</b> from a fixed position were then recorded. The comfort level during the procedure was assessed using a 10 point numerical rating scale (NRS) where 1 =no pain and 10 =worst pain imaginable. Results: The mean body movements in the head up position (23. 3 v 6. 66 mm), head down (40. 89 v 8. 33 mm), and lateral tilt (18. 33 v 4. 26 mm) were significantly greater on the backboard than on the vacuum mattress (p< 0. 01 for all planes of movement). Using the NRS the vacuum mattress (mean score= 1. 88) was significantly more comfortable than the backboard (mean score= 5. 22) (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: In the measured planes the vacuum mattress provides significantly superior stability and comfort than a backboard. Current teaching in trauma management in the ATL...|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{to support}} the much older claim was not {{provided}} beyond the single point of spinal degeneration. A growing body of work soon began to appear to dispute {{the assessment of the}} age of the mummy and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten. [...] Where Filer and Strouhal (below) relied on multiple indicators to determine the younger age, the new study cited one point to indicate a much older age. One letter to the JAMA editors came from Arizona State University bioarchaeologist Brenda J. Baker. The content was retold on the Archaeology News Network website and is representative of a portion of the dissent: [...] A specialist in human osteology and paleopathology, Baker takes issue with the identification of the skeletonized mummy KV55 as Tutankhamun’s father, Akhenaten. The authors et al in JAMA place this individual’s age at the time of death at 35-45, despite producing no evidence that repudiates well-known prior examinations citing the age in the 18-26 range.These earlier analyses - documented with written descriptions, photographs and radiographs - show a pattern of fused and unfused epiphyses (caps on ends of growing bones) throughout the skeleton, indicating a man much younger than Akhenaten {{is believed to have been}} at the time of his death. Baker also uses a photograph of the pubic <b>symphysis</b> of the <b>pelvis</b> to narrow the age of KV55 to 18-23 based on recent techniques used in osteology and forensic anthropology.|$|R
40|$|Aim of investigation. To {{prove the}} {{usefulness}} of the use of embryonic fibroblasts for the regeneration of cartilaginous tissue. Material and methods. New experimental model of symphysis pubis rupture followed by its recovery was employed in 24 male Shinshilla rabbits (2. 3 — 3. 5 kg body mass) in 3 series of experiments. In the first series, reconstruction was not employed. In the 2 nd series, the reconstruction of symphisis was performed with the aid of tantal wired cerclage (d= 1. 2 mm). In the 3 d series, the reconstitution was the same as in the previous series of experiments with addition of grown embrional allofibroblast tissue pieces. Duration of experiments was 7, 14, 21 and 30 days. After each experiment, pieces of cartilaginous tissue were fixed with 10 % neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin, eosin and VanGieson.   Results. After the rupture of symphysis pubis of the pelvic bone, the cartilaginous tissue undergone alterations followed by formation of chondromatous nodules of different sizes and sclerosis of surrounding muscular and osseous tissues. In the second series of experiment after <b>pelvis</b> <b>symphysis</b> pubis rupture and symphysis recovery with the help of cerclage, the morphologic investigation revealed the formation of mixed initial callus consisting of connective and chondromatous tissue elements. In the third series of experiment {{it has been shown that}} within 4  weeks of experiment, the connective tissue with intensive basophil stain is formed in the area of symphysis pubisrupture. Connective tissue formation in surrounding soft tissue structures was associated with the formation of cartilaginous cells. Conclusion. Process of formation of cartilaginous tissue in the area of symphysis pubis rupture as evident by the experimental observation demonstrates the stimulating influence of allogeneic fibroblasts on process of cartilaginous tissue regeneration that ensures premises for clinical development of suggested method of regeneration. </p...|$|R
