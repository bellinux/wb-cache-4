Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.|$|E

500|$|Dennis Lim of Blender {{named the}} song {{one of the}} {{highlights}} of the album, calling it [...] "hypnotic pole-dance pop". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called the song [...] "futuristic and thrilling". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said that [...] "somehow, out of personal chaos, pop greatness has emerged. [...] melds tack-sharp beats and a deliciously scuzzy bassline to create a dancefloor throb that feels devilishly sexy". While reviewing The Singles Collection, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called [...] "Gimme More" [...] "the best dance track she has done since 'Toxic'". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said the track set the mood for Blackout, adding that [...] "the electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears’s voice is thin [...] she delivers almost nothing but slithery come-ons and defiant invitations to nightclub decadence". New Musical Express compared Spears's vocals to [...] "a sex addict’s cry for help".

[...] Mustaine wrote the songs for the album {{in an attempt to}} [...] "stir something {{in the minds of the}} listener". The lyrics of the album were mostly about choices the American government were making at the time, which Mustaine found to be foolish. Mustaine stated recording the new songs was [...] "super fun", despite having troubles with some of the complex music and vocal arrangements. All of the lyrics and music, with the exception of one song, were written by Mustaine. [...] "Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms" [...] was co-written by Mustaine and guitarist Glen Drover. When bassist James LoMenzo was asked about the lyrics of the album, he said to [...] "talk to Dave about that". Although most of the band had no writing credits on the album, they stated that they were excited about recording the music.|$|E
500|$|New Amerykah Part One {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 83, based on 27 reviews. Slant Magazines Eric Henderson {{said it is}} a powerful listen that stands as Badu's most musically ambitious work. Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker described the album as [...] "a brilliant resurgence of black avant-garde vocal pop" [...] and [...] "the work of a restless polymath ignoring the world around her and opting for an idiosyncratic, murky feeling that reflects her impulses." [...] In the Chicago Tribune, Kot wrote that [...] "art this deeply personal" [...] is rarely an easy listen, while Alex Macpherson of The Guardian deemed it a rewarding listen that [...] "demands to be explored." [...] Rolling Stone magazine's Christian Hoard was more critical, finding Badu's socially conscious lyrics unexceptional and too ambiguous, and some songs [...] "absent-minded doodles". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau deemed it an enjoyable effort, citing [...] "Amerykahn Promise" [...] and [...] "The Cell" [...] as highlights, but <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> themes seemed dated {{in comparison to the}} music: [...] "When your funk is this futuristic, not to say abstract, astrology and Farrakhan sound old, not to say ignorant".

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{contributor}} Doug Pratt {{called it}} a [...] "high point" [...] of the first season. Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register said of the episode, [...] "All this proves once again that animated series are great platforms for hot topics that live action shows don't dare grab head on. South Park allegory {{of good and evil}} is more apt and knowing than anything seen on Christy or Touched by an Angel. Funnier too." [...] However, Littlefield also <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's graphic dialogue, like the phrase [...] "poop on a stick", was growing [...] "pretty darn redundant". Gary Budzak of The Columbus Dispatch described the [...] "Damien" [...] episode as perhaps [...] "the most outrageous yet". Virginia Rohan of The Record praised the episode, saying, [...] "The episode is funny, and ultimately, good does conquer evil, albeit for all the wrong reasons." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Lon Grahnke gave the episode three stars and called it simultaneously strange and funny. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News called the episode [...] "awfully funny" [...] and praised its satirical element, although he warned it was potentially very offensive to some viewers: [...] "A scene in which the kids offer profane between-rounds encouragement to Jesus could make even thick-skinned viewers wince a bit." [...] Likewise, Star-Ledger reporter Matt Zoller Seitz said, [...] "Tonight's episode is crazy, vulgar and borderline blasphemous; it is also, if you're in the right frame of mind, paralyzingly funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} [...] "The Open Door is a muddle of affections. Sonically, however, it captures the Evanescence mythos {{better and more}} {{consistently}} than the first album - after all, Lee now has no apologies of being the thinking man's nu-metal chick, now that she's a star". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called the album [...] "less fun", [...] and <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs are similar to each other. St. Louis Post-Dispatchs Sara Berry critiqued, [...] " [...] sound remains essentially the same: the strange but amicable marriage of churning guitar riffs to lead singer Amy Lee's silky soprano". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called the album a 45-minute [...] "romantic piece" [...] and said, [...] "if [...] featured more open-throated crooning and less teeth-gritting anger {{it would be a}} much more interesting record". She also added that the sound of the album gets [...] "black and blacker" [...] and, [...] "Lyrics tend toward repetition of words like 'darkness,' 'haunting,' and 'rage'". Christa Titus of Billboard called it a [...] "far more nuanced, moody and richly textured effort" [...] than Fallen. Postmedia News gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "While it's similar in style and sound to its predecessor, The Open Door loses the punchy power rifts and instead persuades the listener with piano and airy vocals". Andre Farias of Christianity Today admitted that [...] "The sound is loud, yes, but it's almost indistinguishable from its predecessor—a disappointment considering the opus was nearly three-and-a-half years in the making".|$|E

500|$|New York Daily News writer David Hinckley said Lowe and Scott {{were strong}} {{additions}} to the show, and that Scott's character in Parks was better than his character in Party Down. Hinckley said the humor [...] "remains happily rooted in the show's eccentric characters", although he <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jokes, like Andy's [...] "November" [...] song [...] "sometimes feels {{like a series of}} short sketches instead of a show". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell described Lowe as entertaining but [...] "one-note", but said Adam Scott was [...] "much more promising and nuanced", with better potential for a romantic interest for Leslie than previous guest stars like Will Arnett and Justin Theroux. Kandell felt Schneider's imminent departure from the series seemed unceremonious, and praised Nick Offerman's reactions of [...] "unbridled ecstasy" [...] at the idea of cutbacks and the government shutdown. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic expressed doubt about the long-term effectiveness of Lowe's character, and said the April and Andy subplot felt [...] "dragged out for yet another week". However, he praised the script, the addition of Scott, and the performance of the entire cast, especially Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari. Hochberger said, [...] "I'm not convinced Parks and Recreation could have a bad episode {{at this point in the}} season." [...] TV Squad writer Kona Gallagher felt [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was an especially important episode due to the addition of the Lowe and Scott characters, the beginning of Mark's exit from the series and the economic problems for Pawnee. However, Gallagher also said the episode felt mostly like a preparation for the third season.|$|E
500|$|TV Squad's Bob Sassone enjoyed Jan Hooks' appearance, {{and said}} that her role as Jenna's mother was [...] "good casting."

That being <b>said,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material... were pretty great by even the show's lofty standards", said Paste magazine's Sean Gandert. In his recap, Adam Mersel for TV Guide was complimentary, writing it had [...] "spot-on one-liners, witty pop culture references, and a hilarious guest-star in Jan Hooks", and that [...] "Verna" [...] became his favorite episode of the season. Nick Catucci for New York magazine liked Liz and Frank's plot, noting that their bad habits featured here [...] "culminated in the greatest few moments the show has had in some time." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed this episode of 30 Rock, writing that the show [...] "was firing on all cylinders. It was good for laughs aplenty but it also helped illuminate Jack's paternal relationship with Jenna, the source of some of Jenna's narcissistic craziness and the full measure of Jack's Oedipal hell." [...] Margaret Lyons for Entertainment Weekly deemed [...] "Verna" [...] a solid episode from the show. Time contributor James Poniewozik enjoyed Hooks' performance, and that it was good to see Jane Krakowski's Jenna [...] "get a story that was not solely about her being an insecure ninny." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché so {{familiar}} that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne {{was too much of}} an exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman <b>said</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".|$|E
