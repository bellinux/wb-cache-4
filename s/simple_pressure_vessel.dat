40|$|In {{the broad}} context of {{modeling}} for system design, it is normally assumed that all decision-makers cooperate fully and thus avoid conflict. However, {{this is not always}} possible, in which case the design process is best modelled and studied as a multi-player game. The objective in this paper is to present and illustrate such a general game-theoretic framework for design modeling. In particular, explicit solutions are computed and interpreted for conservative or minmax, Pareto, Nash and Stackelberg games in a <b>simple</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> design example in which two players interact strategically, one of whom wants to minimize the weight and other wishes to maximize the volume. In another example in which a rotating disk is to be optimized for two objectives related to its design and manufacture, the Pareto solutions show how a novel manufacturing cost function can improve, under assumptions of a cooperative game, the optimal shape that is obtained under a single objective formulation related [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral {{neuropathy}} affects approximately 50 % of the 15 million Americans with diabetes. It {{has been}} suggested that mechanical effects related to collagen glycation are related to the permanence of neuropathy. In the present paper, we develop a model for load transfer in a whole nerve, using a <b>simple</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> approximation, in order to assess the significant of stiffening of the collagenous nerve sheath on endoneurial fluid pressure. We also develop a fibril-scale mechanics model for the nerve, to model the straightening of wavy fibrils, producing the toe region observed in nerve tissue, and also to interrogate the effects of interfibrillar crosslinks on the overall properties of the tissue. Such collagen crosslinking has been implicated in complications in diabetic tissues. Our fibril-scale model uses a two-parameter Weibull model for fibril strength, in combination with statistical parameters describing fibril modulus, angle, wave-amplitude, and volume fraction to capture both toe region and failure region behavior of whole rat sciatic nerve. The extrema of equal and local load-sharing assumptions are used to map potential differences in diabetic and nondiabetic tissues. This work may ultimately be useful in differentiating between the responses of normal and heavily crosslinked tissue. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 1824118...|$|E
