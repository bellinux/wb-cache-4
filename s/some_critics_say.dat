25|$|Human scoring is {{relatively}} expensive and often variable, {{which is why}} computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that poorly paid employees will score tests badly. Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. Sometimes states pay to have two or more scorers read each paper; if their scores do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that {{breast cancer}} {{awareness}} {{has transformed the}} disease into a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitches. Corporate marketing machines promote early detection of breast cancer, while also opposing public health efforts, such as stricter environmental legislation, that might decrease the incidence rate of breast cancer. These critics believe {{that some of the}} breast cancer organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G. Komen for the Cure, have become captive companies that support and provide social capital to the breast cancer industry, including pharmaceutical companies, mammography equipment manufacturers, and pollution-causing industries, as well as large corporations, creating or exacerbating other problems.|$|E
25|$|Tom Laliberty of Raytheon {{said that}} President Barack Obama {{was forced to}} shift from a land based missile defense system to a sea based one because of the {{difficulties}} of coordinating with partner nations. There is discussion {{about the effectiveness of}} this plan. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> it is not as effective as a ground-based defense since the most advanced Standard missiles lack even half the range to hit ICBMs and even IRBMs arcing overhead. Also, the U.S. Defense Department has said it would be just one component of a wider defense which might also include ground-based facilities. There are some reports that SPY-1 radar systems onboard some individual warships are not being maintained properly.|$|E

The album was released while the band {{participated in the}} 2014 Summer Slaughter tour alongside Morbid Angel, The Faceless, Dying Fetus and Thy Art is Murder. The album received significant acclaim, despite <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> the production {{was a victim of}} the [...] "Loudness Wars" [...] and little dynamic range.|$|R
40|$|With more {{survivors}} of the Holocaust dying out, the Simon Wiesenthal centre has opened a hotline in several countries, including Poland, {{to get in touch}} with potential witnesses to WW 2 war crimes. Seen by many as the last dash to chase war criminals from that period, the initiative has triggered a lot of controversy with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> that it is time that period of history be finally put to rest...|$|R
50|$|Maumoon Abdul Gayoom {{began his}} 30-year role as President in 1978, winning six {{consecutive}} elections without opposition. His election {{was seen as}} ushering {{in a period of}} political stability and economic development in view of Gayoom's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Gayoom's rule was controversial, with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> Gayoom was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.|$|R
25|$|During Giuliani's administration, {{crime rates}} dropped in New York City. The {{extent to which}} Giuliani deserves the credit is disputed. Crime rates in New York City had started to drop in 1991 under {{previous}} mayor David Dinkins, three years before Giuliani took office. The rates of most crimes, including all categories of violent crime, made consecutive declines during the last 36 months of Dinkins's four-year term, ending a 30-year upward spiral. A small nationwide drop in crime preceded Giuliani's election, and <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> {{that he may have}} been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress. Additional contributing factors to the overall decline in New York City crime during the 1990s were the addition of 7,000 officers to the NYPD, lobbied for and hired by the Dinkins administration, and an overall improvement in the national economy. Changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions, which were similar across the country during this time. Because the crime index is based on that of the FBI, which is self-reported by police departments, some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories that the FBI doesn't collect.|$|E
500|$|On 14 August 1725, Swift {{wrote to}} Charles Ford that his work, Gulliver's Travels, was finished, however, he soon added a scene {{referring}} to the Drapier's Letters. Swift wrote, {{in a letter to}} Pope, [...] "a printer shall be found brave enough to venture his ears". The printer Swift found was Benjamin Motte, and Swift did not control the publication in order to, as <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say,</b> preserve his anonymity.|$|E
2500|$|A crucial {{issue is}} the large and often {{indeterminate}} parameters of the predictions, such that <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> these are not predictions, {{and should not be}} recognized as such. Much of the controversy with VAN arises from this failure to adequately specify these parameters. Some of their telegrams include predictions of two distinct earthquake events, such as (typically) one earthquake predicted at 300km [...] "N.W" [...] of Athens, and another at 240km [...] "W", [...] "with magnitutes [...] 5,3 and 5,8", with no time limit.|$|E
5000|$|... "Michael's Story" [...] was a {{campaign}} poster from the UK MND Association's summer 2015 [...] "Last Summer" [...] first anniversary campaign which featured Michael Smith. He {{had not taken}} part in the Ice Bucket Challenge and was subsequently diagnosed with motor neurone disease. This caused controversy, with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> that the poster was implying that Smith had deserved his illness for his previous non-participation. The claims were strongly refuted by the Association and by Smith himself.|$|R

5000|$|A green {{home is a}} type {{of house}} {{designed}} to be environmentally friendly and sustainable. And also focuses on the efficient use of [...] "energy, water, and building materials." [...] Green homes have become more prevalent as green affordable housing emerges. Green affordable housing shares the same aims as traditional green homes but emphasise affordability, inevitably reducing the environmental friendliness of the home. The idea of affordable green homes is a criticized topic with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> that it is a fallacy and that green homes are inherently more costly than traditional homes.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} embargo {{actually}} helps the regime {{more than it}} hurts it, by providing it with a bogeyman for all of Cuba's misfortunes. Hillary Clinton publicly shared {{the view that the}} embargo helps the Castros, noting that [...] "It is my personal belief that the Castros {{do not want to see}} an end to the embargo and do no want to see normalization with the United States." [...] Clinton said in the same interview that [...] "we're open to changing with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{implicit}} {{advice is}} that the other minorities should stop protesting and emulate the Asian American work ethic and devotion to higher education. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> the depiction replaces biological racism with cultural racism, and should be dropped. According to the Washington Post, [...] "the idea that Asian Americans are distinct among minority groups and immune to the challenges faced by other people of color is a particularly sensitive issue for the community, which has recently fought to reclaim its place in social justice conversations with movements like #ModelMinorityMutiny." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NFL is {{very active}} on {{stopping}} {{what it says}} is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms [...] "NFL", [...] "Super Bowl", and [...] "Super Sunday". As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with colloquialisms such as [...] "The Big Game", or other generic descriptions. [...] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying [...] "it would be super...to have a bowl...of Planters nuts while watching the big game!" [...] and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the [...] "Superb Owl". [...] In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for [...] "Superb Owl". [...] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase [...] "Super Bowl" [...] implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that [...] "promote a message", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55inches. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that [...] "any use is prohibited", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States. Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 [...] "to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games", and [...] "for other purposes".|$|E
50|$|<b>Some</b> noted <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} Red Herring Top 100 is a scam and {{companies}} {{are forced to}} pay a large fee to attend award ceremonies {{in order to receive}} the award. Red Herring has objected to the criticism.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the song}} was generally positive, with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> {{that it was a}} standout track from the album. The video for the song was filmed back-to-back as one collective clip, totaling ten minutes in length with [...] "Rock That Body" [...] which is the fourth international single from the album. The collective montage is titled [...] "Imma Be Rocking That Body". The song was part of the soundtrack of the film The Other Guys (2010) and was used in the bar scene. The song can also be heard in the film The Hangover Part II (2011). However, it does not feature on the official soundtrack.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to this criticism, the State Department released a revised report in June 2004, correcting most of the errors; however, this {{was not enough to}} stop <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> from <b>saying</b> the State Department had deliberately left out information showing failures in the War on Terror.|$|R

50|$|Out My Way is a mini-album {{released}} by the alternative rock band the Meat Puppets in 1986. It features a more hard rock oriented sound than the band usually has, leading <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> to <b>say</b> that the sound is similar to southern/hard rock stylings of ZZ Top. The EP was reissued in 1999 by Rykodisc with additional bonus tracks.|$|R
50|$|None of {{the members}} of the {{collective}} is a fully qualified architect, and even some of them are not architects at all, and have backgrounds in set design, theatre, anthropology, philosophy and construction. <b>Some</b> art <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that Assemble represents a different vision opposite to those mainstream values in the world art, an argument put forward in the New York Times by N+1 editor Nikil Saval.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> would <b>say</b> {{it is hard}} {{to ensure}} that {{briefing}} materials provided to participants are balanced and accurate. It is suggested that an advisory committee {{with a wide range of}} people are to be constituted; however, it can be challenging to obtain a balanced advisory committee at the first place. In this sense, it gives room for a biased and/or incomplete presentation of information.|$|R

5000|$|From 1998-2000, Malina starred as {{character}} Jeremy Goodwin on Sorkin's Sports Night, {{a show that}} attracted him from the moment Sorkin sent him the pilot script. The Goodwin character began as a research analyst, but was promoted to associate producer by the second season, creating a larger role for Malina. The critically acclaimed show {{was unable to find}} a large fan base and was canceled after two seasons, with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> the show's troubles were exacerbated by having to share Sorkin's time with his concurrent project on rival network NBC, The West Wing.

500|$|At {{the same}} time that Alpha Protocol was in development, Obsidian was also working on [...] Prior to working on New Vegas, they were {{contacted}} by Bethesda Softworks about developing a Star Trek game, but the idea never gained traction. After Bethesda released Fallout 3 and began to shift its own focus back towards its Elder Scrolls series, it approached Obsidian with the idea of having the latter studio develop another game in the Fallout series, as several of Obsidian's founders had worked on the franchise while at Black Isle. In developing New Vegas, Obsidian looked at fan requests, which led to New Vegas giving a more prominent role to the in-game factions. When the concept was pitched to Bethesda, it was immediately approved. The development of New Vegas began soon after the cancellation of Aliens: Crucible, and it was released in October 2010. It received generally positive reviews, with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> that the game's quality exceeded that of the critically acclaimed Fallout 3.|$|R
50|$|Nintendo {{released}} the Game Boy on April 21, 1989 (September 1990 for the UK). The design team headed by Gunpei Yokoi {{had also been}} responsible for the Game & Watch system, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System games Metroid and Kid Icarus. The Game Boy came under scrutiny by <b>some</b> industry <b>critics,</b> <b>saying</b> that the monochrome screen was too small, and the processing power was inadequate. The design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns, and when compared to the Microvision, the Game Boy was a huge leap forward.|$|R
50|$|The game {{so far has}} a {{score of}} 49.50% on GameRankings. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> {{it was better than}} X-Men: Mutant Academy on the Game Boy Color.

5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} {{operation}} was [...] "deliberately miss-planned to topple or weaken Ayub Khan".

5000|$|In 2016, Kuntzman {{became the}} center of {{widespread}} attention when he wrote an article titled [...] "Firing an AR-15 is horrifying, menacing, and very very loud." [...] In the article, Kuntzman says that he traveled to a gun range in Philadelphia to shoot a [...] "military-style weapon," [...] so that he could better understand such weapons' appeals {{in the wake of the}} 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. He says that [...] "It felt to me like a bazooka - and sounded like a cannon." [...] Kuntzman further described the experience by saying that [...] "The recoil bruised my shoulder" [...] and [...] "The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick." [...] The most controversial part of the article was when Kuntzman claimed that [...] "The explosions - like a bomb - gave me a temporary form of PTSD." [...] Kuntzman faced widespread criticism for the article, particularly the claim that he suffered from PTSD, with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> that such a claim diminished the severity of PTSD suffered by veterans. Kuntzman later wrote another article further criticizing gun owners, but apologizing for the remarks about PTSD.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film has}} been criticized for its violent content with <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>saying</b> that the graphic nature of the film overshadows the message the film was trying to convey. Grace Montgomery stated that [...] "Although it seems like it's trying to make a {{statement}} about social media and bullying, most of what the film has to say is lost under the horrifying violence that has no resolution." [...] Justin Hamelin praised the film saying that [...] "All American Bully does not simplify the terrible epidemic of bullying in our society these days, nor does it glorify the damage done either by the antagonist or to the victims. It is a reserved and respectful approach to a problem that desperately needs to stop. Perhaps the best compliment I can give this film is that it should be considered for discussion amongst high school classes across the country and while there is a very upsetting scene that I had trouble getting through {{towards the end of the}} film, this is the harsh reality we live in and by spreading awareness of the issues at hand, we can hopefully work towards a society where bullying becomes the exception, as opposed to the expected." ...|$|R

Chinese music itself is built on the same principle and I am planning out the composition called the evolution of music. I hope to show the growth of harmony.
