[...] However, Sheriff Bill Gore, who investigated the death, stated of the family's reluctance to accept the suicide ruling, [...] "We laid out the case extensively to them in Missouri to answer their questions, and it’s unfortunate she can't accept the results." [...] On September 7, the family launched a website [...] seeking donations to fund their own investigation into Zahau's death. The site states: [...] "It was obvious that the Sheriff’s Department had worked too hard to paint this picture of suicide and they were not about to let the Zahaus ruin it." [...] In late September, they continued to demand that the case be re-opened.|$|E
