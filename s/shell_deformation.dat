40|$|We {{investigate}} {{here the}} length {{scales of the}} boundary or interior layer eects in <b>shell</b> <b>deformation.</b> Quantitative information on the layers is obtained by considering two (simplied) `shallow ' shell models corresponding to the `classical' three-eld (Love-Koiter-Novozhilov), resp. ve-eld (Reissner-Naghdi) shell models. We start by analysing the layers as functions of {{the thickness of the}} shell, while keeping the other geometric parameters xed. Having found the four limit Fourier modes we complete the analysis investigating systematically the layers length scales under more general assumptions, particularly when also the wave parameter is variable. Scaling properly the energy expressions, as indicated by the layer mode analysis, <b>shell</b> <b>deformation</b> energies characteristic to shell layers are found.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the stress distribution in the open, cone-shaped, sandwich shell panel. The shell under consideration consists of two load-carrying facings and a core layer of the soft type. The facings are made of an isotropic, compressible, work-hardening material and they are geometrically and physically symmetrical, so they are of equal thicknesses and the same material properties. The core layer resists transverse shear only. The shell under consideration is under combined external load in the form of lateral pressure and a longitudinal force. Different ratios of the longitudinal force to the lateral pressure are taken into account. In each case, the components of the effective stress as well as the effective stress values corresponding to the <b>shell</b> <b>deformation</b> were determined. To determine the stress state which occurs during the <b>shell</b> <b>deformation,</b> the stability equations have to be derived. The effective stress corresponding to the deformations in the shell under consideration can occur within the elastic, elastic-plastic or plastic range. In order to determine the stress distribution in the shell under consideration which corresponds to the on- and post-critical state, the constitutive relations of the Nadai-Hencky deformation theory, alongside the Huber-Mises-Hencky yield condition, are accepted. Analyses show that, in certain cases, there are very large differences between the values of the components of the stress state. In such cases, it seems to be possible to omit the components with small values...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{applicability}} of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) variational framework for thin-body problems in structural mechanics. Our numerical approach is based on discontinuous piecewise polynomial finite element spaces for the trial functions and approximate, local computation of the corresponding 'optimal' test functions. In the Timoshenko beam problem, the proposed method is shown to provide the best approximation in an energy-type norm which is equivalent to the L 2 -norm for all the unknowns, uniformly with respect to the thickness parameter. The same formulation remains valid also for the asymptotic Euler-Bernoulli solution. As another one-dimensional model problem we consider the modelling of the so called basic edge effect in <b>shell</b> <b>deformations.</b> In particular, we derive a special norm for the test space which leads to a robust method in terms of the shell thickness.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 192 Single Comb White Leghorn pullets {{were divided into}} three groups to study the effect of heat stress and diet {{composition}} on feed intake and laying performance at 21, 25, and 33 weeks of age. For each age group all birds were fed a control diet [17. 1 % crude protein (CP), 2770 kcal metabolizable energy (ME) /kg] for a 7 -day period. During this time they were kept at a temperature of 18 C. The temperature was then immediately increased to 35 C, and groups of 16 birds offered either the control diet, a high protein diet (43. 5 % CP), a high energy diet (3371 kcal ME/kg), or a diet of high nutrient density (28. 3 % CP, 2842 kcal ME/kg, and 6. 5 % Ca) for a 3 -day period. After the 3 -day test period, temperature was returned to 18 C, although birds were still offered the experimental diets for an additional 4 days prior to returning to the control diet. Production parameters were measured for individual birds. Feed consumption, egg production (except for the 21 -week-old birds), egg weight, and egg shell thickness decreased (P<. 05) with heat stress. Increases in energy and calcium intake helped partially to maintain normal egg production, egg weight, and egg <b>shell</b> <b>deformation.</b> Egg weight and egg <b>shell</b> <b>deformation</b> returned to pretest levels within an 8 -week postexperimental period. With the excep-tion of those birds receiving the control and high nutrient density diets at 21 weeks of age, data collected over the test periods showed that heat stress caused a significant reduction (P<. 05) in liveweight of birds...|$|E
40|$|The use of foraminifers as bioindicators of {{pollution}} in coastal and paralic environments {{has undergone a}} very fast development. Among various criteria, morphological anomalies are sometimes considered as pollution indicators. This paper presents a synthesis of the studies correlating foraminiferal assemblages and environmental concerns. Sediment cores retrieved along the northern coast of Sfax (Tunisia) are used to monitor the response of benthic foraminifera to modern pollution and environmental stress. Sediment samples were separated immediately after collection for benthic foraminifera analysis. Binocular microscope and the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were carried out to identify the most significant, normal or deformed, specimens.

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} simply supported, circular cylindrical shells in supersonic flow is investigated by using both linear aerodynamics (first-order piston theory) and nonlinear aerodynamics (third-order piston theory). Geometric nonlinearities, due to finite amplitude <b>shell</b> <b>deformations,</b> are considered {{by using the}} Donnell's nonlinear shallow-shell theory,, {{and the effect of}} viscous structural damping is taken into account. The system is discretized by, Galerkin method and is investigated by using a model involving lip to 22 degrees-of-freedom, allowing for travelling-wave flutter around the shell and axisymmetric contraction of the shell. Asymmetric and axisymmetric geometric imperfections of circular cylindrical shells are taken into account. Numerical calculations are carried out for a very thin circular shell affixed Mach number 3 tested at the NASA Ames Research Center. Results show that the system loses stability, by travelling-wave flutter around the shell through supercritical bifurcation. Nonsimple harmonic motion is observed for sufficiently high post-critical dynamic pressure. A very good agreement between theoretical and existing experimental data has been found for the onset of flutter flutter amplitude, and frequency. Results show that onset of flutter is very sensible to small initial imperfections of the shells. The influence of pressure differential across the shell skin has also been deeply investigated.

Green pustules were mainly {{located in the}} posterior portion of the mantle and gonad tissues and the posterior adductor muscle. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of algal cells with similar morphology to Coccomyxa parasitica. Algae were oval shaped with a single nucleus and chloroplast, 1 or 2 mitochondria and a dense granular cytoplasm with a lipid inclusion body, Golgi apparatus and small vesicles. Partial small subunit (SSU) rRNA phylogeny confirmed the inclusion of parasitic algae into the Coccomyxa clade. However, the sequence identity between almost full SSU rRNA sequences of parasitic algae and others in this clade yielded an unexpected result.
