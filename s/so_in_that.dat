In 1721 a drunken nobleman reeled on to {{the stage of the}} theatre and {{assaulted}} the manager, Rich, whose life was saved by Quin's prompt armed interference. This resulted in a riot, and thereafter a guard was stationed in all theatres. In 1732 Quin appeared at Covent Garden, returning to Drury Lane from 1734 to 1741, and in 1742 was again at Covent Garden, where he remained until the close of his career. On 14 November 1746 Quin played Horatio and Garrick Lothario to the Calista of Mrs Cibber in Rose's Fair Penitent. The applause of the audience was so great as to disconcert if not actually to alarm the two actors.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of March 12, while {{conducting}} his usual inspection of the dam, the dam keeper discovered a new leak in the west abutment. Concerned not only because other leaks had appeared in this same area {{in the past but}} more so that the muddy color of the runoff he observed could indicate the water was eroding the foundation of the dam, he immediately alerted Mulholland. After arriving, both Mulholland and Van Norman began inspecting the area of the leak. Van Norman found the source and by following the runoff, determined that the muddy appearance of the water was not from the leak itself but came from where the water contacted loose soil from a newly cut access road. The leak was discharging 2 to 3 cubic feet (15 to 22 U.S. gallons, or 57 to 85 liters) per second of water by their approximation. Certainly their concern was heightened not only given its location but more <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> at times the volume being discharged was inconsistent, they later testified at the Coroner's Inquest. Twice as they watched, an acceleration or surging of the flow was noticed by both men. Mulholland felt that some corrective measures were needed although this could be done at some time in the future.|$|E

South of Heaven was awarded silver certification in the United Kingdom on January 1, 1993, Slayer's first record to do <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country. Slayer's official biography states that [...] "some critics praised the album as demonstrating Slayer's desire to grow musically and avoid repeating themselves."

500|$|This {{period of}} British-US {{engineering}} {{development has been}} the subject of analysis by economic historians. S B Saul, writing in 1960, determined that British engineering and its methods were advanced in spheres such as the manufacture of textile machinery but less <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> of light machine tools and the machinery of mass production. He argued that in these areas the response by British manufacturers to imports from the US [...] "belatedly matured so their influence permeated back through the whole engineering trade and began a rejuvenation of old fossilised trades" [...] in the 1890s. He broadly agreed with the contemporary opinion of Churchill that the adoption of US methods was slow in the light machine tools sector primarily because there was a perceived lack of demand and return on investment to excite the interest of British engineers. He viewed the cycle boom as the catalyst for growth in this area but pointed out that the heavy machine tool sector was one of those which had not been previously neglected by British engineers.|$|E

Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E

She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group.

Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela.

500|$|In 1836, Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar was premiered in Saint Petersburg. This was {{an event}} long-awaited by the intelligentsia. The opera {{was the first}} {{conceived}} by a Russian composer on a grand scale, set to a Russian text and patriotic in its appeal. Its plot fit neatly into the doctrine of Official Nationality being promulgated by Nicholas I, thus assuring Imperial approval. In formal and stylistic terms, A Life was very much an Italian opera but also showed a sophisticated thematic structure and a boldness in orchestral scoring. It was the first tragic opera to enter the Russian repertoire, with Ivan Susanin's death at the end underlining and adding gravitas to the patriotism running through the whole opera. (In Cavos's version, Ivan is spared at the last minute.) It {{was also the first}} Russian opera where the music continued throughout, uninterrupted by spoken dialogue. Moreover—and this is what amazed contemporaries about the work—the music included folk songs and Russian national idioms, incorporating them into the drama. Glinka meant his use of folk songs to reflect the presence of popular characters in the opera, rather than an overt attempt at nationalism. Nor do they play a major part in the opera. Nevertheless, despite a few derogatory comments about Glinka's use of [...] "coachman's music," [...] A Life became popular enough to earn obtain permanent repertory status, the first Russian opera to do <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country.|$|E

She was initially reluctant {{to participate in}} the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. Beyoncé's choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: [...] "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies [...] just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, that means it must be big time. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> respect, I have to take my hat off to them for doing it." [...] Later, Joe Jonas of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo Jedward parodied Beyoncé's dance moves for the video of their cover version of [...] "All the Small Things". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by Beyoncé performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote Trident Unwrapped gum. On November 20, 2009, BBC Newsreaders including Fiona Bruce, Sophie Raworth, Kate Silverton, and Susanna Reid performed [...] "Single Ladies" [...] in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues Bill Turnbull, Ben Brown, Nicholas Owen, and Charlie Stayt before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of Britain's Got Talent, in a dance-off.
