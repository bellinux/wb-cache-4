40|$|Boiler {{slagging}} and fouling as {{a result}} of inorganic impurities in combustion gases being deposited on heat transfer tubes have caused severe problems in coal-fired power plant operation. These problems are fuel, system design, and operating condition dependent. Conventional slag and ash removal methods include the use of in situ blowing or jet-type devices such as air or steam soot blowers and water lances. Pulse detonation technology for the purpose of removing slag and fouling deposits in coal-fired utility power plant boilers offers great potential. The detonation wave technique based on high impact velocity with sufficient energy and thermal shock on the slag deposited on gas contact surfaces offers a convenient, inexpensive, yet efficient and effective way to supplement existing slag removal methods. These detonation waves have been demonstrated experimentally to have exceptionally high shearing capability important to the task of removing slag and fouling deposits.

40|$|Low carbon {{economy and}} the current {{dominant}} role of fossil fuel power plants in serving electricity require the decrease of emission due to carbon dioxide by improving the boiler efficiency. Literature review and industry practice show that neural network based methods are applied to improve the boiler efficiency {{in a number of}} power plants. However, slagging and fouling are still serious problems which impair the efficiency of heat transfer and degrade the performance of a boiler in power plant that uses fossil fuels with high fouling tendency. This paper proposes a new strategy which can be applied to optimize the boiler combustion process by an online adaptive tuning technology based on Integrating Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs). First, a simple heat transfer case with slagging influence consideration is modeled using CFD.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many {{embankments}} and levees have collapsed during strong earthquakes or floods. In the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (North-Eastern Italy), {{the main source of}} this type of risk is a <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> of about 2 x 106 m 3 deriving from galena and lead mining activity until 1991 in the village of Raibl. For the final remedial action plan, several in situ tests were performed: five boreholes equipped with piezometers, four CPTE and some geophysical tests with different approaches (refraction, ReMi and HVSR). Laboratory tests were conducted on the collected samples: geotechnical classification, triaxial compression tests and constant head permeability tests in triaxial cell. Pressure plate tests were also done on unsaturated slag to evaluate the characteristic soil-water curve useful for transient seepage analysis. A seepage analysis was performed in order to obtain the maximum pore water pressures during the intense rainfall event which hit the area on 29 th August 2003. The results highlight that the slag low permeability prevents the infiltration of rainwater, which instead seeps easily through the boundary levees built with coarse materials. For this reason pore water pressures inside the deposits are not particularly influenced by rainfall intensity and frequency. Seismic stability analysis was performed with both the pseudo-static method, coupled with Newmark’s method, and dynamic methods, using as design earthquake the one registered in Tolmezzo (Udine) on 6 th May 1976.

40|$|Increased {{wood pellets}} demand in Scandinavia along with limited {{availability}} of wood assortments e. g. sawdust {{are pushing the}} market towards potentially more problematic raw materials with higher ash content, e. g. peat. The objective of the present work {{was to determine the}} effect of peat addition to woody biomass pellets on combustion characteristics (i. e. slagging tendencies/operational maintenance, gaseous- and particulate emissions) in residential appliances. Two peat assortments were studied: peat A with high ash and high Si content and peat B with low ash and high Ca content. These were co-pelletized in three different contents (low, medium, high) with sawdust and energy wood respectively. A commercial underfed pellet burner (20 kW) installed in a reference boiler was used for the combustion experiments. Measurements of gaseous O 2, CO, NO, HCl and SO 2 as well as particle mass size distribution were made in the exhaust gas directly after the boiler. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDS) were used to characterize the collected <b>slag</b> <b>deposit,</b> the corresponding deposited bottom ash in the boiler and flue gas particulate matter regarding morphology and chemical composition. The slagging tendency generally increased when peat were added to the non-slagging wood assortments. The increment was moderate for peat B compared to when peat A were added. The sawdust fuel was generally stronger affected by the peat mixings compared to the energy wood fuel. The slag from fuels containing medium and high amounts of peat A had higher concentrations of Si, Al and Fe and lower concentrations of Ca compared with fuels containing the low admixture of peat A. No major differences in the elemental compositions were shown when comparing the slag from fuels containing different amounts of peat B.

40|$|Many {{metallurgical}} {{sites are}} {{scattered across the}} Aosta Valley territory (e. g. Tumiati et al., 2005). The age of some of them is unknown and often the slag heaps are the sole vestiges of metallurgical activities. Such {{is the case of}} Miséregne (Fénis), where the village is built on an enormous <b>slag</b> <b>deposit.</b> We performed radiocarbon dating on charcoal fragments included in the slags and obtained ages comprised between the 4 th and 1 st century BC. So far, these are the most ancient ages for early mining activity in the Aosta Valley, probably carried out by the local population of the Salassi. We studied the slags following a petrologic approach. The occurrence of matte inclusions in the slags indicates that the processed raw minerals were Cu-Fe sulfides. Relying on morphologic and micro-textural features, we classified the slags into three categories, i. e., coarse, massive and flat, as suggested by Addis (2013). In all the slag classes the most abundant phase is olivine. Other common phases are spinel group minerals and sulfides, mainly pyrrhotite and bornite solid solutions. The olivine crystal shapes allowed us to qualitatively estimate the degree of undercooling (ΔT) and the rate of cooling of the slags: the coarse slags show a high ΔT; the massive slags seem to record an initial, long-lasting low-ΔT stage, followed by an increase in the cooling rate; the flat slags underwent a brief low-ΔT stage, followed by a sudden marked increase in ΔT. Combining this information with the slag bulk chemistry, the sulfide compositions, the slag morphology and the presence of inclusions of charcoal, quartz and other slag fragments, we hypothesize that the massive and coarse slags come from the lower and, respectively, the upper portion of the same slag contained in the furnace, while the flat ones were tapped slags. Minimum furnace working temperatures estimated by means of olivinespinel geothermometry are in the ranges 932 - 964 °C, 968 - 1037 °C, 1202 - 1239 °C for the coarse, massive and flat slags, respectively. According to the above observations, the flat slags should record conditions that are the closest to the actual furnace working temperature...|$|E

Conventional slag removal methods including soot blowers and water lances have great difficulties in removing slags especially from the down stream areas of utility power plant boilers. The detonation wave technique, based on high impact velocity with sufficient energy and thermal shock on the slag deposited on gas contact surfaces offers a convenient, inexpensive, yet efficient and effective way to supplement existing slag removal methods. A slight increase in the boiler efficiency, due to more effective ash/deposit removal and corresponding reduction in plant maintenance downtime and increased heat transfer efficiency, will save millions of dollars in operational costs. Reductions in toxic emissions will also be accomplished due to reduction in coal usage. Detonation waves have been demonstrated experimentally to have exceptionally high shearing capability, important to the task of removing slag and fouling deposits. The experimental results describe the parametric study of the input parameters in removing the different types of slag and operating condition. The experimental results show that both the single and multi shot detonation waves have high potential in effectively removing <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> from boiler heat transfer surfaces. The results obtained are encouraging and satisfactory. A good indication has also been obtained from the agreement with the preliminary computational fluid dynamics analysis that the wave impacts are more effective in removing slag deposits from tube bundles rather than single tube. This report presents results obtained in effectively removing three different types of slag (economizer, reheater, and air-heater) t a distance of up to 20 cm from the exit of the detonation tube. The experimental results show that the softer slags can be removed more easily. Also closer the slag to the exit of the detonation tube, the better are their removals. Side facing slags are found to shear off without breaking. Wave strength and slag orientation also has different effects on the chipping off of the slag. One of the most important results from this study is the observation that the pressure of the waves plays a vital role in removing slag. The wave frequency is also important after a threshold pressure level is attained...|$|E
40|$|Each year, {{millions}} {{of tons of}} agricultural residues uch as wheat straw are produced worldwide. In this paper, we describe ongoing efforts to solve technological, infrastructural, and economic challenges to using this straw for bioenergy and bioproducts. Among these challenges, silica in straw forms a low-melting point eutectic with potassium, causing excessive <b>slagging</b> <b>deposits</b> in boilers. The presence of chlorine causes corrosion beneath the <b>slag</b> <b>deposits</b> on boiler tubes. Silica fouls kilns and fines slow paper machines, limiting the usefulness of straw in linerboard production. Poor resin bonding to the waxy outer cuticle of the straw, poor resin penetration, and high resin consumption due to fines limit the use of straw for straw-thermoplastic composites and for straw particleboard. Poor cellulase penetration limits the use of straw for production of fuels (ethanol) and chemicals. Straw consists principally of stems, leaves, sheaths, nodes, awns, and chaff. Not all of these parts of straw residue are equally valuable. Leaves and sheaths are higher in silica, while chaff, leaves and nodes comprise the source of most of the fines. The predominantly fibrous straw stem, high in cellulose, is of greater value for bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. Our approach to reducing silica content is to selectively harvest he straw stems using an in-field physical separation, leaving the remaining components in the field to build soil organic matter and contribute soil nutrients.

40|$|Degree: PhD Department: Engineering 1997, South African’s {{major power}} utility, {{recognised}} {{the need to}} improve the understanding of fly ash formation and slag deposition of South African coals. This requirement is due to the predicted quality changes of power station feedstocks and the limited research into the slagging propensity of South African coals. This research seeks to develop an analytical technique and a fly ash formation model for predicting the slagging propensity of coals. The research will establish if the models based on Carboniferous coals can be applied to South African Permian coals. A water-cooled suction pyrometer with a custom designed slag probe was used to obtain samples of fly ash and slag from within a 200 MWe pulverised fuel boiler. Simultaneously, samples of pulverised fuel feedstock were collected. The mineral attributes in the pulverised fuel and the phases in fly ash and <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> were quantified by CCSEM. The analytical procedure, CCSEM, has been developed with a novel procedure for identifying minerals and C-bearing phases. The new fly ash formation model assumes that the mineral attributes of the combusting pulverised fuel particle controls the size and elemental signature of the resultant fly ash particle(s). The new model has shown that the inherent mineral attributes controls the physical and chemical characteristics of the initial fly ash phases. Thereafter, conditions (stoichiometric, temperature and turbulence) within the combustion chamber promote the physical and/or chemical interaction of the initial fly ash particles. Slag deposits are enriched in Ca- and Fe-bearing alumino-silicates. The new slagging propensity index is based on either predicting or measuring the proportion of Ca- and Fe-bearing alumino-silicates. iv The numerous fly ash formation models, based on Carboniferous coals are not necessarily valid for South African coals. It is not the integrity of the actual fly ash formation mechanisms that is questioned, but rather the experimental scale on which the models are based. This research has produced an analytical technique and a fly ash formation model to predict the slagging propensity of coals. This forms a platform for further research into the role that organically bound cations, combustion conditions and boiler configuration has on the formation of Ca- and Fe-bearing alumino-silicates...|$|E
40|$|Union Fenosa's La Robla I Power Station is a 270 -MW Foster Wheeler arch-fired system. The unit {{is located}} at the mine that {{provides}} a portion of the semianthracitic coal. The remaining coals used are from South Africa, Russia, Australia, and China. The challenges at the La Robla I Station stem from the various fuels used, the characteristics of which differ from the design coal. The University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) and the Lehigh University Energy Research Center (LUERC) undertook a program to assess problematic slagging and unburned carbon issues occurring at the plant. Full-scale combustion tests were performed under baseline conditions, with elevated oxygen level and with redistribution of air during a site visit at the plant. During these tests, operating information, observations and temperature measurements, and coal, <b>slag</b> <b>deposit,</b> and fly ash samples were obtained to assess slagging and unburned carbon. The slagging in almost all cases appeared due to elevated temperatures rather than fuel chemistry. The most severe slagging occurred when the temperature at the sampling port was in excess of 1500 C, with problematic slagging where first-observed temperatures exceeded 1350 C. The presence of anorthite crystals in the bulk of the deposits analyzed indicates that the temperatures were in excess of 1350 C, consistent with temperature measurements during the sampling period. Elevated temperatures and ''hot spots'' are probably the result of poor mill performance, and a poor distribution of the coal from the mills to the specific burners causes elevated temperatures in the regions where the slag samples were extracted. A contributing cause appeared to be poor combustion air mixing and heating, resulting in oxygen stratification and increased temperatures in certain areas. Air preheater plugging was observed and reduces the temperature of the air in the windbox, which leads to poor combustion conditions, resulting in unburned carbon as well as slagging. A second phase of the project involved advanced analysis of the baseline coal along with an Australian coal fired at the plant. These analysis results were used in equilibrium thermodynamic modeling along with a coal quality model developed by the EERC to assess slagging, fouling, and opacity for the coals. Bench-scale carbon conversion testing was performed in a drop-tube furnace to assess the reactivity of the coals. The Australian coal had a higher mineral content with significantly more clay minerals present than the baseline coal. The presence of these clay minerals, which tend to melt at relatively low temperatures, indicated a higher potential for problematic slagging than the baseline coal. However, the pyritic minerals, comprising over 25 % of the baseline mineral content, may form sticky iron sulfides, leading to severe slagging in the burner region if local areas with reducing conditions exist. Modeling results indicated that neither would present significant fouling problems. The Australian coal was expected to show slagging behavior much more severe than the baseline coal except at very high furnace temperatures. However, the baseline coal was predicted to exhibit opacity problems, as well as have a higher potential for problematic calcium sulfate-based low-temperature fouling. The baseline coal had a somewhat higher reactivity than the Australian coal, which was consistent with both the lower average activation energy for the baseline coal and the greater carbon conversion at a given temperature and residence time. The activation energy of the baseline coal showed some effect of oxygen on the activation energy, with E{sub a} increasing at the lower oxygen concentration, but {{may be due to the}} scatter in the baseline coal kinetic values at the higher oxygen level tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the speciation of PM 10 sources of airborne Pb, Zn, and Cd metals (PM 10 is an aerosol standard of aerodynamic diameter less than 10 m.) in the atmosphere of a 3 km zone surrounding lead/zinc facilities in operation for a century. Many powdered samples were collected in stacks of working units (grilling, furnace, and refinery), outdoor storages (ores, recycled materials), surrounding waste slag (4 Mt), and polluted topsoils (3 km). PM 10 samples were generated from the raw powders by using artificial resuspension and collection devices. The bulk PM 10 multielemental analyses were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The proportions in mass of Pb (50 %), Zn (40 %), and Cd (1 %) contents and associated metals (traces) reach the proportions of corresponding raw powdered samples of ores, recycled materials, and fume-size emissions of plants without specific enrichment. In contrast, Pb (8 %) and Zn (15 %) contents of PM 10 of <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> were found to be markedly higher than those of raw dust, Pb (4 %), and Zn (9 %), respectively. In the same way, Pb (0. 18 %), Zn (0. 20 %), and Cd (0. 004 %) were enriched by 1. 7, 2. 1, and 2. 3 times, respectively, in PM 10 as compared with raw top-soil corresponding values. X-ray wavelength dispersive electron-microprobe (EM-WDS) microanalysis did not indicate well-defined phases or simple stoichiometries of all the PM 10 samples at the level of the spatial resolution (1 m 3). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that minor elements such as Cd, Hg, and C are more concentrated on the particle surface than in the bulk of PM 10 generated by the smelting processes. (XPS) provided also the average speciation of the surface of PM 10; Pb is mainly represented as PbSO 4, Zn as ZnS, and Cd as CdS or CdSO 4, and small amounts of coke were also detected. The speciation of bulk PM 10 crystallized compounds was deduced from XRD diffractograms with a raw estimation of the relative quantities. PbS and ZnS were found to be the major phases in PM 10 generated by the smelting facilities with PbSO 4, PbSO 4 ·PbO, PbSO 4 · 4 PbO, Pb metal, and ZnO as minor phases. The slag waste PM 10 was found to contain some amounts of PbCO 3, PbSO 4 ·PbO, and ZnFe 2 O 4 phases. The large heterogeneity at the level of the individual particle generates severe overlap of chemical information even at the m scale using electron microprobe (WDS) and Raman microprobe techniques. Fortunately, scanning Raman microspectrometry combined with SIMPle-to-use Interactive Self-modeling Mixture Analysis (SIMPLISMA) performed the PM 10 speciation at the level of individual particles. The speciation of major Pb, Zn, and Cd compounds of PM 10 stack emissions and wind blown dust of ores and recycled materials were found to be PbSO 4, PbSO 4 ·PbO, PbSO 4 · 4 PbO, PbO, metallic Pb, ZnS, ZnO, and CdS. The PM 10 dust of slag waste was found to contain PbCO 3, Pb(OH) 2 · 2 PbCO 3, PbSO 4 ·PbO, and ZnS, while PM 10 -bound Pb, Zn of the top-soils contain Pb 5 (PO 4) 3 Cl, ZnFe 2 O 4 as well as Pb(II) and Zn(II) compounds adsorbed on Fe(III) oxides and in association with clays...|$|E

The Energy & Environmental Research Center has undertaken a fundamental study to address the viability of cofiring biomass with coal in a pulverized coal (pc) -fired boiler for power production. Wheat straw, alfalfa stems, and hybrid poplar were selected as candidate biomass materials for blending at a 20 wt% level with an Illinois bituminous coal and an Absaloka subbituminous coal. The biomass materials were found to be easily processed by shredding and pulverizing to a size suitable for cofiring with pc in a bench-scale downfired furnace. A literature investigation was undertaken on mineral uptake and storage by plants considered for biomass cofiring {{in order to understand the}} modes of occurrence of inorganic elements in plant matter. Sixteen essential elements, C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, B, Mo, and Cl, are found throughout plants. The predominant inorganic elements are K and Ca, which are essential to the function of all plant cells and will, therefore, be evenly distributed throughout the nonreproductive, aerial portions of herbaceous biomass. Some inorganic constituents, e. g., N, P, Ca, and Cl, are organically associated and incorporated into the structure of the plant. Cell vacuoles are the repository for excess ions in the plant. Minerals deposited in these ubiquitous organelles are expected to be most easily leached from dry material. Other elements may not have specific functions within the plant, but are nevertheless absorbed and fill a need, such as silica. Other elements, such as Na, are nonessential, but are deposited throughout the plant. Their concentration will depend entirely on extrinsic factors regulating their availability in the soil solution, i. e., moisture and soil content. Similarly, Cl content is determined less by the needs of the plant than by the availability in the soil solution; in addition to occurring naturally, Cl is present in excess as the anion complement in K fertilizer applications. An analysis was performed on existing data for switchgrass samples from ten different farms in the south-central portion of Iowa, with the goal of determining correlations between switchgrass elemental composition and geographical and seasonal changes so as to identify factors that influence the elemental composition of biomass. The most important factors in determining levels of various chemical compounds were found to be seasonal and geographical differences related to soil conditions. Combustion testing was performed to obtain deposits typical of boiler fouling and slagging conditions as well as fly ash. Analysis methods using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy and chemical fractionation were applied to determine the composition and association of inorganic materials in the biomass samples. Modified sample preparation techniques and mineral quantification procedures using cluster analysis were developed to characterize the inorganic material in these samples. Each of the biomass types exhibited different inorganic associations in the fuel as well as in the deposits and fly ash. Morphological analyses of the wheat straw show elongated 10 - 30 -{micro}m amorphous silica particles or phytoliths in the wheat straw structure. Alkali such as potassium, calcium, and sodium is organically bound and dispersed in the organic structure of the biomass materials. Combustion test results showed that the blends fed quite evenly, with good burnout. Significant <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> formation was observed for the 100 % wheat straw, compared to bituminous and subbituminous coals burned under similar conditions. Although growing rapidly, the fouling deposits of the biomass and coal-biomass blends were significantly weaker than those of the coals. Fouling was only slightly worse for the 100 % wheat straw fuel compared to the coals. The wheat straw ash was found to show the greatest similarity from the fuel to the ash analyzed. A high percentage of particles from both fuel and ash samples contained both Si and K. While Cl was a significant component in the fuel, very little was detected in the ash sample...|$|E
40|$|The Space Shuttle Columbia was {{descending}} for {{a landing}} at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on February 1, 2003. Approximately 20 minutes prior to touchdown, the Columbia began disintegrating over the western United States; the majority of debris eventually impacted in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. A monumental effort eventually recovered approximately 84, 000 pieces of debris, approximately 38 % of the Orbiter's original dry weight. The debris was transported to KSC, where the items were catalogued and evaluated. Critical areas of interest, such as {{the left and right}} leading edge surfaces and the underside of the ship, were placed upon a grid to aid in the reconstruction. Items of interest included metallic structures, reinforced carbon-carbon composites, and ceramic heat insulation tiles. Many of the leading edge elements had re-solidified metallic deposits spattered on them. These deposits became known as slag and were one of the main focuses of the investigation. In order to help determine the sequence of events inside the left wing during the accident, the slag's composition, layering order, and directionality of deposition were studied. A myriad of analytical tests were performed in an attempt to ascertain the compositional and depositional characteristics of selected slag deposits, including the ordering of deposited layers within each individual <b>slag</b> <b>deposit</b> harvested. Initially, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) were performed to quickly characterize the overall composition of individual slag deposits: SEM utilizes a narrowlyfocused high-energy electron beam impinging upon a specimen. The incident beam excites and liberates lower energy secondary electrons, which are detected and analyzed, providing a visual representation of the sample's surface topography. EDX also relies on an incident electron beam, except an EDX unit measures X-ray energies generated by the impinging beam. Each element generates a unique X-ray signature; the EDX detector measures these discreet energies. EDX actually penetrates approximately 2 microns into the bulk of the sample. However, random examination of various portions of slag, coupled with the semiquantitative nature of the SEM/EDX analysis, did not yield convincingly pertinent data. Therefore, X-ray dot mapping was conducted, which provided more understandable data, both in terms of slag layering and composition. An X-ray dot map is generated by performing numerous EDX scans for individual elements, then compiling the scans in a visual representation. Eventually, specimens consisting of not only the slag, but of the adjacent RCC substrate as well were cross-sectioned. X-Ray dot mapping of the materialographicallymounted and -polished cross- sections provided a visual representation of both the layering sequence and compositional characteristics of the slag. Contemporaneously, Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis/X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ESCA/XPS) and powdered X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) were performed to further characterize the deposits and to attempt to identify what, if any, compounds were present. The ESCA/XPS analysis allowed the analyst to "sputter" into the sample with an electron gun, aiding in the identification of the layering sequence. XPS uses photons, rather than electrons, which impinge upon the surface of the sample. XPS measures the electrons emitted from within the first 5 nm of the sample's surface. The XRD measures the scatter angles of incident X-rays; the angle and intensity of scatter depend upon the crystalline structure of the pulverized sample. XRD is considered a qualitative rather than quantitative technique. ESCA/XPS revealed that the final layer to deposit was predominantly carbonaceous. XRD was successful in identifying specific compounds, such as Al 2 O 3, Al and/or Al 3 21 SiO 47, mullite (3 (Al 2) O 3 -SiO 2), and nickel-aluminides. Eventually, Electron MicroProbe Analysis (EMPA) was conducted on the marialographically-prepared cross- sections of selected slag deposits. Microprobe combines SEM and Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (WDS), and, like EDX, uses a narrowly-focused high-energy electron beam impinging upon a specimen to elicit, in the case of EPMA, characteristic X-rays with specific wavelengths. This quantitative, analytical tool proved the most useful in determining depositional layering and composition of the slag deposits. This information was utilized in verifying the location of the breach in the left leading edge of the wing of the Columbia...|$|E

50|$|With {{this type}} of firing, {{combustion}} is extremely rapid, and short flame length results. The mixing is so intense that combustion rates exceeding 35,000 Btu/(ft3·h) or 360 kW/m3 are practical under certain conditions. However, since there is considerable impingement of flame over the furnace walls it is absolutely necessary that they be fully water-cooled. This sweeping of the water-cooled surfaces, in the furnace, by the gas increases the evaporation rate. Thus, in addition to absorption by radiation from the flame envelope, there is transfer by convection, and the resulting furnace temperatures are lower than {{with other types of}} burners, even though the heat liberation rates may be somewhat higher. Tangentially fired furnaces are usually clean in the upper zone and, as a result, both the furnace and the boiler are comparatively free from objectionable <b>slag</b> <b>deposits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Industrial {{shotguns}} {{have long}} been used for specialized applications in servicing lime kilns, blast furnaces, and even for making seismic shots. Typically of 8 gauge, industrial shotguns are much larger than shotguns designed for use as weapons and are designed for firing using fixed mount stations, not being intended for firing from the shoulder. They are used for removing lime deposits from inside kilns and for removing <b>slag</b> <b>deposits</b> from inside blast furnaces, both being used during routine maintenance. The idea is comparable to sandblasting, in that projectiles are forcibly delivered by gas under pressure. When used for generating seismic shots, they provide very repetitive and consistent peak amplitude levels. Industrial shotguns have also been used in lesser sizes (most commonly 10 and 12 gauge) for use in bird control around airports. Both blanks and slugs are used in industrial shotguns, depending on the exact effect desired, blanks most commonly being used for bird control.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a multifaceted {{approach to the}} investigation of iron slag heaps, focusing {{on one of the}} slag heaps at the Royal City of Meroe in Sudan. This study marries together geoprospection data (gradiometry and electrical resistivity transects), topographic data and quantitative excavation data, to provide an analysis and comparison of the total volume, slag component and slag composition of a slag-heap. Significantly, the results demonstrate the limitations of using a topographic only model, but also demonstrate how volumetric modelling must be integrated within quantitative characterisation of slag-heap composition. In this case, quantitative sampling of the <b>slag</b> <b>deposits</b> revealed the composition of the slag assemblage was dominated by a newly defined category of slag which has major implications for reconstructing iron technologies in the Meroitic civilisation. This research highlights the dangers of applying simplistic models and basic investigative strategies to iron slag heaps and furthers the debate on applying volumetric modelling and excavation sampling to unexcavated areas of the finite and important resource of archaeometallurgical deposit sequences...|$|R
