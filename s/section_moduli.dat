30|$|To {{evaluate}} windthrow resistance {{with respect}} to stem breakage, a nondestructive method for determining the shape of trunk cross sections was developed. In this method, the coordinates of multiple gauge points set on the perimeter of a trunk are calculated by measuring the distances between them. The shape between the gauge points is generated {{with the use of}} a profile gauge placed between them. Measurement tests were conducted using profile gauges with lengths of 300 and 900 mm on model specimens with four shape patterns and four different diameters. The accuracy of the estimation was verified by comparing the section modulus calculated for the generated image and for the photograph. The average ratio of section modulus (generated/photo) for all specimens was 0.994, which indicates that the proposed method is highly accurate. The <b>section</b> <b>moduli</b> of hollow trunks can be evaluated using the profile method together with the drill resistance technique on the condition that 26 % of the trunk diameter could be drilled without skew.|$|E

They include control of the hull girder’s Section Modulus and the thickness of plates, web plates and flanges of stiffeners/girders. In addition, there are simplified requirements for the buckling strength of plates and stiffeners/girders. This paper presents the hull girder’s <b>Section</b> <b>Moduli</b> as probabilistic functions at any given ship’s age {{as a result of}} the random nature of the corrosion wear.

We examined the Affymetrix 500 K þ 50 K SNP GeneChip marker sets for associations with multiple osteoporosis-related traits at various skeletal sites, including bone mineral density (BMD, hip and spine), heel ultrasound, and hip geometric indices in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study. We evaluated 433, 510 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2073 women (mean age 65 years), members of two-generational families. Variance components {{analysis was performed}} to estimate phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations (rP, rG, and rE) among bone traits. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test associations between SNPs and multivariable-adjusted trait values. We evaluated the proportion of SNPs associated with pairs of the traits at a nominal significance threshold a 0. 01. We found substantial correlation between the proportion of associated SNPs and the rP and rG (r 0. 91 and 0. 84, respectively) but much lower with rE (r 0. 38). Thus, for example, hip and spine BMD had 6. 8 % associated SNPs in common, corresponding to rP 0. 55 and rG 0. 66 between them. Fewer SNPs were associated with both BMD and any of the hip geometric traits (eg, femoral neck and shaft width, <b>section</b> <b>moduli,</b> neck shaft angle, and neck length); rG between BMD and geometric traits ranged from 0. 24 to þ 0. 40.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensTrusses {{have been}} a common {{structural}} system for hundreds of years. The design and analysis of trusses evolved over time to its current state. Most manual truss analyses use the methods of joints and sections under idealized conditions. These ideal conditions, including pinned connections, cause discrepancies between the ideal truss being analyzed and the actual truss being constructed. The discrepancies include joint rigidity, connection eccentricity, and transverse loading. These cause secondary stresses, which induce bending moment into the truss members due to the chord’s continuity. Secondary stresses are most severe in continuous compression chord members. In these members, secondary stresses {{should be addressed to}} determine if they are severe and {{should be included in the}} truss design, or if idealized analysis will suffice. This report aims to determine the variables that affect the magnitude of secondary stresses in continuous compression chords due to chord continuity. The variables considered are chord stiffness, truss depth, and chord efficiency. Pratt trusses with WT chords were analyzed using the commercial analysis software RISA 3 D. Pinned and continuous chord trusses were compared using the interaction value for each chord member. The results were used to determine how these variables affect secondary stresses and how secondary stresses can be predicted. Evaluation criteria were examined to determine the severity of secondary stresses. These criteria examine the radius of gyration, moment of inertia, depth, and <b>section</b> <b>moduli</b> of the chord members, and the moment of inertia of the truss for determination of secondary stress severity. The results of the studies show that secondary stresses increase with increasing member stiffness, decreasing member efficiency, and decreasing truss depth. The necessity for secondary stress consideration can be determined most accurately using the radius of gyration criterion (L/r[subscript]x < 50) for the compression chord...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to study the {{separate}} effects of grain refiner and modifier on the metallurgical properties of LM 6 sand castings. The research aims to determine how grain refiner and modifier will influence the microstructure of LM 6 sand casting and the associated mechanical properties of hardness, ultimate tensile strength and engineering strain. Design/methodology/approach: A grain refiner consists of 0. 5 wt% Al- 5 Ti- 1 B and a modifier consists of 0. 5 wt% Al- 10 Sr have been introduced separately into the melt of hypoeutectic LM 6 Al-Si alloy to produce slab castings by CO 2 sand casting process. The geometry of the slab casting is designed to have different <b>section</b> <b>moduli</b> to induce directional solidification. Temperature profile of cooling process is taken to correlate between the section modulus and cooling rate. This enables the effect of cooling rate on microstructure and mechanical properties to be studied for grain refined and modified LM 6 sand castings. Findings: The significant finding is that a nearly full eutectic solidification at 540 °C is achieved in the Sr-modified casting with faster cooling rates than those of solely grain-refined and original LM 6. The hardness and ultimate tensile strength can be improved respectively between 20 ~ 40 % and 11 ~ 18 % by Al- 10 Sr modifier. It is observed that the Al- 5 Ti- 1 B grain refiner and Al- 10 Sr modifier increase the strain at UTS by 11 % and 22 % respectively. The metallographic observations show that the eutectic phase is finer and in fibrous form in the Sr-modified LM 6. Research limitations/implications: Further research can study a wider range of inoculant percentage. Practical implications: This eutectic solidification at 540 °C achieved in Sr-modified LM 6 is lower than the solidus temperature of LM 6 to reduce superheat and save electrical energy consumption while ensuring complete liquid mould filling. Originality/value: This is the original work of slab casting of LM 6 and the effects of Sr modifier and TiB grain refiner on its metallurgical properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of engineering theory and analysis to bone {{has led to}} many insights regarding the etiology of increased skeletal fragility with aging and diseases such as osteoporosis. According to mechanics of materials theory, whole bone mechanical behavior should depend {{on the amount of}} bone tissue, bone geometry, and tissue material properties. Through the use of micro-computed tomography, the influence of bone mass and geometry on whole bone strength and stiffness have been confirmed and quantified. With the {{application of}} nanoindentation to the study of bone, the ability to measure the mechanical properties of bone at the micron length scale is now possible. However, most studies using nanoindentation have focused only on tissue-level properties and, therefore, relatively {{little is known about the}} relationships between tissue-level properties and whole bone mechanical behavior. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine the effects of two composition changes, mineralization and crystallinity, on whole bone and tissue-level mechanical behavior, and 2) examine changes in tissue-level composition and mechanical properties due to osteoporosis. To investigate the effects of mineralization and crystallinity independently, two separate dietary interventions in rodents were used. First, vitamin D deficiency in growing rats was used to reduce cortical bone mineralization. The vitamin D deficient animals had compromised whole bone mechanical behav- ior, as indicated by the lower failure moment and bending stiffness. To take into account the mechanical property heterogeneity and cortex geometry when predicting whole bone mechanical behavior, a density-weighted section modulus was calculated using composite beam theory. The weighted <b>section</b> <b>moduli</b> predicted whole bone mechanical behavior better than geometric parameters or average mechanical properties alone. In the second study, growing rats given fluoride had increased cortical bone crystallinity and reduced measures of whole bone mechanical behavior. Cortical cross-sectional geometry was not different with fluoride, implying a difference in mechanical properties was responsible for the altered whole bone mechanical behavior; however, indentation modulus and hardness were not different. The discrepancies between tissue-level and whole bone mechanical behavior suggest that interfaces between microstructural features and other mesoscale features influence whole bone mechanical behavior. In the third study, tissue-level composition and mechanical properties of osteoporotic cancellous bone from a fracture prone location were examined. Vertebral cancellous bone from female cadavers was divided into two groups, osteoporotic and not osteoporotic based on T-scores from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans. Tissue from osteoporotic donors had lower indentation moduli and showed a trend towards being less mineralized compared to tissue from normal and osteopenic individuals. Independent of reduced bone mass and altered trabecular architecture, lower indentation moduli of osteoporotic bone could contribute to skeletal fragility associated with osteoporosis. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|E

In the model, tree-level gauge coupling unification is achieved automatically at the string scale, and the gauge symmetry may be broken to the Standard Model (SM) {{close to the}} string scale. The small number of extra chiral exotic states in the model may be decoupled via the Higgs mechanism and strong dynamics. We calculate the possible supersymmetry breaking soft terms and the corresponding low-energy supersymmetric particle spectra which may potentially be tested at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We find that for the viable regions of the parameter space the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass usually satisfies m_H < 120 GeV, and the observed dark matter density may be generated.

Typical one-complex dimensional <b>sections</b> of the <b>moduli</b> space parametrized by a global complex mass scale v display three qualitatively different regions depending on the ratio between |v| and the dynamically generated scale Lambda. At large |v|/Lambda, instantons are exponentially suppressed as N goes to infinity. When |v| is of order Lambda, singularities due to massless dyons occur. They are densely distributed in rings of calculable thicknesses in the v-plane. At small |v|/Lambda, instantons disintegrate into fractional instantons of charge 1 /(2 N). These fractional instantons give non-trivial contributions to all orders of 1 /N, unlike a planar diagrams expansion which generates a series in 1 /N^ 2, implying the presence of open strings. We have explicitly calculated the fractional instantons series in two representative examples, including the 1 /N and 1 /N^ 2 corrections.
