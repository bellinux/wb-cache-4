5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} course, the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution.

5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E

5|$|Ancient writers {{believed}} that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to Rome {{during the reign of}} the first king Romulus (traditionally 753717 BC) or his successor Numa (717673 BC). Modern scholars have variously <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> as the survival of an early animistic reverence for the power inherent in the boundary marker, or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a god concerned with the division of property.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> more than once.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E

Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself he did not see it.

5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably Holocene age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices.

Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> before being questioned.|$|E

5|$|Opening to mixed reviews, Manhunter fared poorly at the {{box office}} {{at the time of its}} release, making only $8.6 million in the United States. However, it has been reappraised in more recent reviews and now enjoys a more {{favorable}} reception, as both the acting and the stylized visuals have been appreciated better in later years. Its resurgent popularity, which may be due to later adaptations of Harris' books and Petersen's success in , has <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> labelled as a cult film.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the book's basic {{accuracy}} countered on {{the points}} raised by skeptics such as footbinding and the Great Wall of China. Historian Stephen G. Haw {{argued that the}} Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders. They note that the Great Wall familiar to us today is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both {{north and south of}} today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan Dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Batutta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan Dynasty, could find no one who had either <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> or knew of anyone who had <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they were not significant or noteworthy at that time.|$|E
