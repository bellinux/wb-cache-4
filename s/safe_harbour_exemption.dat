40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the current {{situation}} of Spanish case law on ISP liability. It starts by presenting the more salient peculiarities of the Spanish transposition of the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> laid down in the E-Commerce Directive. These peculiarities relate to the knowledge requirement of the hosting <b>safe</b> <b>harbour,</b> and to the <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> for information location tools. The article then {{provides an overview of}} the cases decided so far with regard to each of the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours.</b> Very few cases have dealt with the mere conduit and the caching <b>safe</b> <b>harbours,</b> though the latter was discussed in an interesting case involving Google’s cache. Most cases relate to hosting and linking <b>safe</b> <b>harbours.</b> With regard to hosting, the article focuses particularly on the two judgments handed down by the Supreme Court that hold an open interpretation of actual knowledge, an issue where courts had so far been split. Cases involving the linking <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> have mainly dealt with websites offering P 2 P download links. Accordingly, the article explores the legal actions brought against these sites, which for the moment have been unsuccessful. The new legislative initiative to fight against digital piracy – the Sustainable Economy Bill – is also analyzed. After the conclusion, the article provides an Annex listing the cases that have dealt with ISP liability in Spain since the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> scheme was transposed into Spanish law...|$|R
40|$|Safe harbour' is {{shorthand}} for {{a bundle of}} privileges in insolvency which are typically afforded to financial institutions. They are remotely comparable to security interests as they provide a financial institution with a considerably better position as compared to other creditors should one of its counterparties fail or become insolvent. <b>Safe</b> <b>harbours</b> have been {{and continue to be}} introduced widely in financial markets. The common rationale for such <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> is that the protection they offer against the fallout of the counterparty’s insolvency contributes to systemic stability, as the dreaded ‘domino effect’ of insolvencies is not triggered from the outset. However, <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> also come in for criticism, being accused of accelerating contagion in the financial market in times of crisis and making the market more risky. This paper submits that the more important argument for the existence of <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> is liquidity in the financial market. <b>Safe</b> <b>harbour</b> rules do away with a number of legal concepts, notably those attached to traditional security, and thereby allow for the exponentiation of liquidity. Normative decisions of the legislator sanction <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> as modern markets could not exist without these high levels of liquidity. To the extent that <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> accelerate contagion in terms of crisis, which in principle is a valid argument, specific regulation is well suited to correct this situation, whereas to repeal or significantly restrict the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> would be counterproductive...|$|R

40|$|Data breach {{notification}} laws require organisations {{to notify}} affected persons or regulatory authorities when an unauthorised acquisition of personal data occurs. Most laws provide a <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> to this obligation if acquired data has been encrypted. There are {{three types of}} safe harbour: an exemption; a rebuttable presumption and factor-based analysis. We demonstrate, using three condition-based scenarios, that the broad formulation of most encryption <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> {{is based on the}} flawed assumption that encryption is the silver bullet for personal information protection. We then contend that reliance upon an encryption <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> should be dependent upon a rigorous and competent risk-based review that is required on a case-by-case basis. Finally, we recommend the use of both an encryption <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> and a notification trigger as our preferred choice for a data breach notification regulatory framework.

40|$|US {{state-based}} {{data breach}} notification laws have unveiled serious corporate and government failures regarding {{the security of}} personal information. These laws require organisations to notify persons who may be affected by an unauthorized acquisition of their personal information. <b>Safe</b> <b>harbours</b> to notification exist if personal information is encrypted. Three types of <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> {{have been identified in}} the literature: exemptions, rebuttable presumptions and factors. The underlying assumption of exemptions is that encrypted personal information is secure and therefore unauthorized access does not pose a risk. However, the viability of this assumption is questionable when examined against data breaches involving encrypted information and the demanding practical requirements of effective encryption management. Recent recommendations by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) would amend the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) to implement a data breach scheme that includes a different type of <b>safe</b> <b>harbour,</b> factor based analysis.
