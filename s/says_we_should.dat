2500|$|Chet Raymo, physics {{professor}} at Stonehill College writes that [...] "Ray Kurzweil {{has a better}} record than most at foreseeing the digital future" [...] and [...] "Kurzweil paints a tantalizing — and sometimes terrifying — portrait of {{a world where the}} line between humans and machines has become thoroughly blurred". He says the book is a [...] "welcome challenge to beliefs we hold dear" [...] and feels we can only shape the future if we anticipate it first. Jim Bencivenga, staff writer for The Christian Science Monitor, says Kurzweil [...] "possesses a highly refined and precise ability to think exponentially about technology over time". Bencivenga also <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> take Kurzweil's predictions very seriously because of his [...] "proven track record". Lyle Feisel, former electrical engineering professor, writes the predictions from Kurzweil's The Age of Intelligent Machines [...] "have largely come true" [...] and so [...] "engineers and computer scientists would do well to give [...] a read".|$|E

This is the nearest road to the chapel and the chateau. He <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> reach the former in half an hour.

6000|$|... "But I wasn't. And I {{think it}} best {{for us to}} forget that horrible siege. It is past. It is a miracle that any one was spared. Ebenezer <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not grieve {{for those who are}} gone; they were heroic; they saved the Fort. He says too, that we shall never again be troubled by Indians. Therefore let us forget and be happy. I have {{forgotten}} Miller. You can afford to do the same." ...|$|E

He said it would turn my hair a {{beautiful}} raven black--he positively assured me that it would. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I {{know what it feels}} like to have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they're not. I have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I hadn't then and I believed every word he said IMPLICITLY." ...|$|E
6000|$|Waverley turned, and was warmly {{embraced by}} Fergus Mac-Ivor. 'A {{thousand}} welcomes to Holyrood, once more possessed by her legitimate sovereign!

6000|$|... 'Mr. Dutton {{wants us}} to live out {{in some of the}} {{suburban}} places, where it seems there is a perfect population of clerks' families in semi-detached houses. He <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> save Mark's railway fare, rent, and all in doctors' bills. But people, children and all, do live and thrive in the City; and I think Mark's health will be better looked after if I am there to give him his midday bite and sup, and brush him up, than if he is left to cater for himself; and as to exercise for the Billy-boy, 'tis not so far to the Thames Embankment. The only things that stagger me are the blacks! I don't know whether life is long enough to be after the blacks all day long, but perhaps I shall get used to them!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} important news, Mr. Hilliard. Hitherto we have supposed that Fadil {{had joined the}} Khalifa before the fight at Omdurman, and there was therefore no fear of his reappearing here. We know {{very little of the}} force at Gedareh. We took some prisoners yesterday, but their accounts are very conflicting. Still, {{there is every reason to}} believe that the garrison is not strong. Certainly, as General Rundle <b>says,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be in a much better position there than if we were attacked in the open. No doubt the Arabs who got off in the skirmish, yesterday, carried the news there; and probably some of them would go direct to Fadil, and if he came down upon us here, with his eight thousand men, our position would be a desperate one. It cost us four days to cross the river at El Fasher, and would take us as much to build boats and recross here; and before that time, he might be upon us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruby Gillis {{thinks of}} nothing but beaus," [...] said Anne disdainfully. [...] "She's {{actually}} delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I'm afraid that is an uncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I simply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying {{to be as much}} like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect. Mr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper to talk about on Sundays {{and that is one of}} them. My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties. I'm striving very hard to overcome it and now that I'm really thirteen perhaps I'll get on better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We should paint," [...] Henri said, [...] "that is to <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> paint {{if things}} go as I think they will, and the National Guard refuse to fight.

"It is {{certainly}} shorter, señor; and, as you <b>say,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{have no trouble}} with the brigands, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> also escape the troubles {{that have been going}} on for some years, and are likely, as far as anyone can see, to go on for ever.

6000|$|... "Grandma lets {{me have a}} {{glass of}} milk and a slice of bread and butter before I go to bed; and on Sunday nights she puts jam on the bread," [...] said Paul. [...] "So I'm always glad when it's Sunday night [...] . for more reasons than one. Sunday is a very long day on the shore road. Grandma says it's all too short for her and that father never found Sundays {{tiresome}} {{when he was a little}} boy. It wouldn't seem so long if I could talk to my rock people but I never do that because Grandma doesn't approve of it on Sundays. I think a good deal; but I'm afraid my thoughts are worldly. Grandma <b>says</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never think anything but religious thoughts on Sundays. But teacher here said once that every really beautiful thought was religious, no matter what it was about, or what day we thought it on. But I feel sure Grandma thinks that sermons and Sunday School lessons are the only things you can think truly religious thoughts about. And when it comes to a difference of opinion between Grandma and teacher I don't know what to do. In my heart" [...] . Paul laid his hand on his breast and raised very serious blue eyes to Miss Lavendar's immediately sympathetic face [...] "I agree with teacher. But then, you see, Grandma has brought father up HER way and made a brilliant success of him; and teacher has never brought anybody up yet, though she's helping with Davy and Dora. But you can't tell how they'll turn out till they ARE grown up. So sometimes I feel as if it might be safer to go by Grandma's opinions." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of the same day, the 3d of December, Cicero again {{addressed}} the people, explaining to them what he had done, and what he had before explained in the Senate. This was the third Catiline speech, and for rapid narrative is perhaps surpassed by nothing that he ever spoke. He explains again the motives by which he had been actuated; and in doing so extols the courage, the sagacity, the activity of Catiline, while he ridicules the folly and the fury of the others.[206] Had Catiline remained, he <b>says,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have been forced to fight with him here in the city; but with Lentulus the sleepy, and Cassius the fat, and Cethegus the mad, it has been comparatively easy to deal. It was on this account that he had got rid of him, knowing that their presence would do no harm. Then he reminds the people of all that the gods have done for them, and addresses them in language which makes one feel that they did believe in their gods. It is one instance, one out of many which history and experience afford us, in which an honest and a good man has endeavored to use for salutary purposes a faith in which he has not himself participated. Does the bishop of to-day, when he calls upon his clergy to pray for fine weather, believe that the Almighty will change the ordained seasons, and cause his causes to be inoperative because farmers are anxious for their hay or for their wheat? But he feels that when men are in trouble it is well that they should hold communion with the powers of heaven. So much also Cicero believed, and therefore spoke as he did on this occasion. As to his own religious views, I shall say something in a future chapter.|$|E

"Almost 2000 years ago, {{a strange}} {{character}} called Jesus Christ went about Palestine <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all love our enemies, {{but he was}} crucified before much notice was taken of him, and it is curious that the very land of Palestine {{is now one of}} the World [...] "Trouble spots" [...] in 1974." ...|$|R

2500|$|Under the {{influence}} of the Taliban, men accused of sodomy were sometimes killed by having a wall toppled over them. In February 1998, three men accused of sodomy were taken to the base of a mud and brick wall, which was then toppled over onto them by a tank. A similar death sentence for two men occurred in March 1998. Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Hassan, was reported to say, [...] "Our religious scholars are not agreed on the right kind of punishment for homosexuality. Some <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> take these sinners to a high roof and throw them down, while others <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> dig a hole beside a wall, bury them, then push the wall down on top of them." [...] Prior to Taliban rule, the supposedly [...] "Islamic" [...] punishment of having walls toppled onto homosexuals was not precedented.|$|R

5000|$|As Reed <b>says,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not {{see this}} matriarchy as a [...] "lost paradise" [...] (page xviii). One obvious flaw with the early social {{structure}} based on totem and taboo was that it always required some people to be outside the favoured kin groups {{in order to provide}} sexual partners (pp319,355,381). When men started to cohabit with women as husbands they were divided between their responsibility in their own lineage for their sisters' sons and their responsibility for their wives' children. Reed speculates that this may have been the cause of widespread child sacrifices in many communities at the dawn of 'civilization' (pp403-4).|$|E
