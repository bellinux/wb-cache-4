40|$|Investigations of a foam {{glass-ceramic}} material synthesized from raw <b>siliceous</b> <b>earth</b> material by the two-stage method {{at temperatures}} below 950 °С {{have demonstrated the}} improvement of its physic mechanical properties in comparison with foam glass synthesized from glass cullet. This material actively interacts with microwaves {{and can be used}} for the development of protective screens reducing the adverse effect of microwaves on biological objects, anechoic chambers, and rooms with low level of electromagnetic background noise. Spectra of the transmission and absorption coefficients and of the complex dielectric permittivity for frequencies in the range 26 - 260 GHz are presented. The observed effects demonstrate the existence of regions with partial and total reflection arising on the glass-pore boundary and of the microwave interaction with ultradisperse carbon particles that remain after foaming with incomplete frothier transition from the soot to the gas phase...|$|E
40|$|A reversed-phase argentation {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method has}} been achieved for the determination of ginkgolic acids. Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode is applied to identify ginkgolic acids from ginkgo leaves. The leaves are extracted with ethanol and then cleaned-up by extraction of analytes with hexane after addition of an acidified saturated solution of sodium sulfate and <b>siliceous</b> <b>earth</b> to the matrix solution. Ginkgolic acids are determined within 30 min on a C₁₈ column with methanol– 5 % aqueous acetic acid (90 : 10) containing 0. 03 mol l⁻¹ silver nitrate as eluent and with ultraviolet detection at 310 nm. Addition of silver ions as complexation agent into the mobile phase decreases retention time of ginkgolic acids with an unsaturated side chain. Four ginkgolic acids are successfully separated {{from each other and}} from other interfering components by the high selectivity of reversed-phase argentation HPLC, which is confirmed by the spectra identification. The average recovery of the method is around 97 %. Good reproducibility is obtained with relative standard deviations varying from 2 to 5 %. [URL]...|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of Rodez {{is packed with}} geological diversity. It straddles on the ancient base of Ségala composed of acidic <b>siliceous</b> <b>earths</b> of Les Rougiers to soil consisting of red argillite, and causses composed of limestones and marls. The city was built on a conical isolated terrain, locally called Le Piton, and gradually spread to the surrounding slopes. It {{is located in a}} level 2 zone of seismicity, in other words at a low level.|$|R
40|$|The company Kiviks Musteri AB {{produces}} a pear base wine that forms stable foam, which is problematic from a production perspective. The {{aim of this}} thesis {{was to investigate the}} factors underlying foam stability in the pear base wine and to find means for its reduction. This was done by foam testing wines and varying several variables, such as the fining agents normally used in the wine production (bentonite, gelatin, <b>siliceous</b> <b>earth</b> and activated carbon), enzyme treatment, and by changing the fermenting yeast species. Results: The wine started to form stable foam during fermentation, and foam stability could be reduced by using more bentonite and carbon during the fining process. The other fining agents appeared to have only limited impact on foaming characteristics. No pectin was present according to the pectin test, but protein bands were evident from SDS PAGE analysis, though absent in samples treated with increased doses of bentonite. In conclusion, pectin is not a major foaming agent in the wine, the yeast is most likely the producer of the foaming agents, carbon and bentonite have a reducing effect on foam stability, bentonite also reduces protein content. Proteins are likely {{to be involved in the}} foam stabilization but are not the sole contributors to stable foam...|$|E
