5|$|Athletes {{that have}} won {{at least two}} medals are listed below. Medalists are sorted first {{by the total number}} of medals, then <b>successively</b> by the number of gold, silver and bronze medals. If a tie is still verified, medalists are ordered {{chronologically}} by their first medal.|$|E
5|$|Coutances' nephew, John of Coutances, became Archdeacon of Oxford and Dean of Rouen under Walter's influence, {{and later}} Bishop of Worcester. Other nephews were William, <b>successively</b> a canon at Lincoln Cathedral and an archdeacon at Rouen, and Richard, also an archdeacon at Rouen.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 to 1957, three bodies, <b>successively</b> the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, the Federal Capital Commission, and the National Capital Planning and Development Committee {{continued}} {{to plan the}} further expansion of Canberra {{in the absence of}} Griffin; however, they were only advisory, and development decisions were made without consulting them, increasing inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|George held {{a number}} of titles {{throughout}} his life, as <b>successively</b> great-grandson, grandson and son of the monarch. As sovereign, he was referred to most often as simply The King or His Majesty. In his position as sovereign, George automatically held the position of Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, American {{scientists}} at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og. These parent nuclei {{were reported to have}} <b>successively</b> emitted seven alpha particles to form 265Rf nuclei, but their claim was retracted in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Retired {{from regular}} service in 1963 after {{covering}} 2.08 million miles, Flying Scotsman gained considerable fame in preservation under the ownership of, <b>successively,</b> Alan Pegler, William McAlpine, Tony Marchington, {{and finally the}} National Railway Museum (NRM).|$|E
5|$|Robert de Chesney (died December 1166) was {{a medieval}} English Bishop of Lincoln. He was {{the brother of}} an {{important}} royal official, William de Chesney, and the uncle of Gilbert Foliot, <b>successively</b> Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was Archdeacon of Leicester before his election as bishop in December 1148.|$|E
5|$|The phrase 'working your ticket' {{comes from}} a story {{attributed}} in Scouting legend to Baden-Powell: Upon completion of a British soldier's service in India, he had to pay the cost of his ticket home. The most affordable way for a soldier to return was to engineer a progression of assignments that were <b>successively</b> closer to home.|$|E
5|$|With the {{apparent}} murder of Radama II, {{the power of}} the Merina monarchs was broken. Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova, particularly Rainilaiarivony, who became Prime Minister after his brother and <b>successively</b> married all three remaining queens of the monarchy: Rasoherina, Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III.|$|E
5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted <b>successively</b> (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that <b>successively</b> shortens the {{interval}} in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein {{received}} his Master's degree {{in political science}} in 1980, and later his PhD in political studies, from Princeton. His doctoral thesis was on Zionism. Before gaining academic employment, Finkelstein was a part-time social worker with teenage dropouts in New York. He then taught <b>successively</b> at Rutgers University, New York University, Brooklyn College, and Hunter College and at DePaul University in Chicago. During the First Intifada, he spent every summer from 1988 in the West Bank, a guest of Palestinian families in Hebron and Beit Sahour.|$|E
5|$|In 1568 he {{departed}} for Rome, arriving in 1569 and joining the Society of Jesus. In 1571 {{he returned to}} Poland, and preached <b>successively</b> at Pułtusk, Lwów, Jarosław, Warsaw (where he delivered a sermon before the Sejm) and Płock, where he visited the court of Queen Anna Jagiellon, who {{would become one of}} his patrons. A leading proponent of counter-reformation, Skarga commonly preached against non-Catholic denominations and helped secure funds and privileges for the Society of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century it was <b>successively</b> {{the home}} of the notable {{scientists}} Dr William Budd FRS, who discovered the origins of typhoid, and Professor John Beddoe FRS, the social anthropologist who wrote The Races of Man. In the 1890s the house became a school preparing young gentlemen for colonial civil service examinations and for the army and navy. The school closed in 1915 and the house became {{the home of}} The Red Maids' School, which was evacuated from Westbury while their buildings were used as a Red Cross Hospital during the Great War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medical}} profession, {{he was known}} for {{transforming}} the teaching of anatomy, for the papers and books that he wrote, {{as well as for}} his efficient work in his medical school, for which he was <b>successively</b> awarded medicine's highest honours, including membership of the General Medical Council, fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the presidency of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and finally a knighthood.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 2010, Channel 4 {{announced}} {{the making of}} a four-part television miniseries based on the novel. Boyd wrote the screenplay, with (<b>successively)</b> Sam Claflin, Matthew Macfadyen and Jim Broadbent playing Mountstuart as he ages. It was broadcast from 21 November to 12 December 2010. The miniseries was broadcast in re-edited form as three one-and-a-half-hour episodes on 13, 20 and 27 February 2011 in the United States on PBS as part of the Masterpiece Classic program.|$|E
5|$|On January 22, 1836, {{the island}} was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout at an annual cost of 196 francs. Still, another treaty made Sédhiou the primary trading post of Casamance, and the {{exploitation}} of Carabane was left for {{some time in the}} hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre then his brother Jean. Each <b>successively</b> took on the title of Resident. With this official but ambiguous title, they were permitted to continue their trading operation so long as they regularly reported to France.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to England Bellingham spent six months in London, seeking {{compensation}} for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia. He considered the British authorities were responsible, through their neglect of his repeated requests for help. <b>Successively</b> he petitioned the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Privy Council, and Perceval himself; in each case his claims were politely rejected. Defeated and exhausted, in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family. He joined her in Liverpool to begin life afresh.|$|E
5|$|Only Rensselaerswyck was a {{successful}} patroonship. Van Rensselaer <b>successively</b> purchased Godyn's share in the patroonship from his heirs, so that van Rensselaer soon became the owner of three-fifths. The two other shares remained partly {{in the hands of}} Blommaert and partly in the hands of others: Adam Bessels owning Blommaert's fifth, while Johannes de Laet and Toussaint Muyssaert split Burgh's fifth between them.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{had risen}} to {{national}} prominence, <b>successively</b> chairing the Southern Governors Association, the Democratic Governors Association, and the National Governors Association (NGA). He was serving as NGA chair {{at the time the}} Tina Conner scandal broke, and planned to resign his chairmanship in November 2002. Nevertheless, the other governors rallied around him, convincing him to remain in the position. Together with his Republican vice-chair, Idaho's Dirk Kempthorne, Patton led the NGA effectively, securing federal funding to shore up state budgets and keeping the caucus from a partisan split in a vote over Medicaid.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{the history}} of Strasbourg and of France, the palace has been owned <b>successively</b> by the nobility, the {{municipality}}, the monarchy, the state, the university, and the municipality again. Its architectural conception and its iconography were intended to indicate the return of Roman Catholicism to the city, which had been dominated by Protestantism for the previous two centuries. Thus the prelate's apartments face the cathedral, to the north, {{and many of the}} statues, reliefs and paintings reflect the Catholic dogma.|$|E
5|$|Romanos Lekapenos {{had risen}} to power in 919, when {{he had managed to}} appoint himself regent over the young Constantine VII and marry his {{daughter}} Helena to him. Within a year, he <b>successively</b> rose from basileopator to Caesar, and was eventually crowned senior emperor on 17 December 920. To consolidate his hold on power, and with a view of supplanting the ruling Macedonian dynasty with his own family, he raised his eldest son Christopher to co-emperor in May 921, while Stephen and Constantine were proclaimed co-emperors on 25 December 924.|$|E
5|$|Since Wagner's death, the Bayreuth Festival, {{which has}} become an annual event, has been <b>successively</b> {{directed}} by his widow, his son Siegfried, the latter's widow Winifred Wagner, their two sons Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner, and, presently, two of the composer's great-granddaughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner. Since 1973, the festival has been overseen by the Richard-Wagner-Stiftung (Richard Wagner Foundation), the members of which include a number of Wagner's descendants.|$|E
5|$|The drip {{painting}} {{works of the}} modern artist Jackson Pollock are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 Number 14 has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had <b>successively</b> higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, Blue Poles, took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found deep inside holes {{at the bottom}} of {{blow-out}} craters. Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. <b>Successively</b> more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E
5|$|White Northern Republicans, {{and some}} Democrats, became excited about an {{abolition}} amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions. Many blacks, {{particularly in the}} South, focused more on landownership and education {{as the key to}} liberation. As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats <b>successively</b> announced their support for the amendment, including Representative James Brooks, Senator Reverdy Johnson, and Tammany Hall, a powerful New York political machine.|$|E
5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) with a bunch of grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord <b>successively</b> of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S.atratus), despite size and colour differences, and sent them to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began {{to attract the attention of}} biologists, and were <b>successively</b> identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.|$|E
5|$|Charles Atangana (c. 1880 – 1 September 1943), {{also known}} by his birth name, Ntsama, and his German name, Karl, was the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Ewondo and Bane ethnic groups {{during much of the}} colonial period in Cameroon. Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests and administrators secured him <b>successively</b> more prominent posts in the colonial government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Chief Keokuk gave {{a generous}} portion {{of land to}} Antoine Le Claire's wife, Marguerite, the granddaughter of a Sauk chief. Le Claire built their home on the exact spot where the {{agreement}} was signed, as stipulated by Keokuk, or he would have forfeited the land. Le Claire finished the 'Treaty House' {{in the spring of}} 1833. He founded Davenport on May 14, 1836, naming it for his friend Colonel George Davenport, who was stationed at Fort Armstrong during the war. The city was incorporated on January 25, 1839. The area was <b>successively</b> governed by the legislatures of the Michigan Territory, the Wisconsin Territory, Iowa Territory and finally Iowa.|$|E
5|$|During PedroII's {{minority}} {{the governing}} regency faced countless rebellions throughout the country. Again breaking {{with his father}} and other relatives sympathetic to the rebels, from 1839 to 1845 Caxias commanded loyalist forces suppressing such uprisings as the Balaiada, the Liberal rebellions of 1842 and the Ragamuffin War. In 1851, under his command, the Brazilian army prevailed against the Argentine Confederation in the Platine War; a decade later Caxias, as army marshal (the army's highest rank), led Brazilian forces to victory in the Paraguayan War. As a reward he was raised to the titled nobility, becoming <b>successively</b> a baron, count, and marquis, finally becoming the only person created duke during PedroII's 58-year reign.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Strasbourg, Calvin was not {{attached}} to one particular church, but held his office <b>successively</b> in the Saint-Nicolas Church, the Sainte-Madeleine Church and the former Dominican Church, renamed the Temple Neuf. (All of these churches still exist, but none are in the architectural state of Calvin's days.) Calvin ministered to 400–500 members in his church. He preached or lectured every day, with two sermons on Sunday. Communion was celebrated monthly and congregational singing of the psalms was encouraged. He also worked on the second edition of the Institutes. Calvin was dissatisfied with its original structure as a catechism, a primer for young Christians.|$|E
5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness <b>successively</b> increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Ryan {{was elected}} mayor of South San Francisco. He served {{less than a}} year as mayor, before taking a seat in the California State Assembly's 27th district, winning his {{assembly}} race by a margin of 20,000 votes. He had previously run for the State Assembly's 25th district in 1958, but lost to Republican Louis Francis. Ryan served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1964 and 1968, and he held his Assembly seat through 1972, when {{he was elected to the}} United States House of Representatives. He was <b>successively</b> elected three more times to the United States Congress.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind {{begins with}} the player's character, having been imprisoned, {{arriving}} in Morrowind by boat {{in order to be}} pardoned. This is a common introductory segment throughout the main installments of the series. A tutorial depicting the prisoner's release moves the player through the process of character creation. The player is <b>successively</b> asked questions by a fellow prisoner, an officer, and a bureaucrat as the player is registered as a free citizen; choosing, in the process, the player character's name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. These affect the player's starting attributes, skills, and abilities. The player then determines their class in one of three ways; Picking from a class list, randomly generating a class via questions, or creating a custom class themselves.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin had no {{legitimate}} descendants, {{though it}} is probable he had illegitimate issue. Four of his five sisters {{lived long enough to}} bear children, but only the daughters of his sister Marfa Elena (sometimes rendered as 'Helen') received Potemkin's special attention. The five unmarried Engelhardt sisters arrived in court in 1775 on the direction of their recently widowed father Vassily. Legend suggests Potemkin soon seduced many of the girls, one of whom was twelve or thirteen at the time. An affair with the third eldest, Varvara, can be verified; after that had subsided, Potemkin formed close—and probably amorous—relationships <b>successively</b> with Alexandra, the second eldest, and Ekaterina, the fifth.|$|E
