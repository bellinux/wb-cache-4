40|$|<b>Sandeels</b> {{are known}} to be {{negatively}} affected by climate change in a number of ways. This study investigated whether these changes are affecting the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a species which consumes <b>sandeels.</b> Porpoise diet was examined in spring (Marchâ€“May), a critical time of year for survival when <b>sandeels</b> are important prey, from 1993 to 2001 to provide baseline information on the proportion of <b>sandeels</b> consumed. When data from spring 2002 and 2003 were compared to these baseline data, the diet was found to be substantially different, with a significant and substantially smaller proportion of <b>sandeels</b> being consumed in March and May. There were also differences in the number of porpoises starving between the two time periods (33 % in spring 2002 and 2003 died of starvation, but only 5 % in the baseline period). This suggests that a lower proportion of <b>sandeels</b> in the diet of porpoises in spring increases the likelihood of starvation. Therefore, we suggest that the negative effects of climate change on sandeel availability may have serious negative effects on harbour porpoise populations in the North Sea by increasing the likelihood of starvation in spring...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese <b>sandeel</b> (Ammodytes personatus) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the coastal area of Japan, {{and especially in the}} summer months, they could be found in the northern coast of Hokkaido. <b>Sandeel</b> {{plays an important role in}} marine ecosystem and represents one of the most commercial coastal fisheries species in Japan. In order to get a better understanding of the Japanese <b>sandeel</b> distribution in the northern coast of Hokkaido for <b>sandeel</b> abundance estimation and management, fishery-independent method for <b>sandeel</b> distribution estimates is needed. The main objective of this study is to estimate the Japanese <b>sandeel</b> distribution in the northern coast of Hokkaido and the secondary objective is to characterize the suitable condition as <b>sandeel</b> habitat. The study area is located off Wakkanai, in the northern coast of Hokkaido, Japan. Acoustic surveys and measurement of oceanographic conditions were conducted in June 2010 and 2011 respectively. <b>Sandeel</b> distribution was estimated by species identification using the volume backscattering strength (SV) difference method. Target strength (TS) of <b>sandeel</b> was estimated by theoretical TS method (distorted-wave Born approximation, DWBA) and the mean and standard deviation for the tilt angle distribution were substituted into theoretical model. Using this TS values, echo trace of <b>sandeel</b> schools was converted to number of individual per unit area. Spatial patterns of <b>sandeel</b> schools were analyzed based on acoustic data and oceanographic conditions such as temperature, salinity, and depth. In this study, number of <b>sandeel</b> schools in 2010 was 8 and 11 schools in 2011, respectively. Most of <b>sandeel</b> abundance was found in the coastal area of 30 to 50 m in bottom depths, and they existed in the near sea bottom. In relation with oceanographic condition, this study showed that <b>sandeel</b> densities tended to be highest in the specific range of 9 - 10 oC in temperature, and 33. 8 - 33. 9 psu in salinity. Probably, <b>sandeel</b> distribution was affected by the mixed water of Soya Warm Current (SWC) and East Sakhalin Current (ESC). From these results, there is a possibility that the oceanographic condition is an important factor for explaining the spatial distribution of Japanese <b>sandeel</b> in the northern coast of Hokkaido...|$|R

The Simrad SH 90 high frequency omidirectional sonar was used in a field experiment in 2011 to acoustically investigate the distribution of Lesser <b>sandeel</b> (Ammodytes marinus) during the North Sea <b>sandeel</b> survey by the Norwegian research vessel Johan Hjort". The sonar was applied together with conventional echo sounder survey, with trawl and dredge sample stations at various point. During the survey, sonar screenshots were recorded for 750 school from the total survey period, while two <b>sandeel</b> banks, the Inner Shoal East" and Hardangervidda" was investigated by using post-processing software LSSS for echo sounder data and PROFOS for sonar data. <b>Sandeel</b> school parameters were carefully analyzed from the screenshots by using the image editing software ImageJ". The results show that <b>sandeel</b> schools can well be detected with the Simrad SH 90 omnidirectional sonar in good to fair weather conditions. The effective detection range for weak schools in shallow water is about 250 m. The sonar showed greater capability of detecting <b>sandeel</b> schools during a conventional acoustic survey, with 3. 02 and 1. 44 times the detections of the echo sounder for Inner Shoal East and Hardangervidda respectively. The school area, perimeter, shape and position relative to the vessel, show that <b>sandeel</b> schools are relative large with an average horizontal area of 1225 m 2. However, the sonar system showed detection limitations {{with respect to the}} smaller schools situated near the seabed. A comparisons made between <b>sandeel</b> schools detected with both acoustic systems, show that the relative size of smaller <b>sandeel</b> schools are more often underestimated in areal size compared with the sonar, while the larger schools are overestimated.

Young Shags were fed almost exclusively lesser <b>sandeels.</b> The relative contributions of 0 -group and older <b>sandeels</b> varied markedly between years.

Although most published data suggest that lesser <b>sandeels</b> spend most of the winter buried in the sand they were obviously still available to Shags during this time and their otoliths occurred in 90 % of pellets and accounted for 90 % of otoliths. The availability of <b>sandeels,</b> specifically when the fish emerge from the sand in spring is probably a major determinant of the timing of breeding of Shags on the Isle of May...|$|E
40|$|Do {{large-scale}} industrial fisheries for <b>sandeels</b> impact 'human consumption' fishes by depriving them of food? In the North Sea, most sandeel fishing {{takes place}} on the Dogger Bank during spring. Here, we studied sandeel-fishery and sandeel-predatory fish interactions in 2 sampling grids, focussing on (1) how localised <b>sandeels</b> are distributed during the day (when feeding pelagically) and at night (when buried in the seabed); (2) how precisely the fishery can target localised sandeel concentrations; and (3) how tightly day/night sandeel distributions {{are linked to the}} local abundance of predatory fishes and their sandeel consumption. Sandeel abundance differed widely between both grids. Within each grid, marked day/night differences in distributions indicated extensive diurnal migrations, with centres of gravity of day and night distributions up to 15 km apart. Fishing effort was tightly matched with sandeel populations during the day and was far higher in the 'high sandeel density' grid. Only at the finest scale examined, effort was concentrated at sandbanks but not significantly matched with local sandeel numbers. This suggested either insufficient knowledge among fishers or vessel maneuverability issues, possibly relating to high mobility of <b>sandeels.</b> Ten predatory fishes (8 'human consumption' species) preyed on <b>sandeels,</b> most notably whiting and lesser weever. Spatial comparisons showed that the predominant sandeel predators were whiting during the day and lesser weever at night. Tight predator-prey interdependencies were revealed: whiting and weever exhibited 'aggregative responses' to <b>sandeels,</b> and most predators consumed more <b>sandeels</b> in the 'high sandeel density' grid. On the Dogger Bank, sandeel fishing effort is concentrated when and where <b>sandeels</b> are most available, but also where these are extensively and locally preyed upon by at least 10 predatory fish species. Hence concerns that this industrial fishery may indirectly impact predatory fishes by depriving them of food might have some basis. Â© Inter-Research 2008...|$|E
40|$|In 2000, a sandeel fishery off SE Scotland, which {{commenced}} in {{the early}} 1990 s, was closed in response to concerns that the fishery was having a deleterious effect on seabird breeding performance at colonies {{in the vicinity of}} the fishing grounds. Fishery-derived catch per unit effort (cpue) data are used together with three different fishery-independent survey techniques (acoustic, demersal trawl, and nocturnal grab survey) to assess variation in sandeel Ammodytes marinus population biomass in the area over the period 1997 â€“ 2003, a period that included the last three years that the fishery was operating and the first four years of the sandeel fishing moratorium. Temporal trends in estimates of sandeel biomass derived from these different assessment methods were inconsistent and, on the basis of these alone, it was not possible to determine whether sandeel population biomass in the area had increased following the closure of the fishery. The different survey methods assess different components of the sandeel population; acoustic survey and fishery cpue quantified <b>sandeels</b> active in the water column, whilst demersal trawl survey quantified <b>sandeels</b> buried in the sediments. These data were collected at a time of year when <b>sandeels</b> were moving between the seabed sediments and the overlying water column. A grab survey also quantified <b>sandeels</b> buried in the sediment, but these data were collected at a time of year when the entire population should have been buried in the sediment. Differences between the different time-series were reconciled by taking account of the cumulative total primary production in each year prior to the surveys. On the basis of this, a model was developed that utilized acoustic and demersal trawl survey data to estimate the total sandeel population biomass. This model was validated using the nocturnal grab-survey data. The modelled data indicated that the biomass of <b>sandeels</b> 1 + years old increased sharply in the first year of the closure and remained higher in all four of the closure years than in any of the preceding three years, when the fishery was operating. The biomass of 0 -group <b>sandeels</b> in three of the four closure years exceeded the biomass present in the three years of commercial fishing. Whereas the response of 1 + <b>sandeels</b> may have been a direct consequence of the closure, this is not likely to have been the case in respect of 0 -group <b>sandeels.</b> The closure appears to have coincided with a period of enhanced recruit production...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sandeel</b> partly {{spend their}} life {{buried in the}} sediment, without a {{permanent}} burrow opening or an inhalant opening in the sediment. We linked the presence of three <b>sandeel</b> species (Ammodytes tobianus, A. marinus and Hyperoplus lanceolatus) off the southern Dutch coast of the North Sea to sediment related environmental variables; (1) sediment composition, with a hypothesized preference for low silt content and high mediumcoarse sand content, (2) water velocity near the seabed, with a hypothesized preference for high water velocity and (3) fishing effort of the beam trawl fleet targeting flatfish and shrimp, with a hypothesized negative impact of fishing on <b>sandeel</b> presence. Data originated from an intensive benthic sampling scheme, VMS and logbook databases and a hydrodynamic model. Statistical models were run including these environmental variables plus year, depth, water temperature and salinity. <b>Sandeel</b> presence was negatively correlated with flatfish and shrimp fisheries â€“ both Ammodytes species with flatfish fisheries and H. lanceolatus with shrimp fisheries. Water velocity and silt content were correlated as hypothesized {{with the presence of}} all species, and sand content was positively correlated with both Ammodytes species. The remaining environmental variables also showed a significant relation with at least two <b>sandeel</b> species. These findings agree with and greatly expand on previous studies on the relation between <b>sandeel</b> and its environment...|$|R
40|$|The lesser <b>sandeel,</b> Ammodytes marinus, {{is a key}} {{food for}} many seabirds and seals, and is also {{the target of the}} largest single-species fishery in the North Sea. Despite claims that <b>sandeel</b> fishing has harmed {{dependent}} predator populations, census data show that most seabirds and grey seals increased in numbers as the fishery grew and reached peak harvest. Generally high breeding success of black-legged kittiwakes at North Sea colonies also suggests that <b>sandeel</b> abundance has remained good for breeding seabirds at the broad scale, though local and small-scale effects of <b>sandeel</b> fishing should not be overlooked. VPA and CPUE data suggest that abundance increased as the fishery grew. A negative correlation between <b>sandeel</b> recruitment and total stock size preceding spawning suggests that there is now resource competition (bottom-up control). Bioenergetics modelling indicates that predatory fish take far more <b>sandeel</b> than taken by the industrial fishery or wildlife. Effects of decreases in predatory fish stocks have been greater than increases in the take by seabirds and seals and by the fishery. Thus, overall, there {{appears to have been a}} reduction in mortality during the last 30 years. Changes in predatory fish abundances, especially mackerel and whiting, may influence <b>sandeel</b> stocks more than changes in industrial fishery, at least at the scale of the North Sea as a whole. These interactions imply that seabird and seal food supply in terms of <b>sandeel</b> may be strongly dependent on decisions regarding management of stocks of mackerel and gadoids. The overwhelming influence of predation on "food-fish" by predatory fish may be a feature of many marine food webs worldwide, where "fishing down the food web" has occurred, and this has clear management implications if wildlife and fisheries are to coexist...|$|R

Pellets are easy to collect and are useful to detect gross changes in diet of full-grown, but possibly non-breeding, Shags between years or colonies. Otoliths recovered from pellets cannot be used for age determination or back-calculations of size of <b>sandeels</b> eaten by Shags. Regurgitations can be used to describe the diet of chicks.

40|$|The lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus is a {{critically}} important mid-trophic {{species in the}} North Sea ecosystem. Seabirds suffered widespread breeding failures in the North Sea in 2004, due to shortages of <b>sandeels,</b> their principal food. Industrial sandeel fisheries also failed in 2003 to 2005. Explaining why <b>sandeels</b> were in short supply is thus critical to understanding and managing the North Sea ecosystem. Sandeel abundance may be controlled â€˜bottom-upâ€™ by food availability or â€˜top-downâ€™ by predation, including fisheries. The relative importance of these 2 mechanisms may vary over space and time, and failure {{to take account of}} such variation may lead to inappropriate management. We summarise the available evidence for top-down or bottom-up control of sandeel abundance in 2 well-studied North Sea regions differing in many biotic and abiotic characteristics. In Shetland, recent low abundance of <b>sandeels</b> coincided with record-high abundance of herring, which may have exerted a top-down predation pressure on <b>sandeels.</b> Off SE Scotland, where adult herrings are scarce, abundance of sandeel larvae was positively correlated with plankton abundance, indicating bottom-up control. Seabird breeding failures in this area in 2004 were linked to extremely low energy content of <b>sandeels.</b> Large-scale sandeel fisheries have not been operating in either area since 2000. Control of food web structure and function in the North Sea is thus likely to be complex, with pronounced regional variation. Improved cooperation between diverse research organisations will be needed to understand this complexity, and future ecosystem-based management of marine bioresources will need to take the results of such research into account...|$|E
40|$|Seabirds in the UK were {{generally}} more productive in 2005 than in 2004, when productivity for many species reached an all-time low. A presumed scarcity of <b>sandeels</b> in 2004, {{especially in the}} North Sea, led to widespread starvation of chicks in the Northern Isles and in many places along {{the east coast of}} Britain (there is also recent evidence that prey fish were of unusually low energy content in 2004 around SE Scotland). The likely knock-on effect for 2005 was that there were few larger <b>sandeels</b> present (those that hatched in 2004) and it is thought that feeding on these fish allow adults to attain breeding condition in spring. This food scarcity and a cold spring led to what was among the latest breeding seasons on record. However, a late appearance of young <b>sandeels</b> allowed some chicks to fledge, and alternative prey species (such as sprat and small haddock) were taken also. However, it is thought that some chicks starved in this late season, as <b>sandeels</b> become unavailable in late summer, when they settle on the seabed. Unusually, 2005 was a very poor breeding season for many species in NW Scotland, which was spared the food shortages of 2004 and previous years; preferred prey during chick rearing were scarce in this region in 2005...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a decline in both size and the {{geographical}} distribution of the <b>sandeel</b> stock. The decline has been particularly profound in the Norwegian economic zone where the <b>sandeel</b> play an important part {{not only in terms of}} economic interests, but also in transferring energy from the planktonic society to the higher trophic levels. If there are not enough copepods to feed on, the <b>sandeel</b> along with several other animals would lose its basis of existence. As a part of the IMR SMASSC (Survey methods for abundance estimation of <b>sandeel</b> (Ammodytes marinus) stocks) project it was decided to develop methods for acoustic identification and abundance estimation of copepods. This was done by comparing biological samples to acoustic abundance estimates using multi frequency methods with the operating frequencies 18, 38, 120 and 200 kHz collected in 2010. These data were to be compared with data collected in 2009 with six operating frequencies 18, 38, 70, 120, 200 and 333 kHz. Results from these studies indicate that 333 kHz is required in most cases to identify copepods, and that the copepod distribution is far too heterogeneous for biological net samples alone to be reliable. Acoustic methods are better suited for mapping geographical distribution of copepods and may also be better suited for abundance estimation of copepods than the time consuming net sampling methods. In addition, <b>sandeel</b> (Ammodyte marinus) digestion rate and gastric evacuation rate were monitored in a tankt. The digestion experiment implies that the <b>sandeel</b> leave the sand to feed once a day at the most.

40|$|Lesser <b>sandeels</b> Ammodytes marinus are {{eaten by}} {{a range of}} predatory fishes {{including}} commercially fished species, but are also exploited at large scale by industrial fisheries. Is availability of <b>sandeels,</b> as key prey source, linked to the body condition of predatory fishes? In the North Sea, the largest sandeel biomass is concentrated in the Dogger Bank region. Here we studied predator-sandeel interactions at two sites differing widely in sandeel abundance and local sandeel fishing effort. Surveys took place in 2004, 2005, and 2006, years when local sandeel densities observed at these sites were low, intermediate, and high, respectively. Five predator species [...] whiting, lesser weever, grey gurnard, plaice, and haddock [...] showed better body condition indices in either the years or study area (or both) characterised by higher local sandeel densities, when compared to sandeel-poorer conditions. Moreover, whiting, weever, and gurnard condition was better for those individuals actually observed to have eaten <b>sandeels</b> (based on stomach contents) than for those that had not. As body condition relates to growth, reproduction, and survival, predators in sandeel-rich conditions may be inferred {{to have a higher}} fitness. These links between sandeel availability, sandeel consumption, and predator condition hint that, if large-scale localised depletions of <b>sandeels</b> were to occur, negative indirect effects on predatory fish might become apparent, underlining the importance of considering the sandeel fishery in an ecosystem context.

40|$|R. J. S. was {{supported}} by a NERC studentship (NER/S/A/ 2000 / 03635) Harbour seal populations have declined by up to 40 % around northern and eastern Britain since 2000 due to unknown causes; prey availability is one important factor that could be contributing to the decline. We estimate the diet and prey consumption of a population of harbour seals in southeast Scotland, using analysis of hard prey remains recovered from scats, to investigate change in the importance of <b>sandeels</b> over 6 yr spanning the local sandeel fishery closure. The study site includes Special Areas of Conservation for harbour seals as well as vulnerable salmon stocks. We estimate the extent of harbour seal predation on salmon in the area. In St. Andrews Bay, harbour seal diet was heavily dominated by <b>sandeels,</b> especially in winter and spring. Gadoids (whiting, cod) and flatfish (dab, plaice, flounder) were the other main prey. The proportion of <b>sandeels</b> in the diet was remarkably consistent over time (71 to 77 %), but the average size of <b>sandeels</b> consumed increased following the closure of the fishery. In the Firth of Tay, <b>sandeels</b> were prevalent in winter, but the diet {{in the rest of the}} year was dominated by salmonids: salmon comprised 64 % of the diet in summer and sea trout comprised 40 % of the diet in autumn. Thus marked differences in diet were evident at a fine spatial scale. The effects of the sandeel fishery closure on harbour seals were equivocal, but harbour seals that haul out in SE Scotland are clearly dependent on sandeels; re-opening the fishery could thus have a negative impact and be inadvisable. We found evidence that local harbour seal predation could be impacting salmon stocks but the high uncertainty in estimates of seal diet and salmon stock size preclude the provision of management advice at this time.

We found little consistency in phenological trends between adjacent trophic levels, no significant relationships with SST, and no significant pairwise correlations between predator and prey phenologies, suggesting that trophic mismatching is occurring.

The date at which <b>sandeels</b> reached a given threshold length became significantly later during the study.

40|$|Seismic {{shooting}} with airguns {{has been}} conducted continuously in the North Sea for about 40 years. In {{the past two decades}} there has been conflicts of interest between Norwegian industrial trawlers fishing for <b>sandeel</b> and seismic exploration activities in the North Sea. The fishermen have claimed that seismic shooting scares fish to flee to the bottom where the burry deep in the sediments and die. A common experience is that catchability is reduced for a period after seismic shooting. In May 2002, a field experiment on the effect of seismic shooting on the lesser <b>sandeel</b> (Ammodytes marinus) was conducted in the southeastern part of the North Sea. Buried <b>sandeel</b> were trapped in customized, bottomless, steel frame cages deployed during night on aggregations of <b>sandeel</b> located by a van Veen grab. Three cages were deployed in an experimental area and exposed to sounds from a standard threedimensional (3 D) seismic survey for about 2. 5 days. The behaviour of the fish caged fish were monitored and recorded with cameras mounted in one of the cage and on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). A control area with two cages was established about 35 km southeast of the experimental area. Within the shooting area, a predetermined set of localities was repeatedly sampled by grab (van Veen) prior to and after seismic shooting. The seismic shooting had no immediate lethal effect on the <b>sandeel.</b> No dead <b>sandeel</b> was found in the grab samples and the total mortality in the cages was on average about 35 % both in the experimental and control groups. This mortality was probably a result of injuries due to handling and confinement. There {{was no significant difference in}} the catches of <b>sandeel</b> in the grab samples before and after shooting. Behaviour analyses from the video recordings showed that the caged fish did not flee to the bottom exposed to seismic shooting. They reacted to the shooting by performing C-starts and increased tailbeat frequency. Almost all C-starts were recorded during seismic shooting, none was recorded before and only one was recorded after. The tailbeat frequency was significantly higher both during and after than prior to seismic shooting and it did not return to preshooting levels during the 3 -day period after the shooting ended. Some of the results differ from other results found in comparable studies. The <b>sandeel</b> lacks swimbladder and are thought to have poor hearing abilities and this is suggested to be an explanation for these differences...|$|R

The lesser sandeel, Ammodytes marinus, is a key food for many seabirds and seals, and is also {{the target of the}} largest single-species fishery in the North Sea (Furness, 2002). Fisheries acoustic data were collected during 2 cruises in May 2004 and July 2004 around the Inner Hebrides, West Scotland. A fully calibrated EK 500 echosounder was used, operating at two frequencies (38 kHz and 120 kHz). The collected data was processed using SonarData Echoview software. Acoustic identification of <b>sandeels</b> was established by using a dB difference algorithm (?MVBS = MVBS 38 - MVBS 120; where ?MVBS < - 1 indicated <b>sandeels).</b> The resulting Nautical Area Backscattering Coefficient (NASC) was integrated for each 0. 5 nmi interval and converted to a relative estimate of mean sandeel density in seal foraging areas. Information on the spatial distribution and movements of 34 grey seals around the West Coast of Scotland in 2003 and 2004 have been collected by SMRU using Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SDRL) and will be used to compare sandeel densities and distribution in areas of high seal usage. The results indicated that the distribution of <b>sandeels</b> was extremely patchy along transects and the cruise track. A comparison of the relative abundance of <b>sandeels</b> in foraging areas showed that densities vary extremely between these areas. Highest densities of <b>sandeels</b> were recorded East of Tiree on the 14 th of May and in Stanton Banks on the 17 th of July. Future research will involve establishing a correlation between seal usage of foraging areas and sandeel abundance and distribution. In addition, the analysis of other fish species and zooplankton in these areas will contribute to a further understanding of foraging strategies of grey seals. The capabilities of underwater acoustic research and their implementation in ecosystem-based studies are constantly evolving. Interdisciplinary research should be encouraged in order to provide useful insights in ecosystem dynamics but also to benefit fisheries and conservation management strategies...|$|E
40|$|The lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus {{is a key}} {{species in}} the North Sea ecosystem, {{transferring}} energy from planktonic producers to top predators. Previous studies have shown a long-term decline {{in the size of}} 0 -group <b>sandeels</b> in the western North Sea, but they were unable to pinpoint the mechanism (later hatching, slower growth or changes in size-dependent mortality) or cause. To investigate the first 2 possibilities we combined 2 independent time series of sandeel size, namely data from chick-feeding Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica and from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR), in a novel statistical model implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The model estimated annual mean length on 1 July, as well as hatching date and growth rate for <b>sandeels</b> from 1973 to 2006. Mean length-at-date declined by 22 % over this period, corresponding to a 60 % decrease in energy content, with a sharper decline since 2002. Up to the mid- 1990 s, the decline was associated with a trend towards later hatching. Subsequently, hatching became earlier again, and the continued trend towards smaller size appears to have been driven by lower growth rates, particularly in the most recent years, although we could not rule out changes in size-dependent mortality. Our findings point to major changes in key aspects of sandeel life history, which we consider are most likely due to direct and indirect temperature-related changes over a range of biotic factors, including the seasonal distribution of copepods and intra- and inter-specific competition with planktivorous fish. The results have implications both for the many predators of <b>sandeels</b> and for age and size of maturation in this aggregation of North Sea <b>sandeels...</b>|$|E
40|$|Local {{differences}} in feeding conditions {{have been suggested}} {{as a cause of}} regional variation in seabird demography but multi-colony comparisons of diet are rare. In UK waters the main fish eaten by seabirds during the breeding season belong to three families: Ammodytidae, Clupeidae and Gadidae. Climate change and fishing are affecting these fish stocks and so probably impact on predators such as seabirds. We used standardized observations of prey brought in for chicks to make the first integrated assessment of the diet of Common Guillemot Uria aalge chicks at a UK scale. Chick diet varied markedly among the 23 colonies sampled between 2006 and 2011. <b>Sandeels</b> (Ammodytidae), probably Lesser <b>Sandeels</b> Ammodytes marinus, were the commonest prey. Their contribution to the diet varied both latitudinally and among marine regions, with the proportion significantly higher for a given latitude on the west coast compared to the east. The non-sandeel component of the diet showed latitudinal changes, with small clupeids, probably Sprats Sprattus sprattus, predominant at southern colonies whereas juvenile gadids were the main alternative to <b>sandeels</b> in the north. Comparison of our Guillemot chick diet with data collected 15 â€“ 30 years earlier suggests that the proportion of <b>sandeels</b> in the diet has decreased at colonies bordering the North Sea. No significant change was apparent in Atlantic colonies but historical data were limited. The early years of our study coincided with a population explosion of Snake Pipefish Entelurus aequoreus in the Northeast Atlantic and North Sea. Pipefish were recorded in Guillemot chick diet at several northern and northwestern colonies in 2006 and 2007 but have been absent since 2009. Spatial and temporal variation in chick diet accorded broadly with patterns expected as a result of rising sea temperatures and impacts of fishing. Guillemot chick diet could potentially be a useful indicator of changes in the distribution and abundance of forage fish. ...|$|E

We evaluate whether the CPR data are reliable for <b>sandeel</b> larvae. Spatially, CPR larval data were comparable with catches by dedicated larval samplers (Gulf and bongo nets) during ICES coordinated surveys in 2004 and 2009. ICES data are also used to explore environmental influences on <b>sandeel</b> distributions. Temporally, CPR data correlate with larval data from plankton surveys off Stonehaven (1999 â€“ 2005), with <b>sandeel</b> 0 -group trawl data at the east Fair Isle ground (since 1984), and with recruitment data (since 1983) for the Dogger Banks stock assessment area. Therefore, CPR data may provide an early recruit index of relative abundance for the Dogger Banks assessment area, where the majority of the commercial catch of A. marinus is taken, and the Wee Bankie area that is particularly important for seabird foraging.

40|$|International audienceIn {{contrast}} to the situation at {{the west coast of}} the North Sea, the breeding colony of black-legged kittiwakes at Helgoland in the south-eastern North Sea did not exhibit severe declines since 1990 but instead numbers increased and only lately stabilised. Declines at the west coast of the North Sea were attributed to a lower abundance and lower quality of the key prey, <b>sandeels.</b> We hypothesised that kittiwakes at Helgoland do not rely as heavily on <b>sandeels</b> as their conspecifics. We analysed stomach contents of nestlings and adults of 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2006. In concordance with earlier studies of the 1980 s and 1990 s, young whiting was the most important prey species in 2001, 2002 and 2004. Clupeids and <b>sandeels</b> were consumed in lower proportions. While earlier studies suggested whiting to originate from fisheries discards, evidence now supports that kittiwakes prey upon whiting in areas of hydrographic fronts. No whiting was recovered in samples of 2006 and the proportion of fish prey was low. Main prey items were polychaete worms (Nereidae), which were presumably consumed as swarming Heteronereis stages. An observed strong rise in water temperature in summer 2006 might have influenced food availability of kittiwakes by inducing swarming of Nereidae. Overall, kittiwakes breeding on Helgoland showed a positive population trend for several decades while mainly feeding on whiting...|$|E
40|$|The {{report is}} based on {{interviews}} with fishermen and written sources that deal with <b>sandeels</b> and sandeel fishing periods along the coast of estern Norway. Observations, stories and figures are put together in an attempt to reconstruct and understand the occurrence and changes in sandeel abundance. The sources show that sandeel fry migrating into the west coast was an annual phenomenon varying in strength. The fry was important for the ecosystems along the coast. Large amounts of fish and birds followed and fed on the <b>sandeels.</b> Fry-shoals recruited probably also to coastal sandeel fields (and thus also important Danish seine fishing fields). The most likely explanation for the disappearance of these fry shoals along the coast is the increased harvest on sandeel on the North Sea fields in the 1970 s onwards. This has in turn greatly reduced/removed surplus amounts of larvae/fry previously ending up along the coast of Western Norway...|$|E
50|$|In the North Atlantic, they {{primarily}} eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 {{study showed}} that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while <b>sandeel</b> (Ammodytes spp.), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off VesterÃ¥len, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on <b>sandeel</b> (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for <b>sandeel</b> in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on <b>sandeel</b> (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. <b>Sandeel</b> was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while <b>sandeel's</b> importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while <b>sandeel</b> dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{changes in}} climate are {{affecting}} the abundance, distribution and phenology of species across all trophic levels. Short-term climate variability is also having {{a profound impact}} on species and trophic interactions. Crucially, species will experience long- and short-term variation simultaneously, and both are predicted to change, yet studies tend to focus on only one of these temporal scales. Apex predators are sensitive to long-term climate-driven changes in prey populations and short-term effects of weather on prey availability, both of which could result in changes of diet. We investigated temporal trends and effects of long- and short-term environmental variability on chick diet composition in a North Sea population of European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis between 1985 and 2014. The proportion of their principal prey, lesser <b>sandeel</b> Ammodytes marinus, declined from 0. 99 (1985) to 0. 51 (2014), and estimated <b>sandeel</b> size declined from 104. 5 to 92. 0 mm. Concurrently, diet diversification increased from 1. 32 (1985) to 11. 05 (2014) prey types yr- 1, including members of the families Pholidae, Callionymidae and Gadidae. The relative proportion of adult to juvenile <b>sandeel</b> was greater following low sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the previous year. In contrast, the proportion of Pholidae and prey richness were higher following high SST in the previous year. Within a season, the proportion of <b>sandeel</b> in the diet was lower on days with higher wind speeds. Crucially, our results showed that diet diversification was linked to trends in SST. Thus, predicted changes in climate means and variability may have important implications for diet composition of European shags in the future, with potential consequences for population dynamics...|$|R
