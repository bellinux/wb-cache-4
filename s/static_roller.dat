50|$|Advantages: As {{opposed to}} all other types of hot mix, PFC is {{designed}} to let water drain through the mixture into the underlying layer. PFC mixtures significantly reduce water spray, improve wet weather visibility and visibility of pavement markings, significantly reduce tire noise, and restore ride quality. PFC mixtures have stone on stone contact and relatively high amounts of asphalt binder. As a result, they offer good resistance to rutting and cracking. PFC mixtures are relatively easy to design and place. PFC mixtures require only a minimal amount of compaction with a <b>static</b> <b>roller.</b> This helps facilitate a smooth riding surface. PFC mixtures provide for a roadway that has a uniform yet coarse surface texture. The coarse texture and permeable mix characteristics improve wet weather traction.|$|E

As a consequence rather often the maintenance process {{has to be}} carried out under less favorable circumstances, e. g. adverse weather conditions. It raises a number of questions, such as; “how do less favorable circumstances affect the quality of work?”, and, “how should the operating procedure of the maintenance process be adapted to unexpected or changing conditions?” The paper presents the results of a research project that focuses on the compaction process of asphalt pavements to determine the impact of varying conditions during this process. The main objective is the design of a simulation tool for the compaction effect of a roller under varying external conditions. During the compaction process material behavior is mainly elastic-plastic due to the reorientation of the particles. Large deformations can occur and, because of that, also large strains. Therefore, an elastic-plastic non-linear analysis is carried out to examine the relations between roller and material properties and the compaction result. Within the DiekA model, an Arbitrary Langrange Eulerian FEM approach, a material model derived from soil mechanics and called “Rock model” is implemented. This model describes material behavior in an elastic-plastic manner and has a closed yield locus. Calculations with the model show a realistic stress and strain pattern in the asphalt mix under a <b>static</b> <b>roller</b> while compacting. In the project, a field experiment has been set up to validate the model...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{great need}} to {{construct}} more durable roads such as concrete roads in Sri Lanka since the government is spending {{a considerable amount of}} money every year to maintain the national road network which has been constructed using with either conventional asphalt concrete or bituminous paving materials. This research was carried out mainly to explore the possibility of introducing more durable and cost effective Roller Compacted Concrete for road pavements in Sri Lanka. The structural behavior of Roller Compacted Concrete pavement (RCCP), which is a rigid pavement, is completely different from conventional asphalt pavements which are designed as flexible pavements. Since RCCP is not currently used in Sri Lanka there is no local standards available for design and construction of RCCP. An extensive literature review was carried out regarding the design of rigid pavements practiced in other countries. The rigid pavements can be designed using different types of design methods for given conditions. However, out of those methods, American Association of State Highway Traffic Organization method (AASHTO) and Portland Cement Association (PCA) method are popular in the countries where rigid pavements are used. Out of these two methods AASHTO method uses more parameters in designing the pavement thickness. Therefore, parametric study was carried out to investigate the effect of each parameter used in AASHTO method. And also a computer program was developed based on PCA method to carry out the thickness design procedure effectively, as it is more suitable for low volume traffic conditions. An experimental investigation was carried out to formulate a mix design procedure for RCC using local materials. Since the thickness of RCCP depends on the flexural strength of RCC, tests were carried out to investigate the factors affecting the flexural strength of RCC and also other properties such as wet density, compressive strength and drying shrinkage. New test methods were developed to measure these properties specially the flexural strength and wet density incorporating actual conditions of RCC such as actions of <b>static</b> and vibrating <b>rollers.</b> A new apparatus was developed to measure the wet density by modifying the conventional V-B apparatus where vibration as well as known static pressure can be applied to compact concrete. Furthermore, use of chemical and mineral admixtures to improve the properties of RCC was also investigated. Based on the results of experimental investigations a mix design procedure for RCC was proposed...|$|R
