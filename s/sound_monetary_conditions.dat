40|$|Extensive {{research}} on the linkages between <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and stock returns has been conducted in developed countries.

This paper therefore aims to study the long believed asymmetrical relationship between changes in <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and subsequent changes in stock returns in South Africa. Research in the United States of America (US) indicates that US stock returns are significantly related to the US monetary environment. The findings and results show that expansive (restrictive) <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> serves as good (bad) news for stock returns, i. e. cuts in interest rates are followed by periods of excess stock returns, while increases in interest rates have a restrictive effect. The results of this study (for South Africa over the period 1991 - 2001) are in line with international findings, but are, in terms of South Africa, in contradiction with the findings of a previous study. This previous study on the relationship between South African <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and stock returns suggests that South African stock returns were not related to South African <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results of this (current) study, however, disputes the conclusions of the previous study indicating that, for South Africa, expansive <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> are indeed followed by excess stock returns, while restrictive <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> are followed by low or negative stock returns. The South African stock market thus perform better (worse) in expansive (restrictive) <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> This inverse relationship also seems to be more apparent in expansive than in restrictive <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> Empirical results show that the role and potency of <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions,</b> as proxied by a short-term interest rate and a <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> index, in the behaviour of stock market performance for South Africa has increased over the study period, indicating the growing importance of the credit and exchange rate channels in affecting domestic <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and stock returns. <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conditions,</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conditions</b> Index, MCI, <b>Monetary</b> Policy, Interest rates, Money Market rates, Discount Rtae, Interbank Call Rate, Exchange Rate, Rand, Stock Market, Stock Returns, VEC, VAR, Cointegration, Impulse Response Function...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conditions</b> Index (MCI) is {{a concept}} with a twofold use in the {{analysis}} of <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and in the development of monetary policy strategies. The idea of this concept is that (real) interest rates are not a sufficient indicator for <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in rather small and open economies. Apart from interest rates, exchange rates also have a sig-nificant influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> Therefore, the MCI combines interest rates and exchange rates to a single measurement of <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> within an economy. The MCI can be employed to measure conditions in order to evaluate monetary policy in an early stage and to give a guideline to policy makers to set their instruments and operating targets accord-ing to target final objectives such as inflation targets. The paper provides a brief introduction into the concept of the MCI and focuses on the estimation of the respective parameters of this index concept for South Africa. The estimated weights of the MCI suggest that changes of real interest rates have a 1. 9 times higher influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> than changes in real exchange rates.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to review and {{interpret}} the use of a <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conditions</b> Index (or MCI) by central banks in the conduct of monetary policy. Numerous central banks, governmental organizations, and businesses now calculate an MCI as an indicator of the stance of monetary policy.

This paper describes and defines the concept of an MCI, summarizes how central banks implement MCIs in practice, reviews some of the operational and conceptual issues involved, and evaluates the sensitivity of MCIs to an inherent source of uncertainty in their calculation.

40|$|Economic and {{financial}} developments on the Mainland {{have important implications}} for Hong Kong. This paper presents an empirical framework for assessing <b>monetary</b> {{and financial}} <b>conditions</b> on the Mainland by estimating a <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> index (MCI). An MCI is usually defined as a weighted sum of some measures of real interest rate and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Because bank credit is an important channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Mainland China, this study extends the conventional MCI by including a quantity variable to capture the credit availability effect. Estimates suggest that, in terms of the effect on real GDP growth, a rise in real interest rates by 1 percentage point is equivalent to an increase in REER appreciation by about 4 percentage points or a fall in real credit growth by 2. 5 percentage points. The estimated MCI suggests a sharp easing in <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in 2002 - 2003, reflecting a weaker US dollar, relaxed credit stance of banks, and easing of deflation which reduced real interest rates. The fall in the MCI is equivalent to a decline of about 10 percentage points in real interest rates during the period. Easy <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> have contributed to an acceleration in economic growth since 2002. Fears of overheating pressures prompted the authorities to implement administrative measures in early 2004 to curb credit supply to selected sectors and raise interest rates in late October 2004.
