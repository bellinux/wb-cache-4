5000|$|Heavy Is The Head... is {{the first}} solo {{extended}} play by American rapper and producer MarvWon, released October 16, 2012, following up from his 2010 album Wayne Fontes Music. Signed under Mr. Porter's My Own Planet imprint, this nine-track record featured Detroit-based artists Royce Da 5'9" [...] (of <b>Slaughterhouse),</b> <b>Fat</b> Killahz and Kon Artis (of D12), whose production is primarily presented, along with Jay Oliver, Young Roc, Pzuvmynd, and Trox.|$|E
40|$|Abdominal and {{subcutaneous}} fat {{are regarded as}} the main sources of waste in the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> <b>Fat</b> stored intramuscularly is regarded a favorite trait related to meat quality. The objective of current study was to estimate genetic parameters for fat deposition in the 3 different parts of body and their relationships with other carcass traits. Traits were recorded for 1, 752 females and 1, 526 males from a meat-type chicken line. Heritability estimates for abdominal fat percentage, skin percentage {{as a measure of}} {{subcutaneous fat}}, and intramuscular fat percentage were 0. 71, 0. 24, and 0. 08, respectively. Heritabilities of the other carcass traits were moderate to high (0. 28 to 0. 73). There was a high genetic correlation between abdominal fat weight and skin weight (0. 54), whereas the genetic correlation between abdominal fat weight and intramuscular fat percentage was almost zero (0. 02). The BW at 7 wk showed a positive genetic correlation with fat production traits, which were high for intramuscular fat percentage (0. 87) and moderate for skin percentage (0. 17) and abdominal fat percentage (0. 13). Therefore carcass traits could be improved by selection for increased breast muscle and reduced abdominal fat without decreased intramuscular fa...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the interactions and effects of 2 and 4 % addition levels of poultry <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>fat</b> (chicken tallow) and soybean oil in diets for broiler chickens. Two experiments were carried out using one-day-old male Cobb chicks in an entirely random design with a 2 x 2 factorial scheme. In the first experiment, 560 chicks were used to evaluate performance and carcass characteristics. In the second experiment, 100 chicks {{were used to determine}} the nutrient digestibility, dietary energy utilization and the lipase and amylase pancreatic activity. There was no interaction between the fat sources and the addition levels for any of the analyzed variables, except for the digestibility coefficient of dry matter (DCDM), which was higher in diets added with 2 % soybean oil when compared to chicken tallow. The addition of 4 % fat in the diet, regardless of fat source, improved the digestibility coefficient of ethereal extract (DCEE) and increased weight gain and feed intake. Moreover, in the initial phase, the addition of 4 % fat to the diet increased lipase activity when compared to diets with 2 % addition, and a positive correlation between DCEE and pancreatic lipase activity was observed. In conclusion, there is no interaction between fat sources and addition levels, except for DCDM. Carcass characteristics are not influenced by any of the studied factors. The addition of 4 % fat increases pancreatic lipase activity and improves DCEE, resulting in greater weight gain, regardless of the tested fat source, making chicken tallow a great alternative to soybean oil...|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters were {{originally}} designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not, however, the material {{with the most}} potential for anaerobic digestion, as the biodegradable material has already had much of the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore, many digesters operate with codigestion {{of two or more}} types of feedstock. For example, in a farm-based digester that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock, the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock, e.g., grass and corn (typical on-farm feedstock), or various organic byproducts, such as <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste, <b>fats,</b> oils and grease from restaurants, organic household waste, etc. (typical off-site feedstock).|$|R
30|$|To {{cope with}} these {{negative}} effects on water stream treatment, several strategies for removing lipid residues {{at the head of}} the plant have been proposed such as thermochemical, alkaline and enzymatic pretreatments (Sawayama et al. 1995; Masse et al. 2001; Mouneimne et al. 2003; Mendes et al. 2005, 2006, 2010; Cammarota and Freire 2006; Rosa et al. 2009; Valladão et al. 2011; Alexandre et al. 2011). Among these, the alternative of using specific enzymes (lipases) has recently gained attention because of stringent environmental regulations and a clean and friendly application of enzymes (Mendes et al. 2005, 2006, 2010; Cammarota and Freire 2006; Rosa et al. 2009; Valladão et al. 2011; Alexandre et al. 2011). Lipases (triacylglycerol ester acyl hydrolases EC 3.1. 1.3) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to glycerol and long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) at the water–lipid interface (Mendes et al. 2012). These enzymes showed potential applications in hydrolyzing oil and fats in wastewater generated by dairy industries, <b>slaughterhouses,</b> edible oils, <b>fat</b> refineries and others (Mendes et al. 2006, 2010; Cammarota and Freire 2006; Rosa et al. 2009; Valladão et al. 2011; Alexandre et al. 2011). The application of lipases for wastewater pretreatment decreases the organic matter concentration, in terms of COD, color and suspended solids as lipids (Mendes et al. 2005, 2006, 2010; Cammarota and Freire 2006; Rosa et al. 2009; Valladão et al. 2011; Alexandre et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|The pork chain {{has been}} seriously {{affected}} by dioxin incidents in recent decades. Hence, monitoring dioxins {{is crucial for}} detecting contaminations in the pork chain. This study aims to develop a decision support tool (optimization model) to determine cost-effective monitoring schemes for detecting and tracing a dioxin contamination over multiple control points along the pork production chain. The optimization model considers four control points (i. e. at the supplier of fatty feed ingredients, the feed mill, the <b>slaughterhouse</b> and the <b>fat</b> melting facility). It was applied to several hypothetical contamination scenarios involving contaminated animal fatty feed ingredients. The cost-effective allocation of resources for detecting and tracing the dioxin contamination from an integrated chain approach (i. e. considering all control points) focuses on monitoring at the feed mill, followed by the supplier of fatty feed ingredients and - {{to a lesser extent}} - by the slaughterhouse. The number of contaminated feed mills, the frequency of dioxin contaminations, the required level of effectiveness, and the cost of screening are main factors driving the total monitoring costs. Sharing the responsibility of monitoring dioxins within control points along the chain largely reduces the total monitoring costs. In each of the evaluated scenarios, the total costs of monitoring dioxins at individual control points are larger than the costs resulting from an optimal allocation of resources among all control points integrated in one overarching chain monitoring scheme. These results elicit the economic benefits of a chain approach to monitoring dioxins over an approach where each chain actor independently monitors dioxins. The developed model can be used by decision makers in the feed and food industry for determining optimal schemes for monitoring dioxins in the pork chain focusing on preventing specific contamination...|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{alternative}} dietary {{protein sources}} and {{new types of}} outdoor rearing techniques that enhance animal welfare, thus optimising costs and production performance, are among the main objectives of nutritionists and breeders. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare two types of rations where pea and potato concentrate completely substituted soybean in intensively and extensively bred swine. Forty Large White × Duroc piglets weighing about 40 kg were divided into 4 groups of 10 sex- and weightmatched individuals: Indoor rearing + Control diet, Indoor rearing + Experimental diet, Outdoor rearing + Control diet, Outdoor rearing + Experimental diet. Different diets were formulated for the growing phase (40 - 100 kg) and the fattening period (100 -slaughter); pigs, weighed individually every 40 days to estimate the average daily gain and feed conversion rate, were slaughtered when they reached the weight for Italian ham production. The following measurements were obtained: carcass weight, slaughtered yield, weight of lean cuts, pH 45 minutes and 24 hours post mortem. 40 semimembranosus muscle samples were analysed for colour parameters (L*, a* and b*), moisture, fat, protein and ash while the energy values were calculated. Semimembranosus intramuscular fat and ham backfat were analysed for fatty acid profile. Statistical analysis of performances data was conducted using design with repeated measures and the <b>slaughterhouse,</b> meat and <b>fat</b> composition data were subjected to ANOVA. The results show that soybean can be completely substituted with other protein crops. Rearing and slaughterhouse performances were not affected by the diet, whereas significant differences emerged with the rearing system. Diet composition significantly affected lean meat proportion (50. 0 vs 48. 2) and fat thickness of 3 / 4 Thoracic Vertebra (25. 3 vs 28. 3 mm), while the rearing system significantly affected all carcass quality measures. Some parameters were better in outdoorthan indoor-subjects. Meat colour was also significantly influenced by the rearing effect, being less light and yellow in the former subjects (L* 49. 9 vs 37. 3; b* 3. 7 vs 2. 3). Chemical analysis demonstrated that the meat of outdoor-reared subjects was leaner (1. 96 % vs 1. 38 % fat) and had a lower water content (72. 8 % vs 71. 8 %). The complete replacement of soybean is thus compatible with a strong characterization and an enhancement of the value of swine products. In addition, the rearing system can result in distinctive quality features, such as ham colour and fat content, allowing products from outdoor rearing to be clearly recognized from those obtained from intensive rearing...|$|R
