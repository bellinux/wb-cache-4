After finishing high school in Prostějov, Wichterle began to study at the Chemical and Technological Faculty of the Czech Technical University (now the independent University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague) {{but he was also}} interested in medicine. He graduated in 1936 and stayed at the university. In 1939 submitted his second doctorate thesis on chemistry, but the Protectorate regime blocked any further activity at the university. However, Wichterle was able to join the research institute at Baťa's works in Zlín and continue his scientific work. There he led the technical preparation of plastics, namely polyamide and caprolactam. In 1941, Wichterle's team invented the procedure to throw and spool polyamide thread thus making the first Czechoslovak synthetic fiber under the name <b>silon</b> (the invention came independently of the original American nylon procedure in 1938). Wichterle was imprisoned by the Gestapo in 1942 but was released after a few months.|$|E

40|$|Objective. {{the aim of}} {{this study}} is to report the use of a female condom as a non-surgical <b>silon</b> pouch in the early {{management}} of newborns with gastroschisis with large visceroabdominal disproportion. Methods. Pre-washed, sterile female condoms without spermicide were used as an early approach to treat gastroschisis in 20 newborns with large defects and in whom staged correction was anticipated. the condom was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit using sterile technique, with no anesthesia, and it was removed only at the time of the surgical procedure for gastroschisis correction. Results. There were no complications associated with the use of a female condom as a temporary silo for gastroschisis. It protected the exposed organs and also allowed a careful evaluation of the bowel and a better pre-operative planning without the need for emergency procedures. Conclusion. the use of a female condom as a <b>silon</b> pouch is a low-cost and simple alternative in the initial management of newborns with gastroschisis in whom primary correction is considered non-feasible.

40|$|Introduction Hypertrophic {{scarring}} after burns {{remains a}} major challenge for burn care providers. Pressure garments and silicone sheets have been the mainstay of hypertrophic scar treatment. This study was to compare {{the effectiveness of the}} traditional Lycra pressure garment and the silicone incorporated pressure garment (<b>Silon)</b> and also to determine patients’ satisfaction with pressure garment among burns patients in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Methodology This is was a two-phased study. Phase I was a retrospective study, which involved patients who were treated with the Lycra pressure garments from June 2007 until Jun 2009. Meanwhile, phase II was a prospective study, involving patients who were treated with the <b>Silon</b> pressure garments from June 2008 until June 2010. Demographic details collected included age, type and depth of burn, total burn surface area (TBSA) and cause of injury. The effectiveness of the treatment was determined based on the Vancouver Scar Scale score. Patients’ scars were assessed 2 weeks after complete wound healing, and every 4 months, for up to 1 year. Results Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant improvement in terms of scar vascularity, itch and pain within each study group (p 0. 05). Meanwhile, {{there was no significant difference}} within and between the 2 study groups in terms of scar height, pigmentation and pliability. Majority of the patient complained of itch, sweating, discomfort and tightness upon wearing the pressure garments. In addition to interfering with their daily activities, they also reported no improvement of their scar appearance. Nevertheless, they still believe that compliance with the treatment is of great importance in order to gain optimal result. Conclusion We cannot conclude that the combined pressure garment and silicone therapy (<b>Silon)</b> was more effective than the traditional pressure garment (Lycra). Hypertrophic scars following burns injuries can take up to 2 years to reach maturity. Thus, it is recommended that scars should be monitored and pressure garment treatment should be carried out for at least 2 years...|$|E

40|$|Since Raffensperger and Jona {{reported}} an 80 % success rate with primary skin closure including a 16 % rate of complete fascial closure in 24 patients with gastroschisis in 1974, primary fascial closure {{has been the}} author's preferred method. It has been possible to achieve complete fascial and skin closure in 17 of the last 21 patients (81 %). Four infants in this series, {{one of whom was}} initially managed by another surgeon, were treated with brief application of a <b>silon</b> prosthesis with subsequent reduction and closure. The two keys to success of this method are thorough wash out of the meconium from the entire intestine and vigorous stretching of the abdominal wall. Assisted ventilation may be needed for 24 to 48 hours after operation and has been well tolerated. Transposition of an umbilical artery for cannulation and blood gas monitoring has been an important adjunct. The one death (5 % mortality) resulted from prolonged bowel dysfunction and liver failure three months after operation. Other complications have been few and mild. Since some recent reports have indicated that primary closure is not being widely used in the treatment of gastroschisis, this series is presented to emphasize that this method can be used in most infants and with a very low complication rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of ilvC expression in Escherichia coli was investigated. To {{carry out this}} work several different approaches were used. Firstly, sequencing of the ilvY 2143 allele which carries a mutation that makes ilvC expression constitutive was completed. The location of the mutation {{was determined to be}} at the 5 end of the gene. It is a single base substitution (G to A) at position 87 (counted from the transcription startpoint of ilvY). This results in a change of the codon for one amino acid. Glutamine in wild-type ilvY protein is replaced by lysine in the constitutive one. This substitution in the polypeptide of the upsilon protein (product of the ilvY gene) was found to be solely responsible for making the up <b>silon</b> protein independent of the ilvC gene substrates (a-acetohydroxybutyrate or acetolactate) needed for ilvC induction. Two approaches were used to determine the direction of ilvY trancription. One of these employed a gene fusion technique which involves two DNA fragments of ilvY being fused separately to a promoterless lacZ gene, then monitoring the expression of lacZ. The other approach involved the labeling of the upsilon protein withes -methionine after expression of ilvY in a T 7 RNA polymerase dependent promoter system. DNA-binding activity of upsilon protein was investigated. This was carried out in two assays, filter binding and gel retardation assays. These assays were employed to monitor purification of upsilon protein to near homogeneity. Upsilon protein has a subunit size of 35 kd and a native molecular weight of approximately 211 kd, suggesting upsilon exists as a hexamer. Finally, in vitro activities of the upsilon protein were tested using transcriptional and coupled transcription-translation assays. Upsilon protein was shown to cause elevation of ilvC transcription. Two models for the action of the upsilon protein in regulating the transcription of the ilvYC are proposed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{analyzed}} the factors influencing the postoperative results after the repair of gastroschisis defects {{during the past}} 27 years. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The clinical results after the repair of gastroschisis abdominal defects have improved appreciably during the past 25 years, with the long-term survival rate in most large children's centers currently being approximately 90 %. The improvement in survival has been largely attributed to advances in perioperative care, frequent use of parenteral nutrition, and better techniques of surgical repair. METHODS: Between 1965 and 1992, 84 infants with gastroschisis underwent surgical repair. The management of 52 infants after 1979 was {{compared with that of}} 32 during the previous 14 years. Associated anomalies were present in 29 %. The average birth weight was 2412 g. In 31 %, primary fascial closure was performed. In another 31 % with moderate visceroabdominal disproportion (VAD), a silastic chimney was used initially, and complete repair was performed at a second operation. For 25 % who had severe VAD, more than two operative reconstructions were necessary. Seven of 52 infants with moderate VAD underwent initial skin-flap closure and secondary repair within 12 days. RESULTS: Almost all complications (27 %) and deaths (4 %) occurred in infants with severe VAD and were largely unrelated to associated malformations or birth weight. The length of postoperative mechanical ventilation, need for parenteral nutrition, need for multiple operations, and length of hospitalization were all directly related to the severity of the VAD. CONCLUSIONS: Complete repair of gastroschisis at the initial operation is the optimal goal; however, the severity of VAD has permitted this approach in only one third of patients in this study. Delayed repair with a silastic chimney and one or more reconstructive procedures has provided excellent long-term survival with low morbidity and mortality rates. Although skin-flap closure is no longer used initially, this technique has been helpful for the residual defect in infants with severe VAD who have had multiple <b>silon</b> chimney repairs (Applied Biomaterial, Silverdale, WA) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{knowledge of}} staffers about harmful impacts of chemicals and their mixtures, actions leading to protection of occupational {{health and safety}} during manipulations with chemicals and their mixtures. The thesis is divided into two parts, theoretical and practical. Theoretical part is divided into several chapters and is worked out by secondary analysis of data. There is included general description of working system, relationship of work and health, risk analysis and work categorization.

Enclosed are also hygienic limits, samplings and methods of setting for chemicals and biological exposition tests, categorization of work according to chemicals. Conclusion of theoretical thesis contains measures for protection of health and preventive working-medical check-up. In the practical part of thesis was used quantitative research. For collection of information was used questionnaire. Total number of questionnaires were 170, 130 were delivered back completed correctly, it means that return ability is 76 %. This document was anonymous and contained 17 questions, it was printed given to employees of two big companies located in Tabor and surroundings, to chemical company <b>Silon,</b> and to engineering company KOVOSVIT MAS. Obtained data were processed by basic statistic methods and are presented in charts and graphs. The purpose of thesis was to map employees familiarity with about harmful effects of chemicals and actions leading to keeping health during working with dangerous chemicals and to find out the level of keeping employees informed about rules which should the company work out and respect along with Authority of protection of public health according to § 44, subsection 7 law Nr. 258 / 2000. In the research were stated two hypotheses: First Employees are informed about harmful chemicals and measures for health during working with dangerous chemicals. This hypothesis was confirmed, employees proved that they mostly remember being informed about harmful impacts for their health of chemicals and mixtures and about categorization of chemicals, and they work with. Second hypothesis: Principles of safe dealing with dangerous chemicals are accepted by employees. This was also confirmed. According to obtained information and evaluated data should be this thesis a source for management of both companies in the area of handling chemicals. The employers can take necessary measures to increase knowledge of employees. It can be also useful to public and students for getting more information about the topic...|$|E
