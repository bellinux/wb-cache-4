25|$|The Court {{was also}} {{referred}} to the House of Lords case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union (1995). Their Lordships held that the Home Secretary only had a duty to keep {{the implementation of a}} <b>statutory</b> <b>scheme</b> under active consideration until and unless Parliament decided to repeal the statute. The Singapore Court of Appeal distinguished ex parte Fire Brigades Union from the issue at hand on two grounds. First, the word shall in Article 49(1) indicated that the Prime Minister is under a duty to call an election to fill the vacancy, as opposed to the word may which appeared in the statute in ex parte Fire Brigades Union. Secondly, the Prime Minister's discretion under Article 49(1) is not solely and largely dictated by policy considerations, unlike the Home Secretary's discretion in ex parte Fire Brigades Union. Rather, in deciding when to call a by-election, the Prime Minister must bear in mind the equally important consideration of the interests {{of the people of the}} constituency in which a vacancy has arisen.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirements}} of natural justice or {{a duty to}} act fairly depend on the context. In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence {{the content of the}} duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the <b>statutory</b> <b>scheme</b> under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's legitimate expectations, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker. Earlier, in Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19 (1990), the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect. In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.|$|E

Chief Justice Li, Justice Chan PJ, Justice Ribeiro PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, having considered all the statutory restrictions on the freedom of assembly and the statutory safeguards listed above, held that the notification system was constitutional. However, they held that the norm of [...] "ordre public", which existed as a statutory legitimate purpose at that time, was too vague at a statutory level and hence could not be said to be prescribed by law. [...] "Ordre public" [...] was as a result severed, but the term [...] "public order" [...] was sufficiently precise to survive. They also remarked in dicta that the norm of [...] "protection of the rights and freedoms of others" [...] was too wide and did not satisfy the legal certainty requirement.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the scope and efficacy of the civil remedies available to investors against listed companies which have made false or misleading statements in the secondary securities market in Singapore, both at common law and the <b>statutory</b> compensation <b>scheme</b> under the Securities and Futures Act. It argues {{that there are a}} number of limitations faced by such investors in bringing claims founded in tort law against the listed companies. While the <b>statutory</b> compensation <b>scheme</b> attempts to improve the position of investors, there are a number of deficiencies in the scheme the most significant of which is the ceiling on the overall damages recoverable against the contravening listed companies. These deficiencies largely stem from the fact that the scheme is strongly influenced by the desire to achieve optimal deterrence rather than compensation. This article argues that the aim of the <b>statutory</b> compensation <b>scheme</b> should be clarified and that it should be founded on compensation for losses incurred by investors in having relied on the false or misleading statements and not on optimal deterrence. Reforms are suggested to the <b>statutory</b> compensation <b>scheme</b> to achieve this aim...|$|R

The Irish, in Mr. Gladstone’s ironical paraphrase of these singular opinions, had a double dose of original sin; they belonged wholly to the kingdoms of darkness, and therefore the rules of that probability which wise men have made the guide of life can have no bearing in any case of theirs.

40|$|This Article {{tests the}} limits of private {{contracting}} by examining {{what it means to}} contract about bankruptcy.

Both courts and scholars are in conflict, yet the answer is critical because it affects not only bankruptcy costs but also the structuring of corporate reorganizations and securitization transactions. I maintain that the threshold question [...] what freedom should parties or {{should not be allowed to}} contractually alter <b>statutory</b> <b>schemes.</b> I then apply those principles to a model of prebankruptcy contracting by taking into account the policies underlying the bankruptcy code and also by analyzing the extent to which, under contract law, externalities should render a contract unenforceable. I conclude that, within defined limits, bankruptcy law should be viewed as default provisions and not as mandatory rules. Finally I show that my model of prebankruptcy contracting can have important applications, not only to making corporate reorganizations and securitizations transactions more efficient but also to understanding when parties should be allowed to contract about <b>statutory</b> <b>schemes</b> generally and when externalities should override freedom of contract...|$|R
