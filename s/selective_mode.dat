50|$|Resonance {{ionization}} is a <b>selective</b> <b>mode</b> of ionization that {{is based}} upon atomic vibrations as an atom is excited from the ground state. This ionization method {{is used for the}} spectroscopic analysis of inorganic, elemental species. Ionization is accomplished by use of a monochromatic tunable laser, which fires a beam of photons at a gas-phase sample (the analyte). An initial photon from this beam is absorbed by one of the sample atoms, exciting one of the atom's electrons to an intermediate excited state. A second photon then ionizes the atom from the intermediate state such that its high energy level causes it to be ejected from its orbital; the result is a positively charged ion, which is then moved into a mass analyzer.|$|E

40|$|A Bragg {{waveguide}} {{consisting of}} multiple dielectric layers with alternating {{index of refraction}} becomes an excellent option to form electron accelerating structure powered by high power laser sources. It provides confinement of a synchronous speed-of-light mode with extremely low loss. However, laser field can not be coupled into the structure collinearly with the electron beam. There are three requirements in designing input coupler for a Bragg electron accelerator: side-coupling, <b>selective</b> <b>mode</b> excitation, and high coupling efficiency. We present a side coupling scheme using a distributed grating-assisted coupler to inject the laser power into the waveguide. Side coupling is achieved by a grating with a period {{on the order of}} an optical wavelength. The phase matching condition results in resonance coupling thus providing <b>selective</b> <b>mode</b> excitation capability. The coupling efficiency is limited by profile matching between the outgoing beam and the incoming beam, which has normally, a Gaussian profile. We demonstrate a non-uniform distributed grating structure generating an outgoing beam with a Gaussian profile, therefore, increasing the coupling efficiency...|$|E

Based on the different concentration and contact time profiles, three operation modes for the PBMR were identified, <b>selective</b> oxidation <b>mode</b> with low oxygen to hydrocarbon ratios, CO favoring mode and deep oxidation mode using large oxygen excess. All modes offer advantages compared to the FBR operated under similar conditions because they increase selectivity of the desired product. In <b>selective</b> oxidation <b>mode</b> in the PBMR a maximum ethylene yield of 33 % was obtained compared to 22 % in the FBR.
