40|$|A growing or <b>shrinking</b> <b>disc</b> {{will adopt}} a conical shape, its {{intrinsic}} geometry {{characterized by a}} surplus angle $se$ at the apex. If growth is slow, the cone will find its equilibrium. Whereas this is trivial if $se <= 0 $, the disc can fold into one of a discrete infinite number of states if $se$ is positive. We construct these states in the regime where bending dominates, determine their energies and how stress is distributed in them. For each state a critical value of $se$ is identified beyond which the cone touches itself. Before this occurs, all states are stable; the ground state has two-fold symmetry.

40|$|The ICTAC-recommended {{approach}} {{was used to}} characterize the gasification of high-purity, highly crystalline, large natural graphite flakes in oxygen. The average activation energy {{was found to be}} 157. 7 ± 4. 2 kJ mol− 1. The graphite properties and the simple gasification reaction taking place make this an ideal material for the study of reaction interface-controlled reactivity. Based on simple structural and geometrical observations, it was expected that the conversion function would be that of a <b>shrinking</b> <b>disc.</b> However, the experimental conversion function exhibited a behaviour which could not be linked to any of the commonly established reaction models. A factor contributing to this disconnection is the use of an arbitrary scaling procedure in classic solid state kinetics. A more integrated approach has recently been proposed in the literature with the potential for reconciling disparate models into a single comprehensive scheme. A generalization of the classic solid state kinetic expressions for interface-controlled reactivity is proposed which fits into the integrated approach. It is based on fundamental considerations for the subset of reactions in which reactivity is controlled by the reaction interface alone. The fundamental nature of the approach yields an expression for which all the variables are directly measurable, without any assumptions regarding the conversion function. The generalized conversion function will always start at a value of one, making interpretation and direct comparison of any active surface area (ASA) progression possible. Visual observations indicate the growth of defect structures within the macro graphite flakes, leading to an increase in ASA. This leads to a behaviour resembling nucleation and growth, despite the interface-controlled reaction taking place on a disc-shaped solid. The random nature of the oxidized flake microstructure makes it difficult to develop representative analytical models for this behaviour.

5000|$|One {{effect of}} ageing and disc {{degeneration}} {{is that the}} nucleus pulposus begins to dehydrate and the concentration of proteoglycans in the matrix decreases, thus limiting {{the ability of the}} disc to absorb shock. This general <b>shrinking</b> of <b>disc</b> size is partially responsible for the common decrease in height as humans age. The anulus fibrosus also becomes weaker with age and has an increased risk of tearing. In addition, the cartilage endplates begin thinning, fissures begin to form, and there is sclerosis of the subchondral bone. As the fissures are formed in the anulus fibrosis due to osteo-arthritic bones or degeneration in general, the inner nucleus pulposus can seep out and put pressure on any number of vertebral nerves. A herniated disc can cause mild to severe pain such as sciatica and treatment for herniated discs range from physical therapy to surgery. [...] Other degeneration of the vertebral column includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis(DISH) which is the calcification or ossification of the ligaments surrounding the vertebrae. This degeneration causes stiffness and sometimes even curvature in the lumbar and thoraco-lumbar spinal region.|$|R
40|$|The stellar disk of the Milky Way shows complex {{spatial and}} {{abundance}} structure that {{is central to}} understanding the key physical mechanisms responsible for shaping our Galaxy. In this study, we use six very high resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes to study the prevalence and formation of chemically distinct disc components. We find that our simulations develop a clearly bimodal distribution in the [α/Fe] [...] [Fe/H] plane. We find two main pathways to creating this dichotomy which operate in {{different regions of the}} galaxies: a) an early (z> 1) and intense high-[α/Fe] star formation phase in the inner region (R≲ 5 kpc) induced by gas-rich mergers, followed by more quiescent low-[α/Fe] star formation; and b) an early phase of high-[α/Fe] star formation in the outer disc followed by a shrinking of the gas disc owing to a temporarily lowered gas accretion rate, after which disc growth resumes. In process b), a double-peaked star formation history around the time and radius of <b>disc</b> <b>shrinking</b> accentuates the dichotomy. If the early star formation phase is prolonged (rather than short and intense), chemical evolution proceeds as per process a) in the inner region, but the dichotomy is less clear. In the outer region, the dichotomy is only evident if the first intense phase of star formation covers a large enough radial range before <b>disc</b> <b>shrinking</b> occurs; otherwise, the outer disc consists of only low-[α/Fe] sequence stars. We discuss the implication that both processes occurred in the Milky Way. Comment: 12 pages, MNRAS accepte...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent, two-dimensional, {{hydrodynamic}} flows {{are characterized}} {{by the emergence of}} coherent, long-lived vortices without a need to invoke special initial conditions. Vortices have the ability to sequester particles, with typical radii ∼ 1 mm to ∼ 10 cm, that are slightly decoupled from the gas. A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature profiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is that four vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. In particular, two of the zones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small particles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time-scale near and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles grow via coagulation, the size of the annulus <b>shrinks.</b> Older <b>discs</b> prefer to capture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time, a phenomenon we term ‘vortex ageing'. More viscous, more dust-opaque and/or less massive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of particle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc. Thus, how efficiently a disc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time-scales between coagulation and vortex ageing. If vortices form in protoplanetary discs, they are important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to condense out of the protostellar nebula. Particle capture also occurs at distances relevant to planet formation. Future infrared, submillimetre and centimetre observations of grain opacity as a function of radial distance will test the hypothesis that vortices serve as nurseries for particle growth in protoplanetary disc...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{accretion}} {{on to the}} neutron star in Be/X-ray binaries, using a 3 D SPH code and the data imported from a simulation by oka 2 for a coplanar system with a short period (P_ orb= 24. 3 d) and a moderate eccentricity (e= 0. 34), which targeted the Be/X-ray binary 4 U 0115 + 63. For simplicity, we adopt the polytropic equation of state. We find that a time-dependent accretion disc is formed around the neutron star regardless of the simulation parameters. In the long term, the disc evolves via a two-stage process, which consists of the initial developing stage and the later developed stage. The developed disc is nearly Keplerian. In the short term, the disc structure modulates with the orbital phase. The <b>disc</b> <b>shrinks</b> at the periastron passage of the Be star and restores its radius afterwards. The accretion rate on to the neutron star is also phase dependent, but its peak is broader and much {{lower than that of}} the mass-transfer rate from the Be disc, unless the polytropic exponent is as large as 5 / 3. Our simulations show that the truncated Be disk model for Be/X-ray binaries is consistent with the observed X-ray behaviour of 4 U 0115 + 63. Comment: 13 pages, 62 figures, accepted to MNRAS.

40|$|GK Per, a {{classical}} nova of 1901, {{is thought to}} undergo variable mass accretion on to a magnetized white dwarf (WD) in an intermediate polar system (IP). We organized a multi-mission observational campaign in the X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) energy ranges during its dwarf nova (DN) outburst in 2015 March-April. Comparing data from quiescence and near outburst, {{we have found that}} the maximum plasma temperature decreased from about 26 to 16. 2 +/- 0. 4 keV. This is consistent with the previously proposed scenario of increase in mass accretion rate while the inner radius of the magnetically disrupted accretion <b>disc</b> <b>shrinks,</b> thereby lowering the shock temperature. A NuSTAR observation also revealed a high-amplitude WD spin modulation of the very hard X-rays with a single-peaked profile, suggesting an obscuration of the lower accretion pole and an extended shock region on the WD surface. The X-ray spectrum of GK Per measured with the Swift X-Ray Telescope varied on time-scales of days and also showed a gradual increase of the soft X-ray flux below 2 keV, accompanied by a decrease of the hard flux above 2 keV. In the Chandra observation with the High Energy Transmission Gratings, we detected prominent emission lines, especially of Ne, Mg and Si, where the ratios of H-like to He-like transition for each element indicate a much lower temperature than the underlying continuum. We suggest that the X-ray emission in the 0. 8 - 2 keV range originates from the magnetospheric boundary. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures; accepted to MNRA...|$|R
