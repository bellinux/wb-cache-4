5000|$|Cancer {{cell lines}} with {{downregulation}} of Sulf1 were investigated {{in the same}} fashion as ovarian cancer. Nine of 11 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines displayed either absent or severely reduced levels of Sulf1 mRNA. Less than half of HCC tumor samples showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and DNA methylation inhibition treatment of Sulf1 absent HCC cell lines reactivated the expression of Sulf1, indicating hypermethylation may be partly responsible for its downregulation. [...] As in ovarian cancer, loss of Sulf1 largely contributed to decreased HPSG sulfation in HCC. In addition, Sulf1 expression is required to suppress sustained activation of ERK1/2 and c-met by the heparin binding growth factors (HB-GF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), thereby decreasing cell proliferation. [...] In extension, Sulf1 mediated HCC cell apoptotic sensitivity to cisplatin and staurosporine. [...] As a review, HGF, or <b>scatter</b> <b>factor,</b> activates its receptor c-Met which activates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and PI3K signaling that are ultimately responsible for expression of proangiogenic factors, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Applying the variable-axis small-cone method, a good-quality reconstructed image is only possible within angular regions where the <b>scattering</b> <b>factor</b> is near isotropic. Thus the usable window for low-energy electron wave-front reconstruction is element dependent; the window size decreases as the atomic number increases.

Measurements were performed on Novalis Tx™ linear accelerator for 6 MV SRS beam with stereotactic cones of diameter 6 mm, 7. 5 mm, 10 mm, 12. 5 mm, and 15 mm. The advantage of plastic scintillator detector is in its energy dependence. The total <b>scatter</b> <b>factor</b> was measured in water at the depth of dose maximum. Total <b>scatter</b> <b>factor</b> with plastic scintillation detector was determined by normalizing the readings to field size of 10 cm × 10 cm. To overcome energy dependence of diode detector for the determination of <b>scatter</b> <b>factor</b> with diode detector, daisy chaining method was used.

Five linear-coordinate 3 d metal complexes, for which the wrong element is found if standard independent-atom model <b>scattering</b> <b>factors</b> are relied upon, are studied, and it is shown that only aspherical-atom <b>scattering</b> <b>factors</b> allow a reliable assignment. The influence of anomalous dispersion in identifying the correct element is investigated and discussed...|$|R
