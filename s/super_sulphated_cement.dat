30|$|A {{good number}} of literatures are {{available}} on activated slag cement. These works mainly focus on mechanical strength properties of ASC. However, the available work on the physical properties of slag activated with alkalis and alkaline earth compounds are rather limited. The setting characteristics of slag-lime mixes were studied by Feret (1939) and Jolibois and Nicol (1952) by using granulated slag and high calcium lime. The slow setting of the mixes was improved by adding sodium sulfate {{to the extent of}} 1  %, but it suffered from producing efflorescence. An addition of gypsum is recommended in their work instead of sodium sulfate. Mehrotra et al. (1982) opined that plaster of Paris is a better activator than the conventional hard burnt gypsum (anhydrite) but, this cement has shorter setting time. Naceri et al. (2009) activated the slag cement by hydrated lime with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10  % (by addition and substitution method) and observed a decline of setting time with increase of lime content. Bijen and Niel (1981) and Dutta and Borthakur (1990) reported the physical properties of <b>super</b> <b>sulphated</b> slag <b>cement</b> prepared by using slag, anhydrite/gypsum and clinker. The optimum amount of anhydrite to activate the slag was reported to vary between 15 and 20  %. Wang et al. (1995) reported that the slag activated with sodium hydroxide poses quick setting and high shrinkage with micro crack formation. Brough et al. (2000) used phosphate and malic acid as retarders in slag and sodium silicate base mixes to increase the setting time of the alkali activated slag cement. Glukhovsky et al. (1983) and Talling and Brandstetr (1989); (Puertas and Fernandez-Jimenez 2003) and Shi and Li (1989) have studied extensively the alkaline activation of slag and the hydration products. The main hydration product is reported to be hydrated calcium–alumina–silicate, like C–A–S–H gel. This phase is different from that formed in the Portland cement in the early period of hydration and has a lower C/S ratio. Gong and Yang (2000) studied the effect of phosphate on the hydration of alkali activated red mud slag through micro calorimeter, X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The setting time was found to be retarded due to the production of a new phase of (CaNa) O·(SiAl) O 2 ·y (CaNa) SO 4 ·xH 2 O. Kim and Hong (2001) observed that the ion concentration change of liquid phase during hydration was different depending on the activator and the hydration time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Uplift of {{sedimentary}} ocks {{is accompanied}} by a wide range of physical and chemical changes that contribute to diagenesis and modify fluid flow regimes. Topography becomes a major driving force behind fluid flow patterns, and meteoric water may penetrate to several kilometres below the surface. Typical diagenefic processes include alteration and leaching of feldspars and other unstable minerals, precipitation of iron oxides and kaolin, and leaching of carbonate and <b>sulphate</b> <b>cements.</b> Reservoired oil may be degraded by near-surface waters, but reservoir rocks may become more oil-wet. Brittle fracturing is enhanced near the surface, and fluid flow may become predominantly fracture-bound as fractures dilate. Uplift also causes tilting of fluid contacts and remigration of hydrocarbons. Exsolution and expansion of gas similarly causes remigration of oil to peripheral traps. Although basin uplift is generally regarded as being detrimental to hydrocarbon prospectivity, especially as a result of breaching of traps, there is also an enhanced potential for hydrocarbon plays based on reserves of exsolved gas, condensate dropout, peripheral traps and fractured reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Since {{a number}} of decades there are many {{problems}} {{in the northern part}} of Germany with high <b>sulphate</b> resistant <b>cement</b> in historical gypsum masonry. Instead of protecting the ancient mansory these injections led to a continuing deterioration of the masonry structure. Own experiments with mortar bars (4 x 4 x 16) consisting of high <b>sulphate</b> resistant <b>cements</b> and gypsum mortar have been exposed to different humidities. Another mean parameter was the sulfate concentration. The changes of length and weight were measured. Chemical and mineralogical analysis give information about the existance of etringite and thaumasite. The second part of the analysis dealt with anchorages of steel bars in masonry. To prevent sulphate reactions in gypsum mortar only the special TUBAG-injection mortar and chrom-nickel-steel bars have been used. Pull-out tests with concrete- and threaded steel bars embelled in concrete have been performed. The threaded steel bars were anchored at their ends with female screws.

The objective {{of this study is to}} characterize regional, tectonically-induced (squeegee-type) fluid flow in these Devonian aquifers, the fluxes and thermal anomalies, their timing and duration, as well as their possible influence on hydrocarbon migration and trapping. New data from the Southesk-Cairn complex and the surrounding shales show intriguing patterns. Firstly, the data define the regional (background) value of the MAximum Sr Isotope Ratio of BAsinal Shale (MASIRBAS) at 0. 7120.

METHODS: Seven calcium phosphate cements (BoneSource®, Calcibon®, ChronOS®, Eurobone®, HydroSet™, Norian SRS®, and Ostim®), one calcium <b>sulphate</b> <b>cement</b> (MIIG® X 3), and one bioactive glass cement (Cortoss®) were tested. Structural characteristics were measured by micro-CT scanning. Compression strength and stiffness were determined following unconfined compression tests. RESULTS: Each bone substitute had unique characteristics. Mean total porosity ranged from 53 % (Ostim®) to 0. 5 % (Norian SRS®). Mean pore size exceeded 100 μm only in Eurobone® and Cortoss® (162. 2 ± 107. 1 μm and 148. 4 ± 70. 6 μm, respectively). However, 230 μm pores were found in Calcibon®, Norian SRS®, HydroSet™, and MIIG® X 3. Connectivity density ranged from 27 /cm 3 for HydroSet™ to 0. 03 /cm 3 for Calcibon®.

40|$|A lot {{of damage}} is {{reported}} for constructions in marine environments, due to aggressiveness of sea water containing chlorides and sulphates. Chlorides affect durability by initiating corrosion of the reinforcement steel, and sulphates by deteriorating the concrete through formation of expansive reaction products. This research compares single-ion attack and combined attack. Combined attack simulates concrete deterioration environments more realistically. However, several factors influence cocnrete resistance against chlorides and <b>sulphates</b> : <b>cement</b> type and C 3 A-content, additions, age, temperature, etc. To examine these influences concrete mixtures containing ordinary Portland <b>cement,</b> high <b>sulphate</b> resistant <b>cement,</b> or blast furnace slag as 50 % and 70 % cement replacement were compared. Resistance against chlorides and chlorides combined with sulphates was tested by natural diffusion tests based on NT Build 443. Specimens were tested at varying ages since chloride penetration decreases with concrete age. The first test series was performed at three different temperatures namely 5 °C, 12. 5 °C and 20 °C to quantify to which extent lower exposure temperatures slow down diffusion rates. It is clear that diffusion coefficients and colour change boundaries decrease when temperatures lower. Next, the influence of sulphates on the chloride penetration was examined. The results show that, when 55 g/l NA 2 SO 4 was added to a 165 g/l NaCl solution, the colour change boundaries and diffision coefficients for ordinary Portland cement concrete and 50 % slag concrete, but not for HSR concrete. However, for all concretes chloride binding decreases when sulphate content increases. Generally the C 3 A-content of the cement {{plays a major role}} in the attack mechanism and in the binding of chlorides and sulphates.

The mortars were immersed at 50 degrees C for 180 days in: (a) a saturated Ca(OH) (2) solution and (b) a 5 % Na 2 SO 4 solution. During the experiment's duration, the mortar samples were being observed visually {{on a regular basis}} while their expansion was estimated on a weekly basis by measuring the change of length with a micrometer. At the end of the experiment, the mortar samples' compressive strength was determined and the deterioration products were identified through means of X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDAX), Thermogravimetry (TG) and Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FT-IR). Concluding it is evident that the amount of ettringite is proportional to the C(3) A content of <b>cement.</b> <b>Sulphates</b> amount in <b>cement</b> is the controlling factor for heat induced ettringite formation since when they are consumed the reaction stops. On the other hand in the case of external sulphate attack another important controlling factor is the compressive strength of the cement; the higher compressive strength the lower the risk of expansion. Finally, in the case of external sulphate attack, limestone, when added to cement, was proved to enhance the durability against sulphates attack when compared to a cement of the same class.

Geopolymers can improve the ecological image of building materials, especially when their production is based on industrial by-products such as fly ash. Three series of fly ash based geopolymer mortars were prepared using calcareous sand to fly ash ratio (S/FA) varying from 0. 5 to 2. In addition, cement mortar specimens were prepared using cement CEM I 42. 5 N and CEM II 32. 5 N. Durability of geopolymer and cement mortars was evaluated by means of compressive strength development, acid resistance, chloride diffusion and sulfate resistance. It was found that fly ash can be effectively used to produce geopolymer mortars with calcareous sand. Geopolymers exhibit competitive compressive strength compared to that of cement mortars.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the treatment outcome of large periapical cystic lesions treated by combining two novel, conservative approaches, “SealBio” and “Surgical Fenestration”. Materials and Methods: Five cases (4 M: 1 F, age range 14 - 38 years, mean age 24. 5 years) of large periapical cystic lesions, diagnosed on clinical and radiographic examination, {{were included in}} the study. After informed consent, endodontic treatment was initiated; chemo-mechanical preparation and intra-canal dressing of calcium hydroxide was given. At the next sitting after one week, further disinfection root canals was done by “apical clearing”, “apical foramen widening” and irrigation. A cotton pellet was kept in the access cavity. After local anaesthesia, full thickness muco-periosteal flap was reflected and the thinned out bone was removed with bone rongers, a small piece of cystic lining was excised and the cystic cavity was copiously flushed with Betadine solution. The remaining cystic lining was gently curetted and the flap was sutured back. “SealBio” was performed after gentle irrigation with saline and intentional over instrumentation.

The MAS NMR findings showed that this higher early age strength was related to increased CSH gel polymerization rates, and a concomitantly larger average number of units in the SiO 4 chains. The formation of CSH gels with very long chains at early ages hindered the uptake of further hydration products, however. This in turn generated more porous and less cohesive structures, causing a decline in mechanical strength, as confirmed by the backscattered electron imaging and porosity results. Dr. I. Elhadiri participated in this study under a Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECI) Grant.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this experimental work was to monitor the influence of applied external exciter on anhydrite obtained properties. As a basic raw material anhydrite imported from Poland was used, as hydration exciter a mixture of anhydrous sodium <b>sulphate</b> and Portland <b>cement</b> CEM I 42. 5 R in total dose of 5 % by anhydrite weight was applied. In the first step the anhydrite underwent the setting of mineralogical composition using the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and monitoring of grain size and shape by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the next step the influence of applied mixing exciter on obtained basic technological properties according to standard CSN EN 13454 was monitored. It was the setting of basic technological properties of anhydrite binder with and without addition of the mixing external exciter and also the setting of strengths of standard anhydrite mortar with addition of external mixing exciter. Upon the obtained values the comparison with technical requirements of the standard for calcium sulphate binders was carried out and this anhydrite mortar was classified as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{quaternary}} ammonium compounds benzalkonium chloride and cetyl pyridinium chloride {{have been studied}} as potential anti-microbial additives for incorporation into acrylic bone cement. Using the commercial bone cement Palacos K- 40, each compound was added at 1 % and 5 % by mass. Setting time of the cement was 9. 75 min. This did not change when benzalkonium chloride (5 %) was present, but was shortened to 9. 00 min by 5 % cetyl pyridinium chloride. Release of additive was estimated by determining chloride release from set cement specimens using a chloride-ion selective electrode. This showed that release occurred but was a complicated process and did not follow simple diffusion-based kinetics. Release thus appeared to occur by a similar overall mechanism to that of gentamicin <b>sulphate</b> from bone <b>cements.</b> The results show that these anti-microbial compounds {{can be incorporated into}} acrylic bone cement and then released in a satisfactory manner and suggest that these compounds have the potential to replace gentamicin sulphate as active ingredients in orthopaedic cements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The study {{investigated}} the compressive strength performance of periwinkle shell ash (PSA) blended cement concrete exposed to sulphate environments. Periwinkle shells were obtained from Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria; and calcined in a furnace to temperature of 800 0 C at zero soaking time. Concrete mix of design characteristic strength of 25 N/mm 2 was adopted as the control. The cement component replaced with PSA at five levels of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % were cast, and on hardened exposed to varying concentration of sulphates of magnesium, sodium and calcium at four levels of 0 %, 1 %, 3 % and 5 % each for three exposure periods of 62, 92 and 152 days after complete immersion in water for 28 days. Using three replicates in all the tests, a total of 630 cubical (150 mm) specimens were cast and tested. The results revealed that compressive strength increased with increase in curing age but decreased as the PSA contents increased. The design compressive strength was attained with 10 % PSA content {{at the age of}} 28 days. The compressive strength reduction in sulphate solutions was noted to increase significantly (p = 0. 005, R 2 = 0. 995) with increase exposure period and concentration, with the most severe caused by magnesium sulphate and the least by calcium sulphate. The least reduction in compressive strength was experienced with 10 % PSA blended cement concrete. Based on the test results the study concluded that 10 % PSA content is adequate as supplementary cementitious material for structural concrete to be placed in an aggressive sulphate environment.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} effects of {{alternative}} fuels and raw materials on the cement clinker quality. The clinker quality was expressed by the content of two principal minerals alite C 3 S and belite C 2 S. The additions of alternative fuels ashes and raw materials, in principle, always increased the belite content and conversely reduced the amount of alite. The alternative fuels with high ash content were used such as the meat-bone meal, sewage sludge from sewage treatment plants and paper sludge and the used alternative raw materials were metallurgical slags - granulated blastfurnace slag, air cooled blastfurnace slag and demetallized steel slag, fluidized bed combustion fly ash and waste glass. Meat-bone meal, sewage sludge from sewage treatment plants and paper sludge were evaluated as moderately suitable alternative fuels which can be added in the amounts of 2. 8 wt. % addition of meat-bone meals ash, 3. 64 wt. % addition of sewage sludge ash and 3. 8 wt. % addition of paper sludge ash to the cement raw mixture. Demetallised steel slag is suitable for production of special <b>sulphate</b> resistant <b>cement</b> clinker for CEM I –SR cement with addition up to 5 wt. %. Granulated blastfurnace slag is a suitable alternative raw material with addition 4 wt. %. Air cooled blastfurnace slag is a suitable alternative raw material with addition 4. 2 wt. %. Waste glass is not very appropriate alternative raw material with addition only 1. 16 wt. %. Fluidized bed combustion fly ash appears not to be equally appropriate alternative raw material for cement clinker burning with less potential utilization in the cement industry and with addition 3. 41 wt. %, which forms undesired anhydrite CaSO 4 in the cement clinker...|$|R
40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{a process}} for assessing the material properties of a fire damaged building so as {{to determine whether the}} remains can be utilized in construction or be demolished. Physical and chemical analysis were carried out on concrete and steel samples taken from various elements of the building after thorough visual inspection of the entire building had been conducted. The physical (non-destructive) tests included the Schmidt hammer and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests on the concrete samples, tensile strength test on the steel samples and chemical tests involving the assessment of the quantities of <b>cement,</b> <b>sulphates</b> and chloride concentrations in the samples. A redesign of the building elements was also carried out and the results were compared with the existing design. The non-destructive test results indicated compressive strengths as low as 9. 9 N/mm 2, the tensile strength test indicated a maximum strength of 397. 48 N/mm 2 and the chemical test indicated chloride contents as high as 0. 534 g per gramme of concrete. These properties deviated significantly from standard requirements. Based on these results, it was concluded that the remains of the building should be demolished...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} <b>sulphate</b> {{resistance}} of <b>cement</b> mortars when subjected to different exposure conditions. Cement mortars were prepared using ground waste brick (GWB) as a pozzolanic partial replacement for cement at replacement levels of 0 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5, 10 %, 12. 5 and 15 %. Mortar specimens were stored under three different conditions: continuous curing in lime-saturated tab water (TW), continuous exposure to 5 % sodium sulphate solution (SS), and continuous exposure to 5 % ammonium nitrate solution (AN), at {{a temperature of}} 20 ± 3 ºC, for 7, 28, 90, and 180 days. Prisms with dimensions of 25 × 25 × 285 mm, to determine the expansions of the mortar samples; and another set of prisms with dimensions of 40 × 40 × 160 mm, were prepared to calculate the compressive strength of the samples. It was determined that the GWB replacement ratios between 2. 5 % and 10 % decreased the 180 days expansion values. The highest compressive strength values were found for the samples with 10 % replacement ratio in the TW, SS, and AN conditions for 180 days. The microstructure of the mortars were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) ...|$|R
