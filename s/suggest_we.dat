5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
25|$|Mammals are a clade, and {{therefore}} the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just {{a section of the}} clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists <b>suggest,</b> <b>we</b> could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.|$|E

25|$|Such changes, they argue, {{include not}} just {{well-known}} physical and biological adaptations such as skin colour, disease resistance, and lactose tolerance, but also personality and cognitive adaptations that {{are starting to}} emerge from genetic research. These may include tendencies towards (for example) reduced physical strength, enhanced long-term planning, or increased docility, all of {{which may have been}} counter-productive in hunter-gatherer societies, but become favoured adaptations in a world of agriculture and its resulting trade, governments and urbanization. These adaptations are even more important in the modern world, and have helped shape today's nation states. The authors speculate that the scientific and Industrial Revolutions came about in part due to genetic changes in Europe over the past millennium, the absence of which had limited the progress of science in Ancient Greece. The authors <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> would expect to see fewer adaptive changes among the Amerindians and sub-Saharan Africans, who have farmed for the shortest times and were genetically isolated from older civilizations by geographical barriers. In groups that had remained foragers, such as the Australian Aborigines, there would presumably be no such adaptations at all. This may explain why Indigenous Australians and many Native Americans have characteristic health problems when exposed to modern Western diets. Similarly, Amerindians, Aboriginals, and Polynesians, for example, had experienced very little infectious disease. They had not evolved immunities as did many Old World dwellers, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world.|$|E
500|$|In The Scotsman, Graham Leicester {{writes that}} the [...] "overblown rhetoric invites a sceptical reaction. But I <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> just accept this {{extraordinary}} compliment graciously." [...] It was likely influenced by Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization {{and the result of}} a marketing strategy. Several reviewers found that Herman was successful in proving that Scots did have a disproportionate impact on modernity. Herman continued this type of theme with his next book, To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World, published in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Health {{effects from}} the smog were downplayed in most early reports. Some {{hospitals}} reported increased admissions of patients with asthma. An official at the city Department of Health noted that some hospitals were receiving fewer asthma patients, and attributed the reported increases to ordinary random fluctuations. The official told The New York Times that [...] "n not one [...] is a pattern emerging which would <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> are dealing with an important health hazard as of this moment." [...] By this time, the inability to incinerate garbage had generated {{a large amount of}} excess waste.

500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The first thing I did when I got to Island was <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E

2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E

2500|$|After two test losses, the Indian team {{announced}} on 7 January 2008 {{that they were}} discontinuing the tour pending {{the outcome of the}} appeal against Harbhajan's three match ban. Rather than travelling on to Canberra, after spending several hours waiting on their tour bus, the Indian team disembarked and remained in Sydney. [...] The Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a statement in which they [...] "decided to challenge the unfair decision to suspend Harbhajan Singh", stating that the ban was [...] "patently unfair". Tendulkar was reported to have messaged Pawar, saying [...] "I <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> should play in Perth only if the ban is lifted". Tendulkar denied advocating a boycott. However, they went back on the suspension and proceeded to Canberra for their next outing.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the siege}} of Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to lead a {{detachment}} {{to take control of}} Yiling (夷陵; present-day Yichang, Hubei), but Gan Ning came under attack by a separate enemy force led by Cao Ren's subordinates. When Gan Ning sent a messenger to Zhou Yu's camp to request for relief forces, most of Sun Quan's officers saw {{that they did not have}} enough men to spare, so they refused to help Gan Ning. Lü Meng, however, insisted on saving Gan Ning. He told Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, [...] "I <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> leave Ling Tong behind while I follow you to help Gan Ning. It's imperative that we lift the siege (on Gan Ning) because he may not be able to hold out for long. I assure you that Ling Tong can defend our current position for at least ten days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Tyler, though, puts {{forward a}} number of {{coherent}} objections to this line of enquiry. Firstly, as he points out, these metaphors, while present in certain Islamic sources {{in other parts of}} the Muslim world, are not always prominent in the Andalucian and North African Islamic sources. Secondly, in any case, John is using them in different ways from the Islamic sources. Thirdly, and crucially, there seems to have been little cultural interplay between Islamic culture and Christian culture in Spain by the late sixteenth century, with sources existing in different languages, not being translated, and of course all Muslims already having been forced to leave Spain. Rather, Tyler concludes, there [...] "are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> should look for Christian sources rather than Muslim sources". As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, it might make more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence.|$|E
