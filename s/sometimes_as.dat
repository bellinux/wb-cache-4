5|$|After {{the opera}} became {{successful}} in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>as</b> many as three, played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, {{returning to the}} touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again {{for most of the}} time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.|$|E
5|$|Any German {{invasion}} of Britain {{would have to}} involve the landing of troops and equipment somewhere on the coast, and the most vulnerable areas were {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Here, Emergency Coastal Batteries were constructed to protect ports and likely landing places. They were fitted with whatever guns were available, which mainly came from naval vessels scrapped {{since the end of the}} First World War. These included 6inch (152mm), 5.5inch (140mm), 4.7inch (120mm) and 4inch (102mm) guns. These had little ammunition, <b>sometimes</b> <b>as</b> few as ten rounds apiece.

Bahuchara {{is believed to have}} originated as a mortal woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off her breasts and dies. In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the woods to engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.|$|E

The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason.

When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.|$|E
5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>as</b> in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E

5|$|In Anglophone countries, Heathen {{groups are}} {{typically}} called kindreds or hearths, or alternately <b>sometimes</b> <b>as</b> fellowships, tribes, or garths. These are small groups, often family units, and usually consist of {{between five and}} fifteen members. They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty, with strict screening procedures regulating the admittance of new members. Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group, while other groups remain closed to all new members. Heathen groups are largely independent and autonomous, although they typically network with other Heathen groups, particularly in their region. There are other followers of the religion who are not affiliated with such groups, operating as solitary practitioners, with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through social media.|$|E
