5000|$|The IBM 3279 was IBM's first colour Terminal. It was {{introduced}} in 1979. The 3279 was widely used as an IBM mainframe terminal before PCs became commonly used for the purpose. It {{was part of the}} 3270 series, using the 3270 datastream. [...] Terminals could be connected to a 3274 controller, either channel connected to an IBM mainframe or linked via an SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control) link. In the <b>Systems</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Architecture</b> (SNA) <b>protocol</b> these terminals were logical unit type 2 (LU2). The basic model 2 used red, green for input fields, and blue and white for output fields. However, there were other models with seven colours and different screen sizes, and one kind had a loadable character set {{that could be used to}} show graphics.|$|R
