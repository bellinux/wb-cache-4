40|$|HIS REVIEW of the {{biophysics}} {{and physiology}} of the cochlea is arbitrarily limited in scope, both {{in regard to}} the period covered and in regard to subject matter. Other review articles cover quite adequately the earlier years and many contiguous areas. The selection of topics, and particularly the relative em-phasis devoted to them, reflect the personal interests and value judgments of the reviewer. The reviewer offers his apologies to those authors whose works should logically be mentioned here but which have not come to his attention. He has not attempted to search the literature and cite every relevant paper. This function is performed periodically by Annual Reviews of Physiology and Annual Reviews of Psychology. Also a <b>special</b> <b>Bibliography</b> on Hearing (223) includes the physiology of the cochlea within its larger scope. We shall not enter the area of transmission of sound to the cochlea, either by air or by bone conduction. Wever and Lawrence, in Physiological Acozcstics (249), re-viewed this subject very competently in historical perspective and in a summary of experimental studies which includes their own important contributions. Part of the chapter by Bekesy and Rosenblith on “The Mechanical Properties of the Ear ” in the Handbook of Experimental Psychology (222) deals with the middle ear and serves as the best companion review to Physiological Acozlstics on this subject. The remainder of Chapter 27 and also most of Chapter 28 on “The Psychophysiology of Hearing and Deafness ” are the direct foundations for much of the present review. Fletcher’s Speech and Hear&g in Commwication (89) deals chiefly with human reactions and responses or with acoustic analyses but has chapters important for cochlear dynamics and the theory of hearing. We shall exclude the entire subject of psychoacoustics, i. e., what a person hears, what he can discriminate, how his hearing can be measured, and so forth, including the interactions of the two ears in providing cues for the localization of the source of sound.

40|$|For {{some time}} CTA has been engaged on a {{programme}} to publish cartographical {{information about the}} pastoral and stock-rearing resources of {{the countries of the}} Sahel. SPORE has already reported the publication of atlases for Chad (SPORE 3), Niger (8), Burkina Faso (11) and Mali (17). The latest is an atlas for Senegal. This study covers the whole range of stock rearing activities, ranging from the trypanotolerant N'dama cattle to the nomad herds in the traditional Sahelian zone of northern Senegal. Stock-rearing in Senegal is of prime importance to the country's economy, accounting for approximately 7 % of the GNP (100 billion CFA francs). However, its productivity is still not sufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the constantly growing population. The Senegal Sahel is divided into four main geographical areas (the Senegal River valley, the Ferlo basin, the Dunes zone and the Naay region) and is occupied mainly by the pastoralist Peul people. The condition of the land has changed considerably in the course of the last four decades, mainly due to attempts to intensify livestock production. One example of this is the drilling of numerous bore-holes. This has resulted in a considerable change in attitudes and there has been less incentive to improve production. Thus, stock-rearing in Senegal is in a period of change, but it is to be hoped that it can develop on a firmer footinq if suitable policies are implemented. The atlas includes a bibliography of some 300 titles, which covers all breeds of domestic animals throughout Senegal, and the geographical areas studied are shown on the maps which accompany this <b>special</b> <b>bibliography.</b> The atlas also covers the geographical spread of the vectors of disease: these include glossina, ticks and helminths. It also shows the progress made in the battle against them, while at the same time urging constant vigilance and continued effort in their control. Infectious diseases, both viral and bacterial, are covered in the same manner in this volume. Aspects of veterinary infrastructure, the training of professional staff, and analysis of woodland ecosystems used for both pasturage and cultivation are also inclded. The Senegalese research scientists at the Senegal Institute of Agricultural Research (ISRA) are to be congratulated on the way they have compiled this work. They have done so with the collaboration of colleagues at (IEMVT) and specialists at (PRGM). Thanks to their team effort, a major work of reference on stock-rearing, which can be consulted by policy-makers in government, has been produced at a crucial moment in Senegal's history.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{following}} bachelor essay is Patient´s Notification - giving information - before transurethral resection of urinary bladder from both - patient´s and nurse´s point of view. As {{the incidence of}} malignant diseases not only of urinal tract keeps growing, this topic {{is becoming more and}} more pressing. The patient´s education and sharing of information with him is an integral part of daily routine of nursing staff. Satisfactory knowledge contributes to contentment of the patient and thus to successful healing process. In Czech republic bladder tumours account for every 6. malingant disease by men and for every 13. such disease by women. One of the methods used for treating superficial tumours is transurethral resection of the bladder combined with regular cytoscopic dispensarization of the patient. The bachelor essay consists of two parts - theoretical and empirical. The theoretical part deals with nursing care of patients who are subjects of transurethral resection of the bladder because of bladder tumour. It describes in detail the attributes of malignant disease of a bladder, it´s symptoms, treatment, precautions and prognosis. The surgical method of treating superficial bladder tumours (transurethral resection of the bladder) as well as cytoscopic examination of the bladder is thoroughly explained also in this part of the essay. Apart from that the theoretical part pays attention to pre- and post-surgery nursing care of patients indicated to above mentioned treatment. Next chapter talks about giving information to patients, educating them and about knowledgeable consent from a patient before surgery. Five goals were set up for this work. First, to map a range of information, given by urology nurses to the patient, before transurethral resection of the bladder. Second, to find out the most used form of giving such information. Third, to discover how satisfied were the patients with the information. Fourth, to find differences in the content of the information advised to the patient before the first and before any repeated surgery. Fifth goal was to distinguish the variances in the way the patients were satisfied with the information before the first and before any repeated surgery. Empiric part of the essay determines three hypothesis. According to the first hypothesis we presume that verbal notification is most often used for giving information to the patient before transurethral resection of the bladder. Second hypothesis says that those patients who are being prepared for repeated surgery are more satisfied with given information than those who hear such information for the first time. Third hypothesis lets us assume that the range of information given before first surgery is wider that before any repeated surgery. In order to verify each hypothesis a quantitative research was set up. It´s results confirmed first hypothesis, the second hypothesis was disproved. Third hypothesis was also not validated through the results of the research. For the research was chosen quantitative method of data collection from the patients as well as from the nurses, using anonymous questionnaires. These questionnaires were disposed to the patients indicated for transurethral resection of the bladder at Urology in hospital in České Budějovice and Písek. Graphs were created for presentation the results of above mentioned research. Discovered results are being compared in discussion with <b>special</b> <b>bibliography.</b> Presumed output of this bachelor essay was to expand - if needed - the content of knowledgeable consent from a patient before surgery that is given to every patient before transurethral resection of the bladder. As the results of our research clarified that almost 100 % patients are fully satisfied with information given to them, we feel that it is pointless to expand the knowledgeable consent from a patient before surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the Ixodidae becomes every day, more and more important owing to {{the fact of the}} increasing number of diseases of man and animals they can transmit. In Brasil besides transmitting treponemosis, piroplasmosis and anaplasmosis to several domestic animals, the ticks are also responsible fo the transmission of the brazilian rocky mountain spotted fever (A. cajennense and Amblyomma striatum) and they can also harbour the virus of the yellow fever and even to transmit it in laboratory experiments (A. cajennense, O. rostratus). The Brazilian fauna of ticks is a small one and has no more than 45 well-established species belonging to the genus Argas, Ornithodoros, Ixodes, Haemaphysalis, Rhipicephalus, Boophilus, Amblyomma and Spaelaeorhynchus. The genus Amblyomma is the best represented one, with 67 % of all species of ticks known in Brazil. One of the most important species in the Amblyomma cajennense owing to its abundance and its wide parasitism in many vertebrates: reptiles, birds and mammals, incluing man, who is much attacked by the larva, the nymph and the adult of this species. The other ticks who attack the man are the Amblyomma brasiliense (the pecari tick), in the forests, and the Ornithodoros, especially the species. O. rostratus and brasiliensis. Other species can bite the man, but only occasionally, like Amblyomma fossum, striatum, oblongogutatum etc. Argas persicus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Boophilus are very important species not only as parasites but specially because they transmit several diseases to animals. Some of the ticks of the brazilian wild animals are now also parasites of the domestic ones and vice-versa. Arga persicus var. dissimilis is very common among the poultry and transmits the Treponema anserinum (gallinarum). Boophilus microplus is very abundant on our domestic and wild ruminants (Bos, Cervus, Mazama etc.) and can also ben found on horse, dogs, Felis onca, Felis concolor etc., and it transmits to cattle piroplasmosis and anaplasmosis. Rhipicephalus sanguineus (an introduced species) is now very common on the dog, over all the country. The author recommend to give popular names to some brazilian ticks in order to make them more acquainted with the non scientific people. The author gives a classification of the superfamilia Ixoidoidea and keys to the determination of the different species of brazilian ticks. He creates a new family of Nuttallielidae to the so interesting tick, described by Bedford with the name of Nuttaliella namaqua in South Africa, a new variety of Argas persicus, the Argas persicus var. dissimilis nov. var. owing to the differences on the segment and on the size and morphology of the peritrema. He describes also the female of Amblyomma fuscum Nn. A great part of the author's work deals with the biology, life conditions and parasitism of many of the brazilian ticks in accordance with his personal and from other author's researches, especially in reference to Argas persicus, Ornithodoros rostratus, O. brasiliensis, Boophilus microplus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Amblyomma cajennense, A. pseudoconcolor, A. auriculare, A. rotundatum (= A. agamum) etc. The author gives a detailed report upon the parthenogenesis of A. rotundatum (A. agamum) that he first described in 1912 and gives also many references to other species of brazilian ticks, to teratological forms etc. He also gives a detailed report of the geographical distribution of brazilian ticks and of the peculiar conditions of its parasitism. The last part of this article deals with references to the species of ticks of some of the South American Republics namely Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay and Venezuela. Amblyomma testudinis Conil, A. neumanni Ribaga 1902 (= A. furcula Dõnitz 1909) and A. parvitarsum Nn. 1899 (= A. altiplanum Dios 1917), are found only in Argentina.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{workshop}} was to provide academics and doctoral students {{the knowledge and skills}} necessary to efficiently organize and retrieve information using Mendeley© software. During the research process, the next step after finding information, is organize it. In this digital era, our skills to efficiently find information need to be {{different from those of the}} print era (Tuominen, 2007). The same applies to the subsequent process of organization of that information. Furthermore, one of the central competencies of digital literacy (i. e. the ability to understand information), is “knowledge assembly” which is only possible by building a reliable collection of information from diverse sources (Bawden, 2008). Today, it’s possible to do that using software. Mendeley© is a free reference manager software useful to organize as a database a large amount of citations from articles, books, book chapters, encyclopedia entries, etc. You can instantly and automatically create a bibliography (e. g. in Microsoft Word) using any citation style like the Chicago Manual of Style, Modern Language Association, American Sociological Association, American Psychologist Association (6 th edition), etc. Furthermore, you actually don’t need to organize the files in your computer, since Mendeley© directly import your PDF files from a folder selected by you. On the other hand, you can search in your database and all the information could be synchronized with other devices like smart phones, tablets, and other computers, giving you the opportunity to carry with your database everywhere. Finally, you can share the information with other people, giving you the possibility to collaborate with a group (there are over 70, 000 groups) in the creation of <b>special</b> <b>bibliographies</b> or just share with others new articles, book chapters, and new bibliography in general.
