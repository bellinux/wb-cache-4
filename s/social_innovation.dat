40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present {{theoretical}} framework for measuring value of <b>social</b> <b>innovations.</b> The paper examines measurement of <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> in the context of their multidimensionality and the triple bottom line (TBL) approach. The basis of the analysis is the theoretical frameworks for measuring value of <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> and identification of key measurement indicators. This paper presents the theoretical background that is needed in order to develop a measurement model for <b>social</b> <b>innovations.</b> The final result of this theoretical framework is the measured value of <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> which is expressed using index. The development of this framework will contribute in measuring value created by <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> and its impact for the whole society...|$|R

25|$|Economic and <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> led to {{a change}} in the {{parameters}} of the Sino-European trade. The formulation of Classical economics by Adam Smith and other economic theorists caused academic belief in mercantilism to decline in Britain. Industrial Revolution Britain began to use its naval power to spread a broadly liberal economic model encompassing open markets and relatively barrier free international trade, a policy in line with the teachings of smithian economics. This stance on trade was intended to open foreign markets to the resources of Britain's colonies, as well as provide the British public with greater access to consumer goods.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{the theory}} would involve radical {{developments}} in {{politics at the}} center, as well as <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revising powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through rotating capital funds, which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens' rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal politics have failed to disrupt.|$|E

Also, for the “Improved Market/Product” and “Health Benefit” themes, <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> were favored more than environmental ones as <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> comprised 76 % of the instances of improved markets/products and 85.7 % of the instances of health benefits.

30|$|Environmental {{innovations}} tend {{to provide}} decreased {{costs more than}} <b>social</b> <b>innovations.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>innovations</b> tend to provide public recognition or awards more than environmental innovations. They also provide more education for employees though the difference is not as pronounced. These findings show that, {{in addition to an}} increase in revenue/sales for both types of innovations, environmental innovations provide more tangible benefits to SME’s than <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> while <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> provide less tangible but perhaps more visible and direct internal benefits than environmental ones. This suggests that SME’s looking to produce cost effective outcomes may want to explore environmental innovations but those looking to increase their public image may want to explore <b>social</b> <b>innovations.</b> This conclusion may change with a further refinement of the “increased revenue/sales” theme.|$|R

In this work {{the importance of}} crowdsourcing {{in the context of}} creating open <b>social</b> <b>innovations,</b> which serve the realisation and solving of social needs, was presented. This elaboration is divided into three parts. Following a short introduction, the essence of open <b>social</b> <b>innovations,</b> including the notion of <b>innovation</b> and <b>social</b> <b>innovations,</b> was presented. In the second part, the essence of crowdsourcing and its potential, were presented. The subject of the final, third part is showing the possibilities of using crowdsourcing to create open <b>social</b> <b>innovations.</b> Theoretical considerations were supported by three examples. Three examples from Poland were purposefully chosen. It is worth underlining that the obtained results confirm the demands made in the subject literature connected with the importance of crowdsourcing in creating open <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> since this phenomenon contributes to obtain and generate new ideas and ways of solving problems including social ones...|$|R

500|$|Weber saw {{religion}} {{as one of}} the core forces in society. His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the social Darwinist paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the Western civilisation. In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that Calvinist (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the rationalism of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise. In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in magic, or what he referred to as [...] "disenchantment of the world".|$|E

30|$|Looking at the {{comparison}} between the types of innovations and the external impacts associated with them {{it is clear that}} environmental innovations tend to provide benefits to the environment more than <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> and <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> provide benefits to populations more than environmental innovations. While these findings are obvious {{it is important to understand}} the specific ways in which each type of innovation provides benefits to either the environment or society. Environmental innovations tend to create a reduction in waste to a much larger extent than <b>social</b> <b>innovations.</b> They also provide an increase in clean energy more than <b>social</b> <b>innovations.</b> This suggests that entrepreneurs interested in the energy industry will find more opportunity in the environmental sector.|$|R

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Innovation</b> {{is often}} an effort of mental {{creativity}} which involves fluency and flexibility {{from a wide range}} of disciplines. The act of <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to <b>social</b> <b>innovation.</b> First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups. <b>Social</b> <b>innovation</b> is also gaining visibility within academia.|$|E
30|$|<b>Social</b> <b>innovations,</b> however, {{tended to}} offer new {{services}} or found new {{uses for the}} businesses associated with them more so than environmental innovations. For example a retail company created a supply chain for local artisan workers to sell their products in the global market. Without this new service, the often poor artisans would never have access to larger markets and much needed revenue would not have come to areas afflicted by poverty. <b>Social</b> <b>innovations</b> also tended to provide education to stakeholders more than environmental innovations. For example, a healthcare company provided education on improved practices to local hospitals that eventually lead to a decrease in malpractice premiums. Agreements between organizations {{in the form of}} new partnerships also favored <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> more than environmental ones. From this it can be concluded that environmental innovations tend to be more product oriented than <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> and <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> tend to be more service oriented than environmental innovations. This suggests that entrepreneurs that are product oriented may want to focus on environmental sustainability while those that are more service oriented should focus on social sustainability in making strategic decisions.|$|R
