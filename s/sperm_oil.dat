These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. Ambergris, a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of [...] "honing oils" [...] to suit different needs. It is important to use the appropriate solution for the job. In the case of knife sharpening, motor oil is too thick or [...] "heavy" [...] and can over-lubricate or clog a sharpening stone, whereas WD-40 is too [...] "light" [...] an oil and will not carry the metal filings plus stone dust (collectively known as [...] "swarf") away from the stone, and clog it. Not using any oil at all will also clog or [...] "glaze" [...] the stone, again reducing its cutting power. Historically <b>sperm</b> whale <b>oil,</b> Neatsfoot oil, and other animal fats were popular.|$|R

25|$|Beginning around 1854, California {{gold rush}} miners held {{organized}} downhill ski races.

This led {{to some of the}} first commercial ski wax (even though they contained no wax at all), such as Black Dope and Sierra Lighting; both were mainly composed of <b>sperm</b> <b>oil,</b> vegetable oil and pine pitch. However, some instead used paraffin candle wax that melted onto ski bases, and these worked better under colder conditions.|$|E

50|$|In the US, {{whale oil}} {{was used in}} cars as an {{additive}} to automatic transmission fluid until it was banned by the Endangered Species Act. Prior to 1972, over 30 million pounds of <b>Sperm</b> Whale <b>oil</b> was used annually in lubricants because of its exceptional lubricity and heat stability. In 1972, the Sperm Whale was listed as an Endangered Species and the following year, the US Congress amended the Endangered Species Act, outlawing the killing of whales {{and the use of}} their oil. The loss of whale oil had a profound impact in the automotive industry, where for example, transmission failures rose from under 1 million in 1972 to over 8 million by 1975.|$|R
25|$|James Reynolds, {{a member}} of the Clan and on the {{committee}} to rescue the prisoners, bought under his name for the Clan a three-masted whaling bark Catalpa for $5,500, and George Anthony recruited twenty-two sailors. On 29 April 1875, Catalpa sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts. At first, most of the crew was unaware of their real mission. Anthony noticed too late that the ship's marine chronometer was broken, so he had to rely on his own skills for navigation. First they sailed to Fayal Island in the Azores, where they off-loaded 210 barrels of <b>sperm</b> whale <b>oil.</b> Unfortunately, much of the crew deserted the ship, and they had to leave three sick men behind. Anthony recruited replacement crew members and set sail for Western Australia.|$|R
