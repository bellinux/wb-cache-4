"No, I never did," [...] confessed Digger, [...] "but I've {{heard my}} {{grandfather}} tell of Sheep that {{live on the}} tops of the great mountains as free as Light-foot the Deer or any other of the Green Forest people, and with horns so large that they, the Sheep, are called Big-Horns. From what I have heard my grandfather say, those horns over there of Mr. Ram's are nothing to brag about. No, Sir, they are nothing to brag about. One of those wild, free cousins of Mr. Ram over there would laugh at those horns. But they are funny horns, and they've been like that always {{since the days of the}} first great Ram, the great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of all the Sheep, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> told me. It was way back in those long-ago days that they became curved and quite useless for fighting, and all because of old Big-Horn going about with a chip on his shoulder." ...|$|E

60|$|The wonder is, that, {{being an}} only child, and a sore problem when any {{question}} of discipline or punishment arose, I was not utterly spoiled. One person at least came very near to doing <b>so,</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> Monsieur Pierre de Ronvel. To be exact, {{he was my}} step-grandfather, for my mother's charming mother, with her ringlets and crinoline, after my real grandfather's death, had married a second time. He crossed the English Channel to visit my parents when I was in my tenth year--a tall, stiff, jerky man, with a sallow face, speckled fur-like hair that stood in a little wall round his forehead, and the liveliest black eyes. His manners were a felicity to watch even at my age. You would have supposed he had come courting my mother; {{and he took a}} great fancy to me. He was extremely fond of salad, I remember: and I very proud of my mustard and cress--which I could gather for him myself with one of my own table-knives. So copiously he talked, with such a medley of joys and zests and surprises on his face, that I vowed soon to be mistress of my stepmother tongue. He could also conjure away reels and thimbles, even spoons and forks, with a skill that precluded my becoming a materialist for ever after. I worshipped my grandfather--and yet without a vestige of fear.|$|E
60|$|But it {{must not}} be thought that Lionel Carvel, your ancestor, was wholly unlettered {{because he was a}} sportsman, though it must be confessed that books {{occupied}} him only when the weather compelled, or when on his back with the gout. At times he would fain have me read to him as he lay in his great four-post bed with the flowered counterpane, from the Spectator, stopping me now and anon at some awakened memory of his youth. He never forgave Mr. Addison for killing stout, old Sir Roger de Coverley, and would never listen to the butler's account of his death. Mr. Carvel, too, had walked in Gray's Inn Gardens and met adventure at Fox Hall, and seen the great Marlborough himself. He had a fondness for Mr. Congreve's Comedies, many of which he had seen acted; and was partial to Mr. Gay's Trivia, which brought him many a recollection. He would also listen to Pope. But of the more modern poetry I think Mr. Gray's Elegy pleased him best. He would laugh over Swift's gall and wormwood, and would never be brought by my mother to acknowledge the defects in the Dean's character. Why? He had once met the Dean in a London drawing-room, when my grandfather was a young spark at Christ Church, Oxford. He never tired of relating that interview. The hostess was a very great lady indeed, and actually stood waiting for a word with his Reverence, whose whim it was rather to talk to the young provincial. He was a forbidding figure, in his black gown and periwig, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> said, with a piercing blue eye and shaggy brow. He made the mighty to come to him, while young Carvel stood between laughter and fear of the great lady's displeasure.|$|E
5000|$|..... And so {{we return}} to my poor father who died in February 1919 beloved by all, and I succeeded him. It was soon very evident after reading his will and {{consultation}} with the family lawyer, that my old home {{would have to go}} - there was no question about it. The estate had to be split up amongst the seven surviving children, with of course provisions for my mother, so I at once settled to sell Fretherne Court Estate, which had been in my family for say some ninety years. or <b>so,</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> having come there as a squarson (squire clergyman) from Richmond. It was very sad, but Fretherne Court had no modern requirements, no central heating, and they said we used to burn a ton of coal a day there - fancy the price now, and of course you could not have got it - no electricity, although my uncle had advocated this so many years before, the kitchens {{about a quarter of a}} mile, or so to speak, from the dining rooms water supply very indifferent, only one or two bathrooms, and the drainage system - well, I finish with this ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Carlo Fantom (died December 1643) was a Croat {{mercenary}} in the English Civil War who had {{the reputation}} of being impervious to bullets and is quoted as saying [...] "I care not for your Cause; I come to fight for your halfe-crown and your handsome women.

6000|$|For all that, I {{ventured to}} point out that the habit of {{alighting}} in the fork of a tree, or the disengaging of one's self from the saddle on the ground, was attended with inconvenience, and even ostentatious display. But Enriquez swept the objections away with a single gesture. [...] "It is the PREENCIPAL--the bottom fact--at which you arrive. The next come of himself! Many horse have achieve to mount the rider by the knees, and relinquish after thees same fashion. <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> had a barb of thees kind--but she has gone dead, and <b>so</b> have <b>my</b> <b>grandfather.</b> Which is sad and strange!

60|$|I have a vast {{respect for}} <b>my</b> <b>grandfather.</b> He {{was a man}} of forethought. He left me a modest little income of seven hundred a-year, well invested. Now, seven hundred a-year is not exactly wealth; but it is an {{unobtrusive}} competence; it permits a bachelor to move about the world and choose at will his own profession. I chose medicine; but I was not wholly dependent upon it. <b>So</b> I honoured <b>my</b> <b>grandfather's</b> wise disposition of his worldly goods; though, oddly enough, my cousin Tom (to whom he left his watch and five hundred pounds) speaks MOST disrespectfully of his character and intellect.|$|R
40|$|DOLL FOAMMy {{grandfather}} was quite hard-of-hearing, and would sometimes mishear words. Usually, he would hear unfamiliar words as {{words that were}} familiar to him, as in this example. He first had his telephone installed about 1945, and since the word 'phone' was unfamiliar, he called it a 'foam'. He continued calling it a 'foam' until xxxx 1965 when the system was changed from the crank-type phones to the dial-type phones. In Sunnyside, telephones then became known as dial phones, but my grandfather didn't know the word 'dial' either, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> began to call 'phones' 'doll foams'. He called them 'doll foams' until he died last year. My grandfathers name was Arthur Rockwood, of Sunnyside, Trinity Bay, and {{he was born in}} 1878. YesJ. D. A.

60|$|My mother's {{family lived}} in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, for several generations. I have little {{information}} about her ancestors. Her family took no interest in genealogy, <b>so</b> that <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> who died when I was sixteen years old, knew only back to his grandfather. On the other side, my father took {{a great interest in}} the subject, and in his researches, he found that there was an entailed estate in Windsor, Connecticut, belonging to the family, to which his nephew, Lawson Grant --still living--was the heir. He was so much interested in the subject that he got his nephew to empower him to act in the matter, and in 1832 or 1833, when I was a boy ten or eleven years old, he went to Windsor, proved the title beyond dispute, and perfected the claim of the owners for a consideration--three thousand dollars, I think. I remember the circumstance well, and remember, too, hearing him say on his return that he found some widows living on the property, who had little or nothing beyond their homes. From these he refused to receive any recompense.|$|R
60|$|That is the {{way with}} us; we may go on half of our life not knowing such a thing is in us, when in reality it was there all the time, and all we needed was {{something}} to turn up that would call for it. Indeed, it was always <b>so</b> without family. <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> had a cancer, and they never knew {{what was the matter}} with him till he died, and he didn't know himself. It is wonderful how gifts and diseases can be concealed in that way. All that was necessary in my case was for this lovely and inspiring girl to cross my path, and out came the poem, and no more trouble to me to word it and rhyme it and perfect it than it is to stone a dog. No, I should have said it was not in me; but it was.|$|R
6000|$|We lay {{that night}} at the sign of the [...] "Twa Naigs," [...] where Bonnie Prince Charlie had rested in the Mars year(1715). Before I went to bed I called for pen and paper, and by the light of a tallow dip sat down to compose a letter to <b>my</b> <b>grandfather,</b> telling him that I was alive and well, and recounting as much of my adventures as I could. I said that I was going to London, where I would see Mr. Dix, and would take passage thence for America. I prayed that {{he had been able to}} bear up against the ordeal of my disappearance. I dwelt upon the {{obligations}} I was under to John Paul, relating the misfortunes of that worthy seaman (which he so little deserved!). And said that it was my purpose to bring him to Maryland with me, where I knew Mr. Carvel would reward him with one of his ships, explaining that he would accept no money. But when it came to accusing Grafton and the rector, I thought twice, and bit the end of the feather. The chances were <b>so</b> great that <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> would be in bed and under the guardianship of my uncle that I forbore, and resolved instead to write it to Captain Daniel at my first opportunity.|$|R
