Players attempt to toss a disc through a hoop while {{avoiding}} full-contact from their opponents, including punches, kicks, throws, and stomps. Like a futuristic rugby, the sport combines elements of hockey, basketball, and full-contact American football. Critics compared the game's mechanics to Discs of Tron, Mortal Kombat, Blood Bowl, Final Fantasy Xs Blitzball, Blades of Steel, and <b>Speedball,</b> and its aesthetic to that of Blade Runner. The game's premise was also compared to the 1975 film Rollerball.|$|E

Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically <b>Speedball.</b> IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study deter- mined human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) seroprevalence and factors associated with HIV infection among street-recruited injection drug users and crack cocaine smokers. METHODS: An analysis was performed on HIV serologies and risk behaviors of 6402 injection drug users and 3383 crack smokers in 16 US municipalities in 1992 and 1993. RESULTS: HIV seroprevalence was 12. 7 % among injection drug users and 7. 5 % among crack smokers. Most high-seroprevalence municipalities (> 25 %) were located along the eastern seaboard of the United States. In high-seroprevalence municipalities, but not in others, HIV seroprevalence was higher for injection drug users than for crack smokers. Among injection drug users, cocaine injection, use of <b>speedballs</b> (cocaine or amphetamines with heroin), and sexual risk behaviors were independently associated with HIV infection. Among crack smokers, sexual risk behaviors were associated with HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Injection drug users and crack smokers {{are at high risk}} for HIV infection...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{factors associated}} with accidental fatal drug overdose among a cohort of injection drug users (IDUs). METHODS: In a prospective cohort study of 2849 IDUs in King County, Washington, deaths were identified by electronically merging subject identifiers with death certificate records. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of overdose mortality. RESULTS: Thirty-two overdoses were observed. Independent predictors of overdose mortality were bisexual sexual orientation (relative risk [RR] = 4. 86; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 30, 13. 2), homelessness (RR = 2. 30; 95 % CI = 1. 06, 5. 01), infrequent injection of <b>speedballs</b> (RR = 5. 36; 95 % CI = 1. 58, 18. 1), daily use of powdered cocaine (RR = 4. 84; 95 % CI = 1. 13, 20. 8), and daily use of poppers (RR = 22. 0; 95 % CI = 1. 74, 278).

25|$|Though tournament paintball was {{originally}} {{played in the}} woods, <b>speedball</b> became the standard competitive format in the 1990s. The smaller fields made use of artificial terrain such as bunkers, allowing symmetrical fields that eliminate terrain advantages for either team; woodsball fields having no such guarantee. Most recently, fields using inflatable bunkers, tethered {{to the ground with}} stakes, have become standard for most tournament formats; the soft, yielding bunkers reduce the occurrence of injuries, the bunkers deflate to store in a compact space and anchor to the ground with tent stakes, allowing for temporary fields to be set up and torn down with less impact on the ground underneath, and the arrangement of bunkers can be easily re-configured to maintain novelty of play or to simulate a predetermined field layout for an upcoming event.|$|E
25|$|A {{native of}} Chicago, Illinois, the {{diminutive}} Ziegler {{was the daughter}} of Frank Siegler and Mae (née Connal) Ziegler. At a very early age, she played baseball in Chicago. In 1933 her family had to relocate to the Los Angeles, California, due to the economic depression. Her father had been a linotype operator in Chicago, but went into different work after moving to California, while her mother was a housewife and an avid bridge player. Ziegler had a brother, Frank, who was three years older than she. At that time in California girls were not allowed to participate in interscholastic sports, except tennis. As expected, Ziegler expressed disappointment over very little organized women's school sport in her new home, but she recalled that various girls athletic associations in the Los Angeles area provided compensation, as her hectic later teenage years involved memberships on several softball, basketball and <b>speedball</b> teams. In the late 1930s, she joined the Goodrich Silvertown, a prestigious softball club sponsored by B. F. Goodrich Company, one of the largest tire and rubber manufacturers in the world. In 1939 she helped her team win another Southern California Championship.|$|E
25|$|Mydland {{died of a}} <b>speedball</b> {{overdose}} in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, {{leading him}} {{to believe that the}} band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's keys musically drove Garcia to new heights on stage. As the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a methadone clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.|$|E
5000|$|Speed {{bags are}} small, air-filled bags {{anchored}} {{at the top}} to a rebound platform parallel to the ground. Speed bags help a fighter learn to keep his or her hands up, improve hand-eye coordination, and learn to shift weight between feet when punching. They are also known as <b>speedballs</b> or speed ball bags. They are generally filled with air and fitted around a tight PU-based or leather material. They come in various sizes, ranging from the large 13x10" [...] (33x25 cm) and 12x9", midsize 11x8", 10x7" [...] (25x18 cm) and 9x6", to the small 8x5", 7x4" [...] and 6x4" [...] (15x10 cm). Generally the larger the bag, the slower it is and the more force is required to keep it going. Large bags are used more for building strength and endurance, while smaller bags allow the training athlete to focus on faster hand speed, timing and coordination. Beginners might view this bag more as a [...] "control bag", not a speed bag, for {{they will not be}} able to punch both quickly and repetitively until they gain control over their swinging force and speed.|$|R
500|$|Edge {{referred}} to Deathrow as a substance-less and [...] "contrived clone" [...] of the 1990 <b>Speedball</b> 2, which used a ball {{instead of a}} disc. David Hodgson of EGM similarly praised the 1990 title in comparison. William Racer of OXM did not mind the two games' similarities and added that [...] "you might as well copy from the best". While Kasavin of GameSpot thought the theme was tired, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Oxford wrote that the game felt [...] "fresh". Reflecting on the release year, IGN director Peer Schneider said that games like Deathrow showed the games industry's ability to make new, high-caliber franchises. Two IGN staffers predicted the game to be a sleeper hit: one noted the sparse press compared to the game's quality, and the other explained that Ubisoft was busy promoting bigger titles such as Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, , and Rayman.|$|E
500|$|Deathrow was {{developed}} by Southend Interactive and produced by Ubisoft Entertainment. Five friends opened Southend in Malmö, Sweden in 1998 to fulfill their childhood ambitions to make video games. Southend began Deathrow development in May 1999 and expected the game to be an online PC video game tentatively titled Blitz Disc Arena. The idea for the sports game descended {{from a combination of}} <b>Speedball</b> 2, the Quake and Unreal series, and Tekken. Southend's nine-person team received Xbox development kits in June 2000 and decided to move the game to console in early 2001. According to Southend animator Rodrigo Cespedes in a 2002 TeamXbox interview, [...] "Xbox was the only console that would allow [...] to produce the game as it was originally envisioned", adding that Microsoft and Ubisoft encouraged the mature direction with emphasis on blood, brutality, and profanity. Thus they began to port the game to the console for its feature capabilities, including vertex and pixel shaders for bump mapped environmental textures and character animations, specular lighting, and bumped reflection mapping.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Speedball</b> {{is played}} {{in an open}} field that could be {{compared}} to a soccer field, it is flat {{with a minimum of}} natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first <b>speedball</b> fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but <b>speedball</b> itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some [...] "give" [...] to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric [...] "bunkers" [...] were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as [...] "snake" [...] and [...] "can" [...] bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. <b>Speedball</b> games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. <b>Speedball</b> is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more [...] "High Tech" [...] in a sense that they are controlled by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).|$|E
