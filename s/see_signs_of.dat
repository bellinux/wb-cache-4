25|$|A soldier {{informed}} Gavin {{that the}} windspeed at the landing site was 56km/h (about 34 miles per hour). During the planning phase, 24km/h (about 14.5 miles per hour) had been assumed. After {{one hour of}} flying, the plane crew could see the bombardment of the invasion beaches. Gavin ordered his men {{to prepare for the}} jump, and a few minutes later was the first paratrooper to jump from the plane. Due to the higher-than-expected windspeed, he sprained his ankle while landing. After assembling a group of 20 men, his S-3, Major Benjamin H. Vandervoort, and his S-1, Captain Ireland, he realized that they had drifted off course and were miles from the intended landing areas. He could <b>see</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> combat twenty miles onwards; he gathered his men and headed towards the combat zone.|$|E

2500|$|Huan, however, soon {{displayed}} {{signs of}} over confidence {{and lack of}} actual fortitude. [...] He had Emperor An issue an edict ordering him to advance north against Later Qin, but then had Emperor An issue another edict ordering him not to do so. [...] Further, as he prepared his fleet, he set aside the treasures on a small ship, ready to flee if the battle turned against him. [...] He was also hypercritical of his officials; any small error would draw a serious punishment from him. [...] He was also very attached to treasures, and whenever he saw precious paintings, calligraphy, or houses, he would {{find some way to}} obtain them. [...] Some ambitious individuals began to <b>see</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> weakness in him and considered rising against him.|$|E

2500|$|Problems with {{spatial memory}} and {{navigation}} {{are thought to}} be one of the early indications of Alzheimer's Disease. Delpolyi and Rankin compared thirteen mild Alzheimer's patients and twenty-one mild-cognitive impairment patients, with twenty-four subjects with normal brain functioning through a series of spatially related tasks. The first task entailed route memory and the study found that the non-control group could not find their location on the map, or recall the order in which they had seen landmarks. The overall results showed that only 10% of the control group got lost on the route while 50% of the non-control group got lost. The demonstrated issues with spatial navigation among Alzheimer's and MCI patients indicates a malfunctioning with the firing of place cells and that abnormalities within the hippocampus may be an early indicatory of disease onset. [...] O'Keefe who originally found the existence of place cells said that, [...] "We suspect we'll begin to <b>see</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> changes in the functions of cells before we see changes in behavioral tasks." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his father's {{illness and}} {{subsequent}} death, Austin began to <b>see</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> similar mental illness in himself, now {{thought to be}} Alzheimer's disease. Austin was {{living and working in}} Seattle as a printer at the Puget Sound Dispatch when he was severely injured in a fireworks explosion on July 4, 1872. The explosion severely lacerated the lower part of his face, removing all the incisors from his lower jawbone. He had {{spent most of his life}} in San Francisco and many years traveling to seek medical treatment to restore his health, while retaining a real estate office in Seattle. Upon returning to Seattle in 1889, he made plans to erect a large brick building on the property he inherited just south of his father's hotel, since renamed the Bellevue House. On April 23, 1889, he took his nephew, William M. Coffman, on a buggy ride to share his plans. [...] The next morning, his demeanor had changed and he was suffering from indigestion. He went to his realty office as usual, locked the door behind him and shot himself in the head. A neighboring merchant heard the shot and rushed across the street to tell a pharmacist that a murder must have occurred. After summoning a doctor, several men broke down Bell's door to find him dead by his own hand. He was 35. A suicide note to Eva was discovered stating that he did not consider life with poor health worth living and expressed sorrow that he must take this way out.|$|E

60|$|One day's {{march was}} much like another, and many passed {{before we were}} with General Herkimer again.
