2500|$|Cosby {{was asked}} {{directly}} about Buress's comments {{and the resulting}} fallout in two November 2014 interviews, which were originally intended to be about a new art exhibit at the Smithsonian that featured his private collection of African American art. In an NPR interview on November 15, 2014, reporter Scott Simon said: [...] "This question gives me no pleasure, Mr. Cosby, {{but there have been}} serious allegations raised about you in recent days." [...] Cosby became silent, leading to an awkward radio exchange in which Simon verbally described Cosby's actions to listeners: [...] "you're <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> no." [...] Simon continued asking Cosby to comment on the allegations before finally wrapping up the interview with no further communication from Cosby. In a November 6, 2014, interview with Associated Press reporter Brett Zongker, Cosby appeared visibly rattled by unexpected Buress questions and told Zongker, [...] "No, no, we don't answer that." [...] In the proceeding minutes, Cosby repeatedly attempted to get Zongker to confirm that the AP would edit out the Buress questions, implying that Zongker's [...] "integrity" [...] and ability to be a [...] "serious reporter" [...] would be compromised if that portion of the interview was not [...] "scuttled". When Zongker failed to guarantee this request, Cosby turned to his off-camera publicist David Brokaw and told him to get on the phone with Zongker's editors [...] "immediately". When the interview was first released on November 10, the Buress questions had indeed been omitted. However, after the allegations continued to gain new traction, including a new accusation from Janice Dickinson, the AP decided to release footage of the full exchange on November 19.|$|E

Well, if you will go home and prepare him a little, I will come round this {{afternoon}} and see him. It's no use <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> Doctor, I feel myself again now; but I will lie down till lunch-time, and will promise not to excite myself." ...|$|E

60|$|After that, Felix {{lay awake}} for some hours, hearing the {{rain on the}} roof, and puzzled in his own head by a half-uncertain memory. What was it in his school reading that that {{ceremony}} with the water indefinitely reminded him of? Wasn't there some Greek or Roman superstition about <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> when water was poured upon it? What could that superstition be, and what light might it cast on that mysterious ceremony? He wished he could remember; {{but it was so}} long since he'd read it, and he never cared much at school for Greek or Roman antiquities.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] {{cried the}} marquis, irritably, {{as soon as}} the steward had made his confession. [...] "I told you to get thirty girls, and thirty I mean to have. What's the use of <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> when all their dresses are ordered? Thirty tunics, thirty wreaths, thirty pairs of sandals and silk stockings, thirty crooks, you scoundrel--and you have the impudence to offer me only twenty-three hands to hold them. Not a word! I won't hear a word! Get me my thirty girls, or lose your place." [...] The marquis roared out this last terrible {{sentence}} {{at the top of his}} voice, and pointed peremptorily to the door.|$|E
6000|$|If {{you carry}} out your design of {{settling}} in London {{you must be}} sure and let us have the new address. I swear we shall write some time--and if the interval be long you must just take {{it on your own}} head for prophesying horrors. You remember how you always said we were but an encampment of Bedouins, and that you would awake some morning to find us fled for ever. Nothing unsettled me more than these ill-judged remarks. I was doing my best to be a sedentary semi-respectable man in a suburban villa; and you were always <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> at me and assuring me (what I knew to be partly true) that it was all a farce. Even here, when I have sunk practically all that I possess, and have good health and my fill of congenial fighting, and could not possibly get away if I wanted ever so--even here and now the recollection of these infidel prophesies rings in my ears like an invitation to the sea. Tu l'as voulu! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Whatever it is," [...] rejoined Allan, [...] "we'll {{treat it}} like a dose of physic--we'll take it at once, {{and be done with}} it." [...] He went on reading: [...] "'And no license to marry without banns shall be granted, unless oath shall be first made by one of the parties that he or she {{believes}} that there is no impediment of kindred or alliance'--well, I can take my oath of that with a safe conscience! What next? 'And one of the said parties must, for the space of fifteen days immediately preceding such license, have had his or her usual place of abode within the parish or chapelry within which such marriage is to be solemnized!' Chapelry! I'd live fifteen days in a dog-kennel with the greatest pleasure. I say, Neelie, all this seems like plain sailing enough. What are you <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> about? Go on, and I shall see? Oh, all right; I'll go on. Here we are: 'And where one of the said parties, not being a widower or widow, shall be under the age of twenty-one years, oath must first be made that the consent of the person or persons whose consent is required has been obtained, or that there is no person having authority to give such consent. The consent required by this act is that of the father--'" [...] At those last formidable words Allan came to a full stop. [...] "The consent of the father," [...] he repeated, with all needful seriousness of look and manner. [...] "I couldn't exactly swear to that, could I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I object,' {{continued}} Thomas, quietly possessing {{himself of}} his friend's hat, which {{stood on a}} table near him,--'I object, first, to the personal appearance of the horse. I protest against the conventional idea of beauty, as attached to that animal. I think his nose too long, his forehead too low, and his legs (except {{in the case of}} the cart-horse) ridiculously thin by comparison with the size of his body. Again, considering how big an animal he is, I object to the contemptible delicacy of his constitution. Is he not the sickliest creature in creation? Does any child catch cold as easily as a horse? Does he not sprain his fetlock, for all his appearance of superior strength, as easily as I sprained my ankle! Furthermore, to take him from another point of view, what a helpless wretch he is! No fine lady requires more constant waiting-on than a horse. Other animals can make their own toilette: he must have a groom. You will tell me that this is because we want to make his coat artificially glossy. Glossy! Come home with me, and see my cat,--my clever cat, who can groom herself! Look at your own dog! see how the intelligent creature curry-combs himself with his own honest teeth! Then, again, what a fool the horse is, what a poor, nervous fool! He will start at a piece of white paper in the road as if it was a lion. His one idea, when he hears a noise that he is not accustomed to, is to run away from it. What do you say to those two common instances of the sense and courage of this absurdly overpraised animal? I might multiply them to two hundred, if I chose to exert my mind and waste my breath, which I never do. I prefer coming at once to my last charge against the horse, which is the most serious of all, because it affects his moral character. I accuse him boldly, in his capacity of servant to man, of slyness and treachery. I brand him publicly, no matter how mild he may look about the eyes, or how sleek he may be about the coat, as a systematic betrayer, whenever he can get the chance, of the confidence reposed in him. What do you mean by laughing and <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> at me?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Conventional {{gestures}} are culture-bound emblems that do {{not translate}} across different cultures. Culture-specific gestures such as <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> [...] "no" [...] or waving [...] "goodbye" [...] are considered conventional gestures. Although American children do not typically produce many representational gestures in general, conventional gestures are {{the most frequently used}} in the representational gesture category.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Don't {{look at me}} like that, darling; and don't <b>shake</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> so. It is all right! I {{told you}} I had my reasons, and you said you would trust me. I have only done what I thought best!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No good, Mr Varden. You may <b>shake</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> father, but I say no good, {{and will}} say no good, and I {{would say no}} good a hundred times over, if that would {{bring him back to}} have the drubbing he deserves.' ...|$|R
50|$|Cultural {{differences}} exist within countries (tribal/regional differences, dialects etc.), between religious groups and in organisations or at an organisational level - where companies, teams and units {{may have different}} expectations, norms and idiolects. Families and family groups may also experience the effect of cultural barriers to communication within and between different family members or groups. For example: words, colours and symbols have different meanings in different cultures. In {{most parts of the}} world, nodding your head means agreement, <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> means no, except {{in some parts of the}} world.|$|E
5000|$|Pop Insomniacs said, [...] "We've seen {{versions}} of this story several times, but never quite mangled together like this before, which is precisely why I was so captivated, uncomfortable and surprised by this movie". Kansas City Star reporter Jocelyn Noveck said, [...] "It {{all comes down to}} a doozy of a plot twist, and it's enjoyably shocking. But at the end you're still left <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> feeling lost, wishing there was something tangible to hold on to — perhaps a bit like being trapped in a snow globe...

5000|$|Michael Farkash, The Hollywood Reporter (August 25, 2000)The {{telefilm}} {{is true to}} its pedigree, and that's {{good and}} bad news. The visuals are cool and, occasionally, nicely subtle as our heroine, Sara Pezzini, flashes her new powers of super speed and martial arts skill. But the characters as scripted are thin.... Things move a little too fast at TV series speeds. In fact, it's too fast for an introductory feature. The personal stuff doesn't get its due. Although we learn that Sara had a heroic father, also a cop, we don't see them together in flashback.... Watch out for leaps in the story's internal logic that may have you <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> But hey, relax! It's only a telefilm. Soon, perhaps, {{it will become a}} series or give birth to sequels.|$|E
5000|$|Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk rhetorically asked, [...] "If {{anyone would}} like to explain just what the hell {{happened}} at the end of 'Tree Trunks' I'm all ears." [...] However, he noted that [...] "If Adventure Time was a lesser show, episodes like that could possibly make one walk away <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> but somehow it was simply another quirky bit of personality for a show bursting at the seams with it." [...] A review from the Dayton Examiner wrote that [...] "Tree Trunks makes a hysterical character by just being absurd". They praised the fact that, in the episode, she often says lines [...] "that have vague sexual overtones (some of them failing to even be vague)". The review enjoyed the way the episode was able to convey the message of [...] "following your dreams" [...] in such an absurd way. The review also praised the [...] "priceless" [...] twist ending, calling it [...] "the absolute best moment in the episode and one of their personal favorites in the entirety of Adventure Time".|$|E
5000|$|Brain Wave Vibration is {{promoted}} as a {{mental and physical}} health enhancement technique developed by Ilchi Lee. According to Lee, brain waves are a type of vibration that has a significant effect on a person’s health and outlook on life. [...] A form of moving meditation (head-shaking), the technique was described by one Body & Brain instructor: [...] "By <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and vibrating your body, you bring healing energy. You just need to close your eyes and turn your head right and left, right and left, focusing on the center of your brain and keeping a rhythm. Afterwards, you feel very rejuvenated!" [...] As part of CNN's three-part investigation into controversy and lawsuits surrounding Dahn Yoga, Neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta was asked about testimonials that Brain Wave Vibration [...] "lowered blood pressure, corrected lazy eyes, and even reduced symptoms of multiple sclerosis." [...] Gupta stated that the notion of vibrating the brain or {{other parts of the body}} to turn parts of the brain on and off is not grounded in science and that anecdotes are not empirically verifiable.|$|E

5000|$|On July 22, 2016, Tillman gained media {{attention}} after walking off stage at XPoNential Music Festival in Camden, New Jersey, after twenty minutes into his planned fifty-minute performance. Instead of performing his setlist, Tillman {{walked out and}} asked, [...] "What the fuck is going on?" [...] He then talked for six minutes about the [...] "numbing" [...] role entertainment plays in our lives and how [...] "stupidity just fucking runs the world because entertainment is stupid." [...] When the audience applauded him he asked them not to and responded by saying, [...] "Maybe just {{take a moment to}} be really fucking profoundly sad." [...] He finally played a thirteen-minute piece from his recent album Pure Comedy called Leaving LA which references the frustrations he spoke of during his speech. Tillman then covered Leonard Cohen's [...] "Bird on the Wire" [...] before telling the crowd he loved them and walked off the stage, cutting his performance short. The following day, Tillman explained his performance in an Instagram post, in which he called Donald Trump's speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention a [...] "demonic clown pageant coronation of our next potential Idiot King", which took place the night before Tillman's performance. [...] So, maybe it's completely insane and wildly inappropriate to get in front of a battleship adjacent to Camden, NJ the day after the demonic clown pageant coronation of our next potential Idiot King and publicly despair on a stage contracted specially for the purpose an afternoon of delightful folk/blues/Americana/roots music and feel real fucking deep-down-in-your guts jeembles about entertainment, its narcotic properties and horrifying efficiency in elevating madmen to the heights of influence (ironic) - KNOWING all the while it's probably better to leave this kind of commentary to the professionals at Comedy Central- after a few days of politely shrugging and <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> in pathetic resignation with other polite, pathetic resigned people and asking [...] "Wait, what the fuck is going on?" [...] in to a microphone before playing a new 15 minute song that is almost obscenely vulnerable because it feels more honest to you than [...] "Bored in the USA" [...] but maybe it's not. [...] Tillman addressed his behavior while later performing at Mo Pop Festival in Detroit on July 24, 2016, where he said he was not particularly articulate and clarified: [...] We really need to regain some perspective on what can be entertainment and try to be conscious {{of the ways in which}} we're viewing things as if they were entertainment. Things end up becoming really passive and we become powerless because we interact with it like it's entertainment. I just feel like I would be remiss if I didn't talk about that a little bit.|$|E
