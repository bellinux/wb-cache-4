25|$|Ziaul Ahsan, {{a detective}} with the RAB, said {{investigators}} believed the murder was pre-meditated and committed by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> the victims. Police {{said at least}} two people murdered the couple. At first police reported that nothing was stolen, but later reports said Sarowar’s laptop computer and cell phones could be missing. Another report, however, claimed that police had retrieved three cell phones as evidence. But in the petition brought to the High Court, it was learned that the couple's computers and laptops had been stolen.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} suspicions that corrupt figures in {{authority}} had helped Leggio avoid justice, {{with plenty of}} suspicion falling on the General Attorney of Sicily, Pietro Scaglione, who was shot dead on 5 May 1971 with his police bodyguard Antonino Lo Russo. Pentiti Tommaso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno later said Leggio personally shot Scaglione dead because he either did {{not want him to}} help deliver an acquittal for one of the Corleonesi boss's rivals or {{he did not want to}} leave <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> a lot of his secrets alive. Leggio would later be tried twice for killing Scaglione but was acquitted for insufficient evidence.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of a catalog was to Cogswell's mind a matter of prime importance. By the end of 1855, Cogswell was able to report that the catalog was finished, excepting {{only a small portion}} of history. The collection was grouped into 14 departments, for each of which a separate catalog was prepared. The alphabetical index to these separate catalogs formed the basis of the printed catalog issued during 1857–1861 in 4 volumes. The timing and the format of the catalog went against Cogswell's judgment, but accorded with the desire of the trustees to put before the public a tangible result of their work. In 1866, a supplement was issued. The first catalog recorded approximately 115,000 volumes. The supplement of 1866 recorded the accessions of five years, about 15,000 volumes, and carried with it an index to subjects. It was imperfect, but also the work of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> books and knew how to guide others to them.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} USC School of Cinematic Arts, Singer {{directed}} a short film in 1988 called Lion's Den involving {{a number of}} friends, including actor Ethan Hawke whom he knew from his childhood in New Jersey and editor John Ottman who he had met while working on a friend's short film. After a screening of Lion's Den, Singer was approached by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> of a Japanese company that funded low-budget films. by someone from Tokuma Japan Productions, a Japanese company that funded low-budget films. After being asked {{to come up with}} a concept that might be used as the basis for a feature film, Singer wrote the concept for Public Access (1993) with high school friend Christopher McQuarrie, and fellow USC student Michael Feit Dougan wrote the first draft in ten days about a supposedly idyllic small town. Ottman again served as editor but this time also composed the score for the film. At the 1993 Sundance Film Festival, the film was named as co-winner of the Grand Jury Prize.|$|E
25|$|In December 1932, {{the general}} counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) resigned, and Reed was {{appointed}} the agency's new general counsel. Since 1930, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Eugene Meyer, had pressed Hoover to take a more active approach to ameliorating the Great Depression. Hoover finally relented and submitted legislation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act was signed into law on January 22, 1932, but its operations were kept secret for five months. Hoover feared both political attacks from Republicans and that publicity about which corporations were receiving RFC assistance might disrupt the agency's attempts to keep companies financially viable. When Congress passed legislation in July 1932 forcing the RFC to make public the companies that received loans, the resulting political embarrassment led to the resignation of the RFC's president and his successor as well as other staff turnover at the agency. Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President in November 1932 led to further staff changes. On December 1, 1932, the RFC's general counsel resigned, and Hoover appointed Reed to the position. Roosevelt, impressed with Reed's work and needing <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> the agency, its staff and its operations, kept Reed on. Reed mentored and protected the careers of a number of young lawyers at RFC, many of whom became highly influential in the Roosevelt administration: Alger Hiss, Robert H. Jackson, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr. (later an important federal district court judge), and David Cushman Coyle.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hook arrives to the mansion to warn Emma, but Gold thwarts his efforts, erases his {{phone calls to}} Emma, and ties him to the fence. Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he will find a way to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is the only one left alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma wondered what got into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story wanted them to be together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks. Unfortunately, Emma and Elsa notice the yellow ribbons on their left wrists too late, and that they can't remove their ribbons, even while the ribbons are siphoning away their power.|$|E

500|$|In 1943 Arthur Freed, the {{successful}} producer of musical films at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, bought the film rights to Best Foot Forward {{and made a}} film version starring Lucille Ball and William Gaxton. Donen moved to Hollywood to audition for the film and signed a one-year contract with MGM. In Best Foot Forward, Donen appeared as a chorus dancer and was made assistant choreographer by Charles Walters. At MGM Donen renewed his friendship with Kelly, who was quickly becoming a popular supporting actor in musicals. When Kelly was loaned to Columbia Pictures for a film with Rita Hayworth, he was offered the chance to choreograph his own dance numbers and asked Donen to assist. Kelly stated, [...] "Stanley needed a job. I needed someone to count for the cameraman, <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> the steps and could explain what I {{was going to do}} so the shot was set up correctly." [...] Donen accepted and choreographed three dance sequences with Kelly in 1944's Cover Girl. Donen {{came up with the idea}} for the [...] "Alter Ego" [...] dance sequence where Kelly's reflection jumps out of a shop window and dances with him. Director Charles Vidor insisted that the idea would never work, so Donen and Kelly directed the scene themselves and Donen spent over a year editing it. The film made Kelly a movie star and is considered by many film critics to be an important and innovative musical. Donen signed a one-year contract with Columbia and choreographed several films there, but returned to MGM the following year when Kelly wanted assistance on his next film.|$|E

2500|$|Parts I, II, and III are chiefly {{written in}} expository language. The papers are informational, matter-of-fact, and instructional. Part IV {{of the book}} is written as a {{biography}} of Jesus' life, and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters, high attention to detail, woven sub-plots, and realistic dialogue. Considered as literature, Part IV is favorably compared to retellings of Jesus' life, such as The Gospel According to Jesus Christ by José Saramago and Behold the Man by Michael Moorcock. Martin Gardner considers Part IV to be an especially [...] "well-written, impressive work," [...] and says, [...] "Either it is accurate in its history, coming directly from higher beings in position to know, or it is a work of fertile imagination by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> the New Testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when Jesus lived."

2500|$|A small {{minority}} of critics have expressed dissenting opinions. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, British film critic Tom Shone suggested that Vertigos critical re-evaluation has led to excessive praise, and argued for a more measured response.

[...] In 2007, poet and critic Dan Schneider criticized the ending of Vertigo as melodramatic and argued that a close examination of the film's plot reveals numerous implausibilities, such as Elster allowing <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> his murder plot to remain living and thus possibly reveal the plan, or the police officers at the crime scene not inspecting the tower for evidence.|$|E
