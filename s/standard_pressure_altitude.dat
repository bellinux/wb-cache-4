5000|$|In aviation, <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> is the {{indicated}} altitude when an altimeter {{is set to}} an agreed baseline pressure setting under certain circumstances where the aircraft's altimeter {{would be unable to}} give a useful readout of altitude. Examples would be landing at a very high altitude or near sea level in conditions of exceptionally high air pressure. Old altimeters were typically limited to show altitude when set between 950 mbar and 1030 mbar. [...] "Standard" [...] pressure, the baseline used universally, is 1013.25 hPa, equivalent to 1013.25 mbar or 29.92 inHg (inches of mercury).

The performance tests covered a range of ventilating-air flows from 500 to 3185 pounds per hour, combustion-air pressure drops from 5 to 35 inches of water, and <b>pressure</b> <b>altitudes</b> from sea level to 41, 000 feet. The operational characteristics investigated were the combustion-air flows for sustained combustion and for consistent ignition covering fuel-air ratios ranging from 0. 033 to 0. 10 and <b>pressure</b> <b>altitudes</b> from sea level to 45, 000 feet. Rated heat output of 50, 000 Btu per hour was obtained at <b>pressure</b> <b>altitudes</b> up to 27, 000 feet for ventilating-air flows greater than 800 pounds per hour; rated output was not obtained at ventilating-air flow below 800 pounds per hour at any altitude.

The minimum combustion-air flow for sustained combustion at a <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 25, 000 feet was about 9 pounds per hour for fuel-air ratios between 0. 037 and 0. 099 and at a <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 45, 000 feet increased to 18 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 099 and 55 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 036.

The data are high-resolution spectra in the O 2 A band (759 – 771 nm) of sunlight reflected from the sea surface, measured by a grating spectrograph directed toward sunglint from a research aircraft. It is shown {{that in the first}} approximation the reflected radiance is a function of just one variable, the adjusted air mass, defined in terms of geometrical factors, surface <b>pressure,</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of the aircraft, and an estimate of the mean temperature of the lower atmosphere.

Since surface pressure varies slowly, whereas the <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of the aircraft is under experimental control, most of the results apply to retrieval of <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude.</b> The principal difficulty in accurate retrievals of pressure lies in modeling the scattered component of the radiance since this quantity is sensitive to aerosol and thin cloud whose properties often are poorly known. It is shown that low-resolution spectra allow the <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> to be tracked with high precision (0. 1 %), but the absolute accuracy is low (2 %) because from low-resolution spectra {{it is not possible to}} determine whether scattered radiance is a significant fraction of the total radiance.

40|$|A sensor fusion {{method was}} {{developed}} for vertical channel stabilization by fusing inertial measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> measurements from a barometric altimeter integrated in the same device (baro-IMU). An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimated the quaternion from the sensor frame to the navigation frame; the sensed specific force was rotated into the navigation frame and compensated for gravity, yielding the vertical linear acceleration; finally, a complementary filter driven by the vertical linear acceleration and the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> produced estimates of height and vertical velocity. A method was also developed to condition the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> using a whitening filter, which helped to remove the short-term correlation due to environment-dependent pressure changes from raw <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude.</b> The sensor fusion method was implemented to work on-line using data from a wireless baro-IMU and tested for the capability of tracking low-frequency small-amplitude vertical human-like motions that can be critical for stand-alone inertial sensor measurements. Validation tests were performed in different experimental conditions, namely no motion, free-fall motion, forced circular motion and squatting. Accurate on-line tracking of height and vertical velocity was achieved, giving confidence {{to the use of}} the sensor fusion method for tracking typical vertical human motions: velocity Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was in the range 0. 04 - 0. 24 m/s; height RMSE was in the range 5 - 68 cm, with statistically significant performance gains when the whitening filter was used by the sensor fusion method to track relatively high-frequency vertical motions...|$|R
