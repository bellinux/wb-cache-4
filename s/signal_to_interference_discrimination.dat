We used three different control algorithms:Power (gain) maximization algorithm, Cost algorithm and <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>interference</b> ratio maximization algorithm. The importance of antennas is rapidly increasing as the communicationsystems are affecting everyone life. Moreover, smart antennas have been considered as an evolution in the world of communication systems, because smart antennas improved the quality of radiation widely. Furthermore, smart antenna is classified into switched-beam and adaptive arrayantennas. Specifically the project will deal with switched-beam smart antennas. This project is about controlling the patterns of a smart antenna (switched-beam) in order to achieve better radiation. We used three different control algorithms:Power (gain) maximization algorithm, Cost algorithm and <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>interference</b> ratio maximization algorithm. These algorithms were programmed by Matlab in order to select the best pattern. In the first algorithm (power maximization) different transmitter angles were applied. In the second algorithm (cost algorithm) different values of gain, Maximum side lobe level, transmitter angle and null depth were applied andexamined. In the third algorithm (<b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>interference</b> ratio maximization) the interferer angle was varied with fixed transmitter angle. In every single experiment there were figures representing the pattern selected by the algorithm used. A comparison has been made between the three algorithms using the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>interference</b> ratio values when applying the same transmitter and interferer angles. {{as a result of the}} comparison, the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>interference</b> ration maximization algorithm was the best algorithm...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{different}} direction based signal copy algorithms for {{a model of}} angular spread caused by local scattering around each signal source. Optimal algorithms, in terms of <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>Interference</b> and Noise ratio, are derived for both rapidly and slowly time varying angular spread and a low complexity ad-hoc algorithm is suggested. Simulations show that these algorithms outperform traditional signal copy algorithms in terms of <b>Signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>Interference</b> and Noise ratio as well as outage probability. 1. Introduction Several principles have been suggested for signal waveform estimation in sensor array processing [2, 3, 4, 7].
