60|$|When you behold {{anything}} marvellous, {{and your}} eyes {{tell you that}} you have seen some ghostly thing, don't believe them, but investigate the matter closely, and you will find it no more a phantom than the mirage or the <b>Spectre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then rejoicing that he {{had made}} up his mind, though not light-hearted enough to whistle, he walked across the moorland, through the white morning mist, curling {{on the sides of the}} hills in fantastic forms, and now and then {{catching}} his lengthened shadow, so as to make him smile by reminding him of the <b>spectre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken.</b>|$|E
60|$|But now the <b>Spectre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> is {{no longer}} an object of fear. Why? Because men have found him out, and he is nothing in the world but a shadow. When the sun is in the right position, an ordinary-sized man on a lower {{mountain}} will see a gigantic shadow of himself thrown upon a cloud beyond the Brocken, though it appears to be on the mountain itself, and it is so perfect a representation {{that it is difficult to}} believe it is only a shadow. But it can be easily proved. If the man stoops to pick up anything, down goes the spectre; if he raises his hand, so does the spectre; if he takes a step of two feet, the spectre takes one of miles; if he raises his hat, the spectre politely returns his salute.|$|E
50|$|Brocken station (Bahnhof <b>Brocken)</b> is <b>the</b> {{terminus}} on <b>the</b> summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken,</b> <b>the</b> highest {{mountain in}} the Harz in central Germany.

50|$|FM-radio and {{television}} broadcasting make major use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken.</b> <b>The</b> old television tower, <b>the</b> Sender <b>Brocken,</b> is now used as hotel and restaurant. It {{also has an}} observation deck, open to tourists.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> in <b>the</b> border zone between the GDR and FRG <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> Railway section between Schierke and Brocken station {{was closed to}} the public from 13 August 1961. Railway and station were then only used for military purposes or by the local population. After the Wende - the political changes in 1989 - <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> line was inspected and repaired, and Schierke station used for its original purpose again.|$|R
50|$|As a {{protected}} area since 1939 {{and due to}} <b>the</b> decades <b>of</b> restricted access <b>the</b> unique climate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> provided outstanding conditions. The massif is partly still covered with primary forest extremely rare in Germany. It provides perfect conditions for endangered and nearly extinct species like the Eurasian lynx, wildcats and capercaillies. <b>The</b> <b>Brocken</b> was therefore declared {{part of a national}} park in 1990.|$|R

40|$|Before {{knowing whether}} one can {{differentiate}} between <b>the</b> <b>spectre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past and <b>the</b> <b>spectre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past {{present and the}} future present, one must perhaps ask oneself whether the spectrality effect does not consist in undoing this opposition, or even this dialectic, between actual, effective presence and its other.

50|$|After German reunification <b>the</b> {{continued}} operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> Railway was initially called into question, however united efforts by railway enthusiasts and politicians under <b>the</b> overall control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then state Minister for the Economy, Horst Rehberger, helped to give <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> Railway a second chance. The German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) was also involved, because <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> Railway {{was needed to}} haul away the obsolete, military facilities on <b>the</b> <b>Brocken.</b> On 15 September 1991, after being renovated, <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> Railway was ceremoniously {{opened to the public}} with two steam-hauled trains. The trains were headed by locomotive no. 99 5903, a Mallet locomotive, which had been procured by the NWE in 1897/98, and locomotive no. 99 6001, a prototype developed in 1939 by <b>the</b> firm <b>of</b> Krupp.|$|R
50|$|By 1760 {{there was}} already a herb garden on the Heinrichshöhe and in 1761 a garden with plants from <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> was laid out at Schierke. But {{it was not until}} 1890 that <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> Garden was {{established}} by Albert Peter with <b>the</b> permission <b>of</b> Prince Otto <b>of</b> Stolberg-Wernigerode on <b>the</b> royal estate. Peter was a naturalist and head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Botanical Garden <b>of</b> Göttingen. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental garden was to research <b>the</b> adaptability <b>of</b> alpine plants to <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> a new habitat. Due to its northerly and exposed location <b>the</b> summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> (1,141 m) equated climatically to heights of about 1,700 to 1,900 m in the Swiss Alps.|$|R
500|$|Together {{with his}} wingman‚ Oberfähnrich Günter Schrey, Waldmann took off at 11:39 on 22 February 1945 from Oranienburg on an {{offensive}} counter-air mission against inbound Allied heavy bombers.

50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>spectre</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-continental empire <b>of</b> Spain passing under <b>the</b> {{effective}} control <b>of</b> Louis XIV provoked a massive coalition of powers to oppose <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Anjou's succession.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1869 {{there was a}} design for <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> a railway to <b>the</b> <b>Brocken,</b> but it was turned down. A resubmission in 1895 succeeded, however, and, on 30 May 1896, the construction permit was issued once Prince Otto of Stolberg-Wernigerode had allocated the requisite land. <b>The</b> first section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> Railway, from Drei Annen Hohne to Schierke, was opened on 20 June 1898 and construction work for the remaining section up to <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> was begun on 4 October 1898. Initially services to <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> only ran between 30 April to 15 October; during the winter trains terminated at Schierke station. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War significant damage occurred to the track, mainly through bombs and grenades, in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> fighting in <b>the</b> Harz, which had been declared a fortress. The section to <b>the</b> <b>Brocken</b> was only reopened, therefore, in 1949.|$|R

50|$|After World War II, however, {{due to its}} {{location}} next to the inner German border, Schierke {{for a long time}} was not accessible to the public for winter sports. Visits required an extra permission by East German authorities between 1952 and 1989. Several hotels were converted into public holiday resorts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stasi ministry.

25|$|Analysis {{is always}} an {{analysis}} ad infinitum and one can never reach the absolute.

As a result, Larkin enjoyed a high success rate in labour disputes until <b>the</b> Dublin Lock-out <b>of</b> 1913. <b>The</b> Sligo Dock strike of 1913 was one example of these successes.|$|R
