I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need to put a little flavor into the ring. My promoter always <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The writer Al Aronowitz, {{while working}} on a profile of Jane Fonda for The Saturday Evening Post in the 1960s, asked Henry Fonda about method acting: [...] "I can't {{articulate}} about the Method", he told me, [...] "because I never studied it. I don't mean to suggest that I have any feelings {{one way or the}} other about it...I don't know what the Method is and I don't care what the Method is. Everybody's got a method. Everybody can't articulate about their method, and I can't, if I have a method—and Jane sometimes <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> use the Method, that is, the capital letter Method, without being aware of it. Maybe I do; it doesn't matter." ...|$|E

[...] I shall {{have to give him}} the lie when he <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was offered $1500 by an agent of Coach Yost to enter Michigan. [...] I neither {{received}} an offer direct or indirect from Yost nor any agent. [...] I went to Michigan because several lawyers in my native town were graduates of that university and I always liked the place. [...] I do not regret my choice. [...] If President Jordan will talk facts rather than trash, he will change his attitude on my standing in college, so far as Michigan is concerned. [...] At Stanford I was only a special and I do not deny that my work was not of a high order. [...] At Michigan I never flunked during my entire course, and what the conditions were against me when I entered I made up by working hard in summer school. ... I owe it to Michigan and athletics in general to state definitely that I did not receive one cent in connection with athletics while I was in Michigan." ...|$|E
5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{often used}} the phrase [...] "drum major {{instinct}}," [...] meaning the instinct to be a leader. In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968 he said: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a drum major, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a drum major for justice, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a drum major for peace, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a drum major for righteousness.

2500|$|On February 19, 2015, David Corn from Mother Jones broke a story {{reporting}} {{a collection of}} inconsistencies of O'Reilly when recalling his experience covering the 1982 Falklands War. On April 17, 2013, O'Reilly said on his show: [...] "I was in a situation one time, {{in a war zone}} in Argentina, in the Falklands, (...)". In his book, The No Spin Zone, he wrote: [...] "You know that I am not easily shocked. I've reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands." [...] On a 2004 column on his website he wrote: [...] "Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash." [...] Corn claimed O'Reilly was not in the Falklands, but in Buenos Aires, and that no American journalist was in the Islands during the conflict. He also pointed out that according to O'Reilly's own book, The No Spin Zone, he arrived in Buenos Aires soon before the war ended. On February 20, 2015, O'Reilly said on his show, [...] "David Corn, a liar, <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> exaggerated situations in the Falklands War" [...] and that he never said he was on the Falkland Islands. O'Reilly went on to describe his experience in a riot in Buenos Aires the day Argentina surrendered. David Corn replied that they didn't claim O'Reilly [...] "exaggerated" [...] but rather that there were contradictions between his accounts and the factual record, and that the 2013 clip from his show proves O'Reilly did in fact say he was on the Falklands. David Corn told The New York Times: [...] "The question is whether Bill O'Reilly was stating the truth when he repeatedly said that Argentine soldiers used real bullets and fired into the crowd of civilians and many were killed." ...|$|E
