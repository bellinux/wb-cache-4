5000|$|The {{spawning}} season for skipjack shad is from early March to late April {{in the southern}} extent of its range. In the upper Mississippi river drainage spawning time is from early May to early July.

50|$|The {{redbreast sunfish}} is a fall spawner on <b>sand-gravel</b> {{substrate}} depending on location, or when water temperature reaches 16-26 °C. According to Stanley Sharp, “The mature male generally builds a nest {{in shallow water}} or may simply use the abandoned nest of another Centrarchid. The female eventually enters the nest, releases her adhesive eggs, and then leaves. The male remains to guard and fan the eggs and possibly even to guard the young for a brief period. The male and female will then {{move out of the}} shallow water after spawning and into deeper water. A male sunfish will breed with more than one female, just as female sunfish will breed with more than one male. Average clutch size for the sunfish is around 2000 depending on the age of the female. Mature ova are around 1.1 mm in diameter. Reproductive maturity is reached the second year of life. They have been known to have a maximum lifespan of around seven years for primarily males. Currently, humans do not play a large role in influencing life history due to large populations and secluded areas.|$|E
50|$|This species’ typical habitat {{has been}} {{described}} as relatively shallow, fast flowing water with fine to intermediate gravel substratum. However, broad-scale habitat use appears to vary for this mussel; and live specimens have been collected from both <b>sand-gravel</b> bars and bedrock fissures. For example, habitat use by this mussel in the Spring River and Shoal Creek differs considerably from habitat use in other Kansas rivers. In the Spring River where water currents are faster than in many other Kansas waters, the Neosho mucket occurs in high densities in the fast flow, and dominates over other freshwater mussel species; whereas in Shoal Creek and also the Oklahoma portion of the Illinois River, it has been often found in backwater areas out of the strongest currents where it is less dominant than most heterospecifics. However, the gravel beds of Shoal Creek and the Spring River are less compacted than in other Kansas streams and the availability of loose substratum to bury in may therefore be important for this mussel even where water currents are slow such as in Shoal Creek. Overall, its optimal habitat conditions appear to comprise fast water currents and plentiful loose gravel substratum; whereas low water currents with compact substratum are probably least optimal. The Neosho mucket also appears more adapted to unstable habitats than most other local unionids.|$|E

In addition, the species is nearly restricted to the Coosa River system above the Fall Line in the Alabama River drainage.The environment of the species is fresh benthopelagic water, and lives in a temperate range, 38°N-33°N. Lythrurus lirus typically prefers clear flowing creeks and/or small rivers. These waters typically have moderate gradients and bottom materials that range from <b>sand-gravel</b> to rubble-boulders. The population of this species is represented by large subpopulations and locations.

40|$|In this paper, {{beach profile}} surveys {{acquired}} {{over more than}} a decade at a sandy beach (Narrabeen Beach, New South Wales, Australia) and a composite <b>sand–gravel</b> beach (Milford-on-Sea, Christchurch Bay, UK) are analysed to compare and contrast cross-shore morphodynamics of the two beach types. The different behavioural characteristics of the two beach types at decadal, inter-annual and intra-annual time scales are investigated. Comparisons of beach profiles with Dean's equilibrium profile and Vellinga's erosion profile show that the Dean's profile satisfactorily represents the time mean profiles of both beach types. Statistical and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses confirm the generally accepted model that the inter-tidal zone is the most morphodynamically active region on a sandy beach whereas the swash zone is the most dynamic region on a mixed <b>sand–gravel</b> beach. The results also imply that during storms composite <b>sand–gravel</b> beaches may become unstable due to cutback of the upper beach while sandy beaches {{are more likely to be}} unstable as a result of beach lowering due to sediment transport from the inter-tidal zone to the sub-tidal zone during storms. EOF results also show that Milford-on-Sea beach is in a state of steady recession while the Narrabeen Beach shows a cyclic erosion–accretion variability. A multivariate technique (Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA) shows that on the composite beach a strong correlation exists between incident wave steepness and profile response, which could be attributed to the unsaturated surf zone, whereas on the sandy beach any correlation is much less evident...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 87 direct shear tests {{in a large}} direct shear-box {{apparatus}} {{have been used to}} investigate the strength and dilatancy of <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures. This paper focuses on the differences in behaviour between a silica sand (yellow Leighton Buzzard sand) and <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures obtained by adding fractions of two kinds of gravel to the sand. The purpose is to find a relation between the grain-size characteristics of the materials and the shearing resistance. Experimental results are analysed in terms of the frictional and dilatant contributions to the strength of mixtures as a function of their relative density, and are compared with dilatancy theories and empirical equations. The addition of gravel to the mixtures, even at low fractions (less than 0. 1 by volume), causes an increase in peak friction angle (φ′peak) which results both from higher dilatancy at failure (ψmax) and higher constant volume friction angle (φ′cv). Use of the minimum voids ratio (emin) of the materials allows the data for the two families of mixtures to be normalized and interpreted in terms of φ ′cv and the ratio (φ′peak -φ′cv/ψmax. The relationships between relative density (Dr), ψmax and φ′peak-φ′cv are only partly explained on a physical basis, so we develop empirical equations to predict the peak shear resistance of <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures (up to gravel contents of 0. 5) on the basis of easily measurable quantities.

40|$|If a {{partially}} mobile sediment is transported an immobile sediment layer can form below the bedforms. This immobile layer {{can cause a}} supply-limitation, i. e. the volume of mobile sediment {{on top of the}} layer available for transport becomes limited.

We studied the development of the bed stratification in a series of flume experiments with different initial <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures. In all experiments a thin immobile gravel layer developed with supply-limited bedforms on top; showing a strong similarity with the supply-limitation as observed in situations of sand transport over pre-installed flat immobile beds. Two phases were observed in the temporal development of the stratified bed: I) first a relatively quick development of dunes with gravel accumulating in the dune troughs, followed by II) a slower development of the level of the immobile gravel layer in the bed. In the final equilibrium situation the thickness and composition of the immobile layer appeared to be more or less independent of the initial <b>sand-gravel</b> mixture composition.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has indicated that variability of antecedent flows is a fundamental control on the entrainment and transport of sediment in river systems. Specifically, the low flows between successive floods appear to have a far greater influence on the stability of a river bed than previously assumed. Increased durations of low flows increase <b>sand-gravel</b> bed stability so as to delay entrainment and significantly reduce transport. Although a degree of quantification of “memory stress” effects has been attempted by previous researchers, their applied methodology precludes development of appropriate mathematical relationships implicit to correcting existing sediment transport equations. The overall aim of this thesis is therefore to address this deficiency via robust physical and mathematical modelling. In total, 84 flume experiments were carried out in a flume. Two poorly sorted (g ≥ 1. 6) <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures of unimodal and bimodal distribution were compared and contrasted for sensitivity of modality to memory effects upon bedload and entrainment threshold.

Experiments employed a stepped discharge hydrograph covering sub-threshold to fully mobile conditions.

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD-project was to gain better {{understanding}} of the sediment transport and depositional processes of <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures in rivers with subaqueous dunes. The understanding of the fundamental processes of sediment transport and deposition in channel beds is crucial for morphological models. <b>Sand-gravel</b> bed rivers have a mixture of sand and gravel in their beds, and have dunes while the coarsest sediment is near incipient motion. In this thesis, the sediment transport, sorting and deposition processes are studied with field measurements and laboratory experiments. Existing bedform stability diagrams were shown to be valid for bedforms observed in sand- gravel bed rivers and experiments, but new bedform types were identified as well: sand ribbons, barchans and bedload sheets. When the bed surface is armoured, barchans and sand ribbons are dependend on the sediment supply from upstream. This supply is often not predictable from the local hydraulics and sediment characteristics. A predictor for bedload transport of sediment mixtures was developed by extending existing deterministic bedload transport predictors to non-uniform sediment, based on flume experiments reported herein. The near-bed turbulence is modelled stochastically to obtain realistic bedload transport rates at incipient motion. The difference in mobility of small and large grains is represented by hiding-exposure functions. The transport predictor was tested on data from the river Rhine, the Netherlands during a discharge wave in 1998.

Very {{little is known about}} the effect that the large particles have on the shear strength of the soil-large particles mixtures. In this study, the influence of the large particles on the shear strength of the mixtures was evaluated experimentally and numerically. The experimental analysis used direct shear tests on simulated granular materials containing large dispersed particles as well as on real <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures. The numerical analysis used the Discrete Element Method (DEM). For the dispersed case (the large particles are not in contact), the laboratory and the DEM simulation results indicated that the shear strength of the mixtures increased with the concentration (C) of the large particles in the mixtures. The shear strength of the mixtures with dispersed oversize particles can be obtained from the following relationship: Sc = Sm (1 + αC). In this relationship, Sc is the shear strength of the mixture, Sm is the shear strength of the granular matrix without the oversize particles, C is the concentration by volume of the oversize particles, and α is a constant that varies between 0. 4 and 2. 5. For the case of the non-dispersed oversize particles (the oversize particles are in contact in the mixture), direct shear tests on <b>sand-gravel</b> mixtures indicated the shear strength of the mixtures can be obtained from the following relationship: Sc = Sm (1 + 0. 7 C + 1. 8 C 2).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to develop new measuring techniques for providing detailed data on sediment sorting suitable for <b>sand-gravel</b> laboratory experiments. Such data will be of aid in obtaining new insights on sorting mechanisms and improving prediction capabilities of morphodynamic models. Two measuring techniques have been developed. The first technique is aimed at measuring the size stratification of a <b>sand-gravel</b> deposit through combining image analysis and a sediment removal technique. The image analysis technique is based on color segmentation of areal images of a bed surface composed of colored sediment. After taking images {{a thin layer of}} sediment is removed, and a new series of images is taken of the newly exposed part of the deposit. The resulting size stratification data is characterized by a high spatial resolution. Using the technique one can avoid time consuming sieve analysis, and the data is processed using an automatic and fast image processing algorithm. The second technique is aimed at measuring the spatial and temporal changes in the bed surface texture during flow in a <b>sand-gravel</b> laboratory experiment. The above image analysis technique is used to process images of the bed surface taken during flow. A floating device, which is moved over the entire observation section, enables taking images of the bed surface. Two degradational laboratory experiments were conducted. In the first experiment the initial bed was composed of a bimodal mixture of gravel and sand and it was characterized by a stepwise downstream fining pattern and a downstream sand reach. Only the sand fraction was mobile. A static armor formed over the bimodal reach {{due to a lack of}} sediment supply and conditions of partial transport. The armoring over the bimodal upstream reach resulted in an abrupt spatial transition in mean grain size of the bed surface and in bed slope between the upstream reach and the downstream sand reach. The difference in the bed slope and so the flow depth between the two reaches led to the formation of an M 1 backwater curve over the bimodal reach. The streamwise increase of the flow depth and the associated decrease of the sediment mobility resulted in downstream fining over the upstream reach. Despite the steady water discharge the morphodynamic equilibrium state was characterized by the presence of a backwater curve. This was because partial transport conditions prevented the bimodal reach from establishing normal flow conditions. In this experiment partial transport conditions controlled the temporal changes of the considered <b>sand-gravel</b> reach. The laboratory experiment was reproduced using a numerical morphodynamic sandgravel model. The numerical model was based on the Hirano active layer model and the backwater equation. The detailed data on spatial and temporal changes of the bed surface texture measured using image analysis were of aid in calibrating the model, in particular in tuning the hiding coefficient in the sediment transport relation. We found a good agreement between measured and predicted data. In the second experiment we investigated the stability of an armor under high flow conditions. The armor was created under a low flow rate and a lack of sediment supply, using a trimodal mixture composed of sand and gravel. The increased water discharge induced a breakup of the armor, which reformed under continued peak flow conditions. The breakup occurred through the dislodgement of the coarse surface particles which then exposed the finer substrate. Consequently, the bed surface locally became finer, which allowed for some degradation. Yet quickly a new armor formed that was coarser than the initial one. The armor breakup corresponded to a sudden and local increase of the sediment transport rate that gradually decreased during armor reformation.
