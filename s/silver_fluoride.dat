40|$|Theme III: Fluoride and Health, Poster sessionOBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of four methods in preventing new active root caries. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial on institutionalized elders aged 60 - 89 years in Hong Kong. A baseline examination was conducted on elders in 21 elderly homes. Status of their tooth roots was recorded. Generally healthy institutionalized elders with at least 5 teeth with exposed sound root surfaces were randomly allocated into one of four prevention groups: Group 1 - receiving individualized oral hygiene instruction (OHI) only; Group 2 - OHI and applications of chlorhexidine varnish every 3 months; Group 3 - OHI and applications of sodium fluoride varnish every 3 months; and Group 4 - OHI and annual applications of <b>silver</b> diamine <b>fluoride</b> solution. Status of their root surfaces was assessed annually by a masked independent examiner. RESULTS: 306 elders were examined at the baseline. After three years, 203 elders (66 %) were reviewed. The mean numbers of root surfaces with new caries found at the three-year examination in Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 1. 85, 0. 69, 0. 06, and 0. 18, respectively (ANOVA, p< 0. 001). Elders receiving only OHI developed more new root caries surfaces (Scheff's multiple-comparison, p< 0. 05) than the elders in the <b>silver</b> diamine <b>fluoride</b> solution, sodium fluoride or chlorhexidine varnish groups.

Objective: Comparison of the anti-bacterial action of 3. 8 % <b>silver</b> diamine <b>fluoride</b> and 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate against Enterococcus faecalis in root canals. Materials and Methods: Forty-four single-rooted teeth were decoronated, and the root section was enlarged with peeso-reamer (No: 3) to standardize length and diameter. The samples were then autoclaved and divided into two study groups and two control groups. Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was inoculated into all test samples for 72 hours. The samples were enlarged with peeso-reamer (No: 5) after placement of respective medicament for 24 hours. Shavings were collected and inoculated on Brain Heart Infusion agar for 24 hrs to measure the colony forming units. Results: Both 3. 8 % <b>silver</b> diamine <b>fluoride</b> and 2 % chlorhexidine showed a superior capacity to sterilize the root canals than control groups.

5000|$|An [...] "anomalous" [...] ionic radius in {{a crystal}} {{is often a}} sign of {{significant}} covalent character in the bonding.

40|$|Safety {{issues related}} to the use of <b>silver</b> <b>fluoride</b> in {{paediatric}} dentistry Theo Gotjamanos, BDS, MDS, PhD, FRACDS, FFOP(RCPA) * Due to its exceedingly high fluoride content, 40 % <b>silver</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution has the potential to cause fluorosis when used in young children. In vitro testing conducted in the present investigation indi-cates that application of 40 % <b>silver</b> <b>fluoride</b> to deep carious lesions or its use as a ‘spot ’ application agent could result in 3 to 4 mg of fluoride reaching the systemic circulation.
