50|$|Invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, beetles, {{and other}} arthropods foraged from the leaf litter comprise {{most of the}} <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> robins’ diet. Invertebrate prey may be cached whole or in portions. Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 meters of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> {{have a very good}} memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation. The birds have demonstrated an ability to differentiate and prioritize caches of varying sizes, up to 12 total items, without any training, which appears to be the highest recorded numerical competency of any wild animal. Because of its high metabolic rate, a robin might spend as much as 90% of its day foraging or storing during the winter. <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> have also been observed to eat berries on occasion, however these are not cached.|$|R

50|$|<b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> {{are genetically}} monogamous, and extra-pair {{paternity}} is rare. As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, {{a male and}} female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods, however they can and will steal from their mate’s cache if given the opportunity. Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males. During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the coast}} are dense forests of rimu, miro, Hall's tōtara and rātā. The lower {{terraces}} are mainly podocarp and silver beech, while the higher terraces {{are dominated by}} yellow-silver pine.

50|$|The tomtit {{is one of}} four {{species of}} the genus Petroica found in New Zealand, the {{ancestors}} of which having colonised from Australia. The species was once thought to have been descended from the scarlet robin, although more recent research has questioned this.

5000|$|<b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> become {{sexually mature}} between six and 12 months of age. They begin their {{breeding}} season fairly early in August or September (Southern Hemisphere spring) {{and thus can}} {{make use of the}} winter's remaining food stores during this time. They build open-cup nests in tree-forks or inside tree cavities. Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again. Modal clutch size is two eggs [...] with the expected inverse correlation between size and number of eggs. Replacement clutches in the case of loss of eggs or nestlings to predation can be produced relatively rapidly, within 3-10 days.|$|R
40|$|Predation is {{the highest}} cause of {{mortality}} for birds and can place intense selection pressures on their behavioural traits. A {{number of studies have}} shown that some animals have innate predator recognition, while others which are predator-naïve have been unable to adapt to the introduction of exotic predators. For my thesis, I firstly studied how eight species of introduced and native birds respond to model predators at their nests. This enabled me to determine whether the native birds have been able to adapt to introduced mammalian predators and have developed recognition of them being a threat. In most species, the reaction to the stoat (Mustela erminea) (an introduced predator) was similar to that of a model morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae) (a native predator). This suggests these species can successfully recognise introduced mammals as a risk. It also allowed me to test whether recently introduced birds have any innate recognition of snakes, which are a significant nest predator in their native ranges but do not exist in New Zealand. I found that introduced birds did not appear to have any recognition of snakes as being a threat. These losses and gains of recognition may have been caused by evolutionary changes or they may be influenced by learning and experience. Secondly, I examined how <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> (Petroica australis) on a predator-free island responded to predator models and compared this to the responses of robins on the mainland (where they co-occur with mammalian predators). The island birds were assumed to show the ancestral reactions to mammalian predators, while any differences in response shown by the mainland robins would indicate they had acquired these behaviours in response to increased predation risk. I found that the <b>island</b> <b>robins</b> did not appear to recognise or react to a taxidermic mount of a stoat while mainland robins did respond to the stoat, confirming that at least some native birds can develop recognition of novel predators. Finally, I compared the personalities of <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> on a predator-free island and on the mainland (where mammalian predators are present). I tested where individuals placed on the ‘bold-shy’ continuum by observing their willingness and speed to approach a risky situation in order to collect food. Studies have shown that average personality between populations can differ where predation risk differs. I found that the <b>island</b> <b>robins</b> were on average bolder than mainland robins. They came nearer to the observer and were faster to approach and remove a food item, while mainland robins were less likely to approach, and those that did approach took a longer time. It is likely that these differences were due to selection pressures by mammalian predators favouring shy individuals on the mainland while other pressures such as interspecific competition favours bold individuals on the island. Personality {{has been shown to be}} genetic and heritable, however, learning and experience cannot be ruled out and may also play a part in influencing how personality is expressed. Together, my results support the importance of historical and ontogenetic factors in influencing how predator recognition and personality traits are expressed...|$|R
40|$|For {{conservation}} purposes {{islands are}} considered safe refuges for many species, particularly in regions where introduced predators form {{a major threat}} to the native fauna, but island populations are also known to possess low levels of genetic diversity. The New Zealand archipelago provides an ideal system to compare genetic diversity of large mainland populations where introduced predators are common, to that of smaller offshore islands, which serve as predator-free refuges. We assessed microsatellite variation in <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> (Petroica australis australis), and compared large mainland, small mainland, natural island and translocated island populations. Large mainland populations exhibited more polymorphic loci and higher number of alleles than small mainland and natural island populations. Genetic variation did not differ between natural and translocated island populations, even though one of the translocated populations was established with five individuals. Hatching failure was recorded in a subset of the populations and found to be significantly higher in translocated populations than in a large mainland population. Significant population differentiation was largely based on heterogeneity in allele frequencies (including fixation of alleles), as few unique alleles were observed. This study shows that large mainland populations retain higher levels of genetic diversity than natural and translocated island populations. It highlights the importance of protecting these mainland populations and using them as a source for new translocations. In the future, these populations may become extremely valuable for species conservation if existing island populations become adversely affected by low levels of genetic variation and do not persist. ...|$|R
50|$|The black robin or Chatham Island robin (Petroica traversi) is an {{endangered}} bird from the Chatham Islands off {{the east coast}} of New Zealand. It is closely related to the <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> (P. australis). It was first described by Walter Buller in 1872. Unlike its mainland counterparts, its flight capacity is somewhat reduced. Evolution in the absence of mammalian predators made it vulnerable to introduced species such as cats and rats, and it became extinct on the main island of the Chatham group before 1871, being restricted to Little Mangere Island thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> (Petroica australis), is a sparrow-sized bird {{found only}} in New Zealand, where it has {{the status of a}} {{protected}} endemic species. The birds are sparsely distributed through the South Island and Stewart Island/Rakiura, although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (P. australis rakiura) are the two subspecies. The species is closely related to the North Island robin (formerly P. australis longipes, now considered a distinct species [...] ), and also to the extremely rare black robin (P. traversi) of the Chatham Islands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> has two subspecies: P. australis australis, the {{nominate}} form, and P. australis rakiura, the Stewart Island robin.

40|$|The {{field of}} avian {{chemical}} ecology {{is very much}} in its infancy, but there has undoubtedly been a surge of interest in recent times for the study of odour in birds – it has even recently been termed “the New Black of avian communication”. I sought to add to the field by carrying out a study on various aspects of the origin, development and function of odours in island birds. I first explored the ontogeny of preen wax production {{and the development of a}} chemical signal in nestlings of 5 native and introduced species of New Zealand birds. I did not find significant differences in the start of preen wax production in native vs. introduced species, mainly due to the highly distinctive preen wax development pattern shown by the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). However, I did discover that nestlings modify the composition of their preen wax over the course of the nestling phase, and the compositional change follows different trajectories in native and introduced species. Multivariate analysis of the preen wax profiles revealed significant variation at all levels examined (status, species and nest). This is consistent with the hypothesis that different evolutionary histories are reflected in the preen wax profiles of birds, and this is discernible from a very early age. I next examined the effect of diet on the chemical profile of a generalist bird widespread in the South Pacific, the silverye Zosterops lateralis. Diet is often cited as a possible confounding effect in studies comparing composition of chemical signals between sexes, seasons, breeding and developmental stages, and among different species, but the effect of diet on chemical profiles has rarely been tested directly. I used a supplemental feeding experiment with tallow fat but this change in diet did not affect preen wax composition in silvereyes, and there was no change in preen wax composition among sampling periods. This supports the hypothesis that preen wax composition in silvereyes is determined by endogenous mechanisms and is not affected by day to day variation in diet. I then explored the differences in chemical profiles of “inbred” vs. “hybrid” <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> Petroica australis, living sympatrically on Motuara Island, where an experimental genetic rescue translocation was carried out in 2008. This setup allowed me to investigate the influence of inbreeding and geographic origin on the chemical profiles of a native New Zealand species, without facing confounding effects derived from the birds living in different habitats. I detected a significant effect of status (“inbred” vs. “hybrid”) on chord-transformed chemical profiles, but found no correlation between chemical profiles and heterozygosity, or between chemical and genetic distances. These results suggest that <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robins</b> preen wax could encode a geographic signal rather than a heterozygosity signal. Finally, I present the results of a broad comparative study that I undertook in collaboration with Aude Thierry, comparing chemical profiles of a number of passerine species across the South Pacific which are phylogenetically related but have very different evolutionary histories, having either evolved in Australia, under pressure from a number of olfactory-searching predators, or on islands were such predators were absent (New Zealand and New Caledonia). We found that island birds showed a significant loss of complexity in the non-volatile components but a significant increase in the diversity of compounds in the volatile part of their wax profile. This suggests birds on islands produce preen waxes, and thus odours, that are likely to be more conspicuous than those of continental species. This is concordant with our expectation, given what we know of their evolutionary history with regards to coexistence with predators, and points to the possibility that some form of “olfactory crypsis” is at work in the continental Australian birds, but is not present – or has been lost – in island birds. Overall, my study confirms that the current interest in avian chemical communication is well warranted as there appears to be a wealth of information encoded in avian chemical signals, and we are only just starting to explore and understand the biological relevance of it, both at the intra- and inter- specific level. This could have repercussions on conservation strategies and in general practices of bird handling, and will allow us to gain an understanding of a communication system that, if ubiquitous across the animal world, has thus far been overlooked in the avian class...|$|R

Numerous invertebrate prey is taken, including cicadas, earthworms, wetas, snails, and spiders. Fruit is also taken. North Island robins cache food supplies for later when prey is plentiful, although males cache more food than females do.

50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> {{is listed}} as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List.

Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several {{attempts have been made to}} translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see above. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonizing individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed. Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.|$|E

The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly colored breast patch. However, North Island males are almost black with a white spot just above the beak as well as the grayish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are grayer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. South Island males are dark gray except for the distinct yellowish white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter gray with a less distinct breast.

50|$|The North Island robin (Petroica longipes) is {{a species}} of Australasian robin endemic to the North Island of New Zealand.

Populations have been reestablished in Karori Wildlife Sanctuary and Moehau in the Coromandel Peninsula. A remnant population is also reestablishing itself in the Ohope Scenic Reserve in the Bay of Plenty. 40 birds have also been translocated from Mokoia Island, Lake Rotorua, to the Ohope Scenic Reserve to assist in the re-establishment of the species.

50|$|Although {{it is now}} infrequent, {{individual}} aerial 1080 operations can still sometimes affect local bird populations if not carried out with sufficient care. In New Zealand, individuals from 19 species of native birds and 13 species of introduced birds have been found dead after aerial 1080 drops. Most of these recorded bird deaths were associated with only four operations in the 1970s that used poor-quality carrot baits with many small fragments. On the other hand, many native New Zealand bird populations have been successfully protected by reducing predator numbers through aerial 1080 operations. Blue duck, New Zealand pigeon, kiwi, New Zealand kaka, New Zealand falcon, tomtit, <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin,</b> North Island robin, New Zealand parakeets (kākāriki), and yellowhead (mōhua) have all responded well to pest control programmes using aerial 1080 operations, with increased chick and adult survival, and increases in population size.

50|$|Historically it {{inhabited}} much of lowland New Zealand's South Island, but its distribution {{has become}} much more patchy in the last century due to habitat loss and introduced predation. The <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> has fared slightly better than the Stewart Island robin. There are two populations on the east coast of the Stewart Island, and slightly more common in the north and west. However, the Stewart Island robin has been relegated to 3 subpopulations, all of which are in Leptospermum swamp scrubland - although this is not their preferred habitat, it is less heavily populated by mammalian predators. Total population was lower than 500 individuals at one point. A programme of translocation to predator-free islands (such as Ulva Island, Motuara Island, and Nukuwaiata Island) has since been instituted that has been relatively successful at establishing new populations (around 600 individuals on Motuara alone). On the South Island, P. australis has a strong affinity for Douglas fir plantations rather than native forests (kanuka trees) or Monterey pine plantations, apparently due to forest structure rather than strict food availability or viable nesting sites, as the species prefers structurally simple forests with dense, even canopies, and ground covered with leaf litter. When the population was introduced to Ulva Island, nesting was positively correlated with presence of broad-leaved coastal vegetation.|$|E
40|$|The Chatham Island black robin, Petroica traversi, is {{a highly}} inbred, {{endangered}} passerine with extremely low levels of variation at hypervariable neutral DNA markers. In this study we investigated variation in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes in both the black robin and its nonendangered relative, the <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> Petroica australis australis. Previous {{studies have shown that}} Petroica have at least four expressed class II B MHC genes. In this study, the sequences of introns flanking exon 2 of these loci were characterized to design primers for peptide-binding region (PBR) sequence analysis. Intron sequences were comprised of varying numbers of repeated units, with highly conserved regions immediately flanking exon 2. Polymerase chain reaction primers designed to this region amplified three or four sequences per black robin individual, and eight to 14 sequences per <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> individual.

Loss of variation at MHC loci may increase extinction risk in endangered species, due to an inability to combat a range of pathogens. In this thesis, the evolution of class II B MHC genes is investigated, and levels of variation at these loci are measured in two species of New Zealand robin, the endangered Chatham Island black robin (Petroica traversi), and the non-endangered <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> (Petroica australis australis). Transcribed class II B MHC loci from both black robin and <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> were characterised prior to analysis of MHC variation. To this end, a non-lethal protocol for isolation of transcribed sequences from blood using 3 'RACE and RT-PCR was developed. Four class II B cDNA sequences were isolated from black robin, and eight sequences were isolated from the <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin,</b> indicating {{there are at least}} four class II B loci. RFLP analysis indicated that all class II MHC loci were contained in a single linkage group. Analysis of 3 'untranslated region sequences enabled orthologous loci to be identified in the two species, and indicated that multiple rounds of gene duplication have occurred. A partial genomic DNA sequence of a putative pseudogene was also isolated from the black robin. Evolution of MHC genes in New Zealand robins appears to be influenced by gene conversion and balancing selection, resulting in loss of orthologous relationships in the coding region, and a highly diverse peptide-binding region. In order to assess the effect of population bottlenecks on MHC variation, levels of variation in the extant black robin population, which is descended from a single breeding pair, were compared with artificially bottlenecked populations of <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> and their respective source populations. Both RFLP and sequence analysis indicated that the black robin is monomorphic at class II B loci, while both source and bottlenecked populations of <b>South</b> <b>Island</b> <b>robin</b> have retained moderate to high levels of variation.
