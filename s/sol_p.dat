According to <b>Sol</b> <b>P.</b> Elias, member of the first graduating class of Modesto High School students, R.S. Holway was [...] "a young schoolmaster... with the advantage of a charming character and a sympathetic mind... zeal and personality... (who) guided the pupils almost through the entire course until his departure... to accept a professorship at the University of California." [...] This man, MHS' first principal, was responsible for the education of the entire student body, playing a role of both teacher and administrator before he left to teach in the UC system. Forty pupils comprised the first class organized at the first building located at 14th and I Streets; after four years, ten of these students remained {{to take part in the}} first graduation of MHS students. In the succeeding years, the number of seniors receiving diplomas fluctuated greatly; the lowest number occurred in 1893 when no one remained in school all four years to graduate.|$|E

40|$|In 1998, two upper North Bosque River {{segments}} {{were designated}} as impaired {{due to the}} nonpoint source (NPS) pollution of phosphorus (P) to these segments in the watershed. As a result, two Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) were applied which called for the reduction of annual loading and annual average soluble reactive P (<b>Sol</b> <b>P)</b> concentrations by 50 %. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of two prospective new technologies, an Electrocoagulation (EC) system, and a Geotube???? dewatering system to potentially aid the dairy farmers in meeting the goals set by the TMDLs. The EC system analyzed in this study used chemical pretreatment to coagulate and separate solids in effluent pumped from the dairy lagoon; the liquid then flowed over charged iron electrodes giving off ions that cause coagulation and precipitation of P and other metals. Overall, the performance of the system was consistently highly effective in reducing total phosphorus (TP) and <b>Sol</b> <b>P,</b> on average, reducing these constituents by 96 % and 99. 6 % respectively from the dairy lagoon effluent. However this consistency did not hold {{for the rest of the}} analytes. In the Geotube???? dewatering system geotextile tubes were utilized to dewater dairy lagoon effluent. Results showed this system performed very well in filtering solids from the dairy lagoon effluent, removing an average of 93. 5 % of the total solids between the two pumping and dewatering events of March and April. It was effective in removing nutrients and metals as well. The average percent reduction of TP and <b>Sol</b> <b>P</b> for the two events were very high at 97 % and 85 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|SOL 1, the {{founding}} member of the S. cerevisiae SOL family, was previously identified as a multi-copy suppressor of the los 1 defect in tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression. Here we report that the four-member SOL family is not essential and that individual family members appear to have distinct functions. SOL 1 –SOL 4 are homologous to genes encoding 6 -phosphogluconolactonase (6 Pgl) involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. Both <b>Sol</b> 3 <b>p</b> and <b>Sol</b> 4 <b>p</b> affect this activity. However, <b>Sol</b> 4 <b>p</b> does not act as a los 1 multi-copy suppressor.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of elevated buffer capacity [~ 32 mM HCO 3 -] through administration of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) on maximally stimulated isolated mouse soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles undergoing cyclical length changes at 37 C. The elevated buffering capacity was of an equivalent level to that achieved in humans with acute oral supplementation. We evaluated the acute effects of elevated [HCO 3 -] on (1) maximal acute power output (PO) and (2) time to fatigue to 60 % of maximum control PO (TLIM 60), the level of decline in muscle PO observed in humans undertaking similar exercise, using the work loop technique. Acute PO was on average 7. 0 ± 4. 8 % greater for NaHCO 3 -treated EDL muscles (P < 0. 001; ES = 2. 0) and 3. 6 ± 1. 8 % greater for NaHCO 3 -treated SOL muscles (P < 0. 001; ES = 2. 3) compared to CON. Increases in PO were likely due to greater force production throughout shortening. The acute effects of NaHCO 3 on EDL were significantly greater (P < 0. 001; ES = 0. 9) than on SOL. Treatment of EDL (P = 0. 22; ES = 0. 6) and <b>SOL</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 19; ES = 0. 9) with NaHCO 3 did not alter the pattern of fatigue. Although significant differences were not observed in whole group data, the fatigability of muscle performance was variable, suggesting that there might be inter-individual differences in response to NaHCO 3 supplementation. These results present the best indication to date that NaHCO 3 has direct peripheral effects on mammalian skeletal muscle resulting in increased acute power output...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE We have {{previously}} reported that cycling muscle recruitment is less skilled in triathletes than cyclists with similar cycling training loads. This {{study investigated the}} relationship between muscle recruitment and cadence in triathletes, which may provide further evidence of less skilled movement control. METHODS: Participants were eight elite triathletes. Comparisons were made with data from our earlier study of nine elite and ten novice cyclists. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made using indwelling electrodes from tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and soleus (SOL). Cycling at individual preferred cadence (PC), 55 – 60, 75 – 80 and 90 – 95 rpm were investigated in random order. Cycling trials were conducted on each participant 2 ̆ 7 s bike secured on a magnetic trainer. Cycling intensity was controlled using ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). RESULTS The increase in cadence from 57. 5 to 92. 5 rpm {{was associated with a}} decrease in modulation of muscle activity (i. e. longer bursts of activity and a higher level of activity between main bursts) in triathletes for TA, <b>SOL</b> (<b>p</b> 0. 56). Coactivation increased with cadence in triathletes in proportion to increased duration of primary muscle activity, as it did in novice cyclists. Peak EMG amplitude increased with cadence in triathletes and was not minimized at PC (p = 0. 21), which is consistent with our findings in novice and elite cyclists. Times of peak EMG activity and variability of muscle recruitment were not influenced by cadence in any group (p > 0. 32). CONCLUSION PC is not related to peak EMG amplitude in triathletes, which is consistent with our findings in novice and elite cyclists. Less modulation of muscle activity and greater muscle coactivation with increased in cadence in triathletes is considered as further evidence of less skilled control of the movement relative to cyclists with similar cycling training loads...|$|E

The pro-inflammatory peptide C 5 a was increased 4. 8 -fold (P = 0. 04) in CF sols compared with controls. Incubation of CF <b>sols</b> with <b>P.</b> aeruginosa or S. aureus increased C 5 a concentration 2. 3 -fold (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 In {{this study}} sleep hygiene {{practices}} and perceived and somnographic sleep indicators were analyzed for 92 women with insomnia and 29 women with no insomnia ages 40 to 55. Women recorded practices and perceptions in diaries during 6 days of polysomnographic sleep monitoring. Self-reported practices included smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, drinking caffeine, and exercising. Optimal sleep hygiene practices include abstaining from tobacco and alcohol or caffeine intake while getting regular exercise {{and maintaining a}} regular schedule for sleeping. Perceptions included sleep onset latency, awakenings, restfulness after sleeping, and sleep quality. Somnographic measures included bedtime, latency to Stages 1 and 2, Stage 0, and getting up time. Regular bedtimes and regular getting up times were defined as less than 30 minutes variation day to day. Women in both groups reported similar practices except for differences in alcohol and caffeine intake. More women with insomnia (52 %) than without insomnia (31 %) abstained from alcohol each day (95 % CI =. 01,. 41). Less than 10 % in both groups reported drinking alcohol everyday. More than 80 % in both groups reported drinking one or more servings of caffeine per day, but women with insomnia averaged one less serving of caffeine per day than women without insomnia (p $<$. 05). Few women in either group reported smoking ($<$ 10 %). Less than 25 % reported 30 minutes of exercise each day, although about one-half of each group reported exercising an average of 30 minutes per day. Very few women had regular bedtimes ($<$ 5 %) or regular getting up times ($<$ 10 %) for all five days assessed. Women with insomnia showed less variation in day to day sleep hygiene practices, but greater variation in sleep perceptions as measured by mean standard deviations. Women with insomnia showed significantly smaller variations in alcohol intake (p =. 05) and bedtimes (p =. 02) and greater variations in reported <b>SOL</b> (<b>p</b> =. 005) and sleep quality (p =. 002) than women without insomnia. Regression analyses showed that combinations of sleep hygiene practices explained small amounts of the variances in sleep indicators. In summary, sleep hygiene practices were similar between women with and without insomnia except for caffeine and alcohol. Women with insomnia showed less variation in sleep hygiene practices, but greater variation in sleep perceptions compared to women with quality sleep...|$|E

40|$|Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{is based}} upon the {{phenomenon}} of water diffusion known as "Brownian motion. " DTI can detect changes in compressed spinal cord earlier than magnetic resonance imaging and is more sensitive to subtle pathological changes of the spinal cord. DTI observation in compressed and noncompressed spinal cord in tuberculosis (TB) spine is not described. This study presents observations in Pott′s spine patients with or without neural deficit. Materials and Methods: Thirty consecutive cases of TB spine with mean age of 32. 1 years of either sexes with paradiscal lesion, with/without paraplegia divided into two groups: Group A: (n = 15) without paraplegia and group B: (n = 15) with paraplegia were evaluated by DTI. The average fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were calculated at 3 different sites, above the lesion (SOL) /normal, at the lesion and below SOL for both groups and mean was compared. Visual impression of tractography was done to document changes in spinal tracts. Results: The mean canal encroachment in group A was 39. 60 % and group B 44. 4 % (insignificant). Group A mean FA values above SOL, at the lesion and below SOL were 0. 608 ± 0. 09, 0. 554 ± 0. 14, and 0. 501 ± 0. 16 respectively. For group B mean FA values above SOL, at the lesion and below SOL were 0. 628 ± 0. 09, 0. 614 ± 0. 12 and 0. 487 ± 0. 15 respectively. There was a significant difference in mean FA above the SOL as compared to the mean FA at and below <b>SOL.</b> <b>P</b> value above versus below the SOL was statistically significant for both groups (0. 04), but P value for at versus below the SOL (0. 01) was statistically significant only in group B. On tractography, disruption of fiber tract at SOL was found in 14 / 15 (93. 3 %) cases of group A and 14 / 15 cases (93. 3 %) of group B (6 / 6 grade 4, 3 / 3 grade 3 and 5 / 6 grade 2 paraplegic cases). Conclusion: The FA and MD above the lesion were same as reported for healthy volunteer hence can be taken as control. FA increases, and MD decreases at SOL in severe grade of paraplegia because of epidural collection while in milder grade, both decrease. In group A (without neurological deficit), mean FA and MD in patients with and without canal encroachment was similar. On tractography, both groups A and B (with or without neurological deficit) showed disruption of fiber tract at SOL and thickness of distally traced spinal cord was appreciably less than the upper cord.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Limiting {{factors for}} {{long-term}} cold preservation of isolated skeletal muscles are increased intracellular calcium levels, {{the occurrence of}} hypercontraction, and the overproduction of oxygen free radicals. In the present study, we investigated whether muscle preservation during cold storage could be improved by additives that can protect against such processes or by oxygen supply. METHODS: The soleus (SOL) and a strip of the cutaneus trunci muscle (CT) from the rat were isolated and stored for 16 hr at 4 degrees C in Bretschneider's Histidine Tryptophane Ketoglutarate (HTK) and subsequently acclimatized in Krebs-Henseleit solution for 90 min at room temperature. The protective effects of 2, 3 -butanedione monoxime (BDM; reduces intracellular calcium release and inhibits fiber contraction) and of the following antioxidants were investigated: N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN), trolox, desferal, and deferione. The antioxidants and BDM were added to both HTK and Krebs-Henseleit solution. Dose-response curves were made {{for each of the}} additives (n> or = 4 for each dose). To evaluate the effect of oxygen supply, HTK was aerated with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2. Muscle function (P 0), energy metabolism (ATP), and cytoarchitecture were analyzed. The measured values were compared with those of fresh unstored muscles (% of control) and with those of muscles stored in HTK without any additive (multivariate analysis of variance, P< 0. 05). RESULTS: We found a significant protection of the contractile function (P 0) of both muscles after the addition of 1 mM of trolox (SOL: 46 % of control; CT: 53 %) and after the addition of 3 mM or 0. 3 mM of deferione to the SOL and CT, respectively (P 0 for both muscles: 55 %), whereas no protection was found with PBN (0. 03 - 1 mM) and Desferal (0. 001 - 1 mM). The addition of BDM (10 or 30 mM) resulted in the highest increase of P 0 (84 % and 60 % for the SOL and CT, respectively). The combinations BDM-trolox and BDM-deferione did not further improve the preservation of the SOL function, but P 0 values (88 % and 91 % of control, respectively) were not different from those found for control muscles. Oxygenation of HTK was only beneficial for the <b>SOL</b> (<b>P</b> 0 : 83 %). The improved preservation of muscle function was accompanied by a reduction of the twitch threshold current, increased by storage, suggesting a protective effect of the intervention on the preservation of the muscle cell membrane integrity.

As Matas de Galeria perfazem cerca de 5 % do bioma Cerrado, que é um hotspot de biodiversidade, ou seja, possui alta diversidade biológica sob alto grau de ameaça. Essa fitofisionomia destaca-se como o ambiente mais diverso deste bioma, representando aproximadamente 30 % de suas espécies arbóreas. A conservação desta fitofisionomia ameaçada pela crescente fragmentação de {{habitats}} faz-se imprescindível para a manutenção de sua estrutura. O objetivo deste estudo foi caracterizar a biometria e morfologia de sementes e plântulas de espécies lenhosas de Mata de Galeria do bioma Cerrado, classificar a ecologia morfofuncional dos seus cotilédones além de avaliar as qualidades germinativas sob diferentes condições de luz e temperatura no laboratório, e o desenvolvimento inicial no viveiro. Para tanto, foram realizadas análises descritivas dos dados biométricos de 100 frutos e 100 sementes e a caracterização de 20 sementes e 10 plântulas e plantas jovens de cada uma das espécies. Foram testadas as germinações a 25 °C e 30 °C, no claro e no escuro, de sementes de seis espécies de Mata de Galeria, em cinco repetições de 20 sementes para cada tratamento. O desenvolvimento foi avaliado à pleno sol e sob sombrite de 50 %, através das variáveis como altura, diâmetro do coleto, comprimento da raiz e massa seca das diferentes partes da plântula de 10 plântulas de cada espécie, em cada tratamento. Os propágulos de Mata de Galeria pesquisados apresentaram variação das suas características biométricas. Nas sementes e nos frutos as variáveis que mais se dispersaram foram massa e número de sementes por fruto (para os frutos). Os morfotipos representados foram: Matayba guianensis - CHR, Miconia cuspidata - FHF, Myrcia splendens - FEF, Platypodium elegans - CHR, Qualea dichotoma - FEF, e Vochysia tucanorum - FEF. As espécies apresentaram, em geral, bons percentuais de germinabilidade. Para a repartição da biomassa seca, duas espécies responderam significativamente melhor a pleno sol (M. guianensis e P. elegans), uma sem diferença significativa (M. splendens) e as outras três não puderam ser comparadas.

This vegetation type is the most diverse in tree species in this biome, representing 30 % of the total. The conservation of this vegetation type is threatened by increasing habitat fragmentation making it vital to maintain its structure. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the morphology and biometry of seeds and seedlings of gallery forest woody species of the cerrado biome, classify the functional morphology of their cotyledones and evaluate its germination under different conditions of light and temperature in the laboratory, and early seedling growth in the nursery. Descriptive analyzes of biometric data of 100 fruits and 100 seeds were undertaken for each species, as well as the characterization of 20 seeds and early development of 10 seedlings. Germination tests were undertaken at 25 °C and 30 °C, both under light and dark conditions, with five replicates of 20 seeds for each treatment. The early seedling development was tested under full sunlight and 50 % shading, and for each treatment their height, diameter, root length and dry weight of 10 seedlings of each species was undertaken. Variation was found in biometric data, particularly in weight and number of seeds per fruit. The morphotypes found were: Matayba guianensis - CHR, Miconia cuspidata - FHF, Myrcia splendens - FEF, Platypodium elegans - CHR, Qualea dichotoma - FEF, e Vochysia tucanorum - FEF.

Significant environmental factors that affect the structure and function of these systems {{are expected to be}} sensitive parameters of global climate change and contribute {{to our understanding of the}} implications that such changes may have in the area under study. The present study area—the Sundarbans, is an interesting ecosystem for studying such changes. Planktoniella Schutt is essentially a warm water diatom reported from tropical waters of marine and estuarine systems (Hasle and Syvertsen 1997; Romero et al. 2002; Balkis 2008; Romero et al. 2009; Biswas et al. 2010; Manna et al. 2010; Mukherjee et al. 2013), with some sporadic records of Planktoniella sol from Atlantic waters in the Norwegian Sea along the Norwegian west coast (Hasle and Syvertsen 1997). Nevertheless, Round (1981) considered the species <b>P.</b> <b>sol</b> to be a true tropical element and also suggested that it may have greater temperature tolerance compared to most tropical species (Round 1973). The genus has generally not been reported as bloom forming algae and accounted relative abundance (%) varies between 0.07  ±  0.121 and 1.317  ±  1.929 in case of <b>P.</b> <b>sol</b> and between 0.989  ±  2.039 and 1.33  ±  1.066 in case of Planktoniella blanda in the Indian Sundarbans (Biswas et al. 2010), though report of <b>P.</b> <b>sol</b> being part of bloom forming event (Rajasekar et al. 2010) or as a dominant component in ‘milky sea’ samples (Lapota et al. 1988) are infrequently found. Yearlong presence of the species has not been reported, instead it appears being to be present seasonally (Manna et al. 2010). The genus finds mention in a number of publications as being part of the diet composition of fish (Indira et al. 2013; Priyadharsini et al. 2014), crab (Nakhodai et al. 2013) and zooplankton (Schnetzer and Steinberg 2002), emphasising its value in the aquatic trophic system.|$|R
30|$|The genus is characterised by the {{presence}} of organic extrusions from the girdle which are of different morphological types. This renders identification of the species difficult after the normal frustules cleaning procedures, which removes organic material during acid cleaning and mounting, leading to misidentification of the genus as Thallassiosira spp. (Hasle and Syvertsen 1997). Two species—P. <b>sol</b> and <b>P.</b> blanda find ephemeral mention in enumeration lists of different publications from the Indian Sundarbans (Manna et al. 2010; Biswas et al. 2010; Mukherjee et al. 2013). Although, in these records, neither species was described adequately to confirm their identification and presence in the estuarine system of Indian Sundarbans. The present work gives attention to the morphometry and taxonomy of the two species along with an analysis of the changing ecological dynamics in terms of seasonal data as well as an analysis of their temporal factsheets obtained as secondary data.|$|R
40|$|The {{widely held}} {{hypothesis}} that enlarged brains have evolved as an adaptation {{to cope with}} novel or altered environmental conditions lacks firm empirical support. Here, we test this hypothesis for a major animal group (birds) by examining whether large-brained species show higher survival than small-brained species when introduced to nonnative locations. Using a global database documenting the outcome of > 600 introduction events, we confirm that avian species with larger brains, relative to their body mass, {{tend to be more}} successful at establishing themselves in novel environments. Moreover, we provide evidence that larger brains help birds respond to novel conditions by enhancing their innovation propensity rather than indirectly through noncognitive mechanisms. These findings provide strong evidence for the hypothesis that enlarged brains function, and hence may have evolved, to deal with changes in the environment.

The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study is to analyze the prognostic impact of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score in patients undergoing liver transplantation (OLT) with suboptimal livers. Methods. Between January 2002 and January 2006, 160 adult patients with liver cirrhosis received a whole liver for primary OLT at our institution including 81 with a suboptimal liver (SOL group) versus 79 with an optimal liver (group OL). The definition of suboptimal liver was: one major criterion (age > 60 years, steatosis > 20 %) or at least two minor criteria: sodium > 155 mEq/L, Intensive Care Unit stay > 7 days, dopamine > 10 mu g/kg/min, abnormal liver tests, and relevant hemodynamic instability. Results. Baseline recipients characteristics were comparable in the two study groups. The SOL group had a significantly greater number of early graft deaths (17, respectively (P > 05).

A study {{was carried out}} {{on the effect of}} sputum sol (obtained by rapid centrifugation of purulent sputum) from 20 patients with chronic bronchial sepsis on the beating of human nasal cilia in vitro by a photometric technique. Thirteen <b>sols</b> caused significant (<b>p</b> less than 0. 001) ciliary slowing. Two patterns of slowing were observed: firstly, a gradual onset associated with epithelial disruption (inhibited by alpha 1 antiprotease) and, secondly, an immediate onset associated with ciliary dyskinesia and ciliostasis (inhibited by chloroform extraction). The ciliary slowing activity of sputum sols was associated with the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0. 01). It is concluded that purulent sputum contains at least two factors that impair ciliary beating [...] one a serine protease, which is probably a product released by the host's phagocytic defences, and the other, which is chloroform extractable and probably a bacterial product...|$|R

40|$|Mortality in Pinus sp. in Sardinia - in particular, P. radiata D. Don - was {{investigated}} between 1976 and 1978. Preliminary studies had revealed {{an association between}} Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. (the causal agent of charcoal root rot disease) with affected plants. The disease occurred on plants of different ages in 24 of the main P. radiata plantantions and nurseries. In every case, the presence of M. pllaseolina was confirmed. The disease varied in spread and severity from rather low to very high values. It was also recorded on P. pinea L., P. halepensis Mill., P. patula Schl. et Cham., <b>P.</b> pinaster <b>Sol.</b> and <b>P.</b> nigra Arn. ssp. Laricio (Poir.) Palabin Coste. The occurrence of infection, the symptomatological progress of thc disease and microscopic characteristics of affected tissues wcrc invcstigntcd both {{in the field and}} in the laboratory. Data concerning the incidence of disease - which first became serious in 1975, showed a low value in 1976 and 1977 and increased again in 1978 - were obtained by field obscrvation and trials in experimental plots. Several strains of Macrophomina phaseolina were isolated from affectcd plants. They were very similar morphologically and in their tempe· rature responses. Regarding microsc 1 erotia size, thcsc strains can bc included in Haigh's «C-type ». Environmental factors favouring the development of the disease were investigated. Analysis revealed that the occurrence of disease in the field can be attributed both to affected plants having come from nurseries and to direct infection due to presence of Cistus monspeliensis in the planting arca. Seeds of other Pinus species were disease-free. Some planting systems appear to favour the development of the disease in certain climatic conditions.

40|$|Cyclosporin-A (CsA) is an {{immunosuppressive}} drug {{that acts as}} an inhibitor of calcineurin, a calcium phosphatase that has been suggested {{to play a role}} in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of CsA administration (25 mg kg- 1 day- 1) on skeletal muscle mass and phenotype during disuse and recovery. Male Wistar rats received vehicle (N = 8) or CsA (N = 8) during hind limb immobilization (N = 8) and recovery (N = 8). Muscle weight (dry/wet) and cross-sectional area were evaluated to verify the effect of CsA treatment on muscle mass. Muscle phenotype was assessed by histochemistry of myosin ATPase. CsA administration during immobilization and recovery did not change muscle/body weight ratio in the soleus (SOL) or plantaris (PL). Regarding muscle phenotype, we observed a consistent slow-to-fast shift in all experimental groups (immobilized only, receiving CsA only, and immobilized receiving CsA) as compared to control in both <b>SOL</b> and PL (<b>P</b> < 0. 05). During recovery, no difference was observed in SOL or PL fiber type composition between the experimental recovered group and recovered group receiving CsA compared to their respective controls. Considering the muscle/body weight ratio, CsA administration does not maximize muscle mass loss induced by immobilization. Our results also indicate that CsA fails to block skeletal muscle regrowth after disuse. The present data suggest that calcineurin inhibition by CsA modulates muscle phenotype rather than muscle mass...|$|R
