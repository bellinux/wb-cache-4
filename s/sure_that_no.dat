5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|The umpire is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches play along the line of scrimmage to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E

25|$|Having {{made his}} way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her.

25|$|To {{protect the}} rights and {{well-being}} of research participants, {{and at the same}} time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or Institutional Review Board. This group examines the proposed research to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.|$|E

It's also revealed that Grif was a minion of Arthur, and in order to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one finds out his plans, Arthur convinces the squire to drink a vial of Agrabah Doom Viper poison. Grif does just that and disappears.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who had to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while being careful not to suggest sins that perhaps the faithful had not thought of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E

500|$|Halo 2s soundtrack was {{composed}} primarily by Martin O'Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori, {{the team that}} had composed the critically acclaimed music of Halo.
