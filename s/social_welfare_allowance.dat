40|$|Characteristics {{of places}} where people live can affect their mental health. Although {{there is a growing}} body of {{research}} into the relationship between neighbourhood context and mental health, evidence is still insufficient. Furthermore, there are limited studies conducted in non-Western settings. The aim of this thesis was to investigate neighbourhood-level factors influencing mental health in Hong Kong by conducting three studies. The first study examined the geographic patterning, socioeconomic correlates, and inequalities of suicide in Hong Kong. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate smoothed standardised mortality ratios for suicide (2005 - 2010) in small geographic units and their associations with a range of area socioeconomic characteristics. The “city centre” of Hong Kong, a generally non-deprived area, showed low suicide rates. However, there were high rates concentrating in some socioeconomically deprived, densely populated areas. Areas in the most deprived quintile had a suicide rate more than two times higher than the least deprived. Suicide rates were associated with indicators of socioeconomic deprivation and social fragmentation. In the second study, data from a population-based survey was used to investigate the association of individuals’ subjective well-being (measured by life satisfaction) individual-, household- and neighbourhood-level characteristics and any evidence for cross-level interactions. Multilevel models were used for analyses. Neighbourhood-level characteristics accounted for a small but significant proportion (around 5 % or less) of the variance of life satisfaction. The area poverty rate and three neighbourhood factors (deprivation, social fragmentation, and ageing) had negative effects. There was evidence for cross-level interactions – the negative impact of neighbourhood poverty and social fragmentation appeared to be attenuated amongst households receiving <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>allowance</b> and living in public housing. The third study investigated the relationship between the two mental health outcomes examined in the first two studies, i. e. suicide and subjective well-being. The association between regional suicide rates and mean scores of life satisfaction and happiness was assessed using Pearson correlation. There was a very strong inverse association of suicide rate with local levels of both life satisfaction (r = - 0. 84) and happiness (r =- 0. 83). The association was markedly attenuated after controlling for area socioeconomic characteristics; this, in parallel to findings from the first two studies, demonstrated the neighbourhood effects on mental health. This thesis provides new evidence for the effects of neighbourhood socioeconomic context on suicide risk and subjective well-being in Hong Kong. The findings have implications for suicide prevention strategies and policies aimed at improving population well-being by focusing on disadvantaged and disconnected neighbourhoods. published_or_final_versionSocial Work and Social AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{revise the}} food-based dietary {{guidelines}} for Ireland {{and assess the}} affordability of healthy eating. DESIGN: An iterative process was used to develop 4 d food intake patterns (n 22) until average intakes met a range of nutrient and energy goals (at moderate and sedentary activity levels) that represented the variable nutritional requirements of all in the population aged 5 years and older. Dietary guidelines were formulated describing the amounts and types of foods that made up these intake patterns. Foods required for healthy eating by typical households in Ireland were priced and affordability assessed {{as a proportion of}} relevant weekly <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>allowances.</b> SETTING: Government agency/community. SUBJECTS: General population aged 5 + years. RESULTS: Food patterns developed achieved energy and nutrient goals with the exception of dietary fibre (inadequate for adults with energy requirements < 9 · 2 MJ) and vitamin D (inadequate for everyone). A new food group to guide on fats/oils intake was developed. Servings within the Bread, Cereal and Potato group were sub-categorized on the basis of energy content. Recommendations on numbers of servings from each food group were developed to guide on energy and nutrient requirements. Healthy eating is least affordable for families with children who are dependent on <b>social</b> <b>welfare.</b> CONCLUSION: Daily supplementation with vitamin D is recommended. Wholemeal breads and cereals are recommended as the best source of energy and fibre. Low-fat dairy products and reduced-fat unsaturated spreads are prioritized to achieve saturated fat and energy goals. Interventions are required to ensure that healthy eating is affordable.

The features of Okamura’s <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> theory may be summarized as follows: (1) a critical collaboration between “legislated” and “voluntary” models of <b>social</b> <b>welfare,</b> (2) a “unique <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> perspective” grounded in the “basic requirements of social life” and “subjective aspects of social relations”, and (3) the principles of assistance that are derived from this “unique <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> perspective. ” To further the development of Okamura’s <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> theory, the following questions arise. Does <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> develop irrevocably along a single track? Can the basic requirements of social life still have any validity today? Is the assistance derived from his unique <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> perspective effective in actual practice? What sort of challenges to social structures could render such assistance effective? By corroborating such challenges {{with a focus on}} the ordinary people’s perspectives, {{it will be possible to}} facilitate the further development and expansion of Okamura’s <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> theory. 本論では、岡村重夫の『社会福祉原論』（ 1983 年）をテキストとし、「社会福祉固有の視点」にもとづく岡村社会福祉論の論理構造を検討し、発展的検討に向けた課題の一端を明らかにした。岡村の社会福祉論の特徴は、（１）「法律による社会福祉」と「自発的な社会福祉」との批判的協力関係、（２）「社会生活の基本的要求」と「社会関係の主体的側面」に基づく「社会福祉固有の視点」、（３）「社会福祉固有の視点」から導き出される援助の原理、という３点にまとめることができる。岡村社会福祉論の更なる展開のために以下のような課題が引き出される。社会福祉は後戻りすることなく単線的に発展するのか。社会生活の基本的要求は今日においても妥当性を持ちうるのか。社会福祉固有の視点から導き出される援助は実際に有効なのだろうか。そうした援助を有効なものとしうる社会構造上の課題とはいかなるものなのか。生活当事者の視点を中心に据えた検証作業によって、岡村社会福祉論の発展は可能となる...|$|R

In the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> sector, the White Paper for <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> of 1997 was adopted as <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> policy for South Africa. The White Paper for <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> is embedded in a developmental approach and charted a new path for <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in the promotion of national social development. Developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> is a pro poor strategy which strives to promote a welfare system that facilitates the development of human capacity and self-reliance within a caring and enabling socio-economic environment. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the progress of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery towards a developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> approach in the Vhembe district, Limpopo. A qualitative research approach was used for this study and the research design was an instrumental case study. The sample for the study was selected purposively and included 28 social workers and four supervisors from four sub-districts in the Vhembe district. Data was collected through four focus group interviews with social workers and one-on-one interviews with the supervisors. Research findings indicate that developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery in this district has progressed in terms of protective services to families and children. However, in terms of poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods, the social service sector still lags behind. The overall conclusion is that the progress of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery towards the developmental approach is slow and unsatisfactory. The recommendations of this study are captured in strategies that social workers could use to promote progress in developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery, strategies suggested for supervisors to promote progress in developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery, and lastly strategies on the creation of an enabling environment.
