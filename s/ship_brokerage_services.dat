40|$|Ongoing {{trends in}} the {{shipping}} industry have placed mid-sized dry bulk <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> firms in dire straits. For one thing, the market share is divided to a reduced number of <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> firms, in respect of mergers and acquisi-tions (M&A) and, for another thing, the considerable transparency due to the information flow has brought the antagonism a few quarters of a second away. Limited literature and studies exist in relation to this modern matter in the European shipping industry which this thesis makes an effort to cover with a qualitative study. In order for the investigation {{to have a more}} repre-sentative result, the investigation involves interviews of <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> firms that are situated in the UK, Greece, and Sweden. In addition, since the main trends and obstacles are related to M&A and considerable flow of informa-tion, the investigation has adopted an angle towards business intelligence and information technology as well as change management. The outcome of this thesis is several critical success factors that could be applied on the dry bulk <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> sector. These critical success factors are related to Kotter’s change management theory and Kelly’s network economy theory together with Bullen & Rockart’s perspective...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of capitated {{transportation}} <b>brokerage</b> <b>services</b> on Medicaid beneficiaries' access to care and expenditures. Data Sources/Study Setting. The study period from 1996 to 1999 corresponds to the period of a natural experiment during which Georgia and Kentucky implemented transportation <b>brokerage</b> <b>services.</b> Effects were estimated for asthmatic children and diabetic adults. Study Design. We used difference-in-differences models to assess the effects of transportation <b>brokerage</b> <b>services</b> on access to care, measured by Medicaid expenditures and health services use. The study design is strengthened by the staggered implementation dates between states and within each state. Principal Findings. For asthmatic children, transportation <b>brokerage</b> <b>services</b> increased nonemergency transportation expenditures and the likelihood of using any services; reductions in monthly expenditures more than offsetting the increased transportation costs. For diabetic adults, nonemergency transportation costs decreased despite increased monthly use of health services; average monthly medical expenditures and the likelihood of hospital admission for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition (ACSC) also decreased. Conclusions. The shift to transportation <b>brokerage</b> <b>services</b> improved access to care among Medicaid beneficiaries and decreased the expenditures. The increase in access combined with reduced hospitalizations for asthmatic children and ACSC admissions for diabetic adults are suggestive of improvements in health outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the functioning of}} the market for <b>brokerage</b> <b>services</b> for residential real estate. The central issue addressed is whether the manner in which <b>brokerage</b> <b>services</b> have traditionally been provided and priced is consistent with efficiency. In approaching this question, the paper first describes the activities usually associated with the brokerage function and develops criteria for the efficient provision of <b>brokerage</b> <b>services.</b> After the structural characterisitcs and pricing practices of the brokerage industry are analyzed, a model of brokerage firm competition is developed. The principal finding is that the traditional absence of price competition among brokers may have led to an inefficiently large commitment of resources to the brokerage industry, supported by excessive rates for consumers of <b>brokerage</b> <b>services.</b> These results stem from the way that competitive pressures emerge when price competition is largely suppressed.
