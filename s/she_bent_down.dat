60|$|Her {{expression}} {{had become}} uneasy. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> towards him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{and kissed}} my brow, while Anscombe took my hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> over Anne, and gayly {{patted her}} on the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Nanina's hands {{dropped on}} the priest's knees. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>down</b> on them, and began to weep bitterly.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a little}} pause. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>down</b> over the {{clusters}} she was grouping. [...] "Is the light of Campobello particularly good on such questions?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} he stood there looking at her intently, and neither of them spoke. Then Netta raised {{her eyes from the}} ground for a second's flash; and Cyril's glance caught hers one instant before <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> them <b>down</b> again in haste to play nervously with the mangled daisy. [...] "Netta," [...] he said, the name thrilling through his very marrow as he uttered it, [...] "Netta, I love you." ...|$|R
60|$|The lady avoided his eye. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and {{inspected}} the left pedal.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and {{out toward}} the light, trying to {{decipher}} the writing.|$|E
60|$|He {{took her}} hand and looked up at her. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and kissed him.|$|E
60|$|Poor Adela! {{what was}} she to say or do. Her hand {{absolutely}} trembled {{as she put it}} lightly to the instrument. Thrice <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>down</b> before she was able to say anything, and thrice she lifted it up in despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{should like}} Mr. Pendennis {{to have it}} this instant, Mr. Luce, please," [...] said the young lady--and her veil dropped over her face as <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>down,</b> and clasped her hands {{together}} for a moment, {{as if she was}} praying.|$|R
60|$|Evelyn {{had slipped}} round {{the group of}} women while Grahame was trying to avoid one of them, and she was now in front of Gomez, who was hurrying along the passage. The man was close to her when <b>she</b> stopped and <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> with a warning cry.|$|R
60|$|She made no answer, {{at least}} in words. Only <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{and kissed him on}} the lips.|$|E
60|$|And, like a {{rustling}} {{cloud of}} silks and satins and perfumes, <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{and kissed the}} baby, and swept from the apartment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor little soul," [...] she murmured, {{lifting a}} loose curl of {{hair from the}} child's tear-stained face. Then <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and kissed the flushed cheek on the pillow.|$|E
60|$|Then they {{plunged into}} the reeds and were obliged to stop talking, since they must walk in single file. Presently Benita {{looked up and saw}} that she was under the thorn which grew in the cleft of the rock. Also, with some trouble she found the bunch of reeds that <b>she</b> had <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> to mark the {{inconspicuous}} hole through which she had crept, and by it her lantern. It seemed weeks since she had left it there.|$|R
60|$|She {{stretched}} {{out her hand}} lazily, and drew towards her a wonderful gold purse set with emeralds. Carefully opening it, she drew from the interior a small flat pocketbook, also of gold, with a great uncut emerald set into its centre. This, too, she opened, and drew out several sheets of foreign note-paper pinned together at the top. These she glanced through until {{she came to the}} third or fourth. Then <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> it <b>down</b> and passed it across the table to Laverick.|$|R
60|$|Freedom and {{the sight}} of the world had if {{possible}} brightened and invigorated her. Her costume and bearing were subtly touched by the romance of the Adriatic. There was a flavour of the pirate in the cloak about her shoulders and the light knitted cap of scarlet she had stuck upon her head. She surveyed his preoccupation for a moment, glanced forward, and then covered his eyes with her hands. In almost the same movement <b>she</b> had <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and nipped the tip of his ear between her teeth.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to kiss him. [...] "Thou knewst it, Friedel, and {{now must}} thou aid me to remain thy father's true widow, {{and to keep}} Ebbo from being violent." ...|$|E
60|$|The rays of {{the moon}} faded slowly from {{the level of the}} little cave, and John's face grew dark to her darkening sight. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and kissed him once--twice--thrice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you must}} not die! Oh, {{you must not}}!' she said. And on an impulse <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and whispered some words to him, {{blushing}} as she had blushed in her maiden days.|$|E
60|$|But the lady's whole frame seemed shaken. <b>She</b> sat <b>down,</b> <b>bent</b> {{her head}} to her knee, and wept aloud. Nothing could console her till the inward storm had had its way. At last the agony {{subsided}} of itself.|$|R
60|$|I spoke {{those words}} in as comforting a manner as I could. The truth is, I hadn't {{the heart to}} irritate the girl by another of my smart replies. I had only noticed her temper at first. I noticed her wretchedness now--and wretchedness is not uncommonly insolent, you will find, in humble life. My answer melted Limping Lucy. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>down,</b> {{and laid it on}} the top of her crutch.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. The {{beautiful}} lady, who {{at first}} had seemed to hesitate whether or no she should advance to Florence, held her to her breast, and pressed the hand with which she clasped her, close about her waist, as if to reassure her and comfort her. Not one word passed the lady's lips. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>down</b> over Florence, and she {{kissed her on the}} cheek, but she said no word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better than it was, thank you, my dear," [...] he said, {{in a soft}} weak tone: then, as <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to {{kiss his}} brow; [...] "you must {{take care of the}} little ones." ...|$|E
60|$|In answer <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{with all}} that {{gentleness}} and grace that was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead. Long after she had disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Allan," [...] she said, {{giving me}} {{her hand and}} a look from her eyes that I trusted was not seen. Then, under pretence of {{arranging}} the kaross which was over me, <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and whispered swiftly: ...|$|E
2500|$|Rajiv Gandhi's last {{public meeting}} was on 21 May 1991, at Sriperumbudur, a village {{approximately}} [...] from Madras, {{where he was}} assassinated while campaigning for the Sriperumbudur Lok Sabha Congress candidate. At 10:10pm, a woman later identified as Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, approached Gandhi in public and greeted him. <b>She</b> then <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to touch his feet and detonated a belt laden with [...] of RDX explosives tucked under her dress. The explosion killed Gandhi, Rajaratnam, and at least 25 other people. The assassination was captured by a 21-year-old local photographer, whose camera and film were found at the site. The cameraman, named Haribabu, died in the blast but the camera remained intact. Gandhi's mutilated body was airlifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi for post-mortem, reconstruction and embalming.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He had {{hated her}} {{throughout}} that second pursuit, and had longed for retaliation on her. He now counterfeited her signature to an instrument, leaving {{all she had}} to leave, to her daughter--ten years old then--to whom the property passed absolutely, and appointing himself the daughter's Guardian. When He slid it under the pillow of the bed on which <b>she</b> lay, He <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> in the deaf ear of Death, and whispered: [...] "Mistress Pride, I have determined a long time that, dead or alive, you must make me compensation in Money.' ...|$|R
50|$|Rajiv Gandhi was {{campaigning for}} the {{upcoming}} elections. On 21 May, after successfully campaigning in Visakhapatnam, his next stop was Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. About two hours after arriving in Madras (now Chennai), Rajiv Gandhi was driven by motorcade in a white Ambassador car to Sriperumbudur, stopping along the way at a few other election campaigning venues. When he reached a campaign rally in Sriperumbudur, {{he got out of}} his car and began to walk towards the dais where he would deliver a speech. Along the way, he was garlanded by many well-wishers, Congress party workers and school children. At 22:21 the assassin, Dhanu, approached and greeted him. <b>She</b> then <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> to touch his feet and detonated an RDX explosive-laden belt tucked below her dress. Gandhi, his assassin and 14 others were killed in the explosion that followed. The assassination was caught on film by a local photographer, whose camera and film was found at the site though the photographer also died in the blast.|$|R
60|$|She {{smoothed}} {{his hair}} {{as a mother}} does to an afflicted child; the motherly instinct was up in arms now, even fighting the womanly, the passionate instinct of a less selfless love. <b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> and kissed his forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Next?' I insisted, and {{struggled}} gently with her hand, pulling up her fingers {{with all my}} childish strength, and as she yielded and the page came over <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't talk such nonsense, child, but go on {{with what}} you were {{speaking}} about," [...] rejoined Susan, with a smile, to conceal which <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> {{her head as she}} plied her needle briskly on one of Emma's mountain-torn dresses.|$|E
60|$|So shallow is {{the wide}} stream {{in the village}} that a little girl of about seven came down from a cottage, and to cool her feet waded out into the middle, and there she stood for some minutes on a low flat stone, looking down on her own {{wavering}} image broken by a hundred hurrying wavelets and ripples. This small maidie, holding up her short, shabby frock with her wee hands, her bright brown hair falling over her face as <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>down</b> and laughed to see her bare little legs and their flickering reflection beneath, made a pretty picture. Like the wagtails, she looked in harmony with her surroundings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{question}} {{if you will}} refuse to see him again," [...] said Grace, dryly, as with eyes askance <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> a sapling <b>down.</b> [...] "But I am not incensed against you as you are against me," [...] she added, abandoning the tree to its natural perpendicular. [...] "Before I came I had been despising you for wanton cruelty; now I only pity you for misplaced affection. When Edgar {{has gone out of}} the house in hope of seeing you, at seasonable hours and unseasonable; when I have found him riding miles and miles across the country at midnight, and risking his life, and getting covered with mud, {{to get a glimpse of}} you, I have called him a foolish man--the plaything of a finished coquette. I thought that what was getting to be a tragedy to me was a comedy to you. But now I see that tragedy lies on YOUR side of the situation no less than on MINE, and more; that if I have felt trouble at my position, you have felt anguish at yours; that if I have had disappointments, you have had despairs. Heaven may fortify me--God help you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{they took}} a sad {{farewell}} of each other, and the Princess stuck the rag {{in front of her}} dress, mounted her horse, and set forth on the journey to her bridegroom's kingdom. After they had ridden for about an hour the Princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to her waiting-maid: [...] "Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder stream: I would like a drink." [...] "If you're thirsty," [...] said the maid, [...] "dismount yourself, and lie down by the water and drink; I don't mean to be your servant any longer." [...] The Princess was so thirsty that <b>she</b> got <b>down,</b> <b>bent</b> over the stream, and drank, for she wasn't allowed to drink out of the golden goblet. As she drank she murmured: [...] "Oh! heaven, what am I to do?" [...] and the three drops of blood replied: ...|$|R
