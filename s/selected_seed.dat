6000|$|When we {{have with}} {{difficulty}} made our selection from the divine redundancy of the ideal world, and {{so far as we}} could have reduced ourselves to the penury of a sole possession, why do not we turn our eyes to the example of Nature in not only bringing forth a hundred or a thousand fold of the kind of seed planted, but in accompanying its growth with that of an endless variety of other plants, all coming to bear in a like profusion? Observe that wise husbandwoman (this is not the contradiction in terms it seems), how when her business is apparently a hay harvest, she mingles myriads of daisies and milkweed and wild carrot and redtop with the grass, and lets her fancy riot all round the meadow in a broidery of blackberries and asters and dogroses and goldenrod. She never works without playing; and she plays even while man is working--plays so graciously and winningly that it takes the heart with joy. Who has ever looked upon an old-world wheat-field, where poppies and vetches are frolicking among the ears, and begrudged Nature her pastime? No one, we will venture, but the owner of the field, who is perhaps also too much of a philosopher to grieve over it. In the ideal world it is much the same. There, too, art having chosen a kind brings it to bear with all the other kinds which have been lurking in the unconscious soil of the mind and only waiting tilth for any purpose before springing up in company with the <b>selected</b> <b>seed.</b> This is what makes the poets and novelists and dramatists so much more profitable reading than the moralists. From whom, indeed, has the vital wisdom of the race been garnered? Not from those hard, ethical masters who have sought to narrow culture to the business of growing precepts, but from the genial teachers who have inculcated amusement and breathed into the unwary mind some inspiration which escaped as unconsciously from themselves. Which philosopher or sage of them all has instructed mankind a hundredth part as much as Shakespeare, who supposed himself to be merely providing diversion for the patrons of the Globe Theatre? ...|$|E

30|$|C. How to <b>select</b> <b>seed</b> {{from the}} pool? Fuzzers {{repeatedly}} <b>select</b> <b>seed</b> from seed pool to mutate {{at the beginning}} of a new round test in the main fuzzing loop. How to <b>select</b> <b>seed</b> from the pool is another important open problem in fuzzing. Previous work has prove that good seed selection strategy could significantly improve the fuzzing efficiency and help find more bugs, faster (Rawat et al. 2017; Böhme et al. 2017, 2017; Wang et al. 2017). With good seed selection strategies, fuzzers could (1) prioritize seeds which are more helpful, including covering more code and be more likely to trigger vulnerabilities, (2) reduce the waste of repeatedly execution of paths and save computing resource, (3) optimally <b>select</b> <b>seeds</b> that cover deeper and more vulnerable code and help identifying hidden vulnerabilities faster. AFL prefers smaller and faster testcases to pursue a fast testing speed.|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in the 1960s, Arnold Arboretum propagator Al Fordham {{created a}} seed {{herbarium}} in the Dana Greenhouse. Collecting {{the seed of}} several hundred rare and unusual taxa, Fordham envisioned a unique resource for the identification and propagation of woody plants from around the world. Carrying forward Fordham’s vision, Arboretum greenhouse staff continued to collect seed, and today maintain a seed herbarium of more than 2,000 samples, {{almost a third of}} which are from accessioned plants in the living collection. The SHIP team installed an on-location archival image library, which holds digital seed herbarium images. Each folder is alphabetically maintained including prints of the actual color photographs of the digital electronic files. SHIP has taken care to produce photographs on archival paper, filed them into acid-free, gov-spec folders to withstand consistent observation, and developed a nondestructive way to observe and diagnose seed identity. [...] "On occasion, seed of rare and endangered species need immediate propagation, limiting our opportunities for studying physical characteristics. With digital imaging now an important protocol at the greenhouse, <b>selected</b> <b>seed</b> will go directly to the SHIP lab for documentation, preserving the integrity of the propagule in digital format. As such, even seed that requires immediate propagation will leave behind a visual record for future study"—Julie McIntosh Shapiro.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- We {{propose a}} {{technique}} of <b>selecting</b> <b>seeds</b> for the LFSR-based test pattern generators {{that are used}} in VLSI BISTs. By setting the computed seed as an initial value, target fault coverage, for example 100 %, can be accomplished with minimum test length. We can also maximize fault coverage for a given test length. Our method can be used for both test-per-clock and test-per-scan BISTs. The procedure is based on vector representations over (2) m GF, where m is the number of LFSR stages. The results indicate that test lengths derived through <b>selected</b> <b>seeds</b> are about sixty percent shorter than those derived by conventionally <b>selected</b> <b>seeds</b> for a given fault coverage. We also show that seeds obtained through this technique accomplish higher fault coverage than the conventional selection procedure. In terms of the c 7552 benchmark, taking a test-per-scan architecture with a 20 -bit LFSR as an example, the number of undetected faults can be decreased from 304 to 227 for 10, 000 LFSR patterns using our proposed technique. 1...|$|R

30|$|Next, neigd_s that {{represent}} all indegree nodes of <b>selected</b> <b>seed</b> sed from its immediate indegree neighborhood till farthest nodes by d_s hops. In other words, its like creating an ego network for seed sed through its immediate indegree neighborhood till nodes connected to that seed by indegree across d_s hops. The {{same thing is}} applied for neigd_I. Then Selected-neighborhood, {{that represent}} all nodes that are candidate to be selected as seed set S, is selected from the last <b>selected</b> <b>seed</b> denoted by taking the difference of neighborhood of seed that is farthest D-hops away minus node neighborhood of seed sed that is farthest one hops away based on indegree centrality (Lines 9 – 13).|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of <b>selected</b> <b>seed</b> sed has no more than {{immediate}} neighbors, the algorithm pick another seed set sed from graph data and proceeds as previously to take the difference of neighborhood selected neighborhood that are farthest D hops minus all immediate neighbors and select candidate seed that may be selected as seed set by matching Selected_neighborhood with graph nodes to select node with the highest score ratio (Lines 14 – 20). Then, the algorithm select as seed set all nodes SeedK that has the highest score value and select one <b>selected</b> <b>seed</b> that surpasses the selection threshold value, then exclude the <b>selected</b> <b>seed</b> from graph data (Lines 21 – 27). If no condition is not successful to select the seed set, select from graph data the seed set sed with the highest score value and then exclude it from graph data and finally return the seed set S (Lines 28 – 33). The algorithm run once for each K= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 from (Lines 3 – 8) and run till getting K seed set from Lines 9 – 33. This could be justified that the algorithm at each tenth of seed size K, it needs to select the most central node with highest score value and then proceeds by executing the remaining of procedure based on multi-hops distance, radius-neighborhood degree and selection threshold value.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Optimizing seed {{selection}} {{is an important}} problem in read mapping. The number of non-overlapping <b>seeds</b> a mapper <b>selects</b> determines {{the sensitivity of the}} mapper while the total frequency of all <b>selected</b> <b>seeds</b> determines the speed of the mapper. Modern seed-and-extend mappers usually <b>select</b> <b>seeds</b> with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible placement scheme, both of which limit the potential of the mapper to <b>select</b> less frequent <b>seeds</b> to speed up the mapping process. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a new algorithm that can adjust both the individual seed length and the seed placement, as well as derive less frequent seeds. Results: We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming algorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an L-bp read in O(x × L) operations on average and in O(x × L 2) operations in the worst case. We compared OSS against four state-of-the-art seed selection schemes and observed that OSS provides a 3 -fold reduction of average seed frequency over the best previous seed selection optimizations...|$|R

40|$|Seed {{management}} {{carried out}} by The State Forests National Forest Holding {{is an integral part}} of rational forest management. Seed collection takes place mainly from stands belonging to first category of forest reproductive material, which is the largest seed base in Poland. In smaller amount, seeds are collected in selective objects of highest forest reproductive material category (<b>selected</b> <b>seed</b> stands, seed orchards). The previous estimation methods of seed crop were based on visual assessment of cones in the stands for their harvest. Following the rules of FRM transfer is additional difficulty of rational seed management which limits the possibility of the use of planting material in Poland. Statements concerning forecast of seed crop and monitoring of seed quality is based on annual reports from the State Forest Service. Forest Research Institute is responsible for preparing and publishing above-mentioned statements. A small extent of its automatization and optimization is a large disadvantage of this procedure. In order to make this process more effective web-based GIS application was designed.
