5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod <b>stray</b> (or did <b>stray,</b> before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to analyze an autobiographical novel Wild by Cheryl <b>Strayed.</b> The novel tells about Strayed’s life story in her self-discovery process {{by doing a}} journey cross over the Pasific Crest Trail alone. <b>Strayed</b> became a destructive one, after her mother passed away. The aim of this thesis is to know the characteristic of <b>Strayed,</b> and to see how <b>Strayed</b> shows her existence to find her truly identity. In this thesis, the researcher uses descriptive qualitative method. And uses new criticism theory to describe the characterization of <b>Strayed,</b> and Soren Kierkegaard’s existentialism theory to describe Strayed’s existence stage by stage. The result of the study shows that <b>Strayed</b> has found her inner peace and herself as she used to be. <b>Strayed</b> also has been back into her own self as she is...|$|R

5|$|Lemmons {{was full}} of impossibly glamorous older people and a core commune of writers, {{painters}} and inventors; even the dogs and cats shared a communal basket, and there were always <b>stray</b> writers and publishers whose marriages were unravelling.

5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They also felt that the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not <b>stray</b> far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman naval {{presence}} at Beirut was completely annihilated, removing the only Turkish naval threat to Italian transports {{in the area}} and giving the Italians complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean Sea {{for the rest of the}} war. Casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy. Both Ottoman warships were sunk, with Avnillah alone taking 58 killed and 108 wounded. In contrast the Italian ships not only took no casualties, but no direct hits from the Ottoman warships as well. The damage was not restricted to the Ottoman naval vessels present at Beirut, as the city took heavy damage as well. <b>Stray</b> shots from the cruisers decimated the city. Fires broke out as a direct result of the <b>stray</b> gunfire, destroying several banks and part of the city's customs house as well as other buildings. Combined from the fires and shelling, 66 civilians were killed in the city along with hundreds of others wounded.|$|E

5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom {{lived across the street}} from the scrapyard and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A <b>stray</b> dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died.|$|E
5|$|Cats hunt small prey, {{primarily}} {{birds and}} rodents, {{and are often}} used {{as a form of}} pest control. Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 80 million feral and <b>stray</b> cats. Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts. In the case of free-ranging pets, equipping cats with bells and not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over <b>stray</b> sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E

50|$|The {{island of}} Bali in Indonesia has been {{undergoing}} a severe outbreak of canine rabies since 2008, that has also killed about 78 humans {{as of late}} September 2010. Unlike predominantly Muslim parts of Indonesia, in Bali many dogs are kept as pets and <b>strays</b> are tolerated in residential areas. Efforts {{are under way to}} vaccinate pets and <b>strays,</b> as well as selective culling of some <b>strays,</b> to control the outbreak. As Bali is a popular tourist destination, visitors are advised to consider rabies vaccinations before going there, if they will be touching animals.|$|R

5|$|Djaoeh Dimata was {{released}} in late 1948, the first domestic feature film since Berdjoang. Despite this five-year gap, film critic Usmar Ismail writes {{that it did not}} <b>stray</b> from the formula which had been proven before the war, one which Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran notes focused on songs, beautiful scenery and romance. Roestam Sutan Palindih's Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum (Tears Flow in Citarum), which had similar themes, {{was released}} shortly after Djaoeh Dimata by the rival Tan & Wong Bros.; it proved the greater financial success. Only three domestic productions were released in 1948; the last was another SPFC production, entitled Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid), which was also directed by Andjar.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Italian {{director}} Luchino Visconti adapted Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice as Ossessione (1943), regarded both {{as one of}} {{the great}} noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism. (This was not even the first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French Le Dernier Tournant in 1939.) In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including Drunken Angel (1948), <b>Stray</b> Dog (1949), The Bad Sleep Well (1960), and High and Low (1963).|$|E
