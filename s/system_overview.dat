50|$|All {{physical}} principles {{which are}} capable {{to provide information}} about the position of an object are suitable to serve as the starting basis for a sensor function. The ambient conditions prevailing during arc welding and also the requirements which are made by fully mechanised equipments have, however, many restrictions as a consequence. Figure 1 depicts the <b>system</b> <b>overview.</b> The monitoring strategy of the sensor (process or geometry) has been chosen as the superordinate criterion, the further subdivision is orientated on the measuring principle.A further distinctive feature of sensor systems is their design. Leading sensors are, thus, marked by the fact that measuring point and joining point are not located in the same position. Here, the measuring and joining process are mainly running in sequence. For making position-relevant statements about the welding process, those systems require calibration of the relative position. If process-oriented sensors are used, the measuring point and the joining point are identical.What the measuring principles all have in common is the fact that through the evaluation of the sensor signal, geometrical information about the joint and its relative position to the measuring head is provided. The individual active principles allow different processing speed for acquiring the information.|$|E

40|$|During {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} system, {{it is critical that}} stakeholders gain insight in this system to provide adequate feedback and make well-founded design decisions. However, the behavior of systems has become more embedded in the software domain in the last decades. Models and simulations are required to make this behavior explicit. While many modeling and simulation approaches exist, a support to communicate the modeling process to a large and varied group of stakeholders is lacking. To overcome this gap, this work proposes the COMBOS-method. The COMBOS-approach supports system architects to increase a stakeholder’s understanding of the system behavior. COMBOS also supports identification of relations between different views of a system. This is achieved by the creation of interactive <b>system</b> <b>overviews</b> in an iterative process involving the relevant stakeholders. These interactive <b>system</b> <b>overviews</b> show the behavior of a system across different views. In order to evaluate the method, it has been applied in a case study. The results show that the COMBOS-method improves the explanation of system behavior, allows creative design discussions on system behavior and increases the understanding of system behavior across a wide group of stakeholders. In conclusion, the COMBOS-method is an approach that supports reasoning on system behavior during {{conceptual design}} of systems...|$|R
