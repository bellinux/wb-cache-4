6000|$|It {{must always}} be remembered that this war is a {{mechanical}} war conducted by men whose discipline renders them uninventive, who know little or nothing of mechanism, who {{are for the most}} part struggling blindly to get things back to the conditions for which they were trained, to Napoleonic conditions, with infantry and cavalry and comparatively light guns, the so-called [...] "war of manoeuvres." [...] It is like a man engaged in a desperate duel who keeps on trying to make it a game of cricket. Most of these soldiers detest every sort of mechanical device; the tanks, for example, which, used with imagination, might have given the British and French overwhelming victory on the western front, were subordinated to the usual cavalry [...] "break through" [...] idea. I am not making any particular complaint against the British and French generals in saying this. It is what must happen to any country which entrusts its welfare to soldiers. A soldier has to be a severely disciplined man, and a severely disciplined man cannot be a versatile man, and on the whole the British army has been as receptive to novelties as any. The German generals have done no better; indeed, they have not done so well as the generals of the Allies in this respect. But after the war, if the world does not organize rapidly for peace, then as resources accumulate a little, the mechanical genius will get to work on the possibilities of these ideas that have merely been sketched out in this war. We shall get big land ironclads which will smash towns. We shall get air offensives--let the experienced London reader think of an air raid going on hour after hour, day after day--that will really burn out and wreck towns, that will drive people mad by the thousand. We shall get a very complete cessation of <b>sea</b> <b>transit.</b> Even land transit may be enormously hampered by aerial attack. I doubt if any sort of social order will really be able to stand the strain of a fully worked out modern war. We have still, of course, to feel the full shock effects even of this war. Most of the combatants are going on, as sometimes men who have incurred grave wounds will still go on for a time--without feeling them. The educational, biological, social, economic punishment that has already been taken by each of the European countries is, I feel, very much greater than we yet realize. Russia, the heaviest and worst-trained combatant, has indeed shown the effects and is down and sick, but in three years' time all Europe will know far better than it does now the full price of this war. And the shock effects of the next war will have much the same relation to the shock effects of this, as the shock of breaking a finger-nail has to the shock of crushing in a body. In Russia to-day we have seen, not indeed social revolution, not the replacement of one social order by another, but disintegration. Let not national conceit blind us. Germany, France, Italy, Britain are all slipping about on that same slope down which Russia has slid. Which goes first, it is hard to guess, or whether we shall all hold out to some kind of Peace. At present the social discipline of France and Britain seems to be at least as good as that of Germany, and the morale of the Rhineland and Bavaria has probably to undergo very severe testing by systematized and steadily increasing air punishment as this year goes on. The next war--if a next war comes--will see all Germany, from end to end, vulnerable to aircraft....|$|E

40|$|The {{geographic}} and geo-economic location of EurAsEC countries gives them significant strategic potential for freight transit. EurAsEC has motorway and railway corridors running east-west and north-south, {{and a number}} of new corridors are being constructed. However, to handle such huge volumes of cargo, the region’s existing transport infrastructure must be modernised. Sea vs land: 2 : 1. Transportation of transit cargo by sea (transoceanic service) has some strong advantages, such as low delivery cost, established relationships with customers and high standards of service. This leads us to conclude that <b>sea</b> <b>transit</b> will prevail in the near future. Land transit routes offer only one competitive advantage – speed of delivery, which is two to three times faster compared with the sea routes linking East Asia with Eastern Europe. This advantage must be exploited. A considerable proportion of “time-sensitive” transit (some 16 million tonnes annually, according to the most conservative estimate) can be redirected to ITCs operated by EurAsEC. There are a number of physical and non-physical barriers to the realisation of the EurAsEC’s transit potential. Physical barriers include the poor state of motorways and railways and their related infrastructure, i. e. obsolete rolling-stock, which prevents any increase in transportation speeds and volumes; existing roads do not meet international standards; border crossing points and logistics centres have a low throughput capacity. Non-physical barriers include cumbersome permit systems, unreasonable delays in crossing borders, various charges and additional taxes imposed by regulatory and local authorities, scheduled and spot-check inspections of cargo weight, etc. The non-physical barriers are the most significant obstacles to the development of cargo transit in the region and cause serious delays in cargo delivery. Time lost does not only result in loss of money and customer trust, but also the loss of the main (in fact the only) competitive advantage land transit has over <b>sea</b> <b>transit.</b> Given their geographic position and national economic interests, Russia, Kazakhstan and their neighbours have a direct interest in the Eurasian integration process that extends beyond the boundaries of the post-Soviet space and involves the region’s most important countries. Projects implemented in certain economic sectors provide a reliable basis for regional economic integration. What begins in those key sectors eventually spreads to the institutional level. In this context, therefore, transportation must be among these priority sectors. ...|$|E
40|$|New sea {{transport}} terminals can be major people movers and main centres for various urban activities and functions, determining strong social output. The city of Palermo {{qualifies as a}} prominent research territory, due to its densely urbanized and populated waterfront areas, associated {{with a lack of}} transport infrastructures and efficient transit systems to meet the mobility demand of residents and commuters. A new waterfront arrangement can improve the city image and opens the way to new urban public transport systems by sea, like ferries and hydrofoils, {{as an alternative to the}} conventional land transit systems already affected by unavoidable congestion. Plans to link by sea different destination on the coast, should first identify and locate the several historical docking points of the city, as they will be the connections between the land transit systems and the sea.

40|$|The main {{component}} of accessibility {{in urban areas}} is {{the relation between the}} transportation network and land use. Improvements in technology have an effective role on the location of urban functions on behalf of urban transportation networks in addition to the economic and social life in the cities. In some cases, technological improvements in the transit systems demonstrate positive and beneficial solutions for the citizens. However, the increasing use of individual automobiles in the cities constitutes one of the most consequential difficulties. The number of automobile owners is stated to be an indicator of the advanced level of cities; however, when the rail or <b>sea</b> <b>transit</b> systems are insufficiently developed and/or when integration between the transit systems is lacking, the use of individual automobiles in daily urban travels escalates dramatically. Such a situation results in serious accessibility problems especially in the historical core of the cities, which are often not planned or developed for vehicular traffic. Under these circumstances, besides the intensive use of social and cultural activities, the speculative aims hasten the deterioration process of the historical districts and cause secondary effects in the form of noise, visual and aesthetic pollution. The Historic Peninsula in Istanbul Metropolitan Area is experiencing the above-mentioned challenges. This article puts forward the importance of the transportation network and its effects on the location of urban facility areas such as administration, education and health, which comprise the whole metropolitan area or national scale of facilities throughout the history in the Historic Peninsula. Finally, based on the hypothesis, the statistical evaluation methods of data collection and interval surveys, which were applied at sample urban facilities during the case study, were analyzed. Furthermore, the criteria for the interaction of transportation and location of urban facilities highlighted by the study are discussed. One of the striking implications is the existence of urban facility areas situated in the Historic Peninsula, which attract both metropolitan and national scale trips during the day. Today, in transportation and urban land use planning, the facilities are drawing high volumes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic out of the historic parts; however, in contrast, the Historic Peninsula is complicated and fully motorized. Furthermore, the limited building lot sizes, which cannot respond to the growing population, raises the issue of decentralization of urban facilities that also use service vehicular transportation today. These circumstances may cause Istanbul to lose the prestige of her historic center and increases the risk of the relocation of central urban facilities according to only highway access. In an effort to avert this situation, a “traffic-limited city” model is suggested for Istanbul in the final proposal section...|$|E
