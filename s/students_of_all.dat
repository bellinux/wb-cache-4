5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted <b>students</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> races.

5|$|The United States Academic Decathlon (USAD) is an American {{academic}} {{competition for}} high school students. The United States Academic Decathlon National Championship, first held in 1982, pits winners {{at the state level}} against each other for a national title.

The Super Quiz replaces one of the seven objective events; since 2003, it has alternated between replacing science and social science. The Academic Decathlon requires participation from <b>students</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> levels of academic ability; teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Though teams consist of nine members (three from each category), only the top two individuals from each category are counted in the final team score. Each student has the possibility of scoring up to 10,000 points, for a combined team score of 60,000.|$|E
