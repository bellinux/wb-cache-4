5|$|Court-show viewers don't {{seem to want}} moral conundrums or {{technical}} wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's <b>show</b> <b>because</b> she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate—swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.|$|E

This was the first season where the coaches did not fight each other after {{the conclusion of the}} <b>show,</b> <b>because</b> Franklin and Hughes were champions in different weight divisions. In 2007, Hughes participated as a guest coach for long-time friend and training partner, Jens Pulver during The Ultimate Fighter 5 season.|$|E
5|$|Lawless was {{attracted}} to the <b>show</b> <b>because</b> of her appreciation for its writing and after hearing the description of her role. She was prominently featured in promotional materials for Salems second season. Lawless based her performance on historical accounts of witches and her childhood love of the horror genre. She avoided portraying Ingrid as a villain to focus on making her a more complex character.|$|E

5|$|Punk made {{a special}} {{appearance}} at the ROH show Unscripted II on February 11, 2006, when the original card had to be scrapped due to Low Ki leaving ROH the week prior. In addition, most of the ROH roster contracted to TNA were pulled from the <b>show</b> <b>because</b> of a snowstorm that TNA officials thought might prevent performers from reaching a pay-per-view scheduled the next day. In the main event, Punk teamed with Bryan Danielson to defeat Jimmy Rave and Adam Pearce in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The {{links to}} The Original Series {{were seen as}} {{positive}} improvements to Star Trek: Enterprise by critics including elements such as {{the appearance of the}} Mirror Universe and the Orion slave girls. Other story arcs praised included the Augment arc with Brent Spiner and the return of the genetic supermen made famous by Ricardo Montalbán's Khan in The Original Series. Phillip Chung of AsianWeek bemoaned the loss of the <b>show,</b> <b>because</b> he felt that it had improved over time and due to the franchise's continued progressive stance in showing racial minorities outside of the normal stereotypes.|$|E
5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per <b>show.</b> <b>Because</b> of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Kàs {{score was}} to be {{composed}} by Benoit Jutras. However, he left the <b>show</b> <b>because</b> of creative differences, and the music of Kà was composed by René Dupéré, who has composed music for multiple other Cirque productions, including Mystère at Treasure Island, and Cirque's touring production of Alegría.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Winfrey {{spoke with}} {{seven of the}} Little Rock Nine and three white former classmates who tormented the group on their first day of high school in 1957 {{as well as a}} student who had befriended them. Winfrey was {{grateful}} to have the remaining members of the Little Rock Nine on her <b>show</b> <b>because</b> she credits her success to those who have contributed to the Civil Rights Movement which paved the way for people like herself.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women have been cast on the <b>show</b> <b>because</b> heterosexual men have been socialized by the media {{to think of them}} as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian men have been largely invisible in popular media. As of 2017, an Asian man has never been cast in the 25 years of the show's existence.|$|E
25|$|Previously aired {{episodes of}} Monk began airing on NBC Universal sibling network NBC April 6, 2008. NBC eyed the <b>show</b> <b>because</b> its block with Psych could be plugged into NBC's {{schedule}} intact. The shows {{were being used}} {{to increase the amount}} of scripted programming on the network as production of its own scripted programming ramped back up following the writers' strike. Ratings for the broadcast debut were well below NBC averages for the time period. The show came in third behind Big Brother 9 on CBS and Oprah's Big Give on ABC.|$|E

25|$|Davis' Toad Tunnel is a {{wildlife}} crossing that {{was constructed in}} 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on The Daily <b>Show.</b> <b>Because</b> of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped {{from one side of}} a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21inches (53cm) wide and 18inches (46cm) high.|$|E

Frank Tashlin's The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos (1937) {{features}} a Fred Allen fox screaming about being misinformed, hinting about his heated feuds with censors who were often at the last minute forcing script changes on his <b>show</b> <b>because</b> of its content.

25|$|A {{relatively}} small, but notable {{difference in}} the show format from its French counterpart is the selection process. Each week, the French version asks the public and judging panel to vote for which one, out of the contenders in danger, should be excluded from the show. The results are announced live, on stage, to the excluded member and the viewers. While this formula was followed in the beginning for Star Académie, it soon was changed because of protests, for the system was seen as cruel treatment to the excluded participant. On one early show, singer Daniel Boucher quit the studio halfway through the <b>show</b> <b>because</b> of this impression. Consequently, the public and judges are now asked {{to vote for the}} participant to remain at the Académie. In all seasons, the results are announced live.|$|E
25|$|Candide is an {{operetta}} {{with music}} composed by Leonard Bernstein, {{based on the}} 1759 novella {{of the same name}} by Voltaire. The operetta was first performed in 1956 with a libretto by Lillian Hellman; but since 1974 it has been generally performed with a book by Hugh Wheeler which is more faithful to Voltaire's novel. The primary lyricist was the poet Richard Wilbur. Other contributors to the text were John Latouche, Dorothy Parker, Lillian Hellman, Stephen Sondheim, John Mauceri, John Wells, and Bernstein himself. Maurice Peress and Hershy Kay contributed orchestrations. Although unsuccessful at its premiere, Candide has now overcome the unenthusiastic reaction of early audiences and critics and achieved enormous popularity. It is very popular among major music schools as a student <b>show</b> <b>because</b> of the quality of its music and the opportunities it offers to student singers.|$|E
25|$|That {{evening at}} the music hall, Tintin and Haddock watch a {{performance}} by the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, which Milou turns into an impromptu duet. Haddock storms out from the <b>show</b> <b>because</b> of Castafiore's singing. Ragdalam the fakir and Yamilah the clairvoyant perform after Castafiore; after a few novelty predictions, Ragdalam asks Yamilah {{to tell him about}} a woman in the audience, Mme Clairmont (Mrs Clarkson). She says that her husband, Clairmont (Clarkson), is a photographer, and that he has been struck down by the curse of Rascar Capac. Mme Clairmont must leave the show with her daughter, Fleur, when she receives a message that her husband is indeed ill. The magician's act is on, and Haddock stumbles onto the stage with a stage prop of a cow's head on his, after having got lost backstage trying to find his way out.|$|E
