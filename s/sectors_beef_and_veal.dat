With the help of this model, {{the influence of the}} situation in macroeconomics, policy and other factors (prices and productivity) on the production and consumption of the main agricultural and food products is estimated. Four agricultural policy scenarios and their influence on the plant (cereals, rapeseed and potatoes) and animal <b>sectors</b> (<b>beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal,</b> pork, sheep meat and poultry) are presented. Prognoses of the aggregate balance of the mentioned products are presented for the year 2020. In conclusion, the results of four agricultural policy scenarios and future research questions related to the current time period are introduced.

40|$|This report {{argues that}} the mining boom has not been managed well, {{and that it has}} been allowed to expand with little {{consideration}} for the collateral damage it causes to other sectors of the economy. Since the beginning of the mining boom Australia’s rural sector has lost $ 43. 5 billion in export income. This includes $ 14. 9 billion in 2010 - 11 alone. These losses have occurred because the mining boom has forced the Australian dollar to historic highs. The damage the mining boom is doing to other sectors has created what has been dubbed the ‘two speed economy’. The booming mining industry has pushed up the Australian exchange rate and in doing so has cut the export earnings of trade-exposed parts of the economy. Most Australian exporters are price-takers. They do not set the world price but rather accept the current world price. So when the value of the exchange rate increases, the amount the exporter receives in Australian dollar terms falls. The rural sector is heavily reliant on export earnings. In 2010 - 11 it exported over $ 36 billion worth of produce, but in Australian dollar terms this has been reduced by $ 14. 9 billion. This represents a decrease of 41 per cent in export income because of the high exchange rate attributable to the mining boom. Within the rural <b>sector</b> the <b>beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> industry has also been adversely impacted with exporting income being cut by $ 2 billion in 2010 - 11 and $ 6. 2 billion over the boom. The sugar industry lost $ 566 million in 2010 - 11 and $ 1. 8 billion over the boom. Just as the Reserve Bank of Australia tries to smooth {{the ups and downs of}} the economy with monetary policy, state and federal governments need to manage the ups and downs of the commodity cycle. The growth in the mining sector has come at a cost to other sectors of the economy, especially the rural sector – and these costs are substantial. The idea that any growth in the mining sector will serve to enhance Australia’s income is simply untrue. The macro economy is far more complex, with unintended consequences like the high Australian exchange rate negatively impacting on non-mining sectors – particularly, as has been shown here, the rural sector. The mining boom has not been managed well. It has been allowed to expand with little consideration for the collateral damage it causes to other sectors of the economy. The rural sector is one part of the economy that has been badly affected. There needs to be a stronger focus on the boom’s full effects rather than a reliance on the simple belief that unrestrained growth in the resource sector is in Australia’s national interest...|$|R

Options for partial decoupling can also be applied even regionally depending on member states decision. For Italian <b>beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> <b>sector</b> decoupling is a critical issue. The different Italian livestock production systems and the lower financial support because of a partial application of Agenda 2000 make decisions about decoupling a hardly task. Effects of different decoupling options have been analyzed joint to national ceiling reduction. A positive mathematical programming model has been calibrated on the <b>beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> <b>sector</b> of Veneto Region. Results show that a decrease in livestock numbers and farmers’ income is mitigated when partial decoupling is applied.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} have nearly {{two thirds of}} the world's livestock populations but produce {{less than a third of}} the world's meat and a fifth of its milk. Low output is due to low off take rates and low yields per animal. <b>Beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> output per head of cattle in North America is 281 kg whereas yields in Africa and Asia are about half of this. In South America, <b>beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> output per animal is 213 kg.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy implementation on the agricultural markets of the eight new EU Member States. The study is based on the AGMEMOD (AGricultural MEmber states MODelling) national econometric models. Two scenarios are simulated for each country. The "Baseline" scenario assumes the implementation of the Single Area Payment Scheme until 2008 and the subsequent introduction of the Single Payment Scheme from 2009 onwards. Complementary national direct payments would remain in force until 2013. The second scenario assumes the full decoupling of direct payments from 2007 and the introduction of modulation from 2013 onwards in the 2004 enlargement new Member States (EU- 8). The baseline scenario projections suggest that the introduction of direct payments would expand EU- 8 aggregate production, mainly of oilseeds, grains, sheepmeat <b>and</b> cheese, while <b>beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> production would also increase. Consumption of more expensive <b>beef</b> <b>and</b> <b>veal</b> meat would be substituted by poultry and pigmeat.
