25|$|The rifle has {{mechanically}} adjustable iron sights that {{consist of}} a notch on a sliding tangent and forward post. The rear sight’s drop arm has a range scale engraved with settings from 1 to 10 (corresponding to firing ranges from 100 to 1,000 m, graduated every 100m) and a fixed setting “S” that is the equivalent to setting “4” on the range scale. Additionally, the <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> is fitted with a radium gas illuminated vial that enables use in low light and near dark conditions.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{can accept}} quick-detachable rails and adapters used to mount optics (STANAG 2324 compliant). The scope mounting system {{consists of a}} centering hole located on the front face of the rear <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> and a dovetail-like mounting point at {{the front end of}} the receiver. Swiss Arms (respectively Brügger & Thomet) offer several types of quick-release scope mounts and Picatinny rails. A version of the rifle with an integral receiver-mounted Picatinny rail is also offered; in this configuration the weapon is fitted with flip-up emergency battle sights—a rear aperture sight which folds down into a recess in the rail and a folding front blade.|$|E
2500|$|Based on the G36, Heckler & Koch {{also created}} the {{semi-automatic}} SL8 rifle and the straight-pull, bolt-action R8, which are {{offered to the}} civilian sport shooting markets. The SL8 is substantially different from the G36, it has a modified receiver and a thumbhole stock with a cheek rest, which is integral with the trigger group. The SL8 has a heavy profile, extended, [...] barrel {{that does not have}} a flash hider or bayonet lug. The rifle uses a 10-round single-stack magazine and an extended top rail used to mount a wide variety of Picatinny-standard optics. Mounted to the rail are a set of iron sights with a hooded foresight and adjustable flip rear aperture. The SL8 can also mount the G36 carry handle and integrated <b>sight</b> <b>assembly,</b> after removing the mechanical iron sights. The SL8 has an unloaded weight of 4.3kg, overall length of 980–1030mm and a trigger rated at 20 N.|$|E
50|$|The GAU-15/A, {{formerly}} {{identified as}} the XM218, is a lightweight member of the M2/M3 family. The GAU-16/A was an improved GAU-15/A with modified grip and <b>sight</b> <b>assemblies</b> for similar applications. Both of these weapons were used {{as a part of}} the A/A49E-11 armament subsystem (also known as the Defensive Armament System).|$|R
50|$|Rear sights {{are usually}} mounted in a {{dovetail}} on the barrel or receiver, {{closer to the}} eye of the shooter, allowing for easy visual pick-up of the notch. Front sights are mounted to the barrel by dovetailing, soldering, screwing, or staking close to the muzzle, frequently on a ramp. Some front <b>sight</b> <b>assemblies</b> include a detachable hood intended to reduce glare, and if the hood is circular, then this provides a reference where the eye will naturally align one within the other.|$|R
50|$|Neither the AK-47 nor the M16 were {{designed}} to mount accessories, except of course for their respective bayonets and a simple clamp type bipod for the M16. However, {{with the advent of}} the Picatinny rail and by sheer happenstance, the M16 has proven itself to be a remarkably adaptable weapon system, capable of mounting a wide range of accessories, including grenade launchers, fore-grips, removable carry handle/rear <b>sight</b> <b>assemblies,</b> bipods, laser systems, electronic sights, night vision, tactical lights, etc. The AK-47 can also use Picatinny rail mounted accessories, although its design and smaller fore-stock make it less adaptable.|$|R
2500|$|The AR-15's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} carrying handle and rear <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the original ArmaLite design, where the carry handle served to protect the charging handle. As the line of sight is [...] over the bore, the AR-15 has an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15–20 meters), the shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired. The standard AR-15 rifle has a 500mm (19.75inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool. The AR-15 can also mount a scope on the carrying handle. With the advent of the AR-15A2, a new fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. Current versions such as AR-15A4 use Picatinny rails, which allows the use of various scopes and sighting devices.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the <b>sighting</b> <b>assembly</b> forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|R

5000|$|Some time later, {{manufacturing}} {{began again}} under the Charco (descendant company of Charter Arms) trademark. This company also filed bankruptcy, and the models produced {{during this period}} showed obvious production flaws. It was produced again by Charter 2000; this company, which failed also, improved the weapon with a one-piece barrel, front <b>sight,</b> ejector-shroud <b>assembly.</b> The original model had no ejector-shroud and the aluminum front sight was soldered to the barrel.|$|R

50|$|Additionally, the RPK-74 has a {{modified}} return mechanism {{compared to the}} AK-74, which uses {{a new type of}} metal spring guide rod and recoil spring. The rear <b>sight</b> <b>assembly,</b> forward handguard and receiver dust cover were all retained from the RPK.|$|E
5000|$|The rifle-attached variant {{could be}} {{mounted on the}} {{underside}} of either a Type56, Type 81, or Type 95 [...] It is lightweight, compact, breech-loading, and single-shot.

The weapon could be used by any front-line assault troops in need of a long range explosive.|$|R
50|$|F88SA2: The F88SA2 Austeyr is an {{evolutionary}} upgrade {{of the current}} rifle to fulfill an operational capability gap. Deliveries of several thousand were completed in late-2009 to selected units for overseas service. (Afghanistan) Technical improvements in the F88S-A2 include: Modified gas system for increased reliability and increased interoperability with U.S ammo. An enlarged ejection port. A longer Picatinny Rail {{on top of the}} weapon, a modified sight housing, a side rail mount for a torch and Night Aiming Device (NAD). The Color of the barrel, <b>sight</b> and barrel <b>assembly</b> has been changed to khaki to reduce the recognition signature.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the PG-2 was {{considerably}} different than the PG-1 of the RPG-1. The rear section of the PG-1 consisted of a central tube holding the propelling charge, and a second tube around this carrying the fins. When the round was inserted in the launcher, the second tube was outside the launcher tube, requiring {{the front of the}} launcher to be free of any fittings. The PG-2 replaced the fins with small metal leafs attached to the inner tube, and eliminated the outer tube found on the PG-1. This allowed the entire propellant section to be inserted in the launcher, which in turn allowed the <b>sights</b> and trigger <b>assembly</b> to be mounted right {{at the front of the}} launcher. This slightly reduced the length compared to the RPG-1, made the entire assembly more robust, and allowed the use of conventional fore-and-aft sights.|$|R
5000|$|Special forces {{units of}} the J.G.S.D.F are {{additionally}} issued a pressure switch activated targeting laser and flashlight which are mounted on the barrel end of the weapon ahead of the front <b>sight</b> <b>assembly.</b> Regular members of the Self-Defense Forces may also obtain these, but must pay for {{them out of their}} own funds.|$|E
50|$|F88 GLA: The F88 GLA Austeyr variant {{is for the}} Australian Army with an M203 grenade launcher. It {{features}} an Inter-bar (armourer attached) interface, an RM Equipment M203PI grenade launcher, and a Knight's Armament quadrant <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> to which a Firepoint red dot sight is attached.

60|$|Polly Ann's wedding-day dawned {{bright and}} fair, and {{long before the}} sun glistened on the corn tassels we were up and {{clearing}} out the big room. The fiddlers came first--a merry lot. And then the guests from afar began to arrive. Some of them had travelled half the night. The bridegroom's friends were assembling at the McChesney place. At last, when the sun was over the stream, rose such Indian war-whoops and shots from the ridge trail as made me think the redskins were upon us. The shouts and hurrahs grew louder and louder, the quickening thud of horses' hoofs was heard in the woods, and there burst into <b>sight</b> of the <b>assembly</b> by the truck patch two wild figures on crazed horses charging down the path towards the house. We scattered to right and left. On they came, leaping logs and brush and ditches, until one of them pulled up, yelling madly, at the very door, the foam-flecked sides of his horse moving with quick heaves.|$|R
60|$|All this, {{which takes}} me {{so long to}} describe, {{impressed}} itself upon me in a few seconds. Then we had very different things to think of, for an active drama was in progress. Two of the ape-men had seized one of the Indians out {{of the group and}} dragged him forward {{to the edge of the}} cliff. The king raised his hand as a signal. They caught the man by his leg and arm, and swung him three times backwards and forwards with tremendous violence. Then, with a frightful heave they shot the poor wretch over the precipice. With such force did they throw him that he curved high in the air before beginning to drop. As he vanished from <b>sight,</b> the whole <b>assembly,</b> except the guards, rushed forward to the edge of the precipice, and there was a long pause of absolute silence, broken by a mad yell of delight. They sprang about, tossing their long, hairy arms in the air and howling with exultation. Then they fell back from the edge, formed themselves again into line, and waited for the next victim.|$|R
5000|$|Sights: Initially, {{detachable}} carrying handles {{cut down}} so that only the rear <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> was used. However, most of these have been replaced with the similar, commercially-made Lewis Machine & Tool adjustable rear sight. Also used are several types of reflex and magnified optics, most commonly seen is the Aimpoint CompM2 in a Wilcox Industries Corp. Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) mount. On the Mod 1, the front sight is deleted and a full-length accessory rail is used; flip up iron sights may be mounted per user preferences ...|$|E
50|$|Most German tanks {{used during}} World War II used the MG 34 Panzerlauf for {{secondary}} armament. The MG 42 was ill-suited for internal/coaxial mounting {{due to the}} method of barrel change. The main difference of the MG 34 Panzerlauf and the regular MG 34 was the heavier, almost solid armored barrel shroud, almost completely lacking the ventilation holes of the basic MG 34. When mounted inside a tank, the MG 34 also lacked a butt-stock. A kit for quick conversion to ground use was carried inside the tank containing a butt-stock and a combined bi-pod and front <b>sight</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The rear <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> is riveted {{onto the}} {{receiver}} cover and {{consist of a}} square notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in 100 m increments from 100 to 1500 m and includes a [...] "point-blank range" [...] battle zero setting corresponding to a 330 m zero. It is identical in design to the AKM and Mosin-Nagant, except that it is oriented backwards with the notch forward and the hinge behind. Like the RPD rear sight, the PK rear sight also features full windage adjustment {{in the form of}} small dials {{on either side of the}} notch.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{can accept}} quick-detachable rails and adapters used to mount optics (STANAG 2324 compliant).

5000|$|The P-61 {{featured}} {{a crew of}} three: pilot, gunner, and radar operator. It was armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano M2 forward-firing cannons mounted in the lower fuselage, and four [...]50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns lined up horizontally with the two middle guns slightly offset upwards in a remotely aimed dorsally mounted turret, a similar arrangement to that used with the B-29 Superfortress using four-gun upper forward remote turrets. The turret was driven by the General Electric GE2CFR12A3 gyroscopic fire control computer, and could be directed by either the gunner or radar operator, who both had aiming control and gyroscopic collimator <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> posts attached to their swiveling seats.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a simple}} <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> atop the chamber block - a semi-cylindrical groove along it, and a white forward post {{at the front of}} the groove. Some {{variants}} of PB-4 have a built-in laser sight with a laser window in the center of the [...] "locking surface", and the beam following the central extractor channel of the chamber block. The laser switch on the left side of the handle block is operated by the thumb, and the laser is fed by a battery inside the pistol grip. There are no safety switches - the locked and loaded weapon is always ready to fire (provided the battery is not discharged, for the models which use a battery).|$|E
5000|$|The M4 carbine was {{developed}} from various outgrowths of these designs, including {{a number of}} 14.5 in-barreled A1 style carbines. The XM4 (Colt Model 727) started its trials in the mid-1980s, with a barrel of 14.5 in. Officially adopted {{as a replacement for}} the M3 [...] "Grease Gun" [...] (and the Beretta M9 and M16A2 for select troops) in 1994, it was used with great success in the Balkans and in more recent conflicts, including the Afghanistan and Iraq theaters. The M4 carbine has a three-round burst firing mode, while the M4A1 carbine has a fully automatic firing mode. Both have a Picatinny rail on the upper receiver, allowing the carry handle/rear <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> to be replaced with other sighting devices.|$|E
50|$|The M67 {{is shaped}} like a long tube with the <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> and trigger offset to the side in {{opposite}} directions about halfway along the barrel. Under this point is the monopod, with the bipod halfway back from there. The weapon required a crew of three to operate it; a gunner, assistant gunner (loader) and ammo bearer. The breech is hinged on the right side, {{and had to be}} swung open to load the round. It was then swung closed and when the rifle was fired, the rear end of the shell case broke up and was blown {{out of the back of}} the breech block. On the left side of the barrel, near the sight and trigger assemblies, was an asbestos heat shield to protect the gunner's shoulder and neck from the heat of the barrel when firing.|$|E
50|$|Based on the G36, Heckler & Koch {{also created}} the {{semi-automatic}} SL8 rifle and the straight-pull, bolt-action R8, which are {{offered to the}} civilian sport shooting markets.

The SL8 has an unloaded weight of 4.3 kg, overall length of 980-1030 mm and a trigger rated at 20 N.|$|E
50|$|The rifle {{comes with}} {{adjustable}} iron sights, {{consisting of a}} forward post and an L-shaped dual-aperture rear flip sight with settings for firing at ranges of 150 and 300 m. The front sight, corrected for windage and elevation, is mounted in a semi-shrouded post {{on top of the}} gas block, and the rear sight—on the receiver top cover. For operation in low-level lighting conditions the rifle uses subdued self-luminous tritium gas vials, installed in a separate folding post attached {{to the base of the}} front sight and deployed manually, and in the rear <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> in a fixed notch sight, exposed by rotating the rear sight arm 180° forward around its pivot axis. Additionally the rifle can be adapted to use various optical sights (i.e. the Trijicon ACOG or night vision equipment such as the Patria VV 2000 passive night sight), through the use of a receiver-mounted side-rail. A detachable cheek riser is employed when using optics.|$|E
50|$|Visually, the M79 grenade {{launcher}} resembles a large bore, break-action, sawed-off shotgun, and is simple in design, having only five major parts: a receiver group, a fore-end assembly, a barrel group, a <b>sight</b> <b>assembly,</b> and a stock. The fore-end assembly beds the barrel to the receiver. The stock {{is made out}} of wood or fiberglass. A rubber pad affixed to the buttstock absorbs some recoil. The front sight is a fixed blade. The rear sight on the M79 is a folding ladder-style leaf-type sight. When folded, the leaf sight acts as a fixed sight for close range. A grenadier may simply point and shoot with high accuracy. When unfolded, the leaf-type sight could be adjusted for ranges from 75 meters to 375 meters, in 25-meter increments. Additionally, Appendix A of U.S. Army field manual for the M203 includes instructions for attaching the M16 rifle grenade sight to the M79's stock and marking the sling for indirect fire at elevations greater than 40°.|$|E
5000|$|Production {{difficulties}} delayed deliveries to {{the army}} until September 1937. Machine production began at Springfield Armory that month {{at a rate of}} ten rifles per day, and reached an output of 100 per day within two years. Despite going into production status, design issues were not at an end. The barrel, gas cylinder, and front <b>sight</b> <b>assembly</b> were redesigned and entered production in early 1940. Existing [...] "gas-trap" [...] rifles were recalled and retrofitted, mirroring problems with the earlier M1903 Springfield rifle that also had to be recalled and reworked approximately three years into production and foreshadowing rework of the M16 rifle at a similar point in its development. Production of the Garand increased in 1940 despite these difficulties, reaching 600 a day by 10 January 1941, and the army was fully equipped by the end of 1941. Following the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Winchester was awarded an [...] "educational" [...] production contract for 65,000 rifles, with deliveries beginning in 1943.|$|E
