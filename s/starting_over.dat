Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of <b>starting</b> <b>over.</b> Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{moved into}} feature film work {{when he wrote}} and co-produced the 1979 film <b>Starting</b> <b>Over.</b> His next project was the {{critically}} acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three roles. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences, the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I'll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, As Good as It Gets (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, 2004's Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).|$|E

25|$|After {{a certain}} point, Fitzgerald became stymied with the novel. He and Zelda (and Scottie) {{returned}} to the United States after several years in Europe, and in 1927 Scott went to Hollywood to write for the movies.

Fitzgerald supported himself and his family in the late 1920s with his highly lucrative short-story output (particularly for the Saturday Evening Post), but was haunted by his inability to progress on the novel. Around 1929 he tried a new angle on the material, <b>starting</b> <b>over</b> with a shipboard story about a Hollywood director and his wife (Lew and Nicole Kelly) and a young actress named Rosemary.

25|$|At 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, Garcia was {{considered}} {{too small for}} the National Football League and was not selected in the 1994 NFL Draft. In 1994, Garcia started his professional career in Calgary with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. He won a place on Calgary's roster as their third-string quarterback behind Doug Flutie and Steve Taylor when he threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns in his exhibition game appearance in 1994. Soon after he was named backup quarterback to Doug Flutie. Garcia took over as starter in 1995 when Flutie was sidelined midway through the season with an elbow injury. In his second start filling in for Flutie, Garcia set a team record with 546 passing yards and six touchdown passes in the Labour Day game against Edmonton touching off an eventual quarterback controversy among some fans when Flutie later returned. Flutie ended up <b>starting</b> <b>over</b> Garcia in the Grey Cup that year which the Stampeders lost. After Flutie signed as a free-agent with the Toronto Argonauts in 1996, Garcia took over as the Stampeders' starting quarterback. During Garcia's three years as starter, the Stampeders finished with records of 13-5, 10-8, and 12-6.|$|E
