Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the structure of the hybrids. The morphology of the hybrid coat-ings was examined by scanning electron microscopy and Si mapping. The hybrid sys-tems have a uniform network structure and inorganic phases have a size of less than 100 nm. In addition, the effect of BPA/GPTMS molar ratio on cross-linking was investigat-ed by ATR-IR and corrosion protection properties of hybrid coatings were evaluated by linear sweep voltametry (LSV) and 2000 -h salt <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> <b>methods.</b> The results of these experiments show that the increasing of cross-linking between silica-network and BPA, would prevent the formation of cracks and decrease the brittleness.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) structures {{must maintain}} sufficient proof strength and durability and achieve required performance throughout their service life. When constructing an RC structure in limited construction space, {{it is often}} constructed in sections (constructed in separate periods of time). Such a structure has construction joints (Fig. 1), and cracks may occur at or near those joints and cause water penetration. In this way, air and water easily penetrate construction joints with cracks and create an environment where rebar easily becomes corroded, likely causing adverse effects on proof strength and durability of the RC structure. That greatly affects maintenance of the RC structure too. Thus, {{on the assumption that}} prevention of corrosion of rebars at such joints could alleviate the issue of long-term durability that greatly affects maintenance of RC structures, we carried out accelerated corrosion tests of rebars using rebars samples that had rebars and different types of existing antirust agent. We also carried out the same tests using concrete samples that had embedded rebars and rebars with different types of existing antirust agent to simulate construction joints. This article will cover those tests and <b>test</b> results. <b>Testing</b> <b>Method</b> 2 As the method of accelerated corrosion testing of ordinary steel, we used a salt water <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> <b>method,</b> where +/- 0. 5 % salt water is used in a test cycle of two hours of salt water spraying, four hours of drying and two hours of leaving in wet condition, based on JIS Z 2371.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{estimate}} the corrosion resistance of composite Zn+Ni and (Ni-Zn+Ni) /Zn coatings by salt <b>spray</b> <b>test,</b> electrochemical <b>methods</b> and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) method. Design/methodology/approach: The corrosion resistance properties of zinc-nickel coatings in 5 % NaCl solution were investigated by salt <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> in 5 % NaCl solution and electrochemical methods. Using Stern method the corrosion potential - Ecorr, corrosion current density - icorr, and polarization resistance - Rp. have been determined {{as a measure of}} corrosion resistance. Phase composition of the corrosion products was determined by X-ray diffraction using Bragg-Brentano and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) methods. Findings: The corrosion resistance of zinc-nickel coatings is dependent on Ni content and it grows with the increase in Ni percentage in the coatings. The higher corrosion resistance could be attributed to the presence of intermetallic Ni 2 Zn 11 phase. The maximum protective ability is reached for the coatings above 40 % Ni, where the content of this phase is the highest. The results of salt <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> exhibit the appearance of white rust corrosion, which is characteristic for zinc oxidation process. The main component of corrosion products was Zn 5 (OH) 8 Cl 2 ּH 2 O phase. The products related to the nickel or steel substrate corrosion process were not found. The application of the GIXD technique has allowed to determine the changes in the phase composition of the corrosion products in the zinc and zinc-nickel coatings versus the penetration depth of the X-ray radiation. The presence of corrosion products on the electrode surface results in further improve in their protective ability and the limiting of the corrosion processes. Research limitations/implications: Special attachment for GIXD technique is required for the experiment. Practical implications: The zinc-nickel coatings could be applied as protective coatings for steel substrates.

50|$|The {{salt spray}} (or salt fog) test is a {{standardized}} and popular corrosion <b>test</b> <b>method,</b> used to check corrosion resistance {{of materials and}} surface coatings. Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. Salt <b>spray</b> <b>testing</b> is an accelerated corrosion test that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating {{for use as a}} protective finish.

50|$|ASTM G85 is {{the most}} popular global test {{standard}} covering modified salt <b>spray</b> <b>tests.</b> There are five such tests altogether, referred to in ASTM G85 as annexes A1 through to A5. Many of these modified tests originally arose within particular industry sector, in order to address the need for a corrosion test capable of replicating the effects of naturally occurring corrosion and accelerate these effects.This acceleration arises through the use of chemically altered salt spray solutions, often combined with other test climates and in most cases, the relatively rapid cycling of these test climates over time. Although popular in certain industries, modified salt <b>spray</b> <b>testing</b> has in many cases been superseded by Cyclic corrosion testing (CCT) The type of environmental test chambers used for modified salt <b>spray</b> <b>testing</b> to ASTM G85 are generally similar to the chambers used for testing to ASTM B117, but will often have some additional features, such as an automatic climate cycling control system.|$|R
50|$|Salt <b>spray</b> <b>testing</b> {{is popular}} {{because it is}} {{relatively}} inexpensive, quick, well standardized, and reasonably repeatable. Although {{there may be a}} weak correlation between the duration in salt <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> and the expected life of a coating in certain coatings such as hot dip galvanized steel, this test has gained worldwide popularity due to low cost and quick results. Most Salt Spray Chambers today are being used NOT to predict the corrosion resistance of a coating, but to maintain coating processes such as pre-treatment and painting, electroplating, galvanizing, and the like, on a comparative basis. For example, pre-treated + painted components must pass 96 hours Neutral Salt Spray, to be accepted for production. Failure to meet this requirement implies instability in the chemical process of the pre-treatment, or the paint quality, which must be addressed immediately, so that the upcoming batches are of the desired quality. The longer the accelerated corrosion test, the longer the process remains out of control, and larger is the loss in the form of non-conforming batches.The principle application of the salt <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> is therefore enabling quick comparisons to be made between actual and expected corrosion resistance. Most commonly, the time taken for oxides to appear on the samples under test is compared to expectations, to determine whether the test is passed or failed. For this reason the salt <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> is most often deployed in a quality audit role, where, for example, {{it can be used to}} check the effectiveness of a production process, such as the surface coating of a metallic part.The salt <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> has little application in predicting how materials or surface coatings will resist corrosion in the real-world, because it does not create, replicate or accelerate real-world corrosive conditions.
