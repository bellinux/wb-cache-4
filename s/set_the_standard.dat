5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in the late Middle Ages that <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with {{the widespread use of}} sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.|$|E
5|$|The Pale Emperor is {{the ninth}} studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was {{released}} on January 15, 2015, through lead singer Marilyn Manson's Hell, etc. label, and was distributed in the United States by Loma Vista Recordings and internationally by Cooking Vinyl. The album was released in standard and deluxe editions on CD and double LP vinyl, and as a limited edition box <b>set.</b> <b>The</b> <b>standard</b> version of the album contains ten tracks; the deluxe edition includes three acoustic versions as bonus tracks.|$|E
5|$|Drainage schemes {{were first}} {{authorised}} {{during the reign}} of Queen Elizabeth I, but from 1632, a group of Adventurers took control of the drainage, in return for which they were granted land. They faced the problem that the outfalls of the River Welland and the River Glen were not sufficiently low to enable proper drainage by gravity, and most schemes included improvement to the rivers. John Perry, an engineer of some repute, who had <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for engineering reports in 1727, began work in 1730, and was followed by John Grundy, Sr., a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems. His son, John Grundy, Jr., was another capable engineer, who was retained as a consultant after he resigned as full-time Surveyor of Works.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> {{for the music}} industry: artists, record labels, producers, {{marketers}} and even choreographers. The music video was {{ahead of its time}} and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|The 1905 All Blacks tour of Britain went on {{to achieve}} legendary status within the rugby world and New Zealand in particular. They scored 976 points and conceded only 59, and thus <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for future All Blacks sides. The tour also saw the first use of the All Blacks name and {{established}} New Zealand's reputation as a world-class rugby nation. Some of these players eventually defected {{to participate in the}} professional 1907–08 tour of Australia and Great Britain where they played against Northern Union sides in the sport that would eventually become known as rugby league.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span {{a period of}} over 9000years. The artifacts were disposed {{in a manner that}} permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy, as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied {{near the end of the}} Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by a cooler climate from about 1000BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} {{its attention to}} the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas had argued and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E
5|$|Stockport {{remained}} in Division 2 of the Football League {{for seven years}} until 1912–13 when they again had to seek re-election. Stockport gained 22 votes and was therefore re-elected. Despite an unsuccessful 1920–21 campaign that saw Stockport end the season bottom of the Second Division, which would normally have seen them face re-election however, they {{were placed in the}} new Third Division North. After winning five of their first six matches; along with going unbeaten from New Years Day 1921 to Easter Weekend 1922; Stockport <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for the division and gained their first Football League title when they beat Darlington in front of 18,500 fans at Edgeley Park. Albert Williams (the then manager) was presented with the trophy seven days later before the home game with Lincoln City. This title win began a remarkable coincidence which has occurred in each of Stockport's title winning seasons where Lincoln City have been the last opponents in each of those seasons. Joe O'Kane; who joined Stockport the previous season, was {{a major factor in the}} clubs promotion although he left the club at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers {{entered the}} season as {{defending}} champions of the AFC North Division, coming off a 10–6 record in 2007. Based on the previous season's results, the team faced the most difficult schedule in over 30 years; however, they were called Super Bowl contenders by ESPN. The Steelers opened their regular season on September 7, with a win over the Houston Texans {{en route to a}} 12–4 record, and a second straight AFC North Division title. In his second season as head coach Mike Tomlin was selected in fan balloting as the Motorola Coach of the Year. Linebacker James Harrison was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year after leading a defense which <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for the league in nearly every defensive category, including total yardage allowed, points allowed, passing yardage allowed, first downs allowed, yards per play, and yards per pass, among others. The playoffs began on January 11, 2009, with a win over the San Diego Chargers. The following week saw the third victory of the season over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship game and the advancement to Super Bowl XLIII where the Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals on February 1, 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{first game}} to feature fist {{fighting}} was Sega's boxing game Heavyweight Champ (1976), which is viewed from a side-view perspective like later fighting games. However, it was Data East's fighting game Karate Champ (1984) which popularized martial arts themed games. The same year, Irem's Hong Kong cinema-inspired Kung-Fu Master (known as Spartan X in Japan) laid {{the foundations for}} side-scrolling beat 'em ups with its simple gameplay and multiple enemies. Also in 1984, Bruce Lee combined multi-player, multi-character combat with traditional collecting, platform and puzzle gameplay. Later that year, Karateka combined the one-on-one fight sequences of Karate Champ with the freedom of movement in Kung-Fu Master, and it successfully experimented with adding plot to its fighting action. It was also among the first beat 'em ups to be successfully ported to home systems. Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun, released in 1986 in Japan, deviated from the martial arts themes of earlier games and introduced street brawling to the genre. The Western adaptation Renegade (released the same year) added an underworld revenge plot that proved more popular with gamers than the principled combat sport of other games. Renegade <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for future beat 'em up games as it introduced {{the ability to move}} both horizontally and vertically. It also introduced the use of combo attacks; in contrast to earlier games, the opponents in Renegade and Double Dragon could take much more punishment, requiring a succession of punches, with the first hit temporarily immobilizing the enemy, making him unable to defend himself against successive punches.|$|E
