5|$|Harmless to humans, the smalltail shark {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} by gillnet and longline fisheries throughout its range. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported {{for use in}} shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient {{due to a lack}} of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by gillnet fisheries targeting the <b>Serra</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing fishing effort, the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the urgent need for conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range. Although the smalltail shark was ostensibly given protection by inclusion on the 2004 Official List of Endangered Animals in Brazil, fishing remains effectively unmanaged.|$|E
25|$|The daggernose shark poses little {{danger to}} humans {{due to its}} small size and teeth. This shark is caught in small numbers by {{subsistence}} fishers in Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana. It also comprises about one-tenth of the catch of a northern Brazil floating gillnet fishery targeting <b>Serra</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) and Acoupa weakfish (Cynoscion acoupa), which operates in estuaries during the dry season. This shark is often found in markets, but is not highly regarded as a food fish. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Critically Endangered, as it has a limited distribution and is highly susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate. The daggernose shark has declined over 90% {{over the past decade}} off Brazil, and similar declines have likely also occurred elsewhere in its range as fishing pressure in the region continues to grow more intense. The IUCN has urgently recommended the implementation of conservation schemes and the expansion of fishery monitoring for this species. Evidence also points to this species being on the verge of or already in reproductive collapse.|$|E

In spearing <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel,</b> relatively large lure and luring model fish with {{same size as the}} <b>spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> are used to attact fish up to sea surface at the spearing position. <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> is attracted by these luring gears, and its behaviour toward them varies depending on the size, movement and moving speed of the luring gear.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the descriptive sensory profile and drivers of liking of eight samples of low-sodium <b>Serra</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>Mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) fish burgers. The sensory profile was determined by 12 trained assessors, and acceptance testing was performed using 243 consumers. Partial least-squares regression analysis was used to identify the drivers of liking and rejection of fish burgers (i. e., "Mackerel burger"). The results of the sensory descriptive profile indicated that the attributes appearance, aroma, and flavor were stronger for the samples prepared from whole minced fish. Acceptance was also higher for formulations containing whole minced fish. The descriptive terms that drove consumer preference and determined the acceptance were fish shape, salty taste, umami taste, fish flavor, herb flavor, and residual artificial flavor, and the term fish shape positively affected the results. Thus, despite the preparation of a fish-based product with low sodium and high acceptance is feasible, the drivers of liking should be considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{register}} the ecological knowledge of fishermen from the municipality of São João de Pirabas, Pará, Brazil, regarding the occurrence of sea turtles on the Pará state coast, as well as measure their incidental capture when fishing; to do this, 50 semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} local fishermen. Fishing was practiced mostly by adult men, who used 7 fishing arts (gillnetting, hook and line, longline, fish corrals, net of tide canals, casting net, and basket trap), mainly aimed at catching king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), <b>serra</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (S. brasiliensis), king weakfish (Macrodon ancylodon), weakfish (Cynoscion spp.), hake (Cynoscion spp.), catfish (Bagre bagre), and mullet (Mugil spp.). Fishermen observed in the region 5 turtle species, with a more frequent occurrence of Chelonia mydas (100 %), Dermochelys coriacea (66 %), and Eretmochelys imbricata (46 %); the less frequent species are Caretta caretta (16 %) and Lepidochelys olivacea (8 %). The spawning areas of the 3 most common species demonstrate the significance of the Pará state coast for their conservation. Incidental capture was reported by 76 % of fishermen, mainly occurring in net, longlines, and fish corrals. Usually, captured animals were released, although there is consumption of sea turtle meat and eggs by fishermen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To utilize low-value fish, <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein was hydrolyzed using alcalase for {{production}} of antioxidant peptide. The antioxidant activities of antioxidant peptide from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein were evaluated. Results: The radical-scavenging properties on hydroxyl and superoxide of protein hydrolysates were 53. 11 % and 23. 1 %. And their reducing power was increased with the peptide {{content of the}} hydrolysates. The hydrolysates significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation in linoleic acid emulsion system, and effectively inhibit autoxidation of linoleic acid; and the inhibition ability increased with the increasing of peptide content in hydrolysates. The hydrolysates inhibited the activity of LOX to a certain extent. Conclusion: The hydrolysates from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein exhibited high antioxidative activity...|$|R
