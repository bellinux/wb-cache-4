A parametric study on the bearing strengths of 182 single <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections at 7 different temperatures was performed using the verified FEM. Bearing factors that included the effects of elevated temperatures were proposed for the bearing strengths of single <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections with and without considering bolt hole deformation.

40|$|Over {{the life}} span of a {{structure}} it may become necessary to retrofit, or strengthen certain components or elements. This may be due to construction errors, changes in use and occupancy, or changes due to material deterioration or damage. Slab-column connections in flat slab structures might need to be strengthened for punching shear. Using steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> to strengthen connections for punching shear is a new technique used for retrofit that was developed at the University of Waterloo. If the retrofitted part of the structure is exposed to the atmosphere, or to chemicals such as deicing salts, the steel can corrode, thus furthering to damage the structure. Non-corrosive materials that can replace the steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> can be a good practical alternative to steel. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the development and use of non-corrosive <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections. Externally applied <b>shear</b> reinforcing <b>bolts</b> provide the punching shear reinforcement strength, while allowing the flexibility and ease of installation of an external application after construction. By providing a bearing area against both sides of the slab surface, the formation of punching shear cracks can be restrained, and the connection can become strengthened against punching shear failure. Three different types of non-corrosive <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> were developed and tested. The first was an off-the-shelf glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bolt / nut product. The two others used two different GFRP core rods with aluminum fittings crimped to their ends. A total of six specimens were tested, four were tested under an increasing static load, while two were tested with an unbalanced pseudo-dynamic lateral load. All six specimens were designed to fail in punching shear before reaching their flexural capacity. The results are compared against previous test results of specimens both unreinforced and reinforced with steel <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> to determine their effectiveness. From the test results {{it was found that the}} GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> did strengthen the connections for punching shear. The GFRP nut and bolt did not strengthen the connection, and, in fact, decreased its overall strength when compared to the unreinforced specimen. The presence of the GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> also increased the connection ductility and the deflection capability. In the pseudo-dynamic tests the GFRP <b>shear</b> <b>bolts</b> significantly increased the amount of energy dissipated by the connection under reverse cyclic loading.

The burn rates were fit to R = a pn, with a = 2. 055 cm/sec/MPan and n = 0. 472 between 0. 15 MPa (22 psi) and 21. 6 MPa (3. 13 Kpsi) and a = 4. 38 cm/sec/MPan and n = 0. 266 between 70 MPa (10. 15 Kpsi) and 312 MPa (45. 25 Kpsi). The decrease in slope at the higher pressures is attributed to a diffusion limited reaction. No acoustically driven flame instabilities or large conductive-to-convective burn transitions were observed. Solid reaction products were analyzed by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction detected only TiO 2 and KC 1. SEM showed that the particle size of the reaction products increased as the nitrogen pressure increased.

The basic design principles of conventional mouldboard ploughs and an ard were taken into consideration. A safety mechanism was developed which was a <b>shear</b> <b>bolt.</b> Apart from the share point, all components of the plough were made from wood, and the total mass was about 10 kg. The orientational parameters of the developed implement such as the tail angle, rake angle and the side-rake angle can be varied to suit the required soil operations and the pulling capability of the draught animals. The developed plough can also be used as a ridger by mounting an extra wing on the plough. Comparative field experiments were conducted in cooperation with the International Livestock Research Institute. ILRI, using the developed and traditional ard-type plough in Ethiopia. Tests were carried out in fields under various soil conditions using oxen and cows. The results showed that the draught required by the developed plough was about 30 percent less than the draught of the traditional Ethiopian ard. A frequency analysis was made to determine the dominant frequencies of the reversible plough under working conditions. The identified frequencies were 0. 5, 1. 3 and 3. 3 Hz. Preliminary assessments were made to compare the performances of a pair of cows with a pair of oxen in relation to speed and forces when pulling the developed plough. A pair of cows moved faster (an average of 0. 84 m/s) than the pair of oxen (an average of 0. 63 m/s) and exerted proportionally greater pulling forces when operating in the same field.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} slab-column {{structures are}} widely used because of their practicality. However, this type of structures can be subject to punching-shear failure in the slab-column connections. Without shear reinforcement, the slab-column connection can undergo brittle punching failure, especially when the structure is subject to lateral loading in seismic zones. The shear bolts are {{a new type of}} transverse reinforcement developed for retrofit of existing structures against punching. This research focuses on how the shear bolts can improve the punching-shear capacity and ductility of the existing slab-column connections under vertical service and lateral seismic loads. A set of nine full-scale reinforced concrete slab-column connection specimens were tested under vertical service and cyclic loads. The vertical (gravity) load for each specimen was kept at a constant value throughout the testing. The cyclic lateral drift with increasing intensity was applied to the columns. The specimens were different in number of bolts, concrete strength, number of openings, and level of gravity punching load. Strains in flexural rebars in the slabs, crack widths, lateral loads, and displacements were obtained. The peak lateral load (moment) and its corresponding drift ratio, connection stiffness, crack width, and ductility were compared among different specimens. The testing results show that shear bolts can increase lateral peak load resisting capacity, lateral drift capacity at peak load, and ductility of the slab-column connections. Shear bolts also change the failure mode of the slab-column connections and increase the energy dissipation capacity. The thesis includes also research on the development of guidelines for <b>shear</b> <b>bolt</b> design for concrete slab retrofitting, including the punching shear design method of concrete slab (with shear bolts), dimensions of bolts, spacing, and influence of bolt layout patterns.

40|$|In certain {{situations}} the punching {{strength of a}} connection may become inadequate after construction due to changes of connection geometry from drilling or coring, or from changes of building use, or construction and design errors. The use of shear reinforcement {{in the form of}} Shear Bolts is a new approach to strengthening slab-column connections. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the use of shear bolts for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections without unbalanced moments. Six slab specimens were tested with different configurations of shear bolts and without shear reinforcement to verify the effectiveness of this method of reinforcement. The central idea is an externally applied shear reinforcing technique that provides strength in shear at par with other conventional reinforcement types {{on the one hand and}} offering the distinct advantage and flexibility of external application after construction. A <b>shear</b> <b>bolt</b> consists of an unhardened steel shaft threaded at one end and flared out to form a bearing/anchor surface on the other end. All six specimens were designed to fail in shear before reaching their flexural capacity, two of which were more critical than the others because of the presence of openings simulating utility ducts around the column perimeter. From the tests, comparisons of predicted loads with the failure loads indicated a higher ultimate load for slab reinforced with the bolt system. Similarly, strain measurements from strain gauges attached to the longitudinal steel and deflection profiles of the slab showed that the new method was efficient in increasing the shear capacity of the slabs. In summary, the test program showed that shear bolts are effective in transforming the behaviour of the slab-column connections from a brittle punching shear failure mode to a more ductile flexural one. Deflection profiles at different load stages, and particularly at failure, show increased deflections for specimens reinforced with bolt reinforcements. This indicates an increased ductility at the connection. Similarly, load and flexural reinforcement strain magnitudes show substantial improvements in the strength of the connections...|$|E

These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperatures. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted connections of cold-formed stainless steel structures at elevated temperatures. The key {{findings of the investigation}} are described in the following paragraphs. A total of 25 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of three different grades of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. The stainless steels are austenitic stainless steel EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1. 4571 (AISI 316 Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1. 4162 (AISI S 32101). Totally 434 tests on bolted connections of stainless steel were performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the nominal strengths calculated from the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European codes for stainless steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the material properties at elevated temperatures were used in the design equations for room temperature. It is shown that the nominal strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. A total of 78 cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections were tested in post-fire condition. The test results were compared with those tested at room temperature. Generally, it is found that the bolted connection strengths in post-fire condition cooling down from 350 and 650 ºC are higher than those tested at room temperature for all three grades of stainless steel. Finite element models for single shear and double <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Static analysis technique was used in the numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 450 specimens were performed using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing resistances of bolted connections of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing resistances of cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double <b>shear</b> <b>bolted</b> connections were proposed based on both the experimental and numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC.

Fractographic study confirmed presence of shear dimples suggesting shear load on the bolts. The Fracture initiation was not associated with any metallurgical defects. The bolts showed a tempered martensitic structure. Bolt material was found to have an average hardness of 444 HV. Since no obvious material abnormalities were found responsible for the failure, it is suggested that the test rig be inspected for abnormalities, present, if any...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{conventional}} {{composite construction}} involving hot-rolled steel section, the composite action is usually achieved by using conventional headed shear studs connectors. However, use of headed studs is not practical for cold-formed steel (CFS) section {{due to its}} very thin form {{that is difficult to}} weld. A suitable bolt and nut type shear connector was proposed; experimental tests were carried out to evaluate its performance. This study also investigated the use of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) integrated with CFS by means of <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors to develop composite action. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors in SCC integrated with CFS section as composite beam system. Eighteen push-out test specimens comprising of M 12, M 14 and M 16 sized <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connector of grade 8. 8 with longitudinal spacings of 150 mm, 250 mm and 300 mm centers were fabricated, cast and tested until failure. The experimental results showed that all <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors possessed a good shear resistance capacity. Not much difference in strength capacity of specimens with M 14 and M 16 <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors was found, perhaps due to CFS failure. Varying the size and longitudinal spacing of the <b>bolted</b> <b>shear</b> connectors revealed that the connectors' strength capacity changed slightly between M 14 and M 16 bolts specimens but, significantly for M 12 bolt specimens...|$|R

These failure mechanisms are observed in three sets of testing: (1) Simple Pin Loading, (2) Window tests (pin loading with transparent out-of-plane constraints), and (3) Double <b>Shear</b> <b>Bolted</b> Joint. The first two test setups involve a unique fixture that allows the collection of far-field strain visualization via Digital Image Correlation, providing {{a better understanding of}} the laminate’s response to the load in real time. These results are subsequently compared to one another and work done in previous publications...|$|R
