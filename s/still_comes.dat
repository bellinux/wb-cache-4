5|$|In {{the postwar}} era, the Haflinger was indiscriminately crossed with other breeds and some {{observers}} feared the breed was in renewed danger of extinction. However, starting in 1946, breeders focused on producing purebred Haflingers and a closed stud book was created. Interest in the breed increased {{in other countries}} and between 1950 and 1974 the population grew, even while the overall European horse population decreased. Population numbers continued to increase steadily and as of 2005, almost 250,000Haflingers existed worldwide. There are breeding farms in several countries, {{although most of the}} breeding stock <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> from Austria. In 2003, a Haflinger became the first horse to be cloned, resulting in a filly named Prometea.|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E
5|$|Although the Haflinger is {{now found}} {{all over the}} world, the {{majority}} of breeding stock <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> from Austria, where state studs own the stallions and carefully maintain {{the quality of the}} breed. However, there are breeding farms located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. As of 2007, Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country. Due to selective breeding during the 1990s aiming to increase height, some breed lines became favored over others in Italy. A 2007 study found little inbreeding within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole, although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due to the existence of fewer breeding stallions. Haflingers are bred throughout France, especially in the provinces of Brittany, Burgundy and Picardy, with between 350 and 400 foals born each year. Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population, with around 307 breeding mares and 30 breeding stallions as of 2008. A 2009 study found that although there was a very small amount of inbreeding in the population, it was increasing slightly over the years. As of 2005 there were almost 250,000Haflingers in the world.|$|E

500|$|Bowers credits Martin J. Faust {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} actors in for Thanhouser in 1910 and 1911, but Faust's role in productions often went uncredited.

In April 2010, Sky included Susan in their feature on the twenty-five most memorable Neighbours characters. They stated, [...] "Kindly but strong matriarch Susan {{may not be the}} most medically robust woman (amnesia, multiple sclerosis, frequent questionable haircuts), but she gets by thanks to her family. She's so devoted, in fact, that after Malcolm, Billy and Libby (sort of) flew the nest, she went and inherited Zeke and Rachel from second husband Alex. Despite her big heart, she can be counted on to get fierce with anyone who tries to upset the Ramsay Street balance – her frequent fights with Izzy in the middle of the street over Karl cemented her reputation as everyone's favourite soap mum." ...|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{wanted to}} do further work on the {{recorded}} tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). [...] Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had {{an agreement with the}} band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. [...] Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. [...] The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] and [...] "All Apologies" [...] with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993. [...] Furthermore, a remix of [...] "Pennyroyal Tea" [...] by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single. [...] One song, [...] "I Hate Myself and Want to Die", was omitted from the final track listing as Cobain felt there were too many [...] "noise" [...] songs on the album. [...] The rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three decibels. [...] Albini was critical of the album's final mix; he said, [...] "The end result, the record in the stores doesn't sound all that much like the record that was made. [...] Though it's still them singing and playing their songs, and the musical quality of it <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> across." ...|$|E

2500|$|Historically, Mexico City's {{potable water}} supply came via {{aqueduct}} {{from the mountain}} springs on the valley sides like that in Chapultepec {{as most of the}} water in Lake Texcoco was saline.

In the mid-1850s, potable groundwater was found underneath the city itself, which motivated the large-scale drilling of wells.

2500|$|Mad Men has {{encouraged}} much discussion about gender. The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we would like to think. Our daughters continually get the messages that power <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> through powerful men.

2500|$|The JT effect <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> into play, namely in {{combination}} with a different nearby, in general non-degenerate electronic state. [...] The result is a pseudo Jahn–Teller effect, for example, of an E state interacting with an A state. This situation is common in JT systems, just as interactions between two nondegenerate electronic states are common for [...] non-JT systems. Examples are excited electronic states of NH3+ and the benzene radical cation. Here, crossings between the E and A state APESs amount to triple intersections, which are associated with very complex spectral features (dense line structures and diffuse spectral envelopes under low resolution). The population transfer between the states is also ultrafast, so fast that fluorescence (proceeding on a nanosecond time scale) cannot compete. This helps {{to understand why the}} benzene cation, like many other organic radical cation, does not fluoresce.|$|E
2500|$|Shelties have {{a double}} coat, and often shed {{a lot of the}} time, no matter the season. The topcoat {{consists}} of long, straight, water-repellent hair, which provides protection from cold and the elements. The undercoat is short, furry, and very dense and helps to keep the dog warm. Mats can be commonly found behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs (the [...] "skirts"), as well as around the collar (if worn). The coat is usually shed twice a year, often at spring and autumn. Females will also shed right before or right after giving birth. Male shelties technically shed less than females but [...] fur <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> off constantly. Shaving these dogs is very bad for their skin and some do not regrow any significant amount of hair after being shaved, a condition known as alopecia. [...] Spaying or neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer, more prone to matting and even more profuse. It should be noted that Shelties shed in clumps which can be pulled or brushed out of the main coat, rather than individual hair. This makes them much easier to groom and clean-up after than many smooth-haired dogs, which leave loose fur in their space.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, {{including}} four chart toppers. [...] Hits include [...] "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", [...] "To Make Love Sweeter For You", [...] "She <b>Still</b> <b>Comes</b> Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", [...] "Since I Met You Baby", [...] "Once More With Feeling", [...] "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and [...] "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as Another Place, Another Time and She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye, was sparse, {{quite different from}} the slick [...] "Nashville sound" [...] that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. [...] The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard. [...] In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording [...] "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".|$|E
2500|$|Jon Dolan, {{writing for}} Blender, gave the album {{three out of}} five stars and commended Norwood's {{decision}} to re-team with Jerkins: [...] "Now she's gone back to girlie hip-hop Eden; four songs were written by Jerkins, author of her best late-'90s hits. Fluttery jams about long distance longing and time-suspending slow dances are balanced by grown-up moments of deeply felt, if slightly weird, balladic fortitude." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the sentiments of the songs, whether self-affirming or heartbroken, were back to generic ones: [...] "Song titles like 'Torn Down' and 'Shattered Heart' show how much Brandy {{is trying to get}} serious, taking on an adult world where happily ever after is elusive. But she <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> across as a fledgling, a personality still being formed, eagerly tagging along after her role models." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Henry Goldblatt noted [...] "the huskiness that defined Brandy's prior work has been replaced by wispier and higher tones. The result is pleasant but far less ambitious than her last CD, 2004's Afrodisiac." [...] Mikael Wood's review for Los Angeles Times was less emphatic. He gave the album one and a half stars out of four, and said: [...] "Unfortunately, it's also hard {{to make it through the}} thing. Brandy's strong suit has never been her thoughtfulness; appropriately for someone with her Hollywood history, she's long been one of R's emptiest vessels, a gorgeous voice used by a series of gifted producers to communicate their own unique ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Atlanta {{acoustic}} {{music scene}} {{at the time was}} split between the Trackside and The Freight Room. [...] When The Freight Room closed in 1992, Conoscenti, Wilcox, and most of Atlanta's other notable musicians like The Indigo Girls, Shawn Mullins, Kristian Bush, and others moved to Eddie's Attic. His first record, Carved in Stone on the DB Records label was released that year, followed by Beneath Your Moon. In 1994, he met Ellis Paul at Eddie's, and the two have been close friends and collaborators since. Conoscenti frequently plays guitar at Paul's shows around the country, including accompanying Paul for many years at his traditional New Year's Eve shows at Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Conoscenti left Atlanta that year and toured the country almost continuously until 2004. [...] During that time he released Boxes of Bones, My Brilliant Masterpiece, One for the Road, Mysterious Light, Paradox of Grace, Extremely Live at Eddie's Attic, and Turn Here. Mysterious Light climbed into the top 20 albums played by folk and acoustic DJs worldwide. In his review of My Brilliant Masterpiece for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Shawn Linderman said: [...] "Weaving in and out of love from both directions, touching on friendships and loss, Don Conoscenti's latest solo acoustic work is cozy and warm. But don't be misled into thinking these tunes are slow and simple. Don can be blistering away on guitar, stretching his vocal range to its limits and interspersing wild wails and growls, and yet the song <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> across as comforting. Don't ask me how he does it-- that's what's so damned fascinating about his music!" ...|$|E
