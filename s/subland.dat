40|$|Warren Ellis?s tenure on Marvel?s Secret Avengers (# 16 - 21, October 2011 -March 2012) saw the writer?s {{trademark}} scepticism of misused technology manifest as an {{interrogation of}} narrative technology, {{in this case}} the comic book format itself. Ellis actively ? albeit quietly ? used Secret Avengers to critique the publishing practices of the larger comics companies: He returns to a single-story-per-issue approach in an age of comic book ?events? and multiple tie-ins, he favours ?the missions no one will ever find out about? in a publishing environment which values maximum exposure, and he does so even as high-profile events like Fear Itself and Avengers Vs X-Men are advertised within the pages of his book. This essay will therefore read Secret Avengers as a metafictional argument against contemporary publishing trends and will illustrate this through discussion of each issue in turn: in ?<b>Subland</b> Empire? (# 16) Ellis warns of the dangers in nefariously repurposing old narrative technology (an old Fantastic Four panel); in ?Beast Box? (# 17) he considers how the relentless juggernaut of the comics ?event? zombifies readers; in ?No Zone? (# 18) he offers ?bad continua?, a series of ?entirely new universes,? as a criticism of misguided reboots; in ?Aniana? (# 19) he tackles physical and spiritual exploitation of the comic format; in ?Encircle? (# 20) he depicts the complexity of changing ?time? (continuity); and in ?Final Level? (# 21) he stages a raid on what serves, metaphorically, as the headquarters of a comic-book publisher. Framing this analysis will be a discussion of how the subtle subversion in Secret Avengers (perfectly married to its cast of super-spies) is an evolution of the more obvert ridicule Ellis proffered with titles like Nextwave: Agents of H. A. T. E. With such books as a point of contrast, the intention of this essay is thus to demonstrate Secret Avengers to be, in essence, a secret satire...|$|E
