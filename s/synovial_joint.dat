50|$|Synovia, {{more often}} called {{synovial}} fluid,1 is a viscous, non-Newtonian fluid {{found in the}} cavities of <b>synovial</b> <b>joints.</b> With its egg white-like consistency, the principal role of synovial fluid is to reduce friction between the articular cartilage of <b>synovial</b> <b>joints</b> during movement.|$|R

40|$|Chick embryos were paralysed in ovo with a neuromuscular {{blocking}} agent between 8 and 20 days of incubation. To {{evaluate the}} rôle of muscular {{activity in the}} development of sutural articulations, sutures of the cranial vault of control and paralysed embryos were studied histologically and the findings compared with the effect of the agent {{on the development of the}} ankle <b>joint</b> and some <b>synovial</b> <b>joints</b> of the jaws. Paralysed embryos showed a consistent lack of development of <b>joint</b> cavities in <b>synovial</b> <b>joints.</b> In most embryos, fusion of opposing cartilaginous elements had occurred. In contrast to <b>synovial</b> <b>joints,</b> sutural articulation showed a micromorphology comparable to that of controls. The findings indicate that different embryonic factors regulate the development of sutural and synovial articulations. Movements of neuromuscular origin play no essential role in the morphogenetic development of sutures, but are a prerequisite for the formation of joint cavities and other specialised structures of <b>synovial</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
