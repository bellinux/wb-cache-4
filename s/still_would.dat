5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln <b>still</b> <b>would</b> have won a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E
5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it <b>still</b> <b>would</b> looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E

Wegmuller was unable to change gears which was crucial for a sprint finish. He got {{assistance}} from his team car to remove the bag, but his gears <b>still</b> <b>would</b> not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to his chances, Wegmuller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 21, 1911. The film was originally set to be released under the title The Patriot Maid of '76. The reason for the title change {{was due to the}} release by the Rex Motion Picture Company's A Heroine of '76 on February 16, 1911. Though the film bears similarity in title and character, the plots were entirely different. Rex's film was also the first release by the new company. For the release of this patriotic film, Thanhouser made additional efforts for promoting the film in trade publications. A film still was used as the cover illustration on the February 11, 1911 issue of The Moving Picture News and a full-page <b>still</b> <b>would</b> be included in the The Moving Picture Worlds February 11 issue.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar's next {{opponent}} was Big Show and Heyman {{was convinced}} {{more than anyone}} that Lesnar could not win, trying {{to talk him out}} of defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the title against Show at Survivor Series on November 17, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Show, but Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. This allowed Show to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair to win the title. This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn into a fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the F-5 on Big Show, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar <b>still</b> <b>would</b> not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening. On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the No. 29 entry, the second to last competitor to enter the match. He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World's Greatest Tag Team, which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin, who were mentored by Angle. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XIX. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin at No Way Out on February 23. During the match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar botched a shooting star press, a move he had done numerous times in developmental matches, and jammed his head and neck. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match – a pinfall by Lesnar that allowed him to win his second WWE Championship. Lesnar was diagnosed with a concussion from the botched shooting star press.|$|E

25|$|By comparison, {{the budget}} for the pilot episode of the 1964 Australian topical revue series The Mavis Bramston Show was just AU₤1500.

25|$|The Labor state government, under premier Doug Lowe, {{backed down}} from the {{original}} proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new Wild Rivers National Park. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme. While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it <b>still</b> <b>would</b> have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{roles of}} women in a Puritan society were to be wives and mothers, and provide the family with their {{everyday}} needs. Women were expected to make the clothing for the family, cook the meals, keep the household clean, and teach the children how to live a Puritan lifestyle. All of these tasks alone could keep a woman busy, yet they got it all done, and <b>still</b> <b>would</b> serve their husbands when they arrived home from work.

25|$|Those that {{argue in}} favor of the claim that humans are the direct cause of the ground sloths’ {{extinction}} point out that the few sloths that remain are small sloths that {{spend most of their time}} in trees, making it difficult for them to be spotted by humans. Although these sloths were sufficiently hidden, they <b>still</b> <b>would</b> have been affected by the climate changes that supposedly wiped out the ground sloths. Additionally, after the continental ground sloths disappeared, insular sloths of the Caribbean remained for approximately 6,000 years longer (these islands were not colonized by humans until about 5500 yr BP).|$|E

Had the Giants knelt on the {{subsequent}} play, there <b>still</b> <b>would</b> have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E
