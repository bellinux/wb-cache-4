40|$|The {{development}} of distributed {{systems in the}} next few years will most probably be centered around: improvement of facilities for application development and execution control; {{development of}} new distributed applications; integration of new technologies to support the first two.

By looking into a few distribution support aspects, it motivates the utility of groups at all system levels. It advances structuring principles and points to the emerging technologies that may support them. The paper focuses, among those, on large-scale internetworking and multiparticipant communication. It discusses how, in the authors' opinion, multipoint (group) communication, logical addressing, membership management, and topology protocols may be used to implement efficient and robust infrastructures for large-scale distribution...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Internet {{technology}} makes {{a series}} of assumptions which may not exist in some cases especially in the challenged environments where <b>some</b> or all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>requirements</b> are hard to meet. In addition, Internet-based communications face the privacy and data security issues simply because the data is essential {{to be sent to}} and maintained in a centralized infrastructure. DTN, by contrast, supports frequently interrupted communications by introducing a Store-and-Forward message switching mechanism: intermediate node keeps the bundle in its persistent storage and waits for a better opportunity to forward it at a later time to another custody node or directly to the final destination if reachable. Floating Content, as a DTN-based localized information sharing service exclusively dependent on mobile phones and other mobile devices, takes advantage of wireless interfaces such as Bluetooth or WLAN to communicate in ad-hoc mode. We evaluate Floating Content service and finally implement it into mobile platforms in the form of mobile application thus benefits the users by providing an opportunistic communication mechanism even in an extreme environment, as well, decreases the security and privacy worries to a certain extent...|$|R

The following provides clarification for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>requirements.</b> Licensing Requirements at Wild/Exotic Animal Auctions Animal Welfare regulations require that persons selling exotic or wild animals for covered purposes be licensed. Therefore, operators of wild/exotic animal auctions must hold a current USDA Class B license. Some but not all persons consigning animals to these auctions need to be licensed. While some exotic or wild animals consigned at auctions are clearly sold only for covered purposes, others are often sold for non-covered purposes such as for food or fiber, or for hunting on game ranches. The three categories below are intended to help determine whether consignors need a USDA license. Never need a license May need a license Always need a license Birds Horses, donkeys, mule...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{different types}} of domain restrictions. We begin by analyzing various qualitative conditions on preference profiles. Value-restricted preferences (with single-peaked preferences {{as one of its}} subcases), limited agreement as well as antagonistic and dichotomous preferences are relatively easy to interpret. In our view, the property of single-peakedness stands out in particular. It proves to be a central restriction under majority voting. However, it also plays an essential role in the context of strategy-proof voting rules (which is the topic of another chapter in this Handbook). Furthermore, we consider quantitative or number-specific requirements on the distribution of voters over different preference orderings, and we shall see that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>requirements</b> are logically related to the qualitative conditions such as extremal restriction and value-restricted preferences. While the latter restrictions are requirements on combinations of individual orderings, the domains of individual orderings that admit n-person nondictatorial social welfare functions a la Arrow result from restrictions on permissible preferences for individuals. While the first five sections study the aggregation problem within the framework of arbitrary finite sets of discrete alternatives, the final section discusses continuous choice rules; the alternatives are assumed to be n-dimensional vectors in Euclidean space. Contractibility as a condition on the topological space of preferences proves to be necessary and sufficient for the existence of continuous aggregation rules. ...|$|E
40|$|Rift Valley fever virus circulates {{throughout}} Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and is {{of great}} concern for animal and public health. Infections in humans are often manifested as mild self‐limiting illness, although in some cases there are more severe symptoms such as neurological complications and hemorrhagic fever. Spontaneous abortions among livestock are a hallmark for Rift Valley fever virus outbreaks and disease in small ruminants often has a deadly outcome. At present, there is no vaccine available for use in humans and the ones used in livestock are either poorly immunogenic or cause severe adverse effects. The economic impact of this pathogen {{in the form of}} livestock losses and restrictions on the trade of animals and animal products as well as its significance in relation to public health underscores the importance of developing safe and effective vaccines. The main focus of this thesis was to evaluate existing vaccines and novel vaccine candidates, with special emphasis on vaccine platforms practical in resource‐poor areas. It is difficult to maintain a cold‐chain during transit in Mozambique and the inactivated Rift Valley fever virus vaccine is transported more than 2000 km within the country before it is administered to livestock in Zambezia Province. For that reason, the vaccine was evaluated for its ability to induce antibodies in cattle after storage at ambient temperatures. Importantly, the storage and transport conditions used in Mozambique did not have an adverse effect on the antibody responses induced by the vaccine. When performing the aforementioned study, we found evidence of previous Rift Valley fever virus infections in livestock in Maputo Province, a region where there had been no recorded evidence of the virus since 1969. A cross‐sectional seroprevalence study was undertaken to examine the need to implement a vaccination program in this particular province. Unexpectedly, seroconversion was observed in 37 % of the investigated cattle, suggesting that this pathogen is widely distributed throughout Maputo Province. Rift Valley fever virus is highly pathogenic and to circumvent the handling of replicating virus during the vaccine manufacturing process would be advantageous. Other highly desirable vaccine‐characteristics are low production costs, high immunogenicity {{to reduce the number of}} doses, and a non‐invasive delivery route to avoid the challenge of maintaining sterility of hypodermic equipment. To fulfill <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>requirements</b> we developed and evaluated three different vaccine strategies i) DNA vaccines, ii) vaccine based on virus‐like particles, and iii) plant‐derived protein subunit vaccines. All candidates induced vaccine‐specific antibody responses in mice and the DNA‐ and virus‐like particle‐based vaccines conferred protection against Rift Valley fever disease. Here, we raise the question of extending the vaccination program in Mozambique to include Maputo Province. We show that the inactivated virus vaccine is well‐suited for that purpose until more effective alternatives are available. In the search for such an alternative, we evaluated three vaccine candidates. One of those candidates, vaccine based on virus‐like particles, was found to have good prospects as a future Rift Valley fever virus vaccine...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a summary {{on the research}} conducted towards {{the development of a}} model to document and to visualize,dynamically, software requirements. The research consisted of analyzing the necessary information focusing on documenting different types of requirements in an efficient way, and how quality factors may be part <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>requirements.</b> The research has also considered, the traceability (Aizenbud-Reshef et al, 2006) among the requirements and different types of artifacts developed during a software project.
