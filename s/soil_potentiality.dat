40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that {{the choice of the}} most suitable uses based in soil and climatic factors, complemented with socio-economic criteria, promotes sustainable use of rural land. There are, however, different methodologies for defining the soil suitability to agroforestal systems or natural and seminatural ecosystems, including agricultural uses, forest plantations, agro-forestry areas and priority areas for nature conservation. Many of these methods rely on decision support systems based on multicriteria spatial analysis. In this study we intended to determine the different levels of suitability for agro-forestry use in a subregion located in the center of Portugal, near the border with Spain. To the effect we used a set of soil and topographic variables. The legal constraints and land cover were also included. The suitability evaluation was performed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A spatial analysis was also performed in order to confront the land use matrix with the <b>soil</b> <b>potentiality.</b> This analysis allows to identify areas where the use and management it is in accordance with their suitability, as well as areas where the use must be subject to a conversion or at least to a change of management mode.

40|$|Remote sensing {{documents}} and thematic maps {{were used to}} provide comprehensive views of surface-bound conditions such as soil and vegetation. The culrent work appljes a paranletric methodology, adopted from the FAOiUNEiP and UNESCO methodology for assessment and mapping of soil degradation at a scale of 1 : 250, 000. The study area {{is located in the}} northern part of Sinai peninsula, Egypt. a region with considerable agriculture potential. Satellite MSS, TM imageries and aerial photographs were utilized to provide data on soil conditions, land cover and land use of the study area. ARC/LNFO software was used to manage and manipulate thematic data, to process satellite images and tabular data. ERDAS software is utilized to derive the Nolmalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values and IDRISI software for generation of the slope degree. A system is established for rating soil paranleters, slope, climate and human activity. The rating values serve as inputs into a modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) to calculate the present state and risk of soil degradation processes (i. e. water esosion, wind erosion, salinization and physical degradation). The produced maps and tabular data show the risk and present status of different soil degradation processes. The study area, in general, is exposed to slight hazard of water erosion, but to high risk of wind erosion, slight to high salinization and slight to moderate physical degradation. It is recommended to use a GIS in detailed and very detailed studies for evaluating <b>soil</b> <b>potentiality</b> in agricultural expansion...|$|E
40|$|The authors tried a phytosociological {{vegetation}} survey as {{a fundamental}} part of landscape evaluation and planning in the humid sub-tropical Izena Island located {{in the northern part}} of Okinawa, southwest Japan. It is the purpose of this paper to clarify the geographical distributions and the characters of plant communities, which are affected not only by the land potentiality but also by a lot of human interventions in the Izena Island. As a result of plot survey, forest and weed vegetation of the Izena Island has been divided into 9 plant communities, and 2 plant communities further Into 4 and 2 subordinate communities. That is; 1.

Oxalis corniculata-Panicum repens community, Under the recognition of the spatial distributions of the differential species in the communities, actual vegetation map was drawn up as Fig. 3. Then the authors discussed on the relationship between land potentiality, especially <b>soil</b> <b>potentiality,</b> and plant communities by using vegetation map. They also discussed on the relationship between land use, including religious preservation of special areas in the Izena Island, and plant communities. They found the distributions of plant communities in the Izena Island to be characterized not only by the influences of land conditions such as soil pH but also by the great influences of human interventions such as agricultural land-use. Such discussions will be useful when we consider the fundamental character of the landscape complex in the humid sub-tropical islands of Japan...|$|E
40|$|Restoring <b>soil</b> <b>potentialities</b> using zaï and compost in Yatenga (Burkina Faso). Land {{degradation}} is {{a serious}} problem in the soudano-sahelian zone of Burkina Faso. Studies were carried out between 2002 and 2004 in two villages, Somyaga and Ziga in the Yatenga Province. The main objectives were to identify and characterize the <b>soil</b> <b>potentialities</b> and constraints applying the geomorphopedological approach and to assess the possibilities of restoring degraded soils by implementing the zaï technique and incorporating composted manure with natural phosphorus. Soil identification based on representative morpho-sequences has shown the prevalence of leached tropical ferruginous soils. These soils therefore present a weak potentiality and a poor fertility without fertilization and conservation practices. Experiments with the zaï technique and composted manure enriched with burkina phosphorus conducted over three years markedly improved the above mentioned soil parameters and sorghum yields. Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and pH increased in the compost treatment. The ANOVA analysis has shown significant differences between compost treatments and the untreated control plots. In general, the increased yields vary from 300 to 500 kg. ha- 1 according to the village in our experiment. About 40 species of herbaceous plants and trees have been regenerated by the zaï system in degraded land. Future research is needed to identify vegetal material adapted to the zaï system and to assess the impact on the micro biomass...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn spatial planning, {{soil quality}} data is poorly {{considered}} {{when it comes}} to design urban planning documents. However, there is a growing concern about urban renewal and urban sprawl limitation, as well as about biodiversity conservation within urban areas. In this respect, assessing soil quality in order to better conceive more sustainable urban plans becomes an objective in the agenda. The poster presents the UQualiSol-ZU Project (funded par the French Ministry of Ecology, GESSOL Program) aiming at investigating whether and how scientific knowledge on soil quality could be included into land use planning. Its objectives were: 1) to assess the expansion of urbanization in a given territory, and what planners do about soil quality, 2) to analyse the existing regulations to identify how such soil quality could be taken into account, and 3) to investigate which kind of knowledge could be used by planners. Its ultimate goal was to design an index displaying how relevant land use is, given the multiple <b>soil</b> <b>potentialities.</b> This methodology was developed on two periurban municipalities next to Marseille (Southern France) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. This article reviews {{soil and}} crop {{production}} information from Bukidnon, Northern Mindanao, the Philippines. It {{focuses on the}} parent materials involved in forming Bukidnon soils, clay forming minerals, soil classification, types and location distribution, physico-chemical characteristics, <b>soil</b> <b>potentialities</b> and constraints, and the yields of the major crops. Literature. The information discussed was gathered from on-line journals, a compilation of agricultural research reports published in Northern Mindanao, published theses, government data and reports, and books. Bukidnon has existing soil information that could be useful for assessing and monitoring soil fertility and in establishing a regional Land Information System (LandIS). Soils in the Province are classified according to Soil Order, Great Group and soil type under the USDA Soil Taxonomic Classification. Data on crop production yields are also available. Soil information is intended more for crop fertilization planning at the broader scale. Studies on geomorphopedology and the interactions of elements within the soil are scarce. The relationship between soil formation and its characteristics and plant responses is not discussed here. Conclusion. The recommendations arising from this study are: (1) to conduct in-depth geomorphopedological studies in marginal areas of undifferentiated soils, (2) to study the relationship between soil characteristics and crop responses including nutrient assimilation by plants, focusing on phosphorus (P), and (3) to develop a generic protocol and establish a LandIS for mountain areas that can be replicated in other areas in Mindanao, the Philippines...|$|R
40|$|The Guarani Aquiferous System is Latina America’s biggest strategical {{freshwater}} {{reserve and}} one of the world’s biggest aquifer systems, with approximately 70 % of its area located in Brazil. The recharging areas and adjacent areas are regions of natural water infiltration, with high vulnerability. In these areas there are different agricultural production systems {{and some of them are}} intensive systems. The objective of this work was to evaluate the land suitability of the watershed of the Espraiado stream, Ribeirão Preto-SP, located on the recharging area of the Guarani Aquifer, considering the potentialities of lands and waters in the studied region. The area of the watershed is approximately 4, 131 ha, with predominance of sugar cane culture. The data base project was constructed in the Geographic Information System (GIS) Idrisi 32. The land suitability evaluation was done considering the intensive agricultural production system predominant in the watershed, adjusted for the vulnerability of the areas of recharge and for the methodology of SIG. In the watershed, Oxysols and Nitosols are dominant, with good or regular aptitude for cultures in intensive agricultural systems. The presence of Quartzipsamments is also observed, and it occurs in small band. These soils play an important role in the direct recharge of the water-bearing due to its high water permeability. The land suitability evaluation in Guarani Aquifer must consider the <b>soils</b> <b>potentialities</b> and the impact the agricultural use can cause in the quantity and the quality of the infiltrated water...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate <b>soil</b> type <b>potentiality</b> and reaction in relation to the scattered remaining vegetation species and to quantify soil suitability for growing field crops. Adham area witnessed serious land degradation due to the rapid expansion of Rain-fed Mechanized Farming and overgrazing. Consequently the low crop yield enforced the local communities to shift to the alternative sources of income generating activities particularly those related to forest products like charcoal making firewood production logging and tree lobbing. By using Randomized Complete Block Design RCBD with emphasizes on Macro nutrients particularly the Nitrogen Phosphorous and potassium NPK in addition to soil pH and Electrical Conductivity EC. random soil samples each with three levels of depths 0 - 15 15 - 30 30 - 45 cm. were collected. All collected data were analyzed in the laboratory. The result of revealed several types of soils including the cracking and non -cracking clay sandy and red soils. The result of statistical analysis depicted variability in NPK pH and EC between the different locations and soil depths. Furthermore the result showed an association between some studied soil attributes and the spatial distribution of the vegetation species. Rational use through participatory approach is recommended for natural resources management conservation and sustainability. Moreover further study using space technology also recommended...|$|R
40|$|Documentation of {{cultivation}} {{practices of}} cotton in different soil types* Cotton as a crop {{as well as}} commodity has a unique place in the economy of India as it {{plays an important role}} in the Agrarian and industrial activities of the nation. Being grown in acreage of 8. 4 million hectares with the production of 30. 5 million bales and productivity of 568 kg ha- 1 (James Clive, 2009). The deployment of Bt cotton over the last eight years has resulted in India becoming the number one exporter of cotton globally as well as the second largest cotton producer in the world. The productivity of India's average is low compared to first largest producer of Bt cotton. Cotton production is affected by genetic <b>potentiality,</b> <b>soil,</b> climatic conditions and management factors. Improved understanding of factors that limit yield on farmers field is necessary to boost the production. To overcome the productivity limitations under varied agro-climatic conditions necessitates strategic and applied research on cotton. With this, an attempt has been made to document the existing cultivation practices of Bt cotton in different soil types in major Bt cotton growing areas of Bailhongal taluk of Belgaum district.
