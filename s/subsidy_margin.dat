40|$|GATT permits {{its members}} to retaliate against unfair trade {{practices}} committed by its signatories. However, GATT imposes requirements on this retaliation. These include establishing injury to the pertinent industry in the offended country, requiring that the unfair practice be currently in existence, and mandating that duties not exceed the dumping or <b>subsidy</b> <b>margin.</b> Because the injury requirement gives the foreign government a period lead in introducing the export subsidy, the home government is unable to completely restore the competitive balance when switching costs are present because of these restrictions. Thus, GATT may induce the behavior that it seeks to deter. Copyright 1996 by The London School of Economics and Political Science. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} application of “Agreement on Subsidy and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) ” of WTO to non-market economies (NMEs).   The difficulties of application of ASCM to NMEs mainly lie in two basic questions.   The first is how to separate the subsidy and government involvement in a NME.   The second is how perfect the market {{has to be in}} order to qualify as a benchmark to calculate subsidy margins. By focusing on WTO rules and substantial WTO cases, this dissertation analyzes the difficulties in application of ASCM to NMEs from seven perspectives in legal practice.   They are: (1) whether subsidies in public utility enterprises in China are actionable, because such subsidies as upstream subsidies pass benefits to export-oriented enterprises? (2) whether subsidies may continue after privatisation of state-owned companies? (3) whether the loans provided by state-owned banks in China are subsidies? (4) whether it is fair to evaluate the subsidies margins of the land use rights in China by using out-of-country benchmark? (5) tax-incentive subsidies in China; (6) the calculation of a <b>subsidy</b> <b>margin</b> in NMEs; and (7) whether currency manipulation constitutes a subsidy? The dissertation finds that the difficulties of application of ASCM to NMEs are due to a number of reasons.   First, the deficiencies of ASCM cannot explain {{the application of}} ASCM to NMEs; second, if applicable to NMEs, there are difficulties in defining a subsidy in NMEs and in calculating a <b>subsidy</b> <b>margin</b> in NMEs; third, the non-unification of assessment of a NME results in unfairness to China which faces different standards of evaluating a NME.   Even though China has been a market economy in some countries’ view, it is difficult to be recognised as a market economy by all countries.

5000|$|Countervailing {{duties in}} the U.S. are {{assessed}} by the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce which determines whether imports in question are being subsidized and, if so, by how much. If there is a determination that there is material injury to the competing domestic industry, the Department of Commerce will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to levy duties in the amount equivalent to <b>subsidy</b> <b>margins.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{forecast}} {{growth for}} Medicare spending {{has created a}} highly visible budgetary impasse {{between the president and}} Congress. Both favor the growth of health plans that accept risk and would promote them by creating less restrictive options than heretofore. Nonetheless, the conference bill the president vetoed for other reasons did not envision price competition among plans but relied upon administered prices instead. The bill allowed Medical Savings Accounts; because of selection, the Congressional Budget Office estimated they would slightly increase Medicare costs. By eliminating the <b>subsidy</b> at the <b>margin</b> to hiring a resident, the bill's provisions would shift demand for residents down. ...|$|R
40|$|By {{negotiating}} the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, the Canadian government sought {{to ensure its}} exporters more secure and predictable access to the huge United States market, where a majority of Canadian foreign trade is conducted. Canadian exporters were especially concerned with the increased imposition of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duties (CVD) by the United States. Trade laws in the United States are effected through the International Trade Commission (ITC) and the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce (ITA). These bodies {{are central to the}} bifurcated, quasi-judicial administrative system used in the United States to resolve antidumping and countervailing duty complaints. The ITC determines whether the imported product has materially injured a domestic producer, and the ITA determines the amount of <b>subsidy</b> or dumping <b>margin</b> which exists...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} that the design of welfare housing allowances of the sort used in Ontario is badly flawed, while classic rent and income conditioned (RIC) housing allowances, for people who are not on welfare, have a good design. RICs pay a percentage of the difference between actual rent (up to a maximum) and affordable rent, while welfare allowances pay actual rent up to a maximum. The paper focuses on Manitoba and Ontario. Evidence suggests that 1989 Ontario changes, including increasing the <b>subsidy</b> at the <b>margin</b> to 100 percent of rent from 80 percent, increased average allowances much more than 25 percent. Further evidence suggests that in Ontario welfare allowances either increased housing consumption or "welfare landlords" exerted monopoly power to inflate rents. Evidence indicates the Manitoba RIC did not have these effects. The paper argues that not differentiating between Toronto and the rest of Ontario results in major inequities. ...|$|R
30|$|In 2007, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} the Livestock Gross Margin insurance program for dairy farms (LGM-Dairy). This program became available in August 2008 for dairy producers in 31 states. In July 2010, LGM-Dairy availability was expanded to all of the lower 48 states (Gould and Cabrera, 2011). LGM-Dairy allows dairy farm operators to purchase insurance to protect against unanticipated low gross milk margins defined as the difference between estimated milk revenue and feed costs. Under this insurance policy, an indemnity at the end of coverage period is the difference, if positive, between the market anticipated gross margins at contract purchase and actual gross margins. The milk revenues and feed costs protected are based on current futures contract settle prices that exist at insurance sign-up. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Class III milk, corn, and soybean meal futures and options markets are used as an information source in the setting of premiums and to determine insurance indemnities {{at the end of the}} contract. The contract premiums are established to be actuarially sound in the sense that over the long-run, the expected indemnities paid equal premiums before subsidy is applied (Gould and Cabrera, 2011). Past research has highlighted the importance of premium <b>subsidies</b> for dairy <b>margin</b> insurance (Valvekar et al., 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{elaborate}} economic models for estimate the economic indicators and optimization of process for breeding of suckler cows herd in selected farm. The hypotesis of diploma thesis was {{the assumption that the}} determination of material and relevance of impact for production indicators of breed will allow to model economic effectiveness of the selected breed farm. Concurrently it can be assumed that is possible to model the influence and impact of market prices for the final profitability of farming, respectively the level of cost per kilogram of live weight gain of animals. Aplications of created models will help to determine the economic turning point and create different models of market situations. The practical part was solved in a company named Ptenínský mlýn, which is located in village Ptenín in district of Plzeň - jih. The company is family character and is involved in an ecological system of agriculture. The company produces cattle for subsequent breeding as well as for fattening and slaughtering. Informations about the company were collected by forms, which were based on 79 asking points. Identified informations were about basic data of the breed and of his expansion in the years. All metods of calculation were created in Program Microsoft Excell 2010. In diploma thesis were determinated the results of the profitability selected breed farm, model s of turning point of cost and revenues, the change of profitability of breed when the parametrs of entrance are changed. On the basis of the calculations was discover negative profitability of breed in the case of absence of <b>subsidies.</b> The <b>margin</b> of profitability confirms this fact. The turning point of sold calves rates actually situation without subsidies. It was discover that for profitability on the based of available documents of company for year 2014 of zero is necessary to sale the calves must to have weight about 1065 kg, which is not possible in real situation. The profit of zero is able to have from to sale of 33 cattles. Without subvences is necessary to reduce of total cost 332 400 CZK, for to have total cost amount 601 600 CZK for to have economy of profitability on level zero. From this situation is clear that subvence allow activity of business and other investments in expansions...|$|R
