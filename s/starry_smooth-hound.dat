50|$|The common smooth-hound has a grey-brown {{back and}} is white on its underneath. It is often {{confused}} with the <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> which has white spots on its back. The <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> can often have faded spots which leads to misidentification. Another shark it is often confused with is the tope shark although the common smooth hound has a larger second dorsal fin. Due to {{the similarities between the}} common smooth-hound and other sharks, misidentification occurred for a long time.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> (Mustelus asterias) is a houndshark of {{the family}} Triakidae. It is found on the {{continental}} shelves of the northeast Atlantic, between latitudes 61° N and 16° N, from the surface {{to a depth of}} 200 m. It can grow up to a length of 1.4 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> mostly {{feeds on}} crustaceans, such as crabs, lobsters, and slipper lobsters, and molluscs. It matures at {{a length of}} about 80 to 85 cm. It is an {{ovoviviparous}} fish, retaining its eggs in its oviduct where the young are nourished by the egg yolk and the oviduct's secretions. Seven to 15 young are in a litter, and they are about 30 cm long at birth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 140 cm. It is grey or greyish-brown with a {{scattering}} of small white spots on its dorsal (upper) surface and white on its ventral (under) surface. It is a long, lean fish with a somewhat rounded snout and rows of shallowly projecting teeth. The two dorsal fins are of similar shape, but the hindmost one is a little smaller than the foremost. A notch occurs in the upper lobe of the caudal fin and the lower lobe is of medium size.|$|E
5000|$|The IUCN, in its Red List of Threatened Species {{lists the}} <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> as [...] "Least Concern". The {{justification}} {{for this is}} that it has a wide range and is common {{in the northern part of}} its range where its population seems to be steady. In the Mediterranean Sea, it is less common and is targeted for human consumption along with the closely related common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus). Numbers in the Mediterranean have dwindled and in this region it might qualify for [...] "Vulnerable" [...] status were it not plentiful elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{paternity}} {{was investigated}} in the <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> shark, Mustelus asterias Cloquet, 1821. Analysis of 12 pregnant females and their embryos, at four microsatellite loci, showed that at least 58 % carried multiply-sired litters. Paternal skew was observed, with one male siring most of the embryos within a litter, although no patterns of association were detected between {{the identity of the}} father and the size or the uterine position of the embryos. Sperm storage was observed in the oviducal glands of all twelve females. Results shed light on the complexity of reproductive strategies and selective processes in M. [*]asterias. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 119 – 125...|$|E
40|$|According to reports, the {{following}} 16 species have extended their distribution to other Mediterranean areas or {{have made a}} new appearance in other regions. The first category includes {{the following}} organisms: The rare and common Indo-Pacific seaweed Codium arabicum (Lebanese coasts), the acari Thalassarachna affinis (Marmara Sea), and the non-indigenous nudibranch Flabellina rubrolineata, which has also been found in many {{other areas of the}} Aegean Sea. In addition, the rare sea slug Thecacera pennigera (Piccolo of Taranto), the fangtooth moray Enchelycore anatina (National Marine Park of Zakynthos, Ionian Sea), the carangid Seriola fasciata (Gulf of Antalya), Lagocephalus sceleratus (SE. Ionian Sea), the reticulated leatherjacket Stephanolepis diaspros (Slovenia, N. Adriatic Sea), the marbled stingray, Dasyatis marmorata (NE Levantine), the <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> Mustelus asterias (Iskenderun Bay, NE Mediterranean), the cephalopod Ommastrephes bartramii (Ionian Sea) have also been reported. The Atlantic crab Dyspanopeus sayi has expanded to many Italian areas and the blue crab Callinectes sapidus to a lake in N. Greece and in the S. Adriatic Sea. Finally, Farfantepenaeus aztecus has been found in the Ionian Sea, thus showing its wide expansion in the Mediterranean. The larval stages of Faccionella oxyrhyncha have been found, after many years, in the Aegean Sea and the first report of an existence on intersexual acari Litarachna duboscqi in Split (Adriatic Sea) was reported...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{estimate}} age, growth and longevity of M. asterias based on interpretation of band pairs in sectioned vertebrae. Age and growth of 106 male and 114 female <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> sharks (Mustelus asterias) were estimated by counting band pairs on unstained sectioned vertebrae. Growth curves were fitted to the length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy and Gompertz models. The 1 -parameter von Bertalanffy-L 0 provided the best fit for males (L∞ = 104 cm TL, L 0 = 30 cm TL and estimated K = 16 0. 224) and females (L∞ = 133 cm TL, L 0 = 30 cm TL and estimated K = 0. 136). Longevity was estimated to be 11. 8 and 20. 2 years for males and females respectively. The length weight relationship is also presented for 304 male and 424 female M. asterias. The von Bertalanffy model was fitted to weight-at-age data. These estimates can form the basis of future work on the assessment and management of this species.

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{long-term}} angler-led {{tagging programme}} was to gain information about seasonal changes in distribution of the <b>starry</b> <b>smooth-hound</b> shark Mustelus asterias, along theDutch coast for management and conservation purposes. Between 2011 and 2014, M. asterias comprised 92 · 6 % (n= 2418) of the total elasmobranch catch (n= 2612) by the licenced group of taggers within the Dutch Delta of which 2244 M. asterias were fin-tagged with plastic rototags. Sex and total length (LT) composition inside the eastern tidal basin(Oosterschelde) were significantly different, i. e. more females and larger individuals, than outside indicating a pupping ground, which was confirmed by the capture of 30 newborn pups (≤ 32 cm). The distribution pattern of reported recaptured M. asterias (return-rate 3 · 6 %, n= 80) showed a circannual migration between summering in the southern North Sea and wintering in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, and suggests that M. asterias is philopatric. The Dutch angling season for M. asterias runs from approximately mid-May to mid-October when the water temperature is above 13 ∘ C. Recaptures of eight mature females, but no males in the Bay of Biscay, indicate partial spatial segregation by sex, where mature females migrate over larger distances than immature females and males. These observations, with the absence of recaptures in other known summering areas (i. e. the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel), suggest that the southern North Sea is used by a separate population. Implications for management and recommendations to improve and expand the study approach are discussed...|$|E
