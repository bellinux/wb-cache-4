5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} generated by Porteous's {{book and the}} 2011 television documentary, the FBI is standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a prime <b>suspect.</b> <b>It</b> cites a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.|$|E
25|$|As of December 2011, no release has {{occurred}} {{and there has}} been no other word about it. In addition, the page for the film on IMDb was removed, leading many to <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was cancelled.|$|E

On August 2, White returned to the Blue Note where Hopkins identified him and he was arrested. White confessed and led police to his dumping ground in Goshen on August 4.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently lost, the Risley Park Lanx re-emerged in the 1990s, as a {{supposed}} heirloom of the now-notorious art forger Shaun Greenhalgh and his family. Bought by private buyers and {{donated to the}} British Museum, it was on display for several years, but was removed when its authenticity became <b>suspect.</b> <b>It</b> was later determined to be a complete fabrication. The fate of the original, genuine, Risley Park Lanx is unknown.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Dillema a {{forensic}} test on body cells obtained from her clothing {{found that there was}} a Y-chromosome in Dillema's DNA which could mean she was a genetic mosaic. Dillema was probably an 46XX/46XY woman also known as ovotesticular DSD or true hermaphroditism. Most of the other women on the team at the time <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was an attempt by Jan and Fanny Blankers to eliminate an opponent, although this has never been confirmed.|$|E
25|$|My {{favorite}} {{king was}} King Melchior, {{because he was}} the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. I <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.|$|E

25|$|Although, former {{president}} Lee {{claimed that the}} Four Major Rivers Restoration Project was Eco-friendly, its results face severe criticism from environmental experts {{both inside and outside}} of the government. It is well described in the report in Hankyoreh, August 2013. The algae known to kill eco system of a river proliferated during summer season for many years and experts <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> is because of weirs that slow or stop water flow. Furthermore, water quality near the Nakdong river deteriorated significantly after weirs were installed. The government already spent more than 3 trillion Korean won to keep the water potable as of August 2013.|$|E
25|$|This {{one-shot}} {{reveals that}} before {{she joined the}} G.I. Joe team, {{she was a member}} of the Army. She was given training above and beyond what a female was allowed to receive at the time, as the generals putting G.I. Joe together wanted a secret weapon that enemies would not <b>suspect.</b> <b>It</b> is revealed that during her time in the CIA she is first given a mini-crossbow, which eventually becomes her weapon of choice. Also, much of her history with martial arts is revealed. Her last mission before joining the G.I. Joe team faces her off against Destro for the first time. It is because of the intelligence that she gathers, as well as her skills, that she is brought into the team.|$|E
25|$|A {{week after}} the assassination, the Warren Commission was {{established}} by President Johnson to investigate the assassination, with Chief Justice Earl Warren leading the investigation. Ten months later, the Commission issued its report with the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone when he killed Kennedy. Privately, his widow cared little about the investigation, stating {{that even if they}} had the right <b>suspect,</b> <b>it</b> would not bring her husband back. Nevertheless, she gave a deposition to the Warren Commission. Following the assassination and the media coverage that had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Jacqueline stepped back from official public view, apart from a brief appearance in Washington to honor the Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.|$|E

500|$|Data hypothesizes that {{a single}} crystal is not intelligent, but when linked to other crystals, their {{intelligence}} is formidable. As the crystalline life form accesses higher-level functions of the Enterprise's computer, Picard and the crew try to transport it to the surface but the crystal blocks all attempts to transport it off the ship. Data and Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) discover the presence of cadmium in the crystal and <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> has photoelectric properties. [...] They disable {{the lights in the}} medical lab and the crystal immediately begs for life. Picard peacefully negotiates to return the crystal life form {{to the surface of the}} planet where Starfleet will institute a quarantine, leaving the life form to live in peace.|$|E
500|$|The murder investigation, named Operation Green, {{was led by}} Sir Edward Crewe, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, and {{included}} 100 police officers and 50 support staff from the West Midlands and West Mercia forces. Detectives viewed {{hundreds of hours of}} CCTV footage, gathered more than 100 separate exhibits and interviewed witnesses. Evidence was analysed by scientists from the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham. Martin Whittaker, the scientist who headed the FSS team, spoke of the huge volume of evidence: [...] "The team pulled together every strand of forensic evidence to create a kind of 'spider's web' and in the centre of it all... was Philip Smith. In 20 years of working for the FSS, I have never had to deal with so much evidence in relation to one <b>suspect.</b> <b>It</b> was quite overwhelming." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, Hollis {{hoped that}} the {{difference}} between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay, and the title was intended to reflect this focus. A flashlight was implemented by Steve Ellis, who had been responsible for much of the multiplayer mode of GoldenEye 007, but it {{was not included in the}} final game due to the limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious, commenting in 2006 that [...] "Even today, you can see game developers struggle to make light and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective. I <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> will take a few years before significant and pervasive gameplay innovation occurs here." [...] Although not all these intended features were realised, the game contains more advanced lighting than its predecessor. For example, lights can be shot out to create darkened areas, gunfire and explosions illuminate rooms dynamically, and the player can use infrared and night vision goggles.|$|E
500|$|In his {{confession}} Lace described {{how he had}} disposed of DeSimone's jewellery by throwing the items on to the railway embankment beneath Copnor Bridge in Portsmouth. In September 2009 a team of six British Transport Police officers with specialist training in forensic search techniques spent two days examining the area {{in an attempt to}} recover the jewellery. Although the ground had been the subject of extensive redevelopment in previous years and recovery of the items was considered unlikely, detectives authorised the operation to ensure every attempt had been made to find and return them to her parents. None of the items was discovered. DCI McTavish said of the search: [...] "It is recognised that in the years since Teresa's murder {{there has been a lot}} of disturbance and redevelopment around the railway track, but there was still a possibility that items may have lain undisturbed. Although we have not been able to recover any items linked to either Teresa or the <b>suspect</b> <b>it</b> was important we did everything to explore this final aspect of the case." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “Currently, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} of real or potential genetic ‘deterioration’ due to harvesting, nor any reason to <b>suspect</b> <b>it.</b> Indeed, indications are that kangaroo numbers would have to be reduced to extremely low levels for genetic impacts to become important and by then other impacts, such as demographic disruption, would be overridingly important”.|$|E

There are too many far more reasonable explanations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Directorate has {{indirectly}} faced significant {{controversy over}} the HAARP project.

2500|$|Hume's {{religious}} views were often <b>suspect.</b> <b>It</b> was {{necessary in the}} 1750s for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of heresy. However, he [...] "would not have come {{and could not be}} forced to attend if he said he was {{not a member of the}} Established Church". Hume failed to gain the chair of philosophy at the University of Glasgow for his {{religious views}}, too. He had published the Philosophical Essays by this time which were decidedly anti-religious. Even Adam Smith, his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern public opinion would be against it.|$|E
