5|$|The Denver Broncos {{selected}} Pastrana in {{the eleventh}} {{round of the}} 1969 NFL Draft with the 270th overall pick. In 1969, he saw action in two games and did not attempt a pass, but did have one reception for 15yards. The following season, he played in five games, including three as starter in relief of Steve Tensi, who had suffered a shoulder injury. Against the San Diego Chargers, Pastrana drove the team to the opposing 35-yard line and within field goal range, but he was knocked unconscious and could not call a crucial timeout. As the offensive captain, {{he was the only}} person authorized to do so under the rules at the time, and the clock expired to result in a 1717 <b>stalemate.</b> The <b>rules</b> regarding timeouts were changed after the season. In 1970, Pastrana completed 29of 75pass attempts for 420yards and one touchdown, rushed 14times for 89yards and one touchdown, threw nine interceptions, and was sacked eight times. Five of his interceptions came against the Kansas City Chiefs. Pastrana suffered a severe concussion that effectively ended his career {{near the end of the}} 1970 season and also heavily altered his personality. In the 1971 offseason, head coach Lou Saban held try-outs with seven quarterbacks. By the end of August, Pastrana made the cut to the final three, alongside Don Horn and Steve Ramsey, and was the only quarterback remaining on the team from the prior season. Pastrana, however, was cut in early September.|$|R

40|$|Waste is society’s dirty secret. Mira Engler 1 The {{madness of}} it all: {{round and round}} in circles we go, where it stops nobody knows. That we are trapped in a vicious circle {{should come as no}} surprise. Though {{contemporary}} civilization is driven by the desire to attain ever-higher standards of living, the consequences leave much to be desired. The more intractable the challenges, the more entrenched our resistance to confront them. We dream of an endless supply of goods while neglecting the aftermath of consumption-generated waste. Prosperity seems to ripen the principle of decay. Recalling Goethe’s ballad The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, efforts to keep means in check often spiral out of control. A self-reinforcing dynamic is fueled by the open-ended drive for material wealth. 2 And so the circle continues. While some believe that technology is the answer, others are more skeptical, arguing that reductive technical idealism will only exacerbate the mess and accelerate the proverbial end. So, where are we heading? The responses range from the ecstatically positive to the emphatically negative. Optimism is played against pessimism, as is utopia against dystopia. 3 But before the doomsayers are dismissed outright in favor of a more upbeat future vision, clues may be taken from the downside of this <b>stalemate,</b> where crisis <b>rules</b> in an apocalyptic setting...|$|R
