40|$|Guinea is the West African {{country which}} is {{currently}} the most prevalent for <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> The littoral area is the region where most <b>of</b> the recent <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> cases have been described, especially the mangrove <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> foci <b>of</b> Dubreka and Boffa where Glossina palpalis gambiensis is the vector. Loos islands constitute a small archipelago 5  km apart from the capital, Conakry. Medical, animal, and entomological surveys were implemented in these islands in Oct-Nov 2006. No pathogenic trypanosomes were found in these surveys. The locally very high tsetse densities (up to more than 100 tsetse/trap/day) linked to pig rearing, constitute a high potential risk for humans (taking into account populations movements with neighboring active <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> foci <b>of</b> the Guinea littoral, and the history <b>of</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> on these islands), and for the economically important pig rearing, {{as well as a}} danger for tourism.

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} {{epidemiological study}} of trypanosome infections in domestic livestock {{was carried out}} over thirteen months in Busia District, an endemic area <b>of</b> Rhodesian <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> It was demonstrated that chemoprophylaxis of domestic livestock with Samorin ® (Rhône Poulenc, France) could virtually eliminate the reservoir of potentially human infective T. brucei spp. infections in domestic animals.

40|$|AbstractTrypanosoma brucei, the causative agent <b>of</b> the African <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> <b>of</b> humans, {{and other}} kinetoplastid flagellates {{belong to the}} eukarytotic {{supergroup}} Excavata.

As it is amenable to most techniques of forward and reverse genetics, T. brucei was subject to several studies of its iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein biogenesis and thus represents the best studied excavate eukaryote. Here we review what is known about the Fe/S protein biogenesis of T. brucei, and focus especially on the comparative and evolutionary interesting aspects. We also explore the connections between the well-known and quite conserved ISC and CIA machineries and the tRNA thiolation pathway.

About 397 domestic animals including 225 pigs, 87 goats, 65 sheep and 20 dogs were sampled. The card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis was positive for 254 (63. 98 %) animals while the parasitological examinations (thin blood film and capillary tube centrifugation) revealed 86 (21. 66 %) trypanosome infections. The PCR based method revealed 140 (35. 26 %) infections of trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon. The genetic characterization of these 140 positive samples revealed 89 different alleles: 82 in pigs, 72 in goat, 60 in sheep and 48 in dog.

In order to update transmission features <b>of</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> in that focus, we have conducted epidemiological and entomological surveys in March-April 2008. Methods: Epidemiological investigation relied on a casecontrol study using a quantitative and qualitative methodology (a structured questionnaire).

25|$|Cattle plagues recurred {{throughout}} history, often accompanying {{wars and}} military campaigns.

40|$|The <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> focus <b>of</b> Campo lies {{along the}} Atlantic coast and extends along the Ntem River, which {{constitutes}} the Cameroonian and Equatorial Guinean border. It is a hypo-endemic focus {{with the disease}} prevalence varying from 0. 3 to 0. 86 % {{during the last few}} decades. Investigations on animal reservoirs revealed a prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense of 0. 6 % in wild animals and 4. 83 % in domestic animals of this focus. From 2001 to 2012, about 19 931 tsetse were collected in this focus and five tsetse species including Glossina palpalis palpalis, G. pallicera, G. nigrofusca, G. tabaniformis and G. caliginea were identified. The analysis of blood meals of these flies showed that they feed on human, pig, goat, sheep, and wild animals such as antelope, duiker, wild pig, turtle and snake. The percentage of blood meals taken on these hosts varies according to sampling periods. For instance, 6. 8 % of blood meals from pig were reported in 2004 and 22 % in 2008. This variation is subjected to considerable evolutions because the Campo HAT focus is submitted to socio-economic mutations including the reopening of a new wood company, the construction of autonomous port at "Kribi" as well as the dam at "Memve ele". These activities will bring more that 3000 inhabitants around Campo and induce the deforestation for the implementation of farmlands as well as breeding of domestic animals.

40|$|Trypanosomes are {{protozoan}} {{agents of}} major parasitic {{diseases such as}} Chagas' disease in South America and <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> <b>of</b> humans and nagana disease <b>of</b> <b>cattle</b> in Africa. They are transmitted to mammalian hosts by specific insect vectors. Their life cycle consists of a succession of differentiation and growth phases requiring regulated gene expression {{to adapt to the}} changing extracellular environment. Typical of such stage-specific expression is that of the major surface antigens of Trypanosoma brucei, procyclin in the procyclic (insect) form and the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) in the bloodstream (mammalian) form. In trypanosomes, the regulation of gene expression is effected mainly at posttranscriptional levels, since primary transcription of most of the genes occurs in long polycistronic units and is constitutive. The transcripts are processed by transsplicing and polyadenylation under the influence of intergenic polypyrimidine tracts. These events show some developmental regulation. Untranslated sequences of the mRNAs seem to play a prominent role in the stage-specific control of individual gene expression, through a modulation of mRNA abundance. The VSG and procyclin transcription units exhibit particular features that are probably related to the need for a high level of expression. The promoters and RNA polymerase driving the expression of these units resemble those of the ribosomal genes. Their mutually exclusive expression is ensured by controls operating at several levels, including RNA elongation. Antigenic variation in the bloodstream is achieved through DNA rearrangements or alternative activation of the telomeric VSG gene expression sites. Recent discoveries, such as the existence of a novel nucleotide in telomeric DNA and the generation of point mutations in VSG genes, have shed new light on the mechanisms and consequences of antigenic variation.

25|$|Regular active surveillance, {{involving}} {{detection and}} prompt treatment of new infections, and tsetse fly control is {{the backbone of}} the strategy used to control <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> Systematic screening <b>of</b> at-risk communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant patients with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis.

Therefore, WHO established a Network on Treatment Failure and Drug Resistance in <b>Sleeping</b> <b>Sickness.</b> One <b>of</b> its objectives is to improve isolation of T. b. gambiense from relapsing cases for research on drug resistance mechanisms. Trypanosoma b. gambiense isolation techniques suffer from low success rates and long periods needed to adapt the parasite to its new host.

In this study, Grammomys surdaster (former Thamnomys surdaster) was investigated as a potential recipient for isolation of T. b. gambiense. Comparative experimental infections of Swiss mice, Wistar rats and G. surdaster thicket rats with T. b. gambiense clearly show that this trypanosome grows faster in G. surdaster.
