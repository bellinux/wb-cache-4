50|$|Starting at the {{beginning}} of the UN Decade for Women in 1975, the Women in Development approach to international development began to inform the provision of development aid. Some academics criticized the Women in Development approach for relying on integrating women into existing development aid paradigms instead of promulgating <b>specific</b> <b>aid</b> to encourage gender equality. The Gender and Development approach was created in response, to discuss international development in terms of societal gender roles and to challenge these gender roles within development policy. Women in Development predominated as the approach to gender in development aid through the 1980s. Starting in the early 1990s Gender and Development’s influence encouraged Gender Mainstreaming within international development aid.|$|E

When reflecting on the role {{at the end of}} the posting in 2011, Cox described President Mori signing the Pacific Partnership for Development Agreement with Australia as one of her major achievements. The agreement meant that the Federated States of Micronesia had a separate, direct agreement with Australia for aid, with <b>specific</b> <b>aid</b> goals. Cox had also signed a treaty for the exchange of tax information between Australia and the Marshall Islands, in 2010.|$|E
40|$|In {{people with}} {{cerebral}} palsy, severe neuromotor disability and communication problems make standard neuropsychological tests impossible. Therefore, alternative methods and <b>specific</b> <b>aids</b> {{must be developed}} to allow patients to autonomously respond to the examiner's questions. In the present individuals and study, a neuropsychological evaluation was made {{of a group of}} eight individuals with cerebral palsy, and severe neuromotor and verbal disabilities, and a group of 19 normal subjects matched for mental age. The tests were administered using an autonomous selection method in which the patient selects the various responses through <b>specific</b> <b>aids</b> without the examiner's interference. Patients' group performances in visuo-spatial and memory tests were on average lower than the mean of the control group. In the verbal domain, patients' scores were comparable to those of normal children in all tests but one assessing the comprehension of syntactically complex sentences. An analysis of the patients' individual performances also revealed heterogeneous cognitive profiles: some patients presented a homogeneously distributed cognitive impairment and others a more selective one. This finding is particularly important for planning differentiated learning programmes, and identifying suitable communicative instruments in rehabilitative and educational settings...|$|R

50|$|Opponents of {{debt relief}} {{argue that it}} is a blank cheque to governments, and fear savings will not reach the poor in {{countries}} plagued by corruption. Others argue that countries will go out and contract further debts, under the belief that these debts will also be forgiven in some future date. They use the money to enhance the wealth and spending ability of the rich, many of whom will spend or invest this money in the rich countries, thus not even creating a trickle-down effect. They argue that the money would be far better spent in <b>specific</b> <b>aid</b> projects that actually help the poor. They further argue that it would be unfair to third-world countries that managed their credit successfully, or do not go into debt in the first place. That is, it actively encourages third-world governments to overspend in order to receive debt relief in the future.Others argue against the conditionalities attached to debt relief. These conditions of structural adjustment have a history, especially in Latin America, of widening the gap between the rich and the poor, as well as increasing economic dependence on the global North.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper aims at {{addressing}} the problem of what makes <b>specific</b> <b>aiding</b> to decide within public policy making problem situations. Under such a perspective it analyses some basic concepts such as “public policy”, “deliberation”,“legitimation”, “accountability” and shows the necessity to expand the concept of rationality {{which is expected to}} be behind the acceptability of a public policy. We then analyse the more recent tentative to construct a rational support to policy making, that is the “evidence-based policy making” approach. Despite the innovation introduced with this approach, we show that it basically fails to address the deep reasons for which supporting the design, implementation and assessment of public policies is a hard problem. We finally show that we need to move one step ahead, specialising decision-aiding methodology to meet the policy cycle requirements: a demand for policy analytics...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} two-step {{approach}} of assessing whether major donors {{of foreign aid}} have met recent demands for less proliferated and better coordinated aid efforts. First, we calculate Theil indices revealing the concentration of each donor’s aid on recipient countries and <b>specific</b> <b>aid</b> sectors. Second, we map overlaps of aid from different donors and over time to analyze the degree of coordination. Our results point to a wide and persistent gap between the rhetoric of political declarations and the donors’ actual aid allocation during the period 1995 - 2006. Few donors have specialized on a limited set of recipients and aid sectors, and coordination has remained elusive...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Actual–Ideal Discrepancy (AID) model of self-esteem determination {{dating back to}} James (1890 / 1963).

We propose a multiple-item latent difference approach to AID as applied {{to a range of}} self-concept domains and sub-domains in young adolescents from two different countries (UK: N = 402; Italy: N = 250). The effects of the AID remained elusive for most domains and sub-domains; indeed, the effects of the <b>specific</b> <b>AIDs</b> were generally trivial and only appearance-AID became significant in the combined sample. Also AIDs did not substantially explain the more general self-concepts beyond what was explained by the actual domains. Even if they had been significant, AID effects would have been, at best, trivially small and detectable only using appropriate latent-variable methodologies coupled with large sample sizes; thus undermining the psychological meaning of the AID model...|$|R

40|$|Why do donors {{continue}} to send foreign aid to corrupt countries, despite that corruption is increasingly seen as detrimental to {{economic and environmental}} development? This study unpacks the complex relationship between corruption and aid fatigue and suggests that while corruption reduces support for foreign aid, reactions to corruption in aid depend on both {{the circumstances under which}} corruption occurs and prospects for accountability. Building on scenario-based experiments, the results show that the end results of aid, the scale and the perceived social normality of corruption influences the effect of corruption on aid fatigue. They also show that corruption generates <b>specific</b> <b>aid</b> fatigue (directed towards individual projects or actors) rather than support for generalized (across-the-board cuts) in aid levels. This contributes towards explaining why previous studies have failed to find a link between corruption and aid fatigue and how citizens deal with the ”aid-corruption paradox”, i. e. that the need for foreign aid is often the greatest in corrupt environments...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is given of UNESCO and UNICEF’s current thinking {{and practice in}} the education sector, especially on a human rights-based approach. Economically irrational policy implementation can {{be a result of}} inefficiency and ineffectiveness of resource allocation; therefore, policy assessment is necessary. Moreover, the deadline for EFA goals is approaching and it seems that EFA goals will not be met under current policy implementation by 2015. This paper bases its analysis on economic theory and offers policy implications and suggestions through a thought experiment and empirical case studies. An {{analysis is}} conducted in two levels, general perspective on education and <b>specific</b> <b>aid</b> projects/programmes. Analysing policies from economic perspective gives a new impression and dimension towards UNESCO and UNICEF. This paper argues that a human rights-based approach is economically rational and sustainable. Identifying rights-holders and duty-bearers cannot only induce demand and supply for education but also theoretically make individuals’ demand for education to be more inelastic to the prices or costs of education. However, in terms of effectiveness of project/programme investment, adjustments are required in the process of project/programme implementation. As a result, there is an ambiguous tension between theoretical and practical issues. Policy implications and suggestions are made accordingly.
