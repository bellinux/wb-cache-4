40|$|This study aims to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility for classifying kiwifruit into shape grades by adding a single camera to current Chinese <b>sorting</b> <b>lines</b> equipped with weight sensors. Image processing methods are employed to calculate fruit length, maximum diameter of the equatorial section, and projected area. A stepwise multiple linear regression method is applied to select significant variables for predicting minimum diameter of the equatorial section and volume and to establish corresponding estimation models. Results show that length, maximum diameter of the equatorial section and weight are selected to predict the minimum diameter of the equatorial section, with the coefficient of determination of only 0. 82 when compared to manual measurements. Weight and length are then selected to estimate the volume, which is in good agreement with the measured one with the coefficient of determination of 0. 98. Fruit classification based on the estimated minimum diameter of the equatorial section achieves a low success rate of 84. 6 %, which is significantly improved using a linear combination of the length/maximum diameter of the equatorial section and projected area/length ratios, reaching 98. 3 %. Thus, {{it is possible for}} Chinese kiwifruit <b>sorting</b> <b>lines</b> to reach international standards of grading kiwifruit on fruit shape classification by adding a single camera...|$|R

40|$|During the {{recycling}} process of end-of-life waste electric and electronic equipment (EOL-WEEE), downgrading of valuable technical polymers {{has to be}} avoided by separating the collected material in fractions of high purity. Most EOL-WEEE pieces are doped with several additives to improve their mechanical, electrical and chemical properties. Common additives are flame retardants, antioxidants. light stabilisers, fillers, dyes and pigments. Their concentration varies typically from traces to several percent. Waste pieces containing brominated flame retardants (BFR) and additives with heavy metals have to be automatically identified and removed from the waste stream to be recycled. This {{is due to the}} significant environmental problems during the waste management phase caused by these substances. To establish an economically feasible recycling process which meets these requirements, high speed automatic sorting systems performing the identification of both the polymer and the detection of the critical additives at a rate of several parts per second are required. In the scope of the European project "Sure-Plast" (BRPR-CT 98 - 0783) a prototype automatic identification and <b>sorting</b> <b>line</b> has been set-up and evaluated for material specific sorting of EOL-WEEE pieces.
