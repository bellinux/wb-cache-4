5|$|As Part III progresses, the {{narrative}} switches to describing their upper-class {{life on the}} island, and filling details of the lifestyle the family was born into. The story of the voodoo practicing Haitian family maid is elucidated: she escaped Trujillo's massacre of Haitians and came to work for Laura, although much of her family was not <b>so</b> <b>lucky.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon {{retrieving}} {{all three}} plasma crystals and destroying the Omegamatic Warp Drive, Keen is confronted by McMire, who {{tells him that}} he will not be <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> the next time before teleporting away; Keen responds that he still defeated McMire, and will make it home in time for dinner. The game then congratulates the player on winning, and warns that with McMire still at large, Keen never knows when he will be called on again to defend the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Thảo's main partner Phát headed towards Tan Son Nhut Air Base — the country's {{military}} headquarters — {{to capture}} {{it with an}} assortment of marines, paratroopers and special forces troops. At the time, most of the senior officers had been in meetings with American officials at Tan Son Nhut {{since the start of the}} morning, and Khánh left at 12:30. The plotters had secured the cooperation of someone working inside the Joint General Staff headquarters. This collaborator was supposed to have closed the gate so Khánh would be held up, but left them open. Some of the other senior officers in the Armed Forces Council were not <b>so</b> <b>lucky,</b> and were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings in the complex remained under junta control.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the other}} senior {{officers}} in the Armed Forces Council were not <b>so</b> <b>lucky,</b> and they were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings of the military complex remained under junta control. Khánh managed to escape to Vũng Tàu. His plane was just emerging from the hangar and lifted off just as rebel tanks were rolling in, attempting to block the runway and shut down the airport. Phát's ground troops also missed capturing Kỳ, who fled through the streets in a sports car {{with his wife and}} mother-in-law. Kỳ ended up at Tân Sơn Nhất, where he ran into Khánh; the pair flew off together to regroup.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, the Crusade {{was seen}} as a huge debacle with many monks writing that it could only have been the work of the Devil. The {{anonymous}} monk who wrote the Annales Herbipolenses chronicle in Würzburg mentioned that for decades afterwards, noble families in Germany were ransoming back knights who had been taken prisoner in Anatolia using Armenian middle-men. The camp followers who had been taken prisoner and sold into slavery by the Turks were not <b>so</b> <b>lucky.</b> Of the 113 individuals known by name to {{have been involved in the}} Crusade, 22 died, 42 returned home while the fate of the last 49 is a mystery. Despite the distaste for the memory of the Second Crusade, the experience of the crusade had notable impact on German literature, with many epic poems of the late 12th century featuring battle scenes clearly inspired by the fighting in the crusade.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after departing Bodrum, UB-14 {{had just}} cleared the Greek island of Kos and {{was off the}} nearby island of Kandeloussa when von Heimburg sighted several {{potential}} victims. The first ship seen was the British hospital ship , headed to Alexandria from the Dardanelles. Von Heimburg, seeing the properly identified hospital ship, allowed Soudan to pass unmolested. The next ship was not <b>so</b> <b>lucky,</b> however. It was the unescorted , a Canadian ocean liner pressed into troopship duties. Royal Edward was headed {{in the opposite direction}} from Soudan: from Alexandria to the Dardanelles with reinforcements for the British 29th Infantry and a small group with the Royal Army Medical Corps, all of whom were destined for Gallipoli. Von Heimburg launched one of his two torpedoes from about a mile (2km) away and hit Royal Edward in the stern; the ship sank stern-first in six minutes, with a large loss of life. Soudan and several other ships were able to rescue nearly 700 men, but over 900 died. Royal Edward, at , was also among the largest ships hit by U-boats during the war. While evading the rescue ships, which included two French destroyers, UB-14s compass broke down again, forcing a return to Bodrum {{on the morning of the}} 15th.|$|E

25|$|On a {{sunny day}} in August, 1940, a German war plane {{attacked}} the communities of Duncormick and Campile. It released four bombs over Duncormick railway station, luckily the bombs missed the station, making four huge craters in a nearby turnip field. But the community of Campile was not <b>so</b> <b>lucky,</b> two people were killed.

25|$|We’re <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> to {{have gotten}} here, and if we {{look back on the}} fact that we were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E

25|$|A trusted follower, Olof Olsson, {{was sent}} ahead {{to locate a}} {{suitable}} place to settle in the United States. He arrived in New York on the Neptunus on 16 December 1845. There he met a fellow Swede, Olof Gustaf Hedström, who suggested that Olsson contact his brother, Jonas Hedström, who was living in Victoria, Illinois. Other followers were not <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> as several vessels foundered during the voyage, consigning hundreds of Janssonists to the deep. Many others were killed by cholera during the trip, or soon after they arrived.|$|E
25|$|It's really {{difficult}} {{for a person to}} create their own life and their own freedom. It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to get what they want. There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> that we've never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.|$|E
25|$|Sensing victory, Moreau ordered Grenier's {{divisions}} and Grouchy to attack around noon. Undeterred by Latour's weak pressure on his front, Ney swung {{to his right}} and began pounding Kollowrat's troops. Pressing his attack, he overran their positions, capturing 1,000 soldiers and ten cannon. Grouchy also returned to the offensive. Hemmed in on three sides by Ney, Grouchy and Richepanse, Kollowrat's column finally disintegrated in a disorderly rout. Archduke John escaped capture on a fast horse, but many of his men were not <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> and thousands of demoralized Austrians and Bavarians surrendered. In addition, over 60 artillery pieces fell into French hands.|$|E

25|$|The {{third and}} final series focused on a {{different}} character each week but with the overlaps creating a more complex layering of the plot, more akin to a one-off episode of a situation comedy (albeit with intertwined plots) than a traditional sketch show. The end of each episode features a white van swerving to avoid a pedestrian and crashing into a garden wall. Some residents escape unharmed, while others are not <b>so</b> <b>lucky.</b> A red plastic bag is seen being blown by the wind through the town in every episode, indicating that all the stories occur simultaneously. It is the only series {{that does not include}} a laugh track.|$|E
25|$|Dancers {{have also}} taken their dances overseas. A dance on Moscow's Red Square {{provided}} no incident, but other square dancers {{have not been}} <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> in other countries (similarly, Russians visiting cities in Manchuria have joined in the square dances). Two mainland Chinese women visiting Taipei decided to do their dance in the hotel lobby, attracting attention from guests there and causing friction with hotel management. A group dancing in Sunset Park, home {{of one of the}} earliest Chinatowns in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, made headlines in August 2014 when its leader was arrested for violating a city ordinance forbidding sounds over 45 decibels; the charge was later dropped.|$|E
25|$|Advancing again though mountainous countryside, another tank {{slid off}} the track and rolled six times down a 200-foot slope. The crew were not <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> this time, as one was killed and the rest injured. The tank was a write-off. The race was on, however, to drive the Germans back, and the North Irish Horse was rushed in again to relieve the hard-pressed 142nd RAC Regt at Maria del Monte. On 3 September, it crossed the Conca river, {{followed}} by an attack on Coriana to secure the bridges crossing the Marano river. On 8 September, the regiment was withdrawn to a safer area {{in the knowledge that}} the Gothic Line had been broken.|$|E

Due to a weak economy, her brother Jim (Harry Hamlin) has converted the family business from a cattle farm into a sheep farm, despite their father's (Lawrence Dane) objections. To help out, Lisa decides she will stay to help on the farm. She adopts a border collie from the local animal shelter and trains it as a sheepdog, naming the dog Lucky. Jim and Lisa decide to enter Lucky in a sheep herding contest, but when a severe windstorm sparks a forest fire, Lucky helps rescue a girl named Kristina (who is lost and almost died) and brings her to safety. While doing <b>so,</b> <b>Lucky's</b> leg is burned, and {{it looks as if}} she {{will not be able to}} compete.|$|R

25|$|The Crown Princess, however, was not <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> {{with the}} {{marriage}} plans {{for her daughter}} Viktoria. In 1881 {{she fell in love}} with Prince Alexander I of Bulgaria and her mother tried to obtain permission from the Emperor for the engagement. Despite being a sovereign, the Bulgarian prince was born of a morganatic marriage, which placed him in a position of inferiority in front of the proud House of Hohenzollern. In addition, Alexander's policy in his Principality of Bulgaria was greatly disliked by Russia, a traditional ally of Prussia. Bismarck feared that marriage between a German princess and an enemy of Tsar Alexander II of Russia would represent a blow to the League of the Three Emperors, i.e. the Austro-German-Russian alliance. The Chancellor, in the meanwhile, gained the disapproval of William I to the union, much to the dismay of Victoria and Frederick.|$|E
25|$|Lawson in the 1890s {{records that}} a young lady once fell over the cliff near Craig Na'an; however, her Victorian style {{garments}} caught the wind like a parachute and she escaped with her life and some broken bones that soon knit back together. A visitor in a group from Stranraer was not <b>so</b> <b>lucky</b> and fell to his death on his way down from the summit. A shocking death {{was that of a}} lad from Girvan who was sitting amongst loose rocks, pulling out stones and throwing them into the sea when a very large boulder started to move and crushed him. The stone was too heavy to shift and help from the mainland was required to extract the body of the unfortunate victim. In 1887 a ten-year-old boy died whilst collecting eggs at the West Craigs.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, the “Flying Armadillos” of HMM-777 traded their aging UH-34Ds for the CH-53A Sea Stallion and was redesignated as a heavy Marine {{helicopter}} squadron (HMH). HMH-777 was deactivated due {{to massive}} budget cuts in 1980, however, on October 1, 1980, the squadron’s personnel and aircraft were reformed as the Bravo Detachment of HMH-772, {{which was based}} at NAS JRB Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. For the next thirteen years, the Dallas detachment supported 4th MAW, including a deployment to Okinawa in support of Desert Storm, yet in 1993 the Reserve heavy-lift squadrons were realigned, and both HMH-772 detachments were deactivated. Det Alpha was reactivated as HMH-769, but HMH-777 was not <b>so</b> <b>lucky.</b> On 1 April 1993, HMH-772, Det Bravo, retired the squadron colors in a brief ceremony to close the final chapter on the “Flying Armadillos” and what has, so far, been the final chapter of rotary aircraft in MAG-41.|$|E
