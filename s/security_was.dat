5|$|A Japanese raiding party {{destroyed}} the bridge over Tuliahan River; Chase's <b>security</b> <b>was</b> not good enough.

5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over {{the merits of the}} early work on the hydrogen bomb project into a matter of a security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where <b>security</b> <b>was</b> necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable to charges by a Congressional aide that he was a Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, metal {{detectors}} {{were added to}} the gates and <b>security</b> <b>was</b> doubled after a person was killed in a shooting during a crowded Mother's Day. It happened after two visitors were involved in a fight, apparently over a drug exchange before their visit to the park.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal <b>security</b> <b>was</b> dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E

5|$|CNN {{reported}} {{that at least}} two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves. They did not see a child among the self-immolators. The CNN crew began filming the events from a distance, but were quickly intercepted by military police, who detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. The authorities then put out the flames consuming the other four people's clothing. A police van came to collect the badly burnt man, and two ambulances arrived almost 25 minutes later to collect the other four. The square was completely closed, and <b>security</b> <b>was</b> tight the next day, the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. Police monitored public access to the square for the New Year celebrations, had fire extinguishers ready, and prevented Falun Gong practitioners from opening banners.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrations {{were planned}} to take place during the show. A protest rally by Unite Against Fascism (UAF) had been held in London {{on the night of}} Tuesday 20 October, and sixteen coachloads of UAF protesters were {{expected}} on the day. Amid concern over the safety of residents, Hammersmith and Fulham council asked for clarification of the BBC's security arrangements, and pushed for an alternative location. Although the protest organisers UAF rejected suggestions that the protests would be violent, <b>security</b> <b>was</b> stepped up at BBC Television Centre. Simon Darby of the BNP stated there would be no counter-demonstration. Griffin expressed fears over his safety for his arrival and departure. Extra officers of the Metropolitan Police were drafted in to maintain order outside the studios, while the BBC recruited an extra 60 security guards for inside the studio.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 the State Department's {{physical}} <b>security</b> <b>was</b> {{split between}} {{foreign and domestic}} branches.

5|$|In April1995, when Parliament {{decided to}} nationalize twenty-six {{regional}} airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated {{a proposal to}} build a new airport in Båtsfjord. At the time Widerøe was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31March1997. In December1995, Widerøe took delivery of their fifteenth Dash8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve Båtsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the cost estimates for the new airport increased from NOK95 to 125million. By June1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK178 million, including a new county road for NOK8million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Widerøe used the Twin Otter until 1April2000, when the route was taken over by larger Dash8 aircraft. Airport <b>security</b> <b>was</b> introduced on 1January2005.|$|E
5|$|Pre-planning for a year, {{including}} {{ten months}} for production issues {{and two months}} for his character, was tiring for Aamir. As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due {{to the lack of}} comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. <b>Security</b> <b>was</b> set up and a special housekeeping team was brought {{to take care of the}} crew's needs. Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers. Initially, they did not want to part with their equipment, but after much coaxing, they gave in. They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used in that day and era.|$|E

Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after <b>security</b> <b>was</b> intensified.|$|E

Basic track construction was completed in November 2007 though fit-out and testing continued into 2008.|$|E
5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national <b>security</b> <b>was</b> a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E

5|$|The {{changing}} world {{order that the}} war had brought about, in particular {{the growth of the}} United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy. Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States. This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the Great Depression, for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations. The issue of the empire's <b>security</b> <b>was</b> a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British economy.|$|E
