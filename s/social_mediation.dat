25|$|Slum {{relocation}} strategies rely on {{removing the}} slums and relocating the slum poor to free semi-rural peripheries of cities, sometimes in free housing. This strategy ignores several dimensions of a slum life. The strategy sees slum {{as merely a}} place where the poor lives. In reality, slums are often integrated with every aspect of a slum resident's life, including sources of employment, distance from work and social life. Slum relocation that displaces the poor from opportunities to earn a livelihood, generates economic insecurity in the poor. In some cases, the slum residents oppose relocation even if the replacement land and housing to the outskirts of cities is free and of better quality than their current house. Examples include Zone One Tondo Organization of Manila, Philippines and Abahlali baseMjondolo of Durban, South Africa. In other cases, such as Ennakhil slum relocation project in Morocco, systematic <b>social</b> <b>mediation</b> has worked. The slum residents have been convinced that their current location is a health hazard, prone to natural disaster, or that the alternative location is well connected to employment opportunities.|$|E

It removed knowledge from the conditions of its production and from its social and cultural roots, much as the eyes see but are not themselves constrained by being seen. It introduced the prominent orthodoxies that still hold firm in the understanding of what science is: the myth of a univocal and fixed method; the rigid separation between subject and object, theory and data, and theory and observation; the search for a perfect language, purified of subjective references; and the mystical ideal of truth.|$|R

At the heart of constructivist philosophy is the belief that knowledge is not given but gained through real experiences that have purpose and meaning to the learner, and the exchange of perspectives about the experience with others (Piaget & Inhelder, 1969; Vygotsky,1978).|$|E

Opinion leaders are peers that can influence a message to an audience but they are not seen as an expert in their field.

Opinion formers are people that are knowledgeable in their field. This may be derived from their professional position, formal influence, job status or qualification over groups. Opinion leaders add another link in the communication chain process and act as meaning filter for the targeted audience.|$|E

5000|$|Critical rationalists {{hold that}} {{scientific}} theories {{and any other}} claims to knowledge {{can and should be}} rationally criticized, and (if they have empirical content) can and should be subjected to tests which may falsify them. Thus claims to knowledge may be contrastingly and normatively evaluated. They are either falsifiable and thus empirical (in a very broad sense), or not falsifiable and thus non-empirical. Those claims to knowledge that are potentially falsifiable can then be admitted to the body of empirical science, and then further differentiated according to whether they are retained or are later actually falsified. If retained, further differentiation may be {{made on the basis of}} how much subjection to criticism they have received, how severe such criticism has been, and how probable the theory is, with the least probable theory that still withstands attempts to falsify it being the one to be preferred. That it is the least probable theory that is to be preferred is one of the contrasting differences between critical rationalism and classical views on science, such as positivism, who hold that one should instead accept the most probable theory. (The least probable theory is the one with the highest information content and most open to future falsification.)Critical Rationalism as a discourse positioned itself against what its proponents took to be epistemologically relativist philosophies, particularly post-modernist or sociological approaches to knowledge. Critical rationalism has it that knowledge is objective (in the sense of being embodied in various substrates and in the sense of not being reducible to what humans individually [...] "know"), and also that truth is objective (exists independently of <b>social</b> <b>mediation</b> or individual perception, but is [...] "really real").|$|E
5000|$|It appears {{increasingly}} {{today that}} the new concept of [...] "commodity fetishism," [...] which {{has nothing to do}} with a hoax of consciousness (an inverted representation), is the central part of the intellectual heritage Marx. [...] "Commodity fetishism" [...] is not only a misrepresentation, much less an exaggerated adoration of goods. The [...] "fetish" [...] instead is to be referred to the structure of the commodity. It is then a theory of [...] "objective fetishism" [...] (Jappe) or radicalized, that is to say, so long as value (the objectification of the specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism), the goods and money, society is actually governed by the self-movement of created things themselves, and not by the subjective manipulation of the ruling classes. The subjects are not men, but it is rather their objectified relationships that are at the heart of socialization under capitalism. Fetishism, Postone notes, must be analyzed [...] "in terms of the structure of social relations constituted by forms of praxis and its seizure by objectifying the category of capital (and hence value). The Subject for Marx, like Hegel is so abstract and can not be identified with any social actor whatsoever [...] "(Postone, Time, p. 75-76). This is the world where abstract labour (which is not immaterial labor) becomes the social bond, <b>social</b> <b>mediation</b> that mediates itself, reducing actual work to a simple expression abstract labor. Abstract labor is then the source of alienation. The self-moving subject, Spirit, Geist, is misrecognized in Hegel, it is described by Marx as Capital and its self-valorization. It is not, Postone suggests, similar to Lukacs' use of Hegel, wherein the proletariat are identified as Spirit, for then spirit would be labour not emancipation.|$|E

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{enhancing}} traditionally <b>social</b> <b>mediation</b> practices, which {{are present in the}} Mozambican context, mostly in community courts, we needed to know {{the extent to which the}} existing practices can be considered as socio-pedagogical mediation practices in Mozambican communities. Starting from this concern (which is qualitative in nature), the research centered upon the sense in which <b>social</b> <b>mediation</b> practices are conducted in community tribunal setups, where the participants are some of those implicated in the <b>social</b> <b>mediation</b> practices. The study centered upon the community court of Mutauanha (Nampula, Mozambique). From the results acquired, the authors concluded that social practices of community mediation are highly valued by the community actors who give it a sense of pedagogy. Apart from what they learn from it, they value the aspect of mediation as key in the promotion of positive social relations. The participants of the research acknowledged the fact that judicial processes of <b>social</b> <b>mediation</b> have the potential of helping to strengthen the sense of community belonging, the potential of helping to develop strategies for conflict resolution, and finally, community courts have the potential of helping people with a the pedagogic power of being auto-formative. As far as the profile of the mediators is concerned, the study conducted concluded that although there is still no professional recognition of this kind of conflict resolution in other communities, those who have been involved in such kind of resolutions consider it to be positive and more conciliatory than what is followed in other situations. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} literary {{representations of}} personal proper name change from 1779 to 1800, arguing that these representations function as sites upon which cultural anxieties about social classification - in which notions of kinship, gender and class all play important roles - are negotiated. Reading imaginative prose literature by Frances Burney, Hester Thrale Piozzi, Charlotte Turner Smith and William Godwin alongside historical sources including journals and newspaper articles, tracts, letters, trial transcripts and legal judgments, I show that these representations of name change offer insights into how competing models of personal identity were envisaged {{to come into}} conflict. 	The thesis contributes to studies of eighteenth-century theories of language, by examining how proper names were understood to exist in relation to common names within lexicography and philosophy of the period. It seeks to enhance understanding of identity formation {{in the eighteenth century}} by arguing for the importance of naming practices in constructing identities through <b>social</b> <b>mediations.</b> It modifies the history of personal naming in England by offering original qualitative and quantitative research concerning the practice of surname change by Royal Licence. It argues that the eighteenth-century novel interrogates competing models of personal identity in dialogue with the laxity of English common law around issues of personal naming, which enables individuals in England to participate in a rich variety of self-fashioning practices. Finally, it offers a contribution to studies of eighteenth-century fame within the commercialised public sphere by arguing that excavating the mutation and material circulation of the personal proper name is key to understanding how ‘reputation’ worked to confer value and status. ...|$|R
