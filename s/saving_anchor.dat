40|$|In {{parts of}} the German media, {{with the support of}} a number of German economists, the ECB 2 ̆ 019 s low nominal {{interest}} rate policy is criticised as unnecessary, ineffective and as expropriating the German saver. This paper provides a review of the relevant arguments. It is recalled that returns on <b>savings</b> are <b>anchored</b> to the real rate of return on capital. Good monetary policy tries to avoid being a source of disturbance in itself, and may be able to smooth the effects of temporary external shocks, but beyond that cannot structurally improve the real rate of return on capital. Against this general background, the paper critically analyses a number of recent arguments as to why low interest rate policies could actually be counterproductive. Finally, the paper reviews what can be done about the medium to long-term real rate of return on capital, which remains in any case the basic issue for the saver, focusing on the specific case of Germany. The key policies identified relate to demographics, education, labour markets, infrastructure and technology. Low growth dynamics in the coming decades and correspondingly low real rates of return on investments are not inevitable...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologySome {{have argued}} {{that there is a}} “retirement savings crisis” (Munnell, Webb, & Golub-Sass, 2007). Accordingly, a number of {{approaches}} have been attempted to increase savings in defined contribution plans, {{the most common type of}} retirement savings plan. One approach that has shown promise is using behavioral economics principles to influence savings behaviors. Realizing that we are not purely rational consumers who make sound financial decisions based solely on numbers, behavioral economics focuses on the ways that internal and external factors influence human decisions. However, current approaches have been only moderately successful in increasing savings, with that success coming at a great expense to the employer. There is a need for simple, inexpensive approaches to getting people to save more for retirement. One potential behavioral economics focused approach that has not been attempted is to use the phenomenon of anchoring and adjustment to influence <b>savings</b> decisions. <b>Anchoring</b> refers to the way people make judgments of amount. They anchor on some initial value, an internal or external cue, and then adjust from it. Three experiments explore how anchoring can be used to influence retirement savings decisions. The first shows that the match threshold of a savings plan influences the amount people contribute to their savings. The second shows that, keeping plan attributes constant, the presentation of a high anchor value induces people to save more. The last explores some potentially fruitful uses of anchoring and adjustment theory that can be exploited when using an electronic enrollment form...|$|R

40|$|Bridges built {{today are}} larger, but also lighter, more slender, and more {{efficient}} structures {{than they were a}} century ago. As the free span of future suspension bridges increases, so does the need for reducing dead loads. Using Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) deck for suspension bridges is one way to achieve significantly lighter dead loads. Although the cost of FRP materials is more than double the cost of conventional concrete and steel deck, the hypothesis of this research is that the <b>savings</b> in the <b>anchoring</b> system and foundation and the reduction in weight of the main cables and suspenders will result in an overall cost reduction. It is also the hypothesis of this research that the use of FRP deck will impair the aerodynamic stability of suspension bridges. Significant studies have been performed on the use of FRP materials in bridge structures. The Federal Highway Administration initiated research on FRP composite bridge decks in the early 1980 s, primarily focused on deck strength and stiffness. In addition, several research projects have been conducted for health monitoring and to assess the long-term performance of FRP materials in bridge construction. Overall, the results suggest that long-term structural response was consistent and well within acceptable strength and serviceability design limits. For the research described in this dissertation, a parametric study was performed considering several bridges of different spans, materials, soil conditions, and material unit prices to study the economic and aerodynamic implications of using FRP deck in suspension bridges. Two groups of suspension bridges with 200 m, 400 m, and 600 m free spans were designed, one group using a reinforced concrete deck and the other group using the much lighter FRP deck. Since soil conditions affect the design of the anchorage and the overall cost of the bridges, three different soil types were considered in this research. The three soil conditions that were considered in this research were sound rock, medium sand, and stiff clay. Then, the aerodynamic stability was examined for all of the bridges using Selberg’s approach. Three-dimensional finite element analyses was performed for each bridge to obtain the values for the torsional moment of inertia and the vertical and torsional frequencies. These values were used in Selberg’s equation to determine the flutter speed of each bridge. A linear elastic analysis was performed to validate the three-dimensional finite element analysis results. The predicted flutter speeds obtained from the linear elastic approach and the finite element approach were within 9 % for all the spans and deck materials. The use of FRP deck reduced the predicted flutter speed of the 200 m span bridge, 400 m span bridge, and 600 m span bridges by 35 %, 36 %, and 37 %, respectively. Sensitivity cost analysis was performed of the 200 m, 400 m and 600 m span bridges founded in three different soil types. The three soil types considered were sound rock, medium sand, and stiff clay. The maximum savings was realized {{in the case of the}} weakest soil with the least resistance to the main cables tension force: stiff clay. Consistent with the research hypothesis, the cost of the FRP deck is more than twice the cost of the concrete deck, yet the overall cost savings for using an FRP deck were 30 % to 42 % of the cost using a concrete deck depending on span length and soil conditions. While earlier studies have demonstrated that the life cycle cost analysis could be advantageous in the long term because it requires less maintenance, the findings of the research described in this dissertation showed that the use of FRP deck could result in a 30 % to 42 % reduction in initial construction cost...|$|R
