25|$|An {{electron}} microscope is a microscope {{that uses a}} beam of accelerated electrons {{as a source of}} illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, {{electron microscope}}s have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A <b>scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> has achieved better than 50pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.|$|E
2500|$|A TEM can be {{modified}} into a <b>scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (STEM) {{by the addition of}} a system that rasters the beam across the sample to form the image, combined with suitable detectors. Scanning coils are used to deflect the beam, such as by an electrostatic shift of the beam, where the beam is then collected using a current detector such as a Faraday cup, which acts as a direct electron counter. By correlating the electron count to the position of the scanning beam (known as the [...] "probe"), the transmitted component of the beam may be measured. The non-transmitted components may be obtained either by beam tilting or by the use of annular dark field detectors.|$|E

50|$|Electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) is a {{semiconductor}} analysis technique {{performed in}} a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or <b>scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (STEM). It is used to identify buried junctions or defects in semiconductors, or to examine minority carrier properties. EBIC is similar to cathodoluminescence in that {{it depends on the}} creation of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor sample by the microscope's electron beam. This technique is used in semiconductor failure analysis and solid-state physics.|$|E
50|$|The focused {{electron}} beam of a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) or <b>scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (STEM) is commonly used. Another method is ion beam-induced deposition (IBID), where a focused ion beam is applied instead. Precursor materials are typically liquid or solid and gasified prior to deposition, usually through vaporization or sublimation, and introduced, at accurately controlled rate, into the high-vacuum chamber of the electron microscope. Alternatively, solid precursors can be sublimated by the {{electron beam}} itself.|$|E
50|$|Physicists use an {{electron}} microscopy technique that involves microanalysis using either energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), infrared spectroscopy(IR), Raman spectroscopy, or cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy, {{in which the}} entire spectrum measured at each point is recorded.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are {{the tools}} of choice for {{material}} science research, since they provide information on the internal structure {{of a wide range}} of specimens. These sophisticated machines are operated manually by skilled technicians, who execute complex and repetitive procedures, such as measuring nano-particles, using mainly visual feedback. Hence, there is a need for new global control strategies to automate these procedures. These strategies, how-ever, must be based on a firm understanding of the microscopes from the system theoretical perspective. To the best of our knowledge, such perspective is lacking in the literature. Thus, it is provided here through a new modeling framework that facilitates the future development of global control strategies. The paper also aims to introduce <b>scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> microscopy as an important and untapped area of application for control engineers. I...|$|R
