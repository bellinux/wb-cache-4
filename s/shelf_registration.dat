40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} shelf offerings to raise equity capital in the U. S. market. Shelf offerings have recently become the key method to offer primary equity as the capital raised via shelf offerings now accounts for 80 % {{of the value of}} U. S. seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Notwithstanding their importance, shelf offerings have attracted little attention in the finance literature. The first essay {{examines the}} drivers of the gradual increase in the use of shelf offerings and consequent decrease in the volume of traditional SEOs. The primary proceeds from shelf offerings have increased more than five times over the last decade: from $ 3. 4 billion in 1997 to $ 18. 9 billion in 2007. We argue that the shift in SEO issue method to shelf offerings is due to the decreasing level of information asymmetry of equity issuers over time. The results suggest that increased institutional ownership rather than other measures of information asymmetry determines the change in the choice of issue method over time. The second essay uses shelf offerings to analyze how firms select the type of security to issue conditional on a limited set of possible choices nominated by the firm in a <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> statement. We use debt and equity offerings issued under allocated and universal <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> statements in the U. S. market and artificial firm-year observations where firms could sell securities but did not. The analysis of conditional security choice finds support for the pecking order hypothesis, trade-off theory, and market timing. This suggests that a firm's external financing behavior has not changed due to the adoption of Rule 415 providing for shelf offerings. The third paper examines the intra-industry transfer of information inferred from the announcements of shelf registrations and offerings. The results show that intra-industry effects exist. Specifically, the announcement of a <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> conveys new information that has shareholder wealth implications to investors about rival firms. The stock price of rival firms is significantly positively affected during a bull market and significantly negatively impacted when the market is bearish. In contrast, we find that a shelf offering is a firm specific event...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of corporate bond markets has been constrained in many emerging economies, {{partly because the}} regulatory model is implicitly designed for stand-alone public offerings. Corporate bonds are intrinsically more suitable for non-retail investors than for retail investors. Nonetheless, the prevailing regulatory model puts an excessive emphasis on disclosure and investor protection as well as government oversight, regardless of targeted investors. Such a non-differentiating regulatory approach disconnects issuers from investors by considerably raising opportunity costs to issuers.

This represents a dramatic shift from the 1980 s, during which the overwhelming majority of firms favored traditional over shelf-registered offerings. We find that the growth in shelf use is related to firms increasingly valuing and using the option feature of <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> to defer offerings. Moreover, the evidence indicates that the way firms now use shelf offerings resolves the shelf under-certification problem and results in no larger market penalties and significantly lower underwriter fees relative to non-shelf offerings.

40|$|U. S. {{companies}} that need capital may choose between selling securities {{in the private}} and public markets. These venues differ in terms of direct issuance costs, the required information disclosed, the liability incurred, and the mechanics of the capital-raising process itself. During the last two decades, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has deregulated private offerings by broadening their investor base and increasing secondary market liquidity. At the same time, SEC policy has bifurcated the offering process in the public market into two distinct segments based largely on company size and seasoning. Large public issuers have seen a gradual deregulation and acceleration of their capitalraising processes. Important changes for issuers include allowing them to incorporate information into registration statements by reference to Exchange Act reports, to use <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> to speed up offers, and to place securities offshore with less regulatory uncertainty. Though small issuers enjoy some of the benefits of these changes, deregulation of their offerings has been somewhat less pronounced.

40|$|The piece {{examines}} {{proposals for}} changing the current system for registering securities under the Securities Act of 1933. Under the current transaction-based system, issuers must register each non-exempt public offering of securities. Despite the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s rule-making power, regulatory revision, at least {{with respect to the}} implementation of any major changes to the existing federal securities regulation landscape, has traditionally followed a somewhat cyclical model. First, there is discussion in the academic and professional literature, commenting on, criticizing or proposing changes to some facet of the existing regulatory system (“public debate”); then, either overlapping with or following this public debate, the SEC may informally float non-binding suggestions for changes, through presentations at conferences, or unofficial articles and publications written by SEC staff members (“agency debate”). Again, perhaps overlapping with the agency debate, the SEC may next issue a formal statement, such as a release, containing proposals to address, and even further shape the discourse, seeking comments on the statements (“agency proposal”). After renewed public debate, and taking into consideration, to varying extents, the comments made, the SEC then exercises its rule-making power and formalizes the revisions into rules (“agency action”). Because of the cyclical nature of the model, as new rules are enacted and put into effect, courts may have an opportunity to interpret them or to pass on their constitutionality, and commentators and the private bar have an opportunity to evaluate the success of the new rules and any deficiencies or other issues arising therefrom, generating additional public debate. Thus, {{in the aftermath of the}} agency action, the cycle starts all over again (“next public debate”). The agency action portion of the model has become much easier for the SEC to accomplish in recent years. The SEC is now authorized by statute to go beyond rule-making simply to carry out the provisions of securities laws. Agency action to adopt a company registration system is the next logical step in the progression from a transaction-based registration system to a company-based registration system. This progression includes the public debate and agency action that was the precursor of company registration - the adoption of the integrated disclosure system for the primary offering and secondary trading markets and the adoption of the <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> process. This was followed by the penultimate step towards a company-based registration system, the universal shelf. Arguably, the entire federal securities regulatory system fits into the cyclical model. This Article, however, is limited to an exploration of the company registration proposal put forth by the SEC in July 1996 in its historical context. Part II of this Article is an application of the cyclical model to the adoption of the integrated disclosure system and the <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> process. Part III is an application of the cyclical model to the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s company registration proposal as a logical outflow of prior debates, including a discussion of possible issues left unresolved by or raised by the company registration proposal that may generate the next public debate, with a recommendation that the SEC adopt company registration...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT TWO ESSAYS ON INVESTOR SENTIMENT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS BY HSIN-HUI CHIU May 2, 2006 Committee Chair: Dr. Jason T. Greene Major Department: Finance Using monthly open-end {{mutual fund}} flows {{as a proxy}} for {{investor}} sentiment, I am able to examine the impact of sentiment on IPO volume and underpricing. I find that issuers’ filing decisions are significantly affected by the predicted future sentiment around the expected IPO dates. Furthermore, sentiment has an impact on the final offer price setting and over-allotment options exercised. While previous research documents IPO cycles with respect to other proxies for investor sentiment, I am able to examine IPO cycles and underpricing with respect to sentiment along with investor risk preferences. I hypothesize that a going public firm will try to issue its IPO when investor risk preferences are favorable to the firm’s own risk characteristics. Empirical results based on 5, 661 initial public offerings between 1986 and 2004 are consistent with my hypotheses that issuers not only time the market with sentiment in general, but also attempt to incorporate investor risk preferences into their going public decisions. Furthermore, underpricing is more severe when firms issue equity during months with large inflows into equity mutual funds. In my second essay, I find that SEO firms appear to time market efficiently because of the shorter filing periods compared to the average 2 - 3 months of the IPOs. Also, sentiment not only affects a SEO offer price setting but also affects the over-allotment options exercised. I examine two subgroups of the SEO samples: <b>shelf</b> <b>registration</b> and non-shelf SEOs. I find that shelf-registered SEOs incorporate investor sentiment into offering price to a greater degree compared to regular SEOs. Lastly I find that investor risk preference plays a role in firms’ decision to file prospectuses with the SEC. In other words, firms rationally decide the timing of filing based on the predicted investor preference and try to match firm characteristics with investor preference around the expected SEO date...|$|E
