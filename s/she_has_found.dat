Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go.

Seruba tells the Doctor <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice.

25|$|When a {{honey bee}} swarm {{emerges from a}} hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a {{suitable}} new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>found.</b> She uses a dance similar to the waggle dance to indicate direction and distance {{to others in the}} cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as Apis dorsata. This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the game, Naija {{discovers that}} all of the ruined civilizations <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> {{throughout}} the game were destroyed by a god, [...] "the Creator", who was jealous of the rising power of that civilization or of their gods.

There she discovers that the Creator fell into the ocean as a child, and bonded with an ancient spirit to gain god-like powers.
