25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, the Central Park Conservancy, the United States Department of Agriculture, and several {{city and state}} {{agencies}} have been fighting an infestation of the Asian long-horned beetle, which {{has been reported in}} Long Island and Manhattan, including some parts of Central Park. The beetle, which likely was accidentally shipped from its native China in an untreated <b>shipping</b> <b>crate,</b> has no natural predators in the United States, and the fight to contain its infestation has been very expensive. The beetle infests trees by boring a hole in them to deposit its eggs, at which point the only way to end the infestation is to destroy the tree. Several thousand trees were infected in the city and later removed, including 2 trees that were removed from Central Park.|$|E

25|$|AF Ser. No. 42-13571 – in {{the private}} {{collection}} of the late Walter Soplata in Newbury, Ohio. This was the first prototype to be converted to the bubble canopy used on production B-36s. It was {{on display in the}} 1950s and 1960s at the former site of the Air Force Museum, now the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. When the museum's current location at Wright-Patterson was being developed in the late 1950s, the cost of moving the bomber was more than simply flying a different B-36 to the new location and the aircraft was slated to be scrapped. It was cut up at the old museum site by August 1972. Instead of being completely disposed of, Soplata bought it and transported the pieces by truck to his farm, where it sits today. The bomb bay currently contains a complete P-47N still packed in its original <b>shipping</b> <b>crate.</b>|$|E
25|$|The show {{went into}} hiatus late in 1979 when Garner {{was told by}} his doctors {{to take time off}} because of {{numerous}} knee injuries and back trouble, as well as an ulcer. He sustained the former conditions largely because of his insistence on performing most of his own stunts, especially those involving fist fights or car chases. Because of his physical pain, Garner eventually opted not to continue with the show some months later, and NBC cancelled the program in mid-season. It was alleged that Rockford had become very expensive to produce, mainly due to the location filming and use of high-end actors as guest stars. According to sources, NBC and Universal claimed the show was generating a deficit of several million dollars, a staggering amount for a nighttime show at the time, although Garner and his production team Cherokee Productions claimed the show turned a profit. Garner told a story to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show that the studio once paid a carpenter $700 to build a <b>shipping</b> <b>crate</b> for a shoot-out on a boat dock, though there were shipping crates on the dock. The script often called for Garner to damage his car, so the car could be sold, repaired, and repurchased for each episode.|$|E

50|$|Given {{that the}} cajón comes from slave musicians in the Spanish colonial Americas, {{there are two}} {{complementary}} origin theories for the instrument. It {{is possible that the}} drum is a direct descendant of a number of boxlike musical instruments from west and central Africa, especially Angola, and the Antilles. These instruments were adapted by slaves from the Spanish <b>shipping</b> <b>crates</b> at their disposal. In port cities like Matanzas, Cuba, codfish <b>shipping</b> <b>crates</b> and small dresser drawers became similar instruments. Another theory is that slaves used boxes as musical instruments to subvert Spanish colonial bans on music in predominantly African areas; In this way, cajones could easily be disguised as seats or stools, thus avoiding identification as musical instruments. In all likelihood it is a combination of these factors - African origins and Spanish suppression of slave music - that led to the cajón's creation.|$|R
