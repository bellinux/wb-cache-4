5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a good student, earning good grades {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E
5|$|Schools and {{hospitals}} are mentioned in records {{and these were}} built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to sing in choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu Matha, Jain Palli and Buddhist Vihara. These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries (Saraswati Bhandara). Learning was imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called Brahmapuri (or Ghatika or Agrahara). Teaching Sanskrit was a near monopoly of Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> varied from four to eighteen. The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics (Vartta), Political Science (Dandaniti), Veda (trayi) and Philosophy (Anvikshiki), subjects that are mentioned as early as Kautilyas Arthashastra.|$|E

25|$|The first {{teachers}} in the school were mostly young Dublin priests who had studied at the Irish College in Rome. Among them was Dr. James Quinn, who set about enrolling students from wealthy Catholic families. Within a year the school had an enrollment of 130 students. The <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> were classical rather than practical and included Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian and the Arts. Pope Pius XI eventually chose Quinn as the first Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, Australia – and he left the school.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, secondary-school {{pupils in}} Soweto began a {{rebellion}} {{in response to}} the government's decision that Afrikaans be used as the language of instruction for half the <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> in non-White schools (with English continuing for the other half). Although English is the mother tongue of only 8.2% of the population, it is the language most widely understood, and the second language of a majority of South Africans.

25|$|The Jesuits {{introduced}} India to {{both the}} European college system and the printing of books, through founding Saint Paul's College, Goa in 1542. The French traveler François Pyrard de Laval, who visited Goa c. 1608, described the College of St Paul, praising the variety of the <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> there free of charge. Like many other European travelers who visited the College, he recorded {{that at this time}} it had 3,000 students, from all the missions of Asia.

25|$|Being {{a private}} school, Dame Allan's does not {{strictly}} {{adhere to the}} National Curriculum. It does enter all its students in public examinations such as GCSEs and A-levels, so the <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> are closely tied into their national counterparts. All students must study English, mathematics, and the sciences to GCSE level, and it is strongly recommended {{that at least one}} foreign language be studied to this level. Sixth form students have a much wider range of study, with no mandatory subjects and the introduction of many new subjects in year 12, including A-levels in politics, psychology, sports, business and theatre studies. Dame Allan's is an Anglican school.|$|E
25|$|The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel of Nantwich in Cheshire {{was seeking}} a {{headmaster}} in 1866 for its elementary Day School to succeed the retiring Mr Mobbs; they required an incumbent who could also play the organ at the chapel. Twenty-years old Hall was appointed, {{and took up}} the position on 7 January 1867. He was {{to spend the rest}} of his life in Cheshire.

25|$|The ten {{fighting}} {{styles of}} northern sastra-vidya {{were said to}} have been created in different areas based on animals and gods, and designed for the particular geography of their origin. Tradition ascribes their convergence to the 6th-century Buddhist university of Takshashila, ancient India's intellectual capital. Located in present-day Panjab, Pakistan, the Ramayana ascribes the city's founding to Bharata who named it after his son Taksha. From the 7th to the 5th centuries BC it was held in high regard as a great centre of trade and learning, attracting students from throughout present-day Pakistan and northern India. Among the <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> were the “military sciences”, and archery was one of its prime arts.|$|E

25|$|The <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> in pilot {{training}} include: {{tactics of}} the branches of aviation, general aviation tactics, meteorology, air navigation, air traffic control, radio communications and culture in general, along with approximately 250 hours of flight. During the first year, the training is theoretical. During the second year, Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft are used for flight instruction. During the third the cadets are trained Aermacchi SF260EU for aerobatics, and later on Pilatus PC-7 for advanced flight tactics, including combat. Within each of these stages, the cadets are trained in aerial acrobatics, stage tactical instrument flight, visual flying rules (VFR), radio operations, among others, which increase in complexity as the cadets' training progresses. The first female aviator to graduate as a pilot {{in the history of}} FAM, Andrea Cruz, became a cadet at the Military Aviation School in 2007.|$|E
25|$|When Sedgwick {{was seven}} or eight, {{she passed the}} summer {{under the care of}} her cousin Sabrina Parsons, in Bennington, Vermont, at the house of the Rev. Mr. Swift, the husband of Sedgwick's aunt. At home, she {{attended}} the district schools, but no one dictated her studies or overlooked her progress. Reading, spelling, and Dwight's Geography were the only <b>subjects</b> <b>taught,</b> in addition to the first four rules of arithmetic, the names of the several parts of speech. During her first winter in New York, when she was 11 years old, she studied dance under M. Lalliet, and had a French master who came three times a week. About two years later, she attended Mrs. Bell's boarding school in Albany, New York, as a day-scholar. At the age of 15, she was sent to Mr. Payne's boarding school in Boston to complete her education, and was there for six months. One of her schoolmates, Susan Anne Ridley Sedgwick (1788–1867), would become her sister-in-law and a published author.|$|E
25|$|POJOSS {{follows the}} Ghanaian {{educational}} Senior High School curriculum, {{operating in a}} three-year academic cycle, from form one to form three. Students are taught throughout the year, {{over a period of}} three academic terms. The first term of the academic year marks the enrollment of form one students to the school while the third term marks the graduation of form three students. The programmes run by the school include General Science, General Arts, Business and Visual Arts. Form one applicants select four Elective courses. Unlike Elective courses, core courses are offered to all students, irrespective of their programme of study. The core courses in the school are: English language, core mathematics, social studies, integrated science, ICT and physical education, however, students are only examined externally, in the first five aforementioned courses. There are <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> which are unique to the school because of its attachment to a seminary. They are Religion, Doctrine studies, Latin and Music.|$|E
30|$|Some {{limitations}} {{relate to}} the consideration given to the orientation of education. First, although the analysis relies on representative data, bigger samples sizes and/or a stratification of the teachers’ samples by <b>subject</b> <b>taught</b> would have certainly increased the precision of the estimates presented here. Secondly, the analysis rely on variables identifying {{the orientation of the}} school where teachers work (i.e. whether it offers or not vocational programmes) and the orientation of the <b>subject</b> <b>taught</b> by teachers (whether it is vocational or not), but information was not collected on the orientation of the programme in which they teach. This information would have allowed producing more specific estimates and more specific comparisons for VET teachers (as teachers working in VET programmes).|$|R
