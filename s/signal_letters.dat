500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 November 1941, Sydney was {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, near Carnarvon, and heading south towards Fremantle. Around 15:55, the cruiser spotted a merchant ship on a northbound course, which quickly turned away from the coast at [...] Sydney increased speed to [...] and made to intercept. As she closed the gap, Sydney began to signal the unidentified merchantman, first by signal light, then after no reply was forthcoming and the distance between the two ships had decreased, by a combination of light and signal flag. The merchant ship hoisted her callsign, but as she was ahead and just port of Sydney, the flags were obscured by the funnel. A request from the cruiser that the merchant ship make her <b>signal</b> <b>letters</b> clear, which the signals officer did by lengthening the halyard and swinging the flags clear. The callsign was that of the Dutch ship Straat Malakka, but she was not on Sydneys list of ships meant to be in the area. Further flag signals were exchanged between the ships, with Sydney asking the Dutch ship's destination and cargo.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased alcohol cue-reactivity {{and altered}} {{inhibitory}} processing {{have been reported}} in heavy social drinkers and alcohol-dependent patients, and are associated with relapse. In social drinkers, these two processes have been usually studied separately by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during rapid picture presentation. The aim of our study was to confront social drinkers to a task triggering high alcohol cue-reactivity, to verify whether it specifically altered inhibitory performance, by using long-lasting background picture presentation. METHODS: ERP were recorded during visual Go/No-Go tasks performed by social drinkers, in which a frequent Go <b>signal</b> (<b>letter</b> "M"), and a rare No-Go <b>signal</b> (<b>letter</b> "W") were superimposed on three different types of background pictures: neutral (black background), alcohol-related and non alcohol-related. RESULTS: Our data suggested that heavy social drinkers made more commission errors than light drinkers, but only in the alcohol-related context. Neurophysiologically, this was reflected by a delayed No-Go P 3 component. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated alcohol cue-reactivity may lead to poorer inhibitory performance in heavy social drinkers, and may be considered as an important vulnerability factor in developing alcohol misuse. Prevention programs should be designed to decrease the high arousal of alcohol stimuli and strengthen cognitive control in young, at-risk individuals...|$|R

2500|$|As {{she closed}} the gap, the Australian cruiser {{requested}} that Kormoran identify herself. Communications were initially attempted with a signal lamp to repeatedly send [...] "NNJ" [...] ("You should make your signal letters"), but those aboard the raider {{did not understand the}} uncommonly used signal and did not respond. Sydney continued to signal for 30 minutes, after which those aboard the cruiser used flags to send the more common [...] "VH" [...] signal ("You should hoist your signal letters"), while the signal lamp was used to transmit the message in plain language. After another delay, Kormoran raised [...] "PKQI"—the call-sign for the Dutch merchant ship Straat Malakka—on the triatic stay and hoisted a Dutch merchant ensign. As Sydney was approaching from just starboard of Kormorans stern and [...] away, the call-sign was obscured by the raider's funnel: German accounts vary as to if this was to further the illusion of a civilian ship, a ruse to lure Sydney closer, or an error on the signaller's part. Sydney signalled [...] "Make your <b>signal</b> <b>letters</b> clear", which the signals officer aboard Kormoran did by lengthening the halyard and swinging it around to starboard. By 16:35, with Sydney [...] away, the malfunctioning engine aboard Kormoran was repaired, but Detmers chose to keep it in reserve.|$|E

40|$|In this letter, {{we present}} a novel {{exponentially}} embedded families (EEF) based classification method, in which the probability density function (PDF) on raw data is estimated from the PDF on features.

We apply the proposed EEF classifier for text categorization as a case study and derive an optimal Bayesian classification rule with class-specific feature selection based on the Information Gain (IG) score. The promising performance on real-life data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and indicates its wide potential applications.

This Polybius’ particular choice cannot be a coincidence, and the fine details of the equipment that he describes, an engineered system, make us confident that our conjecture may be well grounded. As moderns, we can apply statistical analysis and information theory, by knowing the relative frequencies of the (Modern) Greek alphabet.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} important SEC comment letters and examine the mechanisms by which they affect firm value. The SEC periodically reviews public-company financial statements, issuing comment letters in response to disclosure deficiencies, to ensure that investors are provided with material information, and to prevent fraud. Given that comment letters consist of unstructured text, statistical text classification may be an effective technique to identify comment letter importance. The information in comment letters is distributed over several separate filings and they are not widely cited by the press or analysts as information sources, which may result in investor inattention and underreaction to their disclosure. I utilize negative abnormal returns following comment letter disclosure as the primary indicator of comment letter importance, and develop a Naive Bayesian classification model that <b>signals</b> important comment <b>letters</b> from their text features that are associated with the indicator. In a holdout sample, the text classification model correctly identifies important comment letters between 10 and 40 percent better than chance.
