The control aims to maximise the energy absorption from waves, adapting converter's resistance to the incoming wave size. The MGR is a near shore submerged converter that {{takes advantage of the}} oscillating water column created by the wave when it passes on the converter's platform. The wave column moves the platform, transmitting the force to a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder, that <b>pumps</b> sea water to the coast, where is turbined generating electricity. The control strategy is based on adjusting the system pressure to the coming wave size to create the optimal resistance, absorbing the maximum energy from it. The pressure is controlled by the aperture of turbine jet, positioning jet needle. In addition, the PLC implements the synchronous generator's load (torque) {{in order to maintain the}} turbine working at the maximum efficiency rotation speed. Key words wave energy, control strategy, PI algorithm, near shore device, resonance with waves 1...|$|R

50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} cylinders are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> rod style cylinder, the <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinder is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but retracts using external forces when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir. This external retraction force is usually gravity acting on {{the weight of the}} load. This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|R

5000|$|The engine's pump valve {{mechanism}} {{was invented by}} Prof. Alois Riedler (1850-1936) of the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg (now the Technical University of Berlin) in Berlin, Germany, and was key to its high-speed operation at a hydraulic head of 128 feet. The engine itself is of an unusual triple expansion, three-crank rocker design, with pistons 13.7, 24.375, and 39 inches in diameter and 6 foot stroke. Each rocker is connected both to a crankshaft with a 15-foot flywheel and to a double <b>acting</b> <b>pump's</b> plunger.|$|R

40|$|The study {{described}} in this paper was performed to analyze the pumping characteristics of a double <b>acting</b> valve-less <b>pump.</b> This valve-less pump uses the fluidic diode instead of usual mechanical movable valve to rectify the flow. The author designed and produced a test machine of the double <b>acting</b> valve-less <b>pump</b> driven by servo motor. As {{the results of the}} transport examination, the maximal flow rate of the test valve-less pump was 90 ml/min and the lift head was 450 mm in drive cycle number 109 cycle/min. The influence of driving cycle number on pump performance was also clarified, and it was appeared that the optimum cycle number was in existent. In addition, the author developed the performance design method of the double <b>acting</b> valve-less <b>pump.</b> The experimental performance values agreed with the design values. So, the validity of the performance design method was able to be confirmed...|$|R

50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke. The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as double <b>acting</b> or <b>single</b> <b>acting.</b> In <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the cylinder. In double acting cylinder {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes. Directional control valves required for the easy operation of double acting cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> {{cylinders}} are economical and {{the simplest}} design. Hydraulic fluid enters through a port {{at one end}} of the cylinder, which extends the rod by means of area difference. An external force, internal retraction spring or gravity returns the piston rod.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a {{pneumatic}} cylinder is usually a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder, {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done by compressed air and retraction by means of open coiled spring.

40|$|Mankindâ€™s {{need for}} {{sustainable}} technology is increasing with the ever {{growing demand for}} and depletion of finite energy reserves. Research into the conversion of sustainable energy resources such as wind, hydro and solar into high quality mechanical, chemical or electrical energy is becoming more significant and of greater urgency in modern society. The research reported in this thesis continues from previous work {{carried out in the}} development of a small, low cost solar thermal water pump. The aim of the research was to take a pump previously designed at the University of Canterbury to further develop and refine the system to improve operation, performance, physical and operational design, as well as reliability and maintainability. The earlier design was a novel <b>single</b> <b>acting,</b> double diaphragm <b>pump</b> operating on a thermal cycle similar to a Rankine cycle, dubbed The â€˜Modifiedâ€™ Rankine cycle. Although it was adequate to prove the concept it was inefficient and impractical in design. In order to achieve research goals this previous design was dropped and a new double acting unit developed to give greater performance, smoother flow output, be self starting and self priming and therefore be able to operate unattended. The new design is intended to overcome the major failings of the first prototype while being significantly smaller, lighter, more robust and reliable, and be relatively maintenance free. A complex computer simulation of the collector and pump system was modified and developed for the new design to optimise pump geometry and predict pump operation for any average day at any location and for any water head. Thermodynamic analysis of the pump showed significant exergy loss with the internal energy of the working fluid not being used but was an unavoidable trade off for simplicity, cost and reliability. The new pump was optimised to pump water through a 6 metre vertical water head, operating on a 2. 9 mÂ² flat plate sheet and tube non tracking solar collector. With n-Pentane as the working fluid operating at 56 Â°C a peak flow rate of 27 litres per minute was predicted with a corresponding efficiency of 0. 93 %. For a good summerâ€™s day 10, 000 litres could be lifted through 6 metres. A suitable initial application of this solar thermal pumping unit would be in solar water heating installations for swimming pools. As a circulation pump a solar thermal unit would have distinct advantages: it would have no running cost, it would add heat to the pumped water reducing the area of water heating panel, and would only pump during daylight hours ie. fully automated and self contained operation...|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Henry J. Kaiser asked William Besler to convert his 1953 Kaiser Manhattan to steam. Besler {{completed}} this in either 1957 or 1958. The engine {{was described as}} a V4 <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> uniflow with trunk pistons. It was a cross compound with piston valves across the high-pressure heads. Kaiser apparently did not take the car back and left it with Besler.|$|R
50|$|A {{double acting}} {{cylinder}} is extended and retracted using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure in both directions. Double acting telescopic cylinders are thus much more complex in design than the <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> type. This additional complexity {{is due to the}} requirement of adding retracting piston faces to all of the cylinder stages and the difficulty in supplying pressurized fluid to the retraction pistons of the intermediate stages.|$|R

50|$|The main {{function}} of the piston is to separate the pressure zones inside the barrel. The piston is machined with grooves to fit elastomeric or metal seals and bearing elements. These seals can be <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> or double acting. The difference in pressure {{between the two sides}} of the piston causes the cylinder to extend and retract. The piston is attached with the piston rod by means of threads, bolts, or nuts to transfer the linear motion.|$|R
