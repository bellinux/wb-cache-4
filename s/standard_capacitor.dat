This unique configuration results in enhanced voltage and ESD performance over <b>standard</b> <b>capacitor</b> designs while allowing for a fail-open condition if mechanically damaged (cracked).

The FE-CAP is designed to {{reduce the likelihood of}} a low IR or short circuit condition and the chance for a catastrophic and potentially costly failure event. Driven by the demand for a more robust and reliable component, the FE-CAP was designed for critical applications where higher operating temperatures and mechanical stress are a concern.

40|$|Purpose: To {{eliminate}} {{variation in}} electrometer calibration results caused by high humidity and suboptimal connectors on the <b>standard</b> <b>capacitors</b> and to implement hardware that prevents overloading of the input stage of electrometers during calibration. Methods: A humidity-controlled cabinet was installed {{to provide a}} low-humidity environment for the <b>standard</b> <b>capacitors.</b> All of the coaxial BNC connections were replaced with Triax (TRB) connectors {{with the exception of}} the output from the voltage source. A three-stage RC filter with cascaded RC low-pass sections was designed and tested. Results: The installation of the humidity cabinet resulted in a major improvement in the stability and reproducibility of the electrometer calibration system. For the three years since this upgrade, the Ionizing Radiation Standards (IRS) electrometer calibration results have been consistent regardless of the ambient relative humidity in the lab. The connector replacements improved grounding in the calibration circuit. The three-stage filter allows the voltage at the output to rise in an S-shaped waveform, resulting in a smooth rise of the current through the isolation resistor from zero and back again, with no abrupt transition. For the filter design chosen, 99. 99 of the charge is delivered within 6 s. Conclusions: A three-way improvement to the calibration measurement system was successful in eliminating the observed variations, resulting in an electrometer calibration measurement system that is unaffected by humidity and allowing reliable year-round calibrations of any electrometer encountered since the implementation of these changes.

40|$|Metallised {{polypropylene}} (MPP) capacitors, {{the dominant}} capacitor type {{used in a}} wide range of power and electronic circuit applications, offer high volumetric capacitor density, low cost, excellent frequency characteristics and a unique ability to recover from point failures in the dielectric film. However MPP capacitors have a generic weakness that is not well understood, failure of the self-healing process leading to ongoing catastrophic failure. The work described in this thesis includes the derivation of an improved electrical model of a capacitor and the uncovering of a mechanism for the catastrophic failure mode. Corrosion of the thin metallic field is firmly linked to drastic increases in metal film current densities and generation of hot spots in capacitors. In the work, novel formulae were derived relating capacitor parameters such as equivalent series resistance and equivalent series capacitance to frequency and physical characteristics such as metal film resistivity and physical dimensions of multiple layer capacitors. Modelling using numerical methods and diffusion equation showed that capacitors with double-end connection topology have more uniform voltage and power distribution than single-end connected capacitors. External characteristics of both connection topologies were shown to be virtually identical up to frequencies well above typical self-resonance. The aggregate spatial distribution of power from both layers and the voltage across the dielectric were found to be fundamentally different in the two circuit connection topologies. In this work it was shown that above singularity frequencies defined by distributed capacitance and metal film spreading resistance, equivalent series resistance and capacitance both fall with the square root of frequency Analysis of the inductance of typical MPP capacitors for single-end and double-end connected topologies and for circumferentially connected capacitor metallization showed that the magnitude and effect of distributed inductance in typical MPP power capacitors was insignificant compared to packaging inductance. Thermal and electrical modelling and experimental measurements showed that corrosion effects could readily account for the generic catastrophic failure mode of metallised polypropylene capacitors. Modelling showed that remnant vestiges of metal bridging corrosion gaps between the schooping and the metallic film could also pose serious thermal danger to the affected capacitor. Fusing current modelling and experimental measurement showed that fusing in metallic films typically occurred for current densities of several hundred thousand amperes per square centimetre. The partial disconnection of the metallic layers from the schooping edge by corrosion for example, was shown to result in large increases in dissipation factor and power loss in a capacitor readily explaining how capacitors "go high". Simple additions to the <b>standard</b> <b>capacitor</b> equivalent circuit model were developed to encompassing dielectric loss, shunt conductance effects and the impact of source resistance on capacitor parameters.

In situ monitoring demonstrated similar failure statistics between the flexible and <b>standard</b> termination <b>capacitors,</b> presence of conformal coating, and voltage bias level. Upon removal from THB conditions recovery occurred only in the standard termination MLCCs.
