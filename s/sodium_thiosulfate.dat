5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and {{is viewed as}} a hard Lewis acid.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> {{is used to}} dechlorinate tapwater for aquariums {{or treat}} {{effluent}} from wastewater treatments prior to release into rivers. The reduction reaction {{is analogous to the}} iodine reduction reaction. Treatment of tapwater requires between 0.1 and 0.3 grams of pentahydrated (crystalline) <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> per 10L of water. Many animals are sensitive to chloramine, and it must be removed from water given to many animals in zoos.|$|E

Cell damage caused by the irradiation was quantified as comet tail moment, which represents the degree of DNA damage. X-ray-induced DNA damage was significantly decreased in both H 4 IIE and L 5178 Y cells by micromolar concentrations of NPTS and 2 PTS compared with the control without the compounds. The protective effect was more potent with 2 PTS than NPTS. Onions and garlic have antiradiation potential...|$|R
5000|$|BEI is very {{hazardous}} {{since it}} attacks nucleic acids and proteins as described above. It can be neutralised by <b>sodium</b> thiosulfate; the <b>thiosulfate</b> is a nucleophile which opens the three-membered ring.|$|R
25|$|The excess {{dichromate}} {{is determined}} by titration against <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate.</b> Subtracting the amount of excess dichromate from the initial amount, gives the amount of ethanol present. Accuracy can be improved by calibrating the dichromate solution against a blank.|$|E
25|$|An older cyanide {{antidote}} kit included {{administration of}} three substances: amyl nitrite pearls (administered by inhalation), sodium nitrite, and <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate.</b> The {{goal of the}} antidote was to generate a large pool of ferric iron (Fe3+) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a3 (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The nitrites oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the cytochrome oxidase enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to thiocyanate by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> is administered to provide a sulfur donor for rhodanese, {{needed in order to}} produce thiocyanate.|$|E
25|$|For cyanide poisoning, a {{large amount}} of {{hydroxocobalamin}} may be given intravenously and sometimes in combination with <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate.</b> The mechanism of action is straightforward: the hydroxycobalamin hydroxide ligand is displaced by the toxic cyanide ion, and the resulting harmless B12 complex is excreted in urine. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved (in 2006) the use of hydroxocobalamin for acute treatment of cyanide poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium sulfite {{is used as}} a {{preservative}} for fixers in photography.

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a wide variety of models, sizes and {{configurations}} of mobile phones available for consumption. After the life cycle of this equipment, the recycling and reuse of the precious metals found in the printed circuit boards (PCB) of the mobile phones are principal objectives. Thus, the objective of this work was to characterize the gold and silver present in a PCB and develop a recycling route using alternative reagents for cyanide, such as <b>sodium</b> and ammonium <b>thiosulfate.</b> These reagents are less harmful to the environment and worker health. The first characterization of gold and silver was performed with aqua regia. The results show 86. 26 g Au/ton of PCBs and 123. 85 g Ag/ton of PCBs. The second characterization was performed with a commercial cyanide-based reagent and 112. 02 g Au/ton of PCBs and 26. 13 g Ag/ ton of PCBs were obtained. A leaching study with solutions based on thiosulfate was performed and an extraction of 9. 02 g Au/ton of PCBs and 33. 88 g Ag/ton of PCBs was obtained, compared to characterization results using a cyanide-based reagent...|$|R

2500|$|The uses of KI include as a {{nutritional}} supplement in animal feeds {{and also the}} human diet. For the latter, {{it is the most}} common additive used to [...] "iodize" [...] table salt (a public health measure to prevent iodine deficiency in populations that get little seafood). The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from iodised salts that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates. Potassium iodate is used to add iodine to some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation. Dextrose or <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> are often added to iodized table salt to stabilize potassium iodide thus reducing loss of the volatile chemical.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} way {{to analyze the}} ascorbic acid content {{is the process of}} titration with an oxidizing agent, and several procedures have been developed, mainly relying on iodometry. Iodine is used {{in the presence of a}} starch indicator. Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator. [...] This indicates the end-point of the titration. As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with <b>sodium</b> <b>thiosulfate</b> using starch as an indicator. The preceding iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by potentiometric titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday's law.|$|E

It was used intraperitoneal and aerogenous introduction of irritants in doses 0, 5 LD 50, LD 50 and LCt 50.

40|$|Sulfate is {{essential}} for normal physiology. The kidney {{plays a major role}} in sulfate homeostasis. Sulfate is freely filtered and strongly reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The apical membrane Na(+) -sulfate cotransporter NaS 1 (SLC 13 A 1) mediates sulfate (re) absorption across renal proximal tubule and small intestinal epithelia. NaS 1 encodes a 595 -amino acid (≈ 66 kDa) protein with 13 putative transmembrane domains. Its substrate preferences are <b>sodium</b> and sulfate, <b>thiosulfate,</b> and selenate, and its activity is inhibited by molybdate, selenate, tungstate, thiosulfate, succinate, and citrate. NaS 1 is primarily expressed in the kidney (proximal tubule) and intestine (duodenum to colon). NaS 1 expression is down-regulated in the renal cortex by high sulfate diet, hypothyroidism, vitamin D depletion, glucocorticoids, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and NSAIDs and up-regulated by low sulfate diet, thyroid hormone, vitamin D supplementation, growth hormone, chronic renal failure, and during post-natal growth. Disruption of murine NaS 1 gene leads to hyposulfatemia and hypersulfaturia, as well as changes in metabolism, growth, fecundity, behavior, gut physiology, and liver detoxification. This suggests that NaS 1 is an important sulfate transporter and its disruption leads to perturbed sulfate homeostasis, which contributes to numerous pathophysiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Calciphylaxis (CFX) is a {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} deposition of calcium in the intima and media of vessels, intimal proliferation, fibrosis, luminal thrombosis, tissue ischemia and necrosis. Its initial report and subsequent descriptions {{were associated with}} chronic renal failure. There is little information regarding the possible effect of the recovery of renal function secondary to kidney transplantation in the incidence of this disease. Methods: Center retrospective study. We analyze in this report the three cases of patients who developed CFX after a renal transplant within a cohort of 448 kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant patients from January 1 th 2001 to January 1 th 2014 in our Hospital.  Results: Three patients {{were found to have}} CFX. All of them had hypercalcemia (serum calcium average 11. 5 mg/dl) at first year post transplant and 2 patients at diagnosis of CFX. PTHi in the three CFX patients was 2 pg/ml, 62, 3 pg/ml and 3561 pg/ml respectively. Hypoalbuminemia was found in all patients. Two patients were diabetic. Only one patient was obese and under anticoagulation treatment. In all cases a biopsy provided the diagnosis of certainty for calciphylaxis. Median serum creatinine at diagnosis was 1. 5 mg/dl (1. 2 mg/dl 1. 2 mg/dl and 2 mg/dl, respectively) and the average time between transplantation and calciphylaxis diagnosis was 32 months. In all cases, strict control of phosphorus and hypercalcemia and <b>sodium</b> IV <b>thiosulfate</b> treatment was performed. The evolution was successful in two patients, controlling blood calcium and improving cutaneous manifestations with preservation of renal function. Conclusions: CFX prevalence in a cohort of 448 kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant patients from 2001 to 2014 was 0. 66 %, less than reported in dialysis patients. Factors associated with CFX in our patients were hypercalcemia in the first year after renal transplant and {{at the time of the}} event, hypoalbuminemia, diabetes and disorders of the parathyroid gland. The persistence of hypercalcemia in the first year after renal transplant should be an element of high clinical suspicion of this complication in the kidney transplant recipients...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose—We have {{recently}} reported {{the safety of}} intraventricular sodium nitroprusside {{for the treatment of}} cerebral ischemia from vasospasm. Treatments have been accompanied previously by cerebral angiography to gauge treatment effect on established vasospasm. We presently report the safe coadministration of intraventricular <b>sodium</b> nitroprusside and <b>thiosulfate</b> in 10 patients with secured ruptured cerebral aneurysms in the intensive care unit, without the use of cerebral angiography for vasospasm treatment. Methods—Patients were considered eligible for treatment on the basis of subarachnoid hemorrhage grade or manifestation of cerebral vasospasm by either transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) or neurological examination criteria. The route of administration was intraventricular, by way of ventriculostomy. Two separate protocols differing in dosage frequency were used, depending on {{the presence or absence of}} a new neurological deficit. Response to treatment was measured by TCD and neurological criteria. Results—Good outcome was observed in 7 of 8 vasospasm patients presenting with clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage grade 3. Four patients demonstrated reversal of well-defined neurological deficits (hemiparesis, paraparesis) in the setting of treatment. Seven patients demonstrated a decrease in TCD velocities within 1 hour of treatment. Two patients died: 1 from intractable vasospasm despite maximal medical management and angioplasty and 1 from pulmonary causes. One episode of hypotension occurred in the setting of a high dose of medication. This responded promptly t...|$|R
