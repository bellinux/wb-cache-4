40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{efficiency}} and plausibility of published computational models of familiarity discrimination in the perirhinal cortex. Substantial evidence indicates that the perirhinal cortex is involved in both the familiarity discrimination aspect of recognition memory and in perceptual functions involved with representations of complete stimuli (i. e., object identification). Published models of how the perirhinal cortex may perform familiarity discrimination {{can be divided into}} two groups. The first group assumes that a proportion of perirhinal neurons form a <b>network</b> <b>specialised</b> just for familiarity discrimination (these models may be based on Hebbian or anti-Hebbian synaptic plasticity). In contrast, the second group assumes that both familiarity discrimination and learning representations of complete stimuli are performed within a single combined network. This study establishes that when the responses of neurons that provide input to the familiarity discrimination network are correlated (as indicated by experimental data), <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> based on anti-Hebbian learning may recognise the previous occurrence of many more stimuli (i. e., have a capacity up to thousands of times larger) than <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> based on Hebbian learning. The currently published combined models do not learn an optimal stimulus representation (they do not fully extract statistically independent features), and hence their capacities are even lower than those of the specialised models based on Hebbian learning. Hence, the combined models published thus far are critically less efficient than the specialised models based on anti-Hebbian learning. This study also compares the consistency of the models with experimental observations concerning what is kno [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Increasing demand in the advanced developing countries for more information more quickly has called into serious question the traditionally fragmented nature of information services by creating a need for greater inter-institutional cooperation. Libraries and information centres have responded to this need by the formation of networks serving limited geographical areas or various special interests. Unless an inclusive network is established on a national scale, expendi tures, facilities and efforts will be unnecessarily duplicated and interconnection will become increasingly difficult as regional and <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> develop without a common approach. The time has come in every advanced developing country to create a national information network which would weld together its separate insulated information resources into a nationwide network. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify common information needs and desires responsible for the present information services in the advanced developing countries, and to design a generalised structure of national information networks based on the common factors identified. This study was carried out by postal questionnaire, personal interview and literature review. The countries investigated are: Brazil, Colombia, Hong Kong, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Taiwan, Turkey, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. The data gathered by questionnaire and interview have been arranged in fifteen country reports to be summarised later by crocos-section characteristics, requirements and constraints. By choosing between the alternative network models and configurations, a generalised structure of national information networks based on the common characteristics of the information needs and desires existing in the advanced developing countries has been presented. The investigator has attempted in this study to view a network as an arrangement of different functional units working together to accomplish the purpose of the whole rather than an integrated set of different <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> such as those in agriculture, chemistry, economics, education, etc...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{examines}} the potential drug delivery barrier {{of the basement}} membrane (BM) by assessing the permeability of select macromolecules and nanoparticles. The study further extends to probing the effect of BM on intestinal epithelial cell attachment and monolayer characteristics, including cell morphology. Serum-free cultured Caco- 2 cells were grown on BM-containing porous supports, which were obtained by prior culture of airway epithelial cells (Calu- 3), shown to assemble and deposit a BM on the growth substrate, followed by decellularisation. Data overall show that the attachment capacity of Caco- 2 cells, which is completely lost in serum-free culture, is fully restored when the cells are grown on BM-coated substrates, with cells forming intact monolayers with high electrical resistance and low permeability to macromolecules. Caco- 2 cells cultured on BM-coated substrates displayed strikingly different morphological characteristics, suggestive of {{a higher level of}} differentiation and closer resemblance to the native intestinal epithelium. BM was found to notably hinder the diffusion of macromolecules and nanoparticles in a size dependent manner.

40|$|Evidence from neuropsychological and {{activation}} studies (Clarke et al., 2 oo 0, Maeder et al., 2000) {{suggests that}} sound recognitionand localisation are processed by two anatomically and functionally distinct cortical networks. We report {{here on a}} case of a patientthat had an interruption of auditory information and we show: i) the effects of this interruption on cortical auditory processing; ii) the effect of the workload on activation pattern. A 36 year old man suffered from a small left mesencephalic haemotrhage, due to cavernous angioma; the let% inferior colliculuswas resected in the surgical approach of the vascular malformation. In the acute stage, the patient complained of auditoryhallucinations and of auditory loss in right ear, while tonal audiometry was normal. At 12 months, auditory recognition, auditorylocalisation (assessed by lTD and IID cues) and auditory motion perception were normal (Clarke et al., 2000), while verbal dichoticlistening was deficient on the right side. Sound recognition and sound localisation activation patterns were investigated with fMRI, using a passive and an activeparadigm. In normal subjects, distinct cortical networks were involved in sound recognition and localisation, both in passive andactive paradigm (Maeder et al., 2 OOOa, 2000 b). Passive listening of environmental and spatial stimuli as compared to rest strongly activated right auditory cortex, but failed toactivate left primary auditory cortex. The <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> for sound recognition and localisation could not be visual&d onthe right and only minimally on the left convexity. A very different activation pattern was obtained in the active condition wherea motor response was required. Workload not only increased the activation of the right auditory cortex, but also allowed theactivation of the left primary auditory cortex. The <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> for sound recognition and localisation were almostcompletely present in both hemispheres. These results show that increasing the workload can i) help to recruit cortical region in the auditory deafferented hemisphere;and ii) lead to processing auditory information within specific cortical networks.

40|$|Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to perform exceptionally well on most recognition tasks such as image classification and segmentation. However, they have {{also been shown to}} be vulnerable to adversarial examples. This phenomenon has recently attracted a lot of attention but it has not been extensively studied on multiple, large-scale datasets and complex tasks such as semantic segmentation which often require more <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> with additional components such as CRFs, dilated convolutions, skip-connections and multiscale processing. In this paper, we present what to our knowledge is the first rigorous evaluation of adversarial attacks on modern semantic segmentation models, using two large-scale datasets. We analyse the effect of different network architectures, model capacity and multiscale processing, and show that many observations made on the task of classification do not always transfer to this more complex task. Furthermore, we show how mean-field inference in deep structured models and multiscale processing naturally implement recently proposed adversarial defenses. Our observations will aid future efforts in understanding and defending against adversarial examples. Moreover, in the shorter term, we show which segmentation models should currently be preferred in safety-critical applications due to their inherent robustness...|$|R

We quantitatively assessed which properties of <b>specialised</b> <b>networks</b> were present in a complex networks involving different interacting types such as saproxylic community, and how they can be organised in trophic food webs. The architecture, interacting patterns and food web composition were evaluated along sub-networks, analysing their implications to network robustness from random and directed extinction simulations. A structure of large and cohesive modules with weakly connected nodes was observed throughout saproxylic sub-networks, composing the main food webs constituting this community. Insect-dependent sub-networks were more modular than wood-dependent sub-networks. Wood-dependent sub-networks presented higher species degree, connectance, links, linkage density, interaction strength, and were less specialised and more aggregated than insect-dependent sub-networks. These attributes defined high network robustness in wood-dependent sub-networks. Finally, our results emphasise the relevance of modularity, differences among interacting types and interrelations among them in modelling the structure o...|$|R
