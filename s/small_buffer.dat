[...] Reiter and British historian Victor Rothwell quote Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov as telling his Lithuanian counterpart at the time Lithuania was effectively absorbed into the USSR, “mall states will disappear...Baltic states, including Finland, will be included within the honourable family of Soviet peoples. However, contends Reiter, [...] "he fear of rising costs of fighting pushed Stalin to accept a limited war outcome with Finland, rather than pursue absolute victory", although a contemporary [...] "Soviet document... called for the brutal military occupation of Finland at war’s end." [...] “The Finnish victory [...] ended the Soviet offensive in Finland and persuaded the Soviets to give up their demand for Finland's unconditional surrender". [...] Peter Provis (1999) concludes his essay on point, “By following [...] policies and fulfilling the Soviet Union's demands ...Finland avoided the same fate as other nations that were 'liberated' by the Red Army...Finland had once again defended her independence in a global conflict that engulfed and destroyed many other nations...The Finns had once again demonstrated their determination to avoid defeat by the Soviet Union and maintained their independence".|$|E

However, as Internet link speeds reach {{hundreds}} of Gigabits-per-second and beyond, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to equip high-speed routers with large buffers, especially as switching moves into the all-optical domain. In this chapter we first trace the evolution in thinking over recent years on how much buffering is required at Internet routers, focusing specifically on the push towards <b>smaller</b> <b>buffers,</b> from Gigabyte down to Kilobyte sizes, making them amenable for all-optical realisation. We then highlight some of the implications of the move towards such <b>small</b> <b>buffers,</b> such as end-to-end performance for real-time and TCP traffic, the reaction of TCP to reduced buffer availability in the network, and the unexpected interactions between TCP and open-loop traffic.

To mitigate the performance degradation resulting from <b>small</b> <b>buffers,</b> this paper proposes that optical edge nodes “pace ” the injection of traffic into the OPS core. Our contributions relating to pacing in OPS networks are three-fold: first, we develop real-time pacing algorithms of poly-logarithmic complexity that are feasible for practical implementation in emerging high-speed OPS networks. Second, we provide an analytical quantification of the benefits of pacing in reducing traffic burstiness and traffic loss at a link with very <b>small</b> <b>buffers.</b> Third, we show via simulations of realistic network topologies that pacing can significantly reduce network losses at the expense of a small and bounded increase in end-to-end delay for real-time traffic flows. We argue that the loss-delay trade-off mechanism provided by pacing can be instrumental in overcoming the performance hurdle arising from the scarcity of buffers in OPS networks. I...|$|R
