5|$|A {{year after}} the freeway opened, traffic volumes along {{parallel}} roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels a month after M-6 opened. Property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 {{as a result of}} development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.|$|E

5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. A cadet <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> a cadet airman basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, a cadet must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet airman and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill test for all CAP cadet enlisted grades.|$|E
5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E
5|$|MD32 {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-97 and MD3 (Robert Crain Highway) in Millersville. MD32 <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> {{a pair of}} two-lane flyover ramps that split west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD32 ramps head northwest while I-97 curves to the northeast and settles into the wide median of {{the northern end of}} MD3. After passing through its interchange with MD3, MD32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes {{to the north of the}} community of Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound ramps of MD32 that is unsigned MD32AA. The eastbound ramps connect with county-maintained Burns Crossing Road. MD32 continues northwest along the northern edge of Odenton, where the freeway gradually curves to the southwest, has a diamond interchange with MD170 (Telegraph Road) and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Annapolis Road), and crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line between the interchanges.|$|E

5|$|PA 263 <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> North York Road at its {{southern}} terminus at PA 611 (Easton Road) in the unincorporated village of Willow Grove in Upper Moreland Township, Montgomery County. At the southern terminus, the route is split into a one-way pair, with the route carrying two lanes in each direction. The northbound lanes split north from northbound PA 611 while the southbound lanes head west and meet PA 611 at the Center Avenue intersection. There is no access from southbound PA 611 to PA 263. At {{the end of}} the one-way pair, PA 263 continues north as a four-lane undivided road, passing through commercial areas with a few homes. The road passes under Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line and becomes a divided highway called South York Road as it crosses under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276). Upon intersecting Mill Road/Warminster Road, PA 263 becomes undivided again as it heads into more residential surroundings.|$|E
5|$|SR54 <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> a six-lane freeway from I-5 {{near the}} mouth of the Sweetwater River in National City. Both {{directions}} of the freeway are divided by the river; eastbound traffic traverses the south bank and westbound traffic traverses the north bank. The two sides join near the junction with I-805. The roadway continues east for several miles past the Westfield Plaza Bonita mall through suburban Paradise Hills in San Diego. As the freeway turns north in Bay Terraces, it merges with SR 125 north. The highways pass west of the Sweetwater Reservoir and Sweetwater Summit Regional Park, and the western segment of SR54 ends at the Jamacha Boulevard exit in La Presa. Jamacha Boulevard veers northeast as an undivided highway through Spring Valley until it reaches Campo Road; it is only designated as County Route S17 (CRS17), while some maps do consider this part of SR54.|$|E
5|$|The Expos called Barrett to the Major Leagues on September 19, 1998, in a {{game against}} the Cincinnati Reds as a third baseman. He managed to hit a home run and a single in the game. After only playing eight games as an Expo, Barrett was sent to play for the Harrisburg Senators, a Class AA team from the Eastern League. He {{recorded}} 145 hits, and seventy-eight runs, nineteen home runs, and eighty-seven RBI en route to winning the Double-A All-Star Catcher and Montreal Expos Minor League Player of the Year awards. His performance allowed him to claim a spot on the Expos’ starting roster during the 1999 season. During his first full season, Barrett had fifty-nine <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> a catcher, sixty-two as a third-baseman, and six as shortstop. He also led all National League rookies with thirty-two doubles, while ranking as one of top statistical tiers in runs, hits, and run batted in among all other rookies.|$|E

5|$|The {{first day}} was {{abandoned}} due to rain. Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch. The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman's wicket {{twice in the}} match, causing a media sensation. Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11, the Australian captain's first score on tour below 80. The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> six were dismissed between 20 and 40. Australia looked set to concede a lead {{for the first time}} on tour as the hosts reached 3/129, but Johnston (5/49) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire's only innings, which ended on the third morning. With a result impossible, Australia had time for batting practice. Bradman reached 43, and when Hilton came on, the Australian captain, perhaps perturbed by earlier events, attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack. After missing the first two balls, Bradman charged the third, swung and missed, fell over and was stumped. Harvey (76*) and Hamence (49*) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52.|$|E
5|$|The route <b>starts</b> <b>as</b> a limited-access southerly bypass of Downtown Sumner, but {{becomes a}} surface road {{east of the}} city.

SR410 enters the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and later heads into Mount Rainier National Park, crossing the Cayuse and Chinook passes, and leaves the park southeast along the American River into Wenatchee National Forest. SR410 leaves the national forest and travels parallel to the Naches River to end in Naches, a city located west of Yakima. The Chinook Scenic Byway begins in Enumclaw and follows the highway through the two national forests and Mount Rainier National Park to US12 in Naches.|$|E
