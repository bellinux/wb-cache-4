40|$|From seismic {{data to the}} {{composition}} of rocks: an interdisciplinary and multiscale approach to exploration seismology Felix J. Herrmann ∗ and the <b>SLIM</b> <b>Team</b> ∗ In this essay, a nonlinear and multidisciplinary approach is presented that takes seismic data to {{the composition}} of rocks. The presented work has deep roots in the ’gedachtengoed ’ (philosophy) of Delphi spearheaded by Guus Berkhout. Central themes are multiscale, object-orientation and a multidisciplinary approach...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{responses}} in the Netherlands to a widespread perception within the water sector of crisis, rooted in an appreciation that former ways of managing water could no longer deal with contemporary and possible future events. The crisis and initial responses are first outlined, grounding the SLIM project experience in Dutch water management practice and policy. This leads to the research question formulated by the Dutch <b>SLIM</b> <b>team,</b> and the predictions it gave rise to. The research methodology, case studies and policy analyses {{at the core of}} the study are introduced. Empirical observations concerning four aspects of the change process are used to explore the predictions: conflict and confrontation among stakeholders; discovery of interdependence among stakeholders; development of social spaces where stakeholders could encounter each other in shared actions; and the role of facilitators and process leaders in helping stakeholders to go forward. The observations are analysed in relation to the initial predictions and the surprises encountered in the history of the cases. Knowledge management is identified as a key task in the social learning processes analysed. The article concludes with reflections on the role of the environmental sciences in the policy processes and research practices described...|$|E

50|$|Having made {{it through}} the {{preliminary}} rounds of the World Aeroball Championship, the Harlem Heroes team bus crashes, killing all but four players. Louis Mayer, his brain alone surviving the tragedy, convinces his three fellow survivors, <b>Slim,</b> Hairy, and <b>team</b> captain John Giant Clay that they can still win the championship title.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} summer, the Borderline Summer Special was released, still a PDF but {{in standard}} magazine format; the <b>slimmed</b> down editorial <b>team</b> made promises of new issues, but {{have yet to}} materialise. However, former Borderline features editor Jay Eales has recently resurrected much of the content; aiming it at a new audience, via his website FactOrFictionPress.co.uk.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid 1970s Smith {{worked at}} Polydor's old studios in Stratford Place, London, and {{was pleased to}} get {{involved}} with The Jam's recordings. [...] "I remember that first gig Chris Parry took me to" [...] said Smith. [...] "It was a period of real excitement and although there were only between 15 and 20 people there, it was a great show with amazing spirit and energy". Later when The Jam <b>slimmed</b> their <b>team</b> of two producers down to one, the then-renamed Coppersmith-Heaven had developed the group's sound with harmonised guitars and acoustic textures. The Jam released their third LP, All Mod Cons in November 1978.|$|R
50|$|George is {{introduced}} {{to his work}} <b>team.</b> <b>Slim,</b> {{the head of the}} team, who is greatly respected, and Carlson. When Carlson suggests they shoot Candy's old dog and get Slim to give him one of his pups, Lennie gets excited and asks George for a pup. After a hard day's work, George is proud of Lennie's work load and gets Lennie his puppy.|$|R
5000|$|After reviving, Jack finds {{they have}} come to the {{hospital}} to get Martha treatment. A doctor says Martha's chances of survival are <b>slim.</b> The <b>team</b> evacuates the hospital while Death, after taking twelve souls, chases after a young leukaemia patient (Jamie Burton) who, while in the toilet with his console, was left behind. Owen saves the child and helps him and Tosh to escape. Ianto, monitoring Martha, explains that the [...] "Faith" [...] which defeated Death was actually a resurrected child named Faith. Owen realises that he {{is the only one who}} can defeat Death as he is dead. After kissing Tosh, Owen fights Death, consuming its energy and forcing it back into the darkness, also restoring Martha to her original age.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not until}} their next single, [...] "Down in the Tube Station at Midnight", that The Jam really regained their former {{critical}} acclaim. The song was a dramatic account of being mugged by thugs who [...] "smelled of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs and too many right-wing meetings." [...] Around this time, The Jam <b>slimmed</b> their <b>team</b> of two producers to one, Vic Coppersmith-Heaven, who helped develop the group's sound with harmonised guitars and acoustic textures. In 1978, the Jam released their third LP, All Mod Cons, which included three previously released tracks among the 12 in total: [...] "David Watts", [...] "'A' Bomb In Wardour Street", and [...] "Down in the Tube Station at Midnight". (It also contained two songs Polydor had previously rejected for single release, the manic [...] "Billy Hunt" [...] and the acoustic ballad [...] "English Rose".) ...|$|R
50|$|Alliot {{remained}} for 1985, with Manfred Winkelhock {{entered in the}} second car, and a new RAM 03 designed by Gustav Brunner. Winkelhock put in some improved qualifying performances, but actual results were still thin. Winkelhock's death in a sports car event in Canada in the summer was {{a blow to the}} team, and Acheson was recalled briefly, before the <b>team</b> <b>slimmed</b> down to a single entry. They missed the final two rounds altogether. Skoal withdrew their backing {{at the end of the}} year, the team's best result having been Alliot's 9th place, again at the opening Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] the <b>team</b> <b>slimmed</b> down to {{a single}} car, with backing from Olympus Cameras. The car itself was barely upgraded, and Divina Galica [...] failed {{to qualify for the}} first two races. Eddie Cheever then managed to get into the South African Grand Prix, {{retiring}} with a fractured oil line. Derek Daly was the next to try the car, and at the wet International Trophy at Silverstone, in his debut, diced for the lead with James Hunt's McLaren before a stone cracked his visor and ended his race. However, in world championship events he failed to qualify for the next three races, after which the team folded.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, to {{show the}} {{viability}} of the Alaska Highway, Slim traveled down the proposed route by dogsled. He only used crude maps in what was previously unmapped territory. When the spring thaw made sledding impossible, he rigged up his sled with Model-T wheels and continued through the muddy Canadian plains toward his destination, the Chicago World's Fair. By the time he reached Seattle, he had become a small celebrity. After the World's Fair had closed for the season, <b>Slim</b> and his <b>team</b> of half-bred wolf/dogs proceeded to Washington, D.C., where he camped in a city park and spent the winter discussing Alaskan concerns with legislators. He also met with President Franklin Roosevelt.|$|R
50|$|For 1990, the new-look Subaru Coloni <b>team</b> <b>slimmed</b> {{down to a}} single-car effort, {{driven by}} Bertrand Gachot. Things started inauspiciously for the team, when Gachot pre-qualified dead-last for the 1990 United States Grand Prix. In fact, Gachot failed to pre-qualify in each and every race that he drove the Subaru-powered C3B, and also the 1990 German Grand Prix and 1990 Hungarian Grand Prix in the new Cosworth-powered C3C. By the 1990 Belgian Grand Prix, however, things had {{improved}} marginally; Gachot pre-qualified a Coloni {{for the first time}} in a year, but was still 30th and last in qualifying proper. From then onwards, Gachot would regularly pre-qualify his C3C, but never once managed to get through qualifying proper, and Coloni finished the season without ever actually competing in a race.|$|R
2500|$|Holtz {{went to the}} University of Arkansas in 1977. In {{his seven}} years there, the Razorbacks {{compiled}} a 60–21–2 record and reached six bowl games. In his first season at Arkansas, he led them to a berth in the 1978 Orange Bowl against the Oklahoma Sooners, then coached by University of Arkansas alumnus Barry Switzer. The Sooners were in position to win their third national championship in four seasons after top-ranked Texas lost {{earlier in the day}} to fifth-ranked Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic. [...] Arkansas' chances looked <b>slim</b> after the <b>team</b> lost several key personnel just before the game. [...] In one of his last practices, All-American guard, Leotis Harris suffered a season-ending injury, and only {{a couple of days later}} Holtz suspended both starting running backs, Ben Cowins and Michael Forrest, and top receiver, Donny Bobo, for disciplinary reasons. [...] However, behind an Orange Bowl record of 205 yards rushing from reserve running back Roland Sales the Hogs defeated the Sooners, 31–6. Holtz was widely considered to be the leading candidate to replace Woody Hayes at Ohio State in 1979, but Holtz did not pursue the job because he did not want to follow Hayes.|$|R
5000|$|Final Round: The {{final round}} found the team leaders in glass {{containers}} below a slime showerhead. One of their team-mates would be blindfolded, whilst {{the other would}} have their hands tied around their back. The four teammates would them look through a blue vat of slime for a disc with a question in it. Whichever team got the disc had the choice to either answer the question themselves, or force the other team answering the question. Should the answering team get their question right, they would get 50 points and the other team's captain would be <b>slimed.</b> If both <b>teams</b> are holding the disc simultaneously, the question is read and anyone can buzz in to answer the question. If the answering team answers the question incorrectly, their opposing team would get 50 points and their team captain would be slimed. Occasionally, both captains were slimed.During Diarmid's run, the lever to operate the [...] "slime" [...] (a mud-coloured liquid) was pulled by someone unseen. During Adrian and Zoe's run, the lever was pulled by Adrian, who would often make faces at the camera while dramatic music played (the slime went between a green-yellow colour and a blue colour, which would vary in episodes). When Diarmid hosted, the segment was called [...] "Slime Time". When Adrian and Zoe hosted, the segment (and the tank) were renamed [...] "Hyperflush." [...] Sometimes, a guest would {{be present in the}} show such as the team's school principal or a teacher and they would be slimed with one of the team captains.One of the prizes during Diarmid's run were merchandise from the Australian Geographic retail outlets and occasionally, A Sega Saturn gaming console. One of the prizes during Adrian and Zoe's run were Lorus watches, and Sony Music Australia CDs.|$|R
2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, {{and left the}} sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette that looks like a taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made <b>slimmer,</b> though the <b>team</b> noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|R
