40|$|Growth ring {{occurrence}} {{was investigated}} in 48 representative species of cerrado {{in the state of}} SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. We characterized growth ring markers and described the growth layer structure of the basal portion of the most developed stem branches in woody plants. Growth rings were poorly defined in 33 %, well defined in 61 % and not discernable in 6 % of the species studied. Various anatomical features were used as growth markers, such as: thick-walled latewood fibres; radially flattened latewood fibres; fibre zones; distended rays; marginal bands of axial parenchyma; marginal lines of parenchyma; and closeness of the narrow bands of <b>scalariform</b> <b>parenchyma.</b> In a single species, different growth ring markers often occurred together. Within growth layers, variations in the anatomical features were observed. Variations in the axial parenchyma distribution within growth rings in Vochysia cinnamomea, Qualea multiflora, V. rufa and V. tucanorum, wood are here reported for the first time. Variation in the distance of the axial parenchyma in narrow bands along the rays within growth layers in Annona coriacea, A. crassiflora, Diospyrus hispida and Roupala montana wood is also reported. Phenology and habit of the studied species were important aspects related to both growth ring presence and distinctness {{as well as to the}} anatomical features' variations within growth layers...|$|E
