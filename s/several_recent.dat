5|$|The Solar System {{is in the}} Local Interstellar Cloud or Local Fluff. It {{is thought}} to be near the {{neighbouring}} G-Cloud but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of <b>several</b> <b>recent</b> supernovae.|$|E
5|$|The West Point Cemetery is {{the final}} resting place of many notable {{graduates}} and faculty, including George Armstrong Custer, Winfield Scott, William Westmoreland, Earl Blaik, Maggie Dixon, and sixteen Medal of Honor recipients. The cemetery is also the burial place of <b>several</b> <b>recent</b> graduates who have died during the ongoing conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of the older grave sites have large and ornate grave markers, the largest belonging to Egbert Viele (class of 1847), chief engineer of Brooklyn's Prospect Park. The cemetery {{is also home to}} a monument to Revolutionary War heroine Margaret Corbin.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} site {{has been the}} subject of <b>several</b> <b>recent</b> redevelopment proposals, including a 2008 plan to demolish the building that was halted after a U.S. District Court ruling. After ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank Building was transferred to the General Services Administration in 2013, it was auctioned to Martin Selig Real Estate in 2015 for $16 million; the firm later announced plans to build a 48-story mixed-use skyscraper atop the existing building, but scaled back the project to only seven floors.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} events can disrupt and or damage the {{infrastructure}} upon which society depends. <b>Several</b> <b>recent</b> eruptions have illustrated {{the vulnerability of}} urban areas that received only a few millimetres or centimetres of volcanic ash. This has been sufficient to cause disruption of transportation, electricity, water, sewage and storm water systems. Costs have been incurred from business disruption, replacement of damaged parts and insured losses. Ash fall impacts on critical infrastructure can also cause multiple knock-on effects, which may disrupt many different sectors and services.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the city was}} {{considered}} as a site for the film The Squaw Man by Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille, but was abandoned in favor of Hollywood. <b>Several</b> <b>recent</b> movies have been filmed, at least in part, in Flagstaff. A small scene in Midnight Run was filmed in Flagstaff at the train depot, the city was also referenced in the film. Several of the running scenes in Forrest Gump were filmed {{in and around the}} area, including a memorable scene where Forrest is seen jogging in downtown Flagstaff and gives inspiration to a bumper sticker designer ("Shit happens"). Parts of 2007 Academy Award winner Little Miss Sunshine were filmed at the junction of I-40 and I-17 in Flagstaff, and Terminal Velocity was partially filmed in the city.|$|E

5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>recent</b> studies {{attempt to}} examine the effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E
5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>recent</b> {{studies have}} shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in <b>several</b> <b>recent</b> years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E
50|$|Two {{additional}} genera, Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus, were formerly considered subgenera of Presbytis. The species-level {{taxonomy of}} Presbytis is complex, and significant {{changes have been}} proposed for <b>several</b> in <b>recent</b> years.|$|R
