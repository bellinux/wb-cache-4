TEAOH or n-butylamine can take the role of template when less TPABr is added. It indicates that the ability of organic amines or ammoniums to direct the Pentasil structure decreases as follows: TPA(+) >TBA(+) >TEA(+) >n-butylamine. Catalysts exhibiting good performance in epoxidation of propylene can be attained using TPABr as the template and ammonia, n-butylamine, diethylamine, hexanediamine or TBAOH as bases.

30|$|Zeolites are {{minerals}} of aqueous aluminosilicate {{group of}} alkali and alkaline-earth metals, which have complex three-dimensional lattice and highly ordered structure. They {{can be both}} natural and artificially synthesized [1]. An important characteristic of zeolites is the Si/Al ratio [2]. It can be changed, thus varying the zeolite charge and hydrophobicity, the number and size of pores. These properties make zeolite an important material in petrochemistry, environmental science, agriculture, medicine, and many other fields. The chemical composition of zeolites can be represented by the formula Mx/n|·[(AlO 2)x·(SiO 2)y]·zH 2 O, where M is the cations of valence n (commonly Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +, Sr 2 +, and Mg 2 +), z {{is the number of}} adsorbed water molecules and the ratio у/х can vary in a wide range from 1 —for low-silica zeolites A and X, to ∞—for crystalline <b>silicalites.</b> For the latter, the cation concentration is close to zero.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} of <b>silicalites</b> and Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSN), which covalently incorporate original water-soluble photosensitizers for PDT applications is described.

Functionalization with mannose was necessary to obtain the best results with PDT due to an active endocytosis of mannose-functionalized nanoparticles. The quantity of mannose on the surface should be carefully adjusted as a too high amount of mannose impairs the phototoxicity of the nanoparticles.

40|$|In {{attempts}} to fabricate model systems of Fe-containing aluminosilicates, we studied incorporation of iron into silicate and aluminosilicate bilayer films grown on Ru(0001). Structural characterization {{was performed by}} low energy electron diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. The experimental results show that even at low concentrations Fe does not randomly substitute Si(Al) cations in the silicate framework, but segregates into a pure silicate (aluminosilicate) phase and an Fe-silicate phase which is formed by an FeO(111) -like layer underneath a silicate layer. At high Fe/(Si+Al) molar ratios, the resulting films showed two phases depending on the annealing temperature. In both phases, the surface exposes a silicate layer and the bottom layer is dominated by FeO. The Al ions seem {{to be present in}} the bottom layer at relatively low oxidation temperatures, but segregate as alumina clusters at the surface at higher temperatures.

40|$|The {{isomorphous}} {{substitution of}} Al and/or Si by other tri- and tetravalent metal ions {{is generally considered}} a tool for tailoring the catalytic properties of zeolites. A large number of elements have been incorporated into the framework, {{but only a few}} (B, Ga, Fe, V and Ti) have been tested, leading to the formation of microporous materials with catalytic properties that are {{different from those of the}} parent aluminosilicates. In particular, boron substituted zeolites (borosilicates) display lower acidic strength, which is useful when mild conditions are required (e. g. toluene alkylation with ethanol, propylene oligomerization and the conversion of methanol [1 - 3]). In this work the influence of boron on the thermal behaviour of ZSM- 5 was studied by in-situ time-resolved powder diffraction (GILDA, ESRF Grenoble). A B-ZSM- 5 (B-MFI) sample (Na 2 [Si 82 B 14 O 192] ∙ 6 EN∙ n H 2 O, s. g. Pnma) synthesized by Eni S. p. a. in the presence of ethylenediamine (EN) was selected for this study. The evolution of the B-ZSM- 5 structural features was followed through full profile Rietveld refinements in the temperature range 25 - 900 °C. TG and DTG analyses of the as-synthesized samples (heating rate of 5 °C/min) were carried out from 25 to 900 °C under a constant flux of air using a STA 409 PC LUXX® - Netzch. XRD diffraction patterns indicated that B-MFI collapses at about 770 °C and at 800 °C is converted into β-cristobalite [4]. All the unit-cell parameters increase with increasing temperatures up to the breakdown temperature. This increase is more evident in the 300 - 500 °C temperature range where the expulsion of the template occurs. This result completely disagrees with the case of <b>silicalites</b> heated after calcination, where after a slight increase in volume, up to 100 - 150 °C, negative thermal expansion is evident [5]. This fact is also present when a Si-fraction is substituted by Zr or Fe [5 - 6]. In the case of as-synthesized <b>silicalites,</b> the removal of the organic template leads to an overall contraction of the orthorhombic lattice [7]. References. [1] Chen, L. Z. & Feng, Y. Q.

30|$|To {{achieve a}} high ODS efficiency, an {{important}} issue is finding a highly active catalyst. Currently, task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs) (Zhu et al. 2013 d; Kulkarni and Afonso 2010; Zhang et al. 2013; Wishart 2009; Zhu et al. 2013 c; Jiang et al. 2015 b), metal oxides (Xiao et al. 2016; He et al. 2015; Gonzalez et al. 2017; Rodriguez-Gattorno et al. 2009), polyoxometalates (Zhang et al. 2017 b; Yang et al. 2017), titanium <b>silicalites</b> (Kong et al. 2006; Feng et al. 2017; Du et al. 2017; Shen et al. 2015), and so on have been widely employed in ODS. Among all the reported catalysts, a metal oxide is an eye-catching one, which is especially true {{when it comes to}} tungsten oxide. However, based on a previous report, stoichiometric tungsten oxide rarely shows excellent catalytic performance (He et al. 2017). For non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide, because of the variable valences of W, the tungsten oxide can be readily reacted with an oxidant to form a reactive intermediate for the further oxidation process. Nevertheless, for tungsten oxide catalysts, bulk tungsten oxide rarely has satisfying catalytic performance because of the poor exposure of catalytically active sites. Thus, numerous strategies have been adopted to improve this situation. For example, our group employed graphene-like hexagonal boron nitride as a support for dispersion of tungsten oxide to prepare the WOx in nanoparticle form (Wu et al. 2015 b). However, such strategy is less universally applicable and involves high-temperature treatment. On the other hand, the poor catalytic activity of the bulk tungsten oxide in ODS has mainly originated from the strong hydrophilic property of tungsten oxide, making the catalyst difficult to contact with the fuel oil.|$|R
