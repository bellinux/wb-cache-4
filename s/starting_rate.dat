40|$|Cycle Time – Throughput curves (CT-TH), which plot {{the average}} cycle time versus <b>start</b> <b>rate</b> {{for a given}} product mix, are often used to support {{decisions}} made in manufacturing settings, such as the impact of proposed changes in <b>start</b> <b>rate</b> on mean cycle time. Discrete event simulation {{is often used to}} generate estimations of cycle time at a significant number of traffic intensities (<b>start</b> <b>rates).</b> However, simulation often requires long run lengths and extensive output analysis. In most manufacturing environments, the time and/or budget available for such simulations is limited. As demands for faster and more accurate results are required, alternative approaches to improving simulation efficiency must be investigated.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of a manufacturing system, the analyst is often interested in the change in mean cycle time {{as a function of}} different throughput (<b>start</b> <b>rate)</b> levels. Since the variance of the mean cycle time generally increases as the <b>start</b> <b>rate</b> increases, an equal allocation of simulation effort at each simulated throughput level will result in confidence intervals of different widths. This paper discusses an approach for generating nearly equal sized mean cycle time confidence intervals at selected throughput levels when the computing budget is fixed (limited). The simulation effort allocation procedure described in this paper determines the proportion of the fixed budget to allocate at each throughput level based on the asymptotic variance. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{production}} system which produces {{a large number}} of items in many steps can be modelled as a continuous flow problem. The resulting hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) typically is nonlinear and nonlocal, modeling a factory whose cycle time depends nonlinearly on the work in progress. One of the few ways to influence the output of such a factory is by adjusting the <b>start</b> <b>rate</b> in a time dependent manner. We solve two prototypical control problems for this case: i) demand tracking where we determine the <b>start</b> <b>rate</b> that generates an output rate which optimally tracks a given time dependent demand rate and ii) backlog tracking which optimally tracks the cumulative demand. The method is based on the formal adjoint method for constrained optimization, incorporating the hyperbolic PDE as a constraint of a nonlinear optimization problem. We show numerical results on optimal <b>start</b> <b>rate</b> profiles for steps in the demand rate and for periodically varying demand rates and discuss the influence of the nonlinearity of the cycle time on the limits of the reactivity of the {{production system}}. Differences between perishable and non-perishable demand (demand vs. backlog tracking) are highlighted. ...|$|R
