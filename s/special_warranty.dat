50|$|In the {{transfer}} of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various warranties. The precise name and nature of these warranties differ by jurisdiction. Often, however, the basic differences between them {{is the degree to}} which the grantor warrants the title. The grantor may give a general warranty of title against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. The latter type of deed is usually known as a <b>special</b> <b>warranty</b> deed. While a general warranty deed was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, <b>special</b> <b>warranty</b> deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{warranty}} deed {{is a type}} of deed where the grantor (seller) guarantees that he or she holds clear title to a piece of real estate and has a right to sell it to the grantee (buyer). This is in contrast to a quitclaim deed, where the seller does not guarantee that he or she holds title to a piece of real estate. A general {{warranty deed}} protects the grantee against title defects arising at any point in time, extending back to the property's origins. A <b>special</b> <b>warranty</b> deed protects the grantee only against title defects arising from the actions or omissions of the grantor.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} demonstrates, through an example, that, in oligopolistic markets, {{it is only}} in <b>special</b> cases that <b>warranties</b> can serve as signals of quality. Warranties are perfect signals only in cases in which the {{intrinsic}} attributes of products are neither too clustered nor too widely spaced. Otherwise, multiple separating equilibria arise and the informational content of warranties is limited. ...|$|R
5000|$|Most often late-model, {{they differ}} from other used cars by having been inspected, refurbished, and {{certified}} by a manufacturer or other certifying authority. They also typically include an extended <b>warranty,</b> <b>special</b> financing, and additional benefits. Luxury marques Lexus and Mercedes-Benz {{were among the}} first to create CPO programs in the 1990s. There are variations as to what is termed certified pre-owned, so the distinctions are important. Manufacturer (or [...] "factory") CPO vehicles are only sold at authorized dealers specializing in that particular franchise. Factory CPO cars are generally five years old or newer and have less than 80,000 miles. They often cost more than vehicles certified by independent authorities, and are higher priced than a non-certified used vehicle. Independent programs can represent good value and an alternative to an OEM program. Independents may hold a vehicle to a higher standard than an OEM, or may be less stringent in their inspections. Independents include brands such as the National Vehicle Certification Program (or [...] "NVCP"), Carmark, and others. Dealer-certified programs represent a third category, as they are often promoted as Certified Pre-Owned. These vehicles generally have not been inspected by anyone outside the dealership, but do typically carry a warranty or extended service contract to provide some protection to the consumer.|$|R
5000|$|... 1981's biggest {{news was}} the {{introduction}} of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in3 V8-6-4 engine. Developed by the Eaton Corporation - with design elements that had been tested for over 500000 mi - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete stop, 6 cylinders during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered <b>special</b> extended <b>warranties</b> to customers. Also available was Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The [...] Buick V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering {{in the spring of}} 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the belt reel was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the seat belt latched at all times, and simply {{get in and out of}} the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The V6 option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 Cadillac Brougham models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and thumb wheel in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or [...] "max" [...] settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).|$|R
40|$|In Swiss law the buyer's {{remedies}} for {{breach of warranty}} of quality remedies are different in many respects from his other contractual remedies. The aim of this thesis {{is to show that}} it is not a necessity but rather a source of confusion for the Swiss legal system to have special {{remedies for}} breach of warranty. General contract remedies could very effectively and rationally compensate buyers for breaches of quality warranties. To achieve this aim this study starts by analysing the historical reasons for the adoption of <b>special</b> <b>warranty</b> remedies. In its second half it compares each warranty remedy found in the Swiss Code of obligations with its equivalent in three recent legal systems: Quebec law, the Uniform Commercial Code of the United States and the United Nations 1980 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods...|$|E
