40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a major}} public health problem and the {{identification}} of individuals at risk of persistent LBP poses substantial challenges to clinical management. The <b>STarT</b> <b>Back</b> questionnaire is a validated nine-item patient self-report questionnaire that classifies patients with LBP at low, medium or high-risk of poor prognosis for persistent non-specific LBP. The objective {{of this study was}} to translate and cross-culturally adapt the English version of the <b>STarT</b> <b>Back</b> questionnaire into French. Methods: The translation was performed using best practice translation guidelines. The following phases were performed: contact with the <b>STarT</b> <b>Back</b> questionnaire developers, initial translations (English into French), synthesis, back translations, expert committee review, test of the pre-final version on 44 individuals with LBP, final version. Results: The linguistic translation required minor semantic alterations. The participants interviewed indicated that all items of the questionnaire were globally clear and comprehensible. However, 6 subjects (14 %) wondered if two questions were related to back pain or general health. After discussion within the expert committee and with the developer of the <b>STarT</b> <b>Back</b> tool, it was decided to modify the questionnaire and to add a reference to back pain in these two questions. Conclusions: The French version of the <b>STarT</b> <b>Back</b> questionnaire has been shown to be comprehensible and adapted to the French speaking general population. Investigations are now required to test the psychometric properties (reliability, internal and external validity, responsiveness) of this translated version of the questionnaire. Peer reviewe...|$|R
