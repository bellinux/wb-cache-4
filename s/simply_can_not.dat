5000|$|The {{simple truth}} is this: During my first deployment, I {{was made to}} {{participate}} in things, the enormity of which is hard to describe. War crimes, crimes against humanity. Though I did not participate willingly, and made what I thought was my best effort to stop these events, {{there are some things}} that a person <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> come back from.... To force me to do these things and then participate in the ensuing coverup is more than any government has the right to demand.

That is more veterans than children killed at Sandy Hook, every single day.... And for what? Bush's religious lunacy? Cheney's ever growing fortune and that of his corporate friends? Is this what we destroy lives for?...The fact is that any kind of ordinary life is an insult to those who died at my hand.

5000|$|Another {{big factor}} {{as to why}} college {{students}} are wanting to kill themselves is because of being a full time student and having a part time job. Being a full time student is when you take 15 units or more in a semester. It's basically like having another job. While taking these units students are very busy with school. Students {{have to put in}} the time to get all of the homework done and study for upcoming tests because {{if they are going to}} school the ultimate goal is to get good grades, and if they are not doing that then they are wasting time and money. Now if they take all these classes and have a part time job then that is just more stress on their shoulders. Working takes up time from their school work. This relates to the Carnegie Unit and Student Hour which is basically a time management idea that helps a student know how much time out of school they should be doing for their school work. For every hour a student spends in class that is equivalent to two hours of school work they should do for that class outside of the classroom. So imagine a student taking 5 classes and having a part time job that takes time from their school work. They <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> do everything they need to do.This results in doing their homework rushed and tired. Out of all this they begin to get overwhelmed with everything and they just can't take it anymore.|$|E
50|$|This is {{presumably the}} oldest living hierofalcon species.

In any case, the radiation of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons {{seems to have taken}} place in the Eemian interglacial {{at the start of the}} Late Pleistocene, a mere 130,000-115,000 years ago; the lanner falcons would thus represent the lineage that became isolated in sub-Saharan Africa at some time during the Riss glaciation (200,000 to 130,000 years ago) already.|$|R

In an interview with the Jewish Journal, he described trying to land his first client to [...] "stapling jelly to the ceiling." [...] His first clients were stand-up comedian David Brenner and actress Joan Rivers. Former David Brenner manager Steve Reidman has described Levine as someone who is devoted to his clients. Throughout his career at LCO, Levine represented many celebrity clients including David Bowie, Sandra Bullock, Michael J. Fox, Demi Moore, Nike, Ozzy Osbourne, Pizza Hut, Prince, Sharp Electronics and Barbra Streisand among many others. Levine was Michael Jackson's publicist in 1993 and 1994 during which time Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old by the name of Jordan Chandler. Prior to that time, Levine helped Jackson disseminate the story of Jackson sleeping in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, a story fabricated by Jackson. In later interviews, Levine describes the Jackson molestation accusations as one of his toughest public relations battle that he has faced. After Jackson's death in 2009, Levine was interviewed by numerous media outlets about Jackson's conditions through those years. Levine described Jackson's life a self-destructive journey and was quoted as saying, [...] "His talent was unquestionable, but so to was his discomfort with the norms of the world. A human <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> withstand this level of prolonged stress." [...] Levine has represented numerous comedians throughout his career, including George Carlin, Sam Kinison and Rodney Dangerfield. In 2010, he organized a birthday party in honor of then deceased Carlin. The event was attended by celebrities that included Tom Arnold, Paul Mooney, Paul Rodriguez, Tom Green, Judy Tenuta, Jay Phillips and Shawn Wayans, each of whom held a sign representing each of Carlin's seven dirty words. Levine also gave commentary on the Laugh Factory incident involving Michael Richards' use of racial slurrs during a stand up act in 2006.|$|E

Among other consequences, this tendency to make State intervention dependent upon a finding of serious prejudice favors the development, at the national level, of quasi-judicial organs specialised in the field of international trade, each with their own distinct interpretation of what constituted a prejudice and of the link of causality required to justify limiting imports.
