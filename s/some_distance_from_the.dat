5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{suggested that}} Wright {{may not have}} acted alone, as the remains of Anneli Alderton were found <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> road but with no evidence that her body had been dragged by one person.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened on}} 26 March 1877. Because of steep {{gradients}} near the town, {{the station was}} built in open fields <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> town itself. The station resembled in design Chingford railway station, opened in 1878, another GER branch line terminus.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding off}} the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, {{followed}} by the right center. They were again {{said to have been}} met by their own womenfolk who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the palace was destroyed, {{separation}} of crown and state had become important, with Parliament being necessary to control military requirements and pass laws. The government wanted to be <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> monarch, and the buildings around Whitehall, physically separated from St James's Palace by St James's Park, {{seemed to be a}} good place for ministers to work.|$|E
5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in {{a process known as}} autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} exactly why Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, {{believed to have been}} enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had {{gone as far as}} Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Building for the 1984–85 campaign, Bremner signed former Leeds striker Aiden Butterworth and winger John Buckley (£25,000 from Partick Thistle). Doncaster {{won five}} of their opening seven games, {{and though they}} were unable to sustain a {{promotion}} push they showed their ability with a 1–0 win over eventual champions Bradford at Valley Parade on Boxing Day and a 1–0 FA Cup win over First Division side Queens Park Rangers on 5 January. Rovers finished the season in 14th place, <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> promotion and the relegation places.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters were {{confident}} that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the dayTuesday 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies {{as well as all}} the emergency services, was run from Hertfordshire Constabulary's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|E
5|$|Newton House was {{originally}} built during the medieval period at <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> castle. It is documented {{to have been}} later modified in 1595 and 1603. The current Newton House was completed in 1660 {{under the command of}} Edward Rice. In the late 1700s, George Rice and his wife Cecil began the construction of a landscape garden, and hired eminent architect Capability Brown in 1775 to assume responsibility for the development. Turrets and battlements were added between 1760 and 1780, giving the property a more romanticised appearance. During the Rebecca Riots of 1843, Colonel George Rice was awoken one night in September and found an empty grave dug in the grounds, warning him that he would be buried in it by October 10.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire {{take place}} in the Hoenn region, located <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Kanto and Johto regions {{featured}} in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.|$|E

5|$|Soon, all {{the bodies}} except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those {{of the last}} three to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest, where they had evidently {{attempted}} to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding. There they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on April 7, 1882, then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of Chipp and his crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} built train car interiors for {{the quarantine}} car where {{the patient was}} being kept and the sleeper cars, and floated the train sets on inner tubes to create the feeling of movement. Seven different cameras were used by director Rob Bowman when filming the train car explosion. Forty-five gallons of gasoline and 120 black-powder bombs {{were used for the}} effect. The car used had been obtained cheaply from a Vancouver-based rail company, and had been considered scrap due to being bent. After the explosion was recorded, a bell from the train was recovered <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> site by the physical effects supervisor Dave Gauthier, who had it polished and engraved with a message for Bowman.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the fighting in the desert, No. 450 Squadron was allocated a ground-attack role during the Allied invasion of Sicily. Moving to Malta on 13 July 1943, the squadron staged out of RAF Luqa, and undertook its first attack in Sicily against Carlentini. Four days later, on 17 July, No. 450 Squadron relocated to Pachino, Sicily, from where it continued ground-attack missions. A further move came on 1 August, when Nos. 450 and 3 Squadrons relocated to Agnone, near Catania, where they commenced close air support operations on 11 August, working closely with Allied ground units around Mount Etna. On the night of 11 August, the airfield was attacked by Ju 88 bombers, which dropped incendiary, anti-personnel and high-explosive bombs for more than an hour. No. 450 Squadron's personnel had been located <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> airfield and only one Australian was wounded, although casualties among other units amounted to twelve killed and 60 wounded. Eighteen RAAF Kittyhawks were destroyed, including eleven belonging to No. 450 Squadron. Despite this, the two RAAF squadrons flew 22 sorties the following day.|$|E

5|$|Hargest and his brigade {{took part}} in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Crete in May. The 2nd New Zealand Division was under the command of Brigadier Edward Puttick due to Freyberg taking command of Creforce, which consisted of all the Allied troops on Crete. Puttick gave Hargest's brigade the task of defending the airfield at Maleme and its easterly approaches. The 21st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew, guarded the airfield itself and a neighbouring hill, Point 107, with the other two battalions of the brigade positioned further east while Hargest situated his headquarters at <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> airfield. Within days of arriving on Crete, the Allied positions began to be the subject of strafing and bombing attacks by German planes as a precursor to an airborne invasion mounted by German paratroopers of the 1st Parachute Division. The bombing triggered in Hargest an occurrence of his shell shock, rendering him lethargic and confused.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{plan for}} July 2 called for Longstreet {{to attack the}} Union's left flank, which would be {{followed}} up by Hill's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet {{was not ready to}} attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from Lee to wait for Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade (Hood's division) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades; Law marched his men quickly, covering 28 miles in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column, and <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> attack positions they would need to reach. All of Longstreet's divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the River Rother {{no longer}} follows its ancient course, {{as it once}} flowed across Romney Marsh and joined the sea at Dungeness. It is widely {{asserted}} that in 1287 a hurricane, known as the Great Storm, caused large quantities of shingle and mud to be deposited on the port of Romney and {{the mouth of the}} river. The water from the river created a new channel, joining the River Brede and the River Tillingham near Rye, where the combined rivers flow into the sea. However, Tatton-Brown has argued that patterns of occupation on Romney Marsh suggest that the change of route took place at least a century before that date. Rye became part of the Cinque Ports in the thirteenth century, and although it is situated <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea, its harbour is still visited by commercial shipping and has a fleet of fishing boats.|$|E
25|$|At <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> Kasarvadavli, <b>the</b> {{natural forest}} cover of Sanjay Gandhi National Park starts growing. Parts of this forest cover, along with {{portions}} of the Vasai Creek, can be seen while travelling on the Ghodbunder Road.|$|R
25|$|The W {{station was}} located <b>some</b> {{considerable}} <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area near street level, and this later led to persistent complaints as it required passengers {{to climb a}} steep and lengthy gradient to reach the exit.|$|R
