40|$|The Article {{addresses}} the frequently litigated {{issue of the}} ownership of joint bank accounts that elderly people may have opened to protect against incapacity or to avoid FDIC insurance limits on single accounts. Despite the strong possibility of these non-donative motives, most states—by statute or court decision—award the accounts to the surviving co-tenants instead of the depositors’ heirs or will beneficiaries. This occurs even when the account contract did not contain language of survivorship and even {{when there is no}} evidence that the depositor was offered a contract that would have allowed him or her to choose an agency arrangement. The author argues that these presumptions in favor of survivorship rights exist because of a faulty analogy to other will substitutes such as life insurance, where donative intent is clear. The author also examines the few <b>statutory</b> <b>account</b> forms that purport to allow depositors to express various intents. These forms are hopelessly complex for a depositor without legal training and propose a simpler deposit account agreement that would allow a depositor to clearly indicate whether donative intent exists...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the under-researched area of corporate governance in small firms with an explicit focus on the potential value of a nonexecutive director (NED) on the small firm board and explicitly including the production and use of financial accounting information in small firm governance research. This is motivated {{by a desire to}} better understand corporate governance in small Irish firms and by the challenge of attempting to translate insights from theoretical work on large listed firms to small firms. A testable conceptual framework based on the two interlinked themes of interest, also including demographic and economic performance variables, is proposed. The role of the external accountant {{and the nature of the}} small firm-banking relationship are also explored. Following a broadly objectivist methodological tradition, data were collected from 79 small firm owners/managers using a survey instrument; five short qualitative interviews were conducted. Strength of association, logistic regression, and innovative multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) techniques, a methodological contribution of the thesis, were applied to data analysis. The study found statistically significant associations between both corporate governance mechanisms (non-executive director related) and economic growth; small firms with at least one NED on their boards are found to be more than three times more likely to experience growth. These small firms are found to be sophisticated in production and use of FAI; they actively track financial position and cashflow. International marketoriented small firms are more likely to experience growth, to produce both useful and sophisticated FAI, and to have both a NED on board and an active board. The external accountant is mainly involved in compliance related areas such as tax planning, auditing and <b>statutory</b> <b>account</b> preparation. There is little evidence of any financial intermediation but the more general small business advisory role is probably a core relation in local and national market oriented firms, a useful finding in terms of policy. The small firm-banking relationship is found to be asymmetric in terms of power, risk and information flows; its asymmetric nature is evident in credit matters related to assetbased collateral as distinct from prospect-based lending, in financial information flows, and in a very weak advisory role when compared to the board or external accountant. The thesis may be viewed as making a modest contribution to small firm theory development as stewardship theory and both the resource-based view and resource dependency theory are shown to have some explanatory power related to corporate governance; the stewardship function of financial accounting is also highlighted. The control model is found to be more relevant to local market oriented firms than the market model; the high levels of financial and business disclosure demanded by the latter, which the international market oriented segment of the sample satisfies, requires further research on possible transitions from one to the other and why, how and when non-executive directors join such boards...|$|E

For {{the purpose of the}} paper, complementary narrative information is defined as that information which refers to specific numbers presented in the <b>statutory</b> <b>accounts</b> (profit and loss and balance sheet). Non?specific narrative information is classified as supplementary. Having made the distinction and provided reasons for such a distinction the study investigates the extent of complementary narrative commentaries on numbers from the <b>statutory</b> <b>accounts.</b> The study also investigates which company?specific characteristics are associated with the extent of complementary narrative commentaries. An index consisting of 46 items which must be reported in the <b>statutory</b> <b>accounts</b> was used to measure the extent of complementary narrative commentaries in the annual reports of 170 listed UK companies. The findings suggest that, on average, the companies comment on 39. 9 % of the numbers appearing in their <b>statutory</b> <b>accounts.</b> Using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, the results indicate that company size, gearing, profitability, liquidity ratio, the presence of exceptional items, and substantial institutional investment are significantly associated with the extent of complementary narrative commentaries. However, auditor type, directors’ share ownership, and the proportion of non?executive directors are not significantly associated with the extent of complementary narrative commentaries.

Through the adoption of IFRS a higher level of harmonization has been pursued. Up to the present, the implementation of IFRS in many European countries is only required for the consolidated statement of listed companies. To this day, numerous studies have focused on harmonization and convergence of financial accounting information in Europe, addressing impediments to convergence and providing the level of adoption of IFRS in the consolidated statements of listed European companies.

40|$|Ethical uprising, {{enforcement}} of accounting guidelines and discipline by <b>statutory</b> <b>accounting</b> body {{is an issue}} of concern that need to be uphold due to the succession of corporate scandals that took place in Nigeria and the world over, thereby undermining the image of the accountancy profession. These corporate scandals in no doubt challenged the credibility of financial statements, auditing and corporate governance practices for which accountants are directly linked with. In this paper, we examined the impasse of the 21 st century accountants and the need for ethical revolution, {{enforcement of}} accounting guidelines and discipline by <b>statutory</b> <b>accounting</b> body for erring accountants. Several impasses facing the 21 st century accountants were identified such as expectation gap (resulting to loss of public confidence in the profession), falsifying financial statements and engaging in ‘negative accounting’ among others. Questionnaire was administered to three (3) classes of respondents (investors, auditors and accounting regulatory bodies) and the data obtained were subjected to Pearson Product Moment Correlation. The study found that the impasse facing the 21 st century accountants can be repealed via ethical revolution, enforcement of accounting guidelines and discipline by <b>statutory</b> <b>accounting</b> body for erring accountants. Owing to the above findings, we proposed that the accounting regulatory bodies and the government should sanction accountants and firms engaged in unscrupulous accounting practices as well as revoking the licenses of professional accountants that precipitate such actions. As a matter of fact, seminars and workshop on issues relating to ethics and accounting guidelines should be organized for professional accountants. Also, code of professional conducts should be strictly enforced on all professional accountants by the regulatory body.

40|$|<b>Statutory</b> <b>accounting</b> {{principles}} for property-liability insurers in the United States, {{in all but}} very special circumstances, do not recognize the time value {{of money in the}} establishment of loss reserves. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 stipulates an interest rate and a methodology for discounting loss reserves for tax purposes. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is studying the discounting issue. In-surers need to consider the appropriate procedures and interest rates to be used in discounting loss reserves. This paper proposes a method of calculating loss payout patterns based on paid loss development data combined with other reserving techniques that would minimize the ad-ditional effort involved in adopting discounting. It also analyzes the repercussions of adopting discounting for <b>statutory</b> <b>accounting</b> purposes. Discounting loss reserves would have both positive and negative effects on the property-liability insurance industry. Discounting at an appropriate interest rate would increase the usefulness of the combined ratio as a profitability measure, with values less than 100 indicating profits and in excess of 100 indicating losses, subject to the accuracy of loss reserves. Statutory surplus would increase as a result of discounting, which, although having no real economic effect, might provide more capacity for the insurance industry due to regulatory reliance on statu-tory values. Conversely, discounting would increase the complexity of loss reserving, create a dependence of reserve adequacy on future in-terest rate levels, and increase the expenses of insurers by raising tax levels. Discounting would have its greatest impact on commercial and professional liability insurers. 76 LOSS RESERVING TECHNIQUES 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the factors that affect the utility of the <b>statutory</b> <b>accounts</b> to the directors of small companies in the UK. The directors' views are important, as they are the main users of the accounts; small companies are important because of the significant role they play in the economy. In this thesis, small companies are defined according to the 1999 EU size thresholds (turnover £ 4. 2 m, balance sheet total £ 2. 1 m, and employees 50). The study is set in the context of the continuing development of little GAAP in the UK; whereby small companies are offered some simplifications and exemptions from mainstream requirements. The government's rationale for regulatory relaxation is based on an assumption that it will reduce burdens. However, the costs and benefits of financial reporting by small companies is an under-researched area in the literature and, to a great extent, the views of the directors have been ignored. Proposals to raise the qualifying thresholds for small companies to the EU maxima have resulted in controversy, but so far, the debate has been dominated by mainly anecdotal evidence from the regulators and the accountancy profession. The present study addresses this deficiency and is set within a positivist paradigm. The methodology included a small preliminary survey and exploratory interviews. The main survey took the form of a postal questionnaire sent to a random, systematic sample of independent, private limited companies filing full accounts. The sample was chosen to represent those that were likely to qualify for little GAAP as well as those were likely to do so if the thresholds were revised to the EU maxima at the time of the survey in 1999. Usable responses were received from 385 companies, giving a response rate of 17 %. Tests for generalisability and non-response bias were non-significant. Due to the nature of the selection criteria and limitations of the sampling frame, the findings cannot be generalised to companies with a turnover less than £ 0. 5 m, very young companies that had failed before filing accounts or those that had not filed full accounts at the time of the survey. The research updates and extends previous knowledge. The study reveals a considerable amount of detailed information concerning the factors that influence the directors' financial reporting choices and the factors that influence their use of the <b>statutory</b> <b>accounts.</b> Using a series of logistic regression models, four factors were found to be significantly associated with the utility of the <b>statutory</b> <b>accounts</b> :from the directors' point of view: The accounts are audited.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{assesses the}} {{influence}} of IFRS adoption on management accounting of Czech unlisted companies under foreign control belonging to groups, for which consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRS are prepared.

The paper investigates the perception of management {{on the importance of}} IFRS for internal decision making. Our results, based on questionnaire survey, show that forced IFRS adopters steadily integrate the IFRS principles into management accounting subsystem. IFRS influence is derived from the structure of executive compensation schemes constructed by parent companies and has impact primarily on the definition of key performance indicators and other financial targets.
