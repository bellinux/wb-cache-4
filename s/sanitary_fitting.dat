40|$|Abstract- Data on {{pressure}} drop were obtained in stainless steel, <b>sanitary</b> <b>fittings</b> and valves during laminar and turbulent flow of aqueous solutions of sucrose and xanthan gum, which were selected as model fluids. The rheological properties of these solutions were determined and the power-law model provided the best fit for experimental data. Friction losses were measured in fully and partially open butterfly and plug valves, bends and unions. Values of loss coefficients (kf) were calculated and correlated {{as a function}} of the generalized Reynolds number by the two-k method. The model adjustment was satisfactory and was better in the laminar flow range (0. 976 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 999) than in the turbulent flow range (0. 774 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 989). In order to test the adequacy of the results for predicting loss coefficients during flow of real fluids, experiments were conducted with coffee extract. Comparison between experimental and predicted loss coefficients showed very good agreement...|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} {{and the case}} study proposed in this paper are motivated by a German <b>sanitary</b> <b>fittings</b> producer that was acquired by a private equity company. The old-established manufacturer, traded as a joint-stock, was characterized by ongoing expansion and thus developed to a global leader in the market segment. After 10  years, {{and even though the}} company was still growing, the owners decided to sell it to an institutional investor. The new owner started to coordinate the whole business by appointing a holding company that claimed massive annual cash outflows from the related supply chain (SC). This led to restructuring activities including the need to cut down costs and staff. A resulting decline in sales and profits began to risk the company’s continued existence. The reasons for the business problems were obvious. The investor considered the acquisition as pure financial investment focusing only on the expected return. Existing efficient network structures including locations, capacities and business partner relations as well as the supply chain operations were disregarded, as a counterproductive decoupling of decisions could be observed in this case.|$|R
