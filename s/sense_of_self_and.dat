25|$|Adults with C-PTSD have {{sometimes}} experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization as {{children as well}} as prolonged trauma as adults. This early injury interrupts the development of a robust <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> of others. Because physical and emotional pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may develop a sense that they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon.|$|E
25|$|For those enslaved in {{situations}} of forced labor, learned helplessness can also manifest itself through the trauma of living as a slave. Reports indicate that captivity for the person and financial gain of their owners adds additional psychological trauma. Victims are often cut off from all forms of social connection, as isolation allows the perpetrator to destroy the victim's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> increase his or her dependence on the perpetrator.|$|E

This concept links with social identity theory in that that difference between a hard-working group {{and one that is}} loafing is the match between the group’s tasks and its members’ self definitions. When individuals derive their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> identity from their membership, social loafing is replaced by social laboring (members will expand extra effort for their group).|$|E

Gender identity may or may not conform to a person's birth assigned sex. The personal characteristics that are associated with gender identity include self-image, physical and biological appearance, expression, behaviour and conduct, as they relate to gender. … Individuals whose birth-assigned sex does not conform to their gender identity include transsexuals, transgenderists, intersexed persons and cross-dressers. A person's gender {{identity is}} fundamentally different from and not determinative of their sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|In the pre-modern era, many people's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> {{purpose was}} often {{expressed}} via a faith {{in some form}} of deity, be it that in a single God or in many gods. Pre-modern cultures have not been thought of creating a sense of distinct individuality, though. Religious officials, who often held positions of power, were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person. It was only through these intermediaries that the general masses had access to the divine. Tradition was sacred to ancient cultures and was unchanging and the social order of ceremony and morals in a culture could be strictly enforced.|$|E
25|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD), {{also known as}} emotionally unstable {{personality disorder}}, is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable relationships with other people, unstable <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> unstable emotions. There is often frequent dangerous behavior, a feeling of emptiness, self-harm, and an extreme fear of abandonment. Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs {{across a variety of}} situations. Substance abuse, depression, and eating disorders are commonly associated with BPD. BPD increases the risk of self-harm and 10% of people affected die by suicide.|$|E

Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change their minds about how to live; neither can we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{examining}} employers' {{attempts to}} regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' {{respond to these}} regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage {{in some form of}} emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E
25|$|All that exists, {{throughout}} all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects {{within the field}} of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, {{is the result of the}} natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the catalytic potential for autoethnography, {{one of the}} “new ethnographies” (Goodall, 2000), to provoke emancipatory consciousness raising activity. Autoethnography opens possibilities {{for the development of}} a critical reflexivity wherein <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self</b> <b>and</b> agency might come to be understood in terms of the social processes that mediate lived experience and the material realities of individuals. It is on this basis that autoethnography offers opportunity for the enactment of a genuinely critical pedagogy.

40|$|Through {{collaborative}} narrative writing, in this article, we redeploy the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> refugeity {{present in}} our singular narratives to co-construct a shared space for creative scholarship {{that becomes a}} feminist space to belong. Drawing on feminist scholarship and performance theory, narrative collaborations awkwardly embrace our mutual <b>and</b> sometimes contradictory <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> identity performance. The co-constructed nature of this article reflects contemporary developments in qualitative research that employ creative arts practice-led methodologies and acknowledge researcher/writers as situated gendered, sexualized, and encultured subjects within particular global and local contexts.

40|$|This book rethinks {{mathematical}} {{teaching and}} learning with view to changing them to meet or resist emerging demands. Through considering how teachers, students and researchers make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> their worlds, the book explores how some linguistic and socio-cultural locations link to prevalent conceptions of mathematics education. The locations include classroom mathematics, spatial awareness, media images of mathematics, curriculum development, teacher education and mathematics education research itself. The book introduces cutting edge theories of subjectivity that trouble more familiar psychological theories of “humans” apprehending mathematical “concepts”. Rather, it suggests that our <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> mathematics result from self-reflections within the various localities in which we live. In foregrounding subjectivity the book shows how mathematics can provoke alternative ways of thinking towards enlivening our transformative capacities. Learning itself is depicted as participation in cultural renewal, where the very mathematics encountered is becoming something new. Addressing teachers, teacher educators and researchers, the book invites the reader to contemplate alternative trajectories of change into fresh ways of being. ...|$|R

Lee Butler of Young Adult Library Services Association commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the Twilight books in his library because he felt the books were [...] "robbing [...] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior." [...] Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like Jezebel, The Frisky, and Salon.com have decried Twilight as promoting an anti-woman message. Bitch magazine stated the novels [...] "had created a new, popular genre of [...] "abstinence porn", concluding that, [...] "In reality, the abstinence message—wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn—objectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn might. The Twilight books conflate Bella losing her virginity {{with the loss of}} other things, including her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> her very life. Such a high-stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless, an object, a fact that is highlighted {{when we get to the}} sex scenes in Breaking Dawn."
