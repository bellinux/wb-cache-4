In order to accurately reproduce such HF switching transients considering the current chopping, dielectric strength (DS) recovery capability and HF quenching capability of VCBs, three models are developed, i. e., a user–defined VCB model, a HF transformer terminal model and a three-core (TC) frequency dependent model of submarine cables, which are validated through simulations and compared with measurements.

Overvoltage in the system “wire – ground” is considered as obstructions which are hazard {{in relation to the}} possibility of electrical damage of the devices of relay protection and automation of substations. With the use of the inverse Laplace transformation, the solution of the problem the magnetic influence of the primary circuits to secondary circuits in the time domain depending on time of transition, which always occurs during the distribution of the voltage impulse in the buses, has been obtained. Estimation of the level of overvol tage in the system “wire – ground” for the case of failure of a bus nonlinear surges and arresters when lightning impulse of voltage is distributed on the buses along their length without deformation has been fulfilled.
