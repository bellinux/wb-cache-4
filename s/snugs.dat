60|$|Again, By {{measuring}} the city, {{he would have}} us to understand that all her limits and bounds were now apparent, that all things, even the church and all the world, were made to see their own compass. For as God {{in the days when}} temple worship only was on foot, would not lose a form or ordinance of all the forms and ordinances of his temple; so when city-work comes up, he will not lose an inch of the limits, and bounds, and compass of his city, she shall be full as large, and of as great a compass every way, as is determined of her; as he saith by the prophet, 'All the land, saith he, shall be turned as a plain (this is that which a little before is called the new heaven and a new earth); that is, there shall be a smooth face upon the whole earth, all <b>snugs,</b> and hubs,[10] and hills, and holes, shall now be taken away, even 'from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem: and it [the city] shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananiel, unto the king's wine presses' (Zech 14:10). The four places here mentioned in this verse, they do seem to be the four corners of the city of old; at which places the city bounds were set; and in which very circle the prophet tells us, but with gospel language, she shall be settled again.|$|E
50|$|The Crown has ten booths, or <b>snugs.</b> Built to {{accommodate}} the pub's more reserved customers during the austere Victorian period, the <b>snugs</b> feature the original gun metal plates for striking matches and an antique bell system for alerting staff. Extra privacy was then afforded by the pub's etched and stained glass windows which feature painted shells, fairies, pineapples, fleurs-de-lis and clowns.|$|E
50|$|Parfois {{accessories}} collection includes jewellery, sunglasses, scarves(long knitwear scarves, <b>snugs</b> {{and also}} delicate scarves and belt, hats and gloves.|$|E
50|$|Some days later, <b>Snug</b> {{offers to}} buy two mules, named Crowder and Moonbeam, from his boss, {{to add to}} his income. Roarer agrees but warns <b>Snug</b> that {{ownership}} of the mules will revert to him if <b>Snug</b> misses even one payment. <b>Snug</b> then takes Crowder and Moonbeam to Tony (Walter Brennan)'s farm, and Tony, who was once a dedicated mule driver before falling down on his luck and becoming an alcoholic. While learning about the mules, <b>Snug</b> also deals with Judith and Stretch, {{who are trying to}} take over the Dominy farm.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>Snug</b> {{learns that}} his father has died, leaving him the Dominy farm, and Tony {{promises}} to consult Judge Stillwell about evicting Stretch and Judith. Soon after, Stretch places a wire snare in Crowder and Moonbeam's stall {{in an attempt to}} cripple them. <b>Snug</b> and Rad, who are out on a date, return to Tony's house and there catch Stretch as Crowder is crushing him against the barn wall. <b>Snug</b> rescues Stretch from Crowder then throws him off Tony's property. Later, Judge Stillwell and Sheriff Bursom evict Stretch and his mother from the Dominy farm. As <b>Snug,</b> Rad and Tony are riding back to Tony's, they pass Roarer, whose tractor is stuck in the mud. <b>Snug</b> bets Roarer that if Moonbeam and Crowder can pull the tractor free, Roarer will forget <b>Snug's</b> debt, but if they fail, Roarer will reassume possession of them. <b>Snug</b> also asks for Roarer's blessing of his marriage to Rad if he succeeds, and Roarer reluctantly agrees. <b>Snug</b> expertly drives the animals and soon the tractor is free. Finally, as a happy Rad joins <b>Snug,</b> Roarer concedes that at least the mules will still be in the family.|$|R

50|$|One day, <b>Snug's</b> {{deliberate}} insolence prompts Roarer to fire him, and <b>Snug</b> {{goes to work}} at {{the lumber}} camp. <b>Snug</b> intends to use his first week's pay for another installment on the mules and is devastated when Tony, who was holding the money, returns home drunk and broke. <b>Snug</b> begs Roarer to accept a double payment in a few days, but Roarer refuses and asks Sheriff Tod Bursom to enforce his right to reclaim the mules. Seeing this, Roarer's wife Lucy finally stands up to her overbearing husband and loans the money.|$|R

50|$|Isaiah Wilson <b>Snugs</b> House, {{also known}} as the Isaiah Wilson Snuggs House and the Marks House, are two {{historic}} homes located at Albemarle, Stanly County, North Carolina. The Marks House was built about 1847, and is a two-story, transitional Federal / Greek Revival style frame dwelling. It is the oldest surviving house in Albemarle. It was moved to its present site behind the Snuggs house in 1975. The Isaiah Wilson Snuggs House, the second oldest in Albemarle, was built about 1874, and is a two-story, three-bay, frame dwelling, with a two-room kitchen/dining room ell. The houses were restored in the 1980s and are operated as historic house museums by the Stanly County Museum.|$|E
5000|$|Yoke front boxers {{are similar}} to gripper boxers in that the wide {{waistband}} yoke can be opened up completely, and the yoke usually has three snaps to close it while the fly itself, below, has no closure mechanism. There {{are two types of}} yoke boxers: one {{in which there is a}} short piece of elastic on each side of the waistband which <b>snugs</b> up the yoke to fit the waist; and [...] "tie-sides" [...] which have narrow cloth tapes on each side of the waist yoke, like strings, which are tightened and knotted by the wearer to make an exact fit. This style of underwear was very common during World War II, when the rubber needed for elastic waistbands had to be used for military purposes.|$|E

Throughout the {{restaurant}} there are various <b>snugs,</b> and it has an open room that can store up to 60 kegs of beer. The pub also has an official replica of St. James's Gate at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin where the beer is brewed and shipped.Shortly after {{the opening of the}} pub’s second location, Kildare’s was opened in Manayunk, a section of Philadelphia, in 2004. The opening of the Scranton pub soon followed. [...] Kildare’s Newark, Delaware location was the first Kildare’s opened outside of Pennsylvania in 2008. [...] The pub's most recent openings were in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in April 2010 and in Notre Dame, Indiana in August 2010.|$|E

At the camps, families access much-needed respite, support and healthcare. <b>SNUG</b> also provides undergraduate speech pathology students with the opportunity to augment their clinical education by becoming <b>SNUG</b> volunteers. Through the camps students experience strength-based, family centred practice and gain insights into the lives of families living with special needs.

5000|$|In 2013 Eskelin {{released}} a new recorded project for clean feed records entitled Mirage, improvisations with Susan Alcorn (pedal steel guitar) and Michael Formanek (double bass). Eskelin remarked {{that he was}} interested in exploring the [...] "expressive range of the saxophone that is perhaps most associated with its beginnings" [...] and that his objective is to [...] "bring that type of lyricism to the language of contemporary improvised music." [...] Continuing with this idea, in the liner notes to his 2015 release Solo Live at <b>Snugs</b> on hatOLOGY records, Eskelin discusses a revamped approach to solo saxophone performance, updating his 1992 release Premonition - Solo Tenor Saxophone in which he compares the two projects by saying “As opposed to reimagining my instrument I’m very much interested in the essence of a saxophone as being just what it is, a saxophone.” Going even further, Eskelin was interviewed by the web based music journal “Point of Departure” in 2016 [...] in which he conveyed his increasing advocacy of acoustic (non-amplified) performance in humanistic, if not spiritual terms. One such project that adheres to this aesthetic was released on the Swiss Intakt label in 2017, titled “Sensations of Tone” with bassist Christian Weber (from Zürich) and Michael Griener on drums (based in Berlin). This trio alternates freely improvised music with early jazz classics by composers such as Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller. The group performs acoustically (with bassist Weber opting not to use an amplifier). In this same interview Eskelin also expresses concern about the effect of technology on the artistic experience (for both performers and audience) as well as the potential for the disruption of personal and community engagement.|$|E

50|$|The Children's Museum {{consists}} of two buildings with a connecting walkway. The museum is housed in the main building which was originally built in 1913 {{as part of the}} <b>Snug</b> Harbor Complex and the old <b>snug</b> harbor barn where the livestock was originally kept to feed the residents of Sailors <b>Snug</b> Harbor. When the museum was developed, a modern walkway was built connecting the two structures to create one museum building.|$|R
5000|$|Cozi, {{played by}} Nigel Cooper, wears {{a red and}} silver {{spacesuit}} and he looks very similar to <b>snug</b> except he has a mustache. Cozi seems slightly brighter than <b>Snug</b> but still occasionally gets things wrong.|$|R
5000|$|The {{residents}} of sailors <b>snug</b> harbor were buried {{on the grounds}} in what was called [...] "monkey hill". The location of the cemetery is {{across the road from}} the current <b>snug</b> harbor complex in Allison Pond Park which used {{to be part of the}} original <b>snug</b> harbor campus. The Lake in Alisons Park served as a water supply for the <b>snug</b> harbor facility until 1939. The cemetery portion (surrounded by a red brick wall) is still owned by the <b>Snug</b> Harbor center while the remaining land was sold in 1975 to the city and turned into a public park with hiking trails. [...] The majority of the over thousand bodies (including those of military naval sailors) lay in unmarked graves because their headstones were removed in the 80's and put into a storage room on the main campus for [...] "preservation".|$|R
