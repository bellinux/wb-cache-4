5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|Littoral {{cells are}} usually {{an area where}} changes in the volume of {{sediment}} directly affects changes in the coastline, and ideally they are defined to minimise longshore sediment exchange with other littoral cells, for example, a pocket beach surrounded by rocky headlands (which are presumed to exclude sediments). Sub-cells are usually defined to better measure the sediment budget of a coast with varying rates of accretion and erosion. The landward boundary of a littoral cell is usually {{the foot of a}} dune or cliff, however, the seaward boundary is difficult to define as mechanisms of sediment transport here are poorly understood. There are three kinds of boundaries between littoral cells: longshore, landward, and seaward; across which sediment may enter the littoral cell or leave it by various processes. It is important to identify which processes operate on a particular littoral cell and also important to identify sediment <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinks,</b> as by measuring the sediment gained or lost by these <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinks,</b> a sediment budget can be determined.|$|E

A {{good example of}} the sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long shore transport.

25|$|Deep {{water in}} lakes {{and the ocean}} can provide {{pressure}} without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers. The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include {{the limited number of}} suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A key benefit of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by cooling air before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.|$|E

[...] Runge et al. point out that in general researchers need to estimate per capita reproduction, probability of survival, and probability of emigration to differentiate source and sink habitats. [...] If emigration is ignored, then individuals that emigrate may be treated as mortalities, thus causing sources to be classified as sinks. [...] This issue is important if the source-sink concept is viewed in terms of habitat quality (as it is in Table 1) because classifying high-quality habitat as low-quality may lead to mistakes in ecological management. [...] Runge et al. showed how to integrate the theory of source-sink dynamics with population projection matrices and ecological statistics in order to differentiate <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinks.</b>|$|E
