50|$|For the Caribbean, at least, {{this shift}} is important. Until then, British social {{science of the}} Caribbean and West Indies {{followed}} {{a modified version of}} <b>structural-functionalism</b> known as cultural pluralism. This theoretical stance had popular support among West Indian intellectuals and Independence movements, but was seen by others as a justification for racism between ethnic groups through the denial of class conflicts and class dynamics among ethnic groups. As a result, cultural pluralist thinkers were reluctant to consider modes of production or economic histories on par with social institutions such as marriage or religion. With the idea of “culture sphere,” the work of Wagley, along with Steward, Sidney Mintz, Eric Wolf, and others, helped construct a much more comparative approach for Caribbean studies.|$|E
50|$|Positively, William Catton {{came of age}} in {{sociology}} when the major debates were about social-only theoretical orientations (<b>structural-functionalism</b> or consensus theory versus Marxism or conflict theory), and methodology (quantitative versus qualitative). However, his inherent attraction to nature and understanding how the earth’s ecosystems operated afforded him the insight that human social systems including their economies operate within parameters of the natural ecology or they destroy it. Catton’s primary contribution is the trailblazing articulation of an environmental sociological framework that challenged existing sociological theories in general from a completely different tack: by synthesizing sociological and ecological theory. He argued that the prevalent idea of human control over nature, instead of being a great achievement, might only be a reflection of exploitation of natural resources that were actually finite.|$|E

5000|$|The anecdotal {{evidence}} of a racial basis for caste, which could {{be traced back to}} the late-18th century speculations of William Jones, was being buttressed by the relatively new field of study known as anthropometry and this gave rise to a form of scientific racism epitomised by the work of people such as Herbert Hope Risley, who became Census Commissioner for India in 1901. Bates remarks that Ibbetson's [...] "classification of castes, however logical and useful it might have proven, lacked a 'scientific' basis, as well as completely neglecting the problem of status." [...] In the longer term, however, Ibbetson's theories have attracted support from John Henry Hutton and Edmund Leach and have been [...] "cherished by successive generations of non-Marxist, non-Dumontian historians and anthropologists working in the classical British tradition of <b>structural-functionalism,</b> first established by Radcliffe Brown." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Lévi-Strauss' view, {{the basic}} {{building}} block of kinship {{is not just the}} nuclear family, as in <b>structural-functionalism,</b> but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This [...] "mother's brother" [...] (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as {{he is the one who}} ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such, but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two sides of one coin: the former emphasising bonds of consanguinity (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).|$|E

5000|$|In Simon Prideauxs [...] "From Organisational Theory to the New Communitarium of Amitai Etzioni", {{he argues}} that Etzionis communitarian methods are based upon earlier functionalist {{definitions}} of organizations.

Also Etzionis communitarian analysis uses a methodology which existed before {{the development of an}} organizational theory. According to Prideaux, Etzioni has taken the methodological influence of <b>structural-functionalism</b> beyond the realms of its organizational branch and fabricated it into a solution to solve the problems of modern society. Etzionis arguments on {{the creation of a new}} communitarian society are restricted to the strengths and weaknesses he witnesses in the American society in which he has lived since the 1950s. This bias [...] "neglects and denies the importance of differences within communities and among communities in different countries." [...] Thus, Etzioni makes the assumption in suggesting that only single identities or homogeneous communities exist.

5000|$|The {{roots of}} this theory {{can be traced}} back to the early 20th century, when {{industrial}} revolution was separating economic work from the family home. The 19th century’s technological advancements in machinery and manufacturing initiated the separation of work from family. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the first view of work-family theories started to shape. <b>Structural-functionalism</b> as one of the dominant sociology theories of early 20th century was a natural candidate.The structural functionalism theory, which emerged following WWII, was largely influenced from the industrial revolution and the changes in the social role of men and women during this period. This theory implies that the life is concerned mainly with two separate spheres: productive life which happens in the workplace and affective life which is at home. Structural functionalism theory believes in the existence of radical separation between work (institution, workplace, or market) and families. According to this theory, these two (workplace and family) work best [...] "when men and women specialize their activities in separate spheres, women at home doing expressive work and men in the workplace performing instrumental tasks” (Kingsbury & Scanzoni, 1993; as cited in MacDermid, 2005: 18).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{credential}} {{phenomena in}} the labor market have been given competing theoretical interpretations in the sociological literature, notably <b>structural-functionalism</b> and the conflict theories. Education as an institutionalized form of socialization allocates people with differential talents into appropriate positions, motivating achievement in meritocratic selection. Yet the functions of education also produce the unintended consequences of inequality along the axis of credentials, which gives rise to conflict as a dysfunction within the social system. This paper uses a paradigm of manifest and latent conflict in explaining credential stratification, using three empirical phenomena [...] credentialist hiring, the “sheepskin effect, ” and credential inflation [...] in the analysis of labor market inequality. Statistical tests of the empirical phenomena are formulated in supporting the conflict theories of credentialism. It is found that occupations higher in the prestige scale require higher credential attainment in entrance than occupations lower in the scale; the sheepskin effect is larger for some minority groups while it is inversely related to the rate of higher-credential holding; minority groups are predicted to adopt different patterns in credential inflation in response to labor market conditions. The study of the credentialist phenomena shows that <b>structural-functionalism</b> and the conflict theories offer competing and yet complementary interpretations of credential stratification...|$|E
