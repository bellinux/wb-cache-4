5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each <b>sworn</b> <b>clerk</b> appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a <b>sworn</b> <b>clerk</b> for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to <b>sworn</b> <b>clerk,</b> first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
50|$|Robert Bowyer was <b>sworn</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Parliaments, that is, {{senior clerk}} of the House of Lords, on 30 January 1610. Elsynge soon joined Bowyer as his assistant. They {{continued}} {{to serve as}} joint Keepers of the Records in the Tower until 1612. Elsynge's future was secured when he was formally granted the reversion of the clerkship on 1 September 1613. Around 1615 he relocated to Westminster.|$|E
50|$|Madox {{was born}} in 1666. He applied himself {{at an early age}} {{to the study of the}} common law, and was {{admitted}} to the Middle Temple, though he was never called to the bar. He became a <b>sworn</b> <b>clerk</b> in the Lord Treasurer's remembrance office (i.e. official archives), and afterwards joint clerk in the Augmentation Office, which administered the crown estates; first with Charles Batteley, who died in May 1722, and afterwards with John Batteley.|$|E
500|$|The King's Remembrancer was {{the chief}} clerk of the Exchequer, {{handling}} all bills of equity. He {{was the equivalent of}} the Court of Chancery's Master of the Rolls, in that he headed up the clerical side of the court. As well as his duties to the judicial body, the King's Remembrancer also handled the revenue side of the Exchequer, a jurisdiction established in the 14th century. He was originally able to appoint all the <b>sworn</b> <b>clerks,</b> but by the 16th century this jurisdiction had been limited to appointing one of the 24 side <b>clerks,</b> with the <b>sworn</b> <b>clerks</b> appointing the rest. In a similar way, while he was originally in charge of the court's records and the enrolment of writs, by the 17th century he no longer possessed the keys to the record office, and the <b>sworn</b> <b>clerks</b> had the exclusive right to search the records. His main job was instead quasi-judicial, examining certain witnesses, taking minutes in court and settling disputes over [...] "scandal and impertinence".|$|R
5000|$|The Office was in Chancery Lane, {{near the}} Holborn end. The {{business}} of the office was to enrol commissions, pardons, patents, warrants, etc., that had passed the Great Seal {{in addition to other}} business in Chancery. In the early history of the Court of Chancery, the Six Clerks and their under-clerks appear to have acted as the attorneys of the suitors. As business increased, these under-clerks became a distinct body, and were recognized by the court under the denomination of <b>sworn</b> <b>clerks,</b> or clerks in court. The advance of commerce, with its consequent accession of wealth, so multiplied the subjects requiring the judgment of a Court of Equity, that the limits of a public office were found wholly inadequate to supply a sufficient number of officers to conduct the {{business of the}} suitors. Hence originated the [...] "Solicitors of the Court of Chancery.” The Office also facilitated Chancery claims by litigants in forma pauperis (impoverished), including children and those suffering from mental illness.|$|R
50|$|In 1840 Field {{came forward}} as an {{advocate}} of chancery reform. His Observations of a Solicitor attracted much attention. In 1841 two of his suggestions were carried out, by {{the abolition of the}} Exchequer of pleas as a court of equity, and the appointment of two additional Vice-Chancellors. The energy with which he continued to press his views {{had much to do with}} the passing of the Court of Chancery Act 1842, by which the Six <b>Clerks</b> and <b>Sworn</b> <b>Clerks</b> were abolished, and the path was opened for further improvements in the efficiency and economy of chancery proceedings. In 1844 Field was in communication with the Board of Trade on the subject of a winding-up act for joint-stock companies. The Joint Stock Companies Act 1848 substantially embodied the proposals contained in a draft bill laid before the legal adviser of the Board of Trade on 27 April 1846, by Field and his friend Rigge, who had formerly been in his office.|$|R

5000|$|Richard {{followed}} his two older brothers, Thomas and Josias into the Middle Temple and in 1617 {{he was a}} barrister and Autumn Reader there. In 1593 he was probably Member of Parliament for the Cornish rotten borough of Mitchell together with Walter Raleigh. In the same year of 1593 he was a clerk {{in the office of}} the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer and rose to the rank of senior <b>sworn</b> <b>clerk,</b> known as the [...] "secondary". On 25 July 1622 he was knighted at Theobalds House.|$|E
50|$|While {{he was in}} France, Father Beurel also {{approached}} the Reverend Mother Superior General of the Infant Jesus Sisters to enlist some sisters in starting a school for girls. He also asked the Singapore government for land next to the church for a charitable institution for girls. When {{he was told that}} there was already sufficient land given to the church, he was said to have bought with his own money a house in Victoria Street that George Drumgoole Coleman had built for H. C. Caldwell, Senior <b>Sworn</b> <b>Clerk</b> who later became Registrar of the Court. In February 1854, the first Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus was opened.|$|E
50|$|He {{was first}} elected at the Terrebonne riding in the 1958 general {{election}} after an unsuccessful attempt there in the 1957 election. After serving his only federal term, the 24th Canadian Parliament, he was defeated at Terrebonne by Léo Cadieux of the Liberal party in the 1962 election. He then returned to private work as an accountant, and later as a bailiff. He was <b>sworn</b> in as <b>Clerk</b> of the Saint-Antoine on 16 September 1968, a position he held until his death on 11 June 1969.|$|R
500|$|The Exchequer's {{jurisdiction}}, {{at various}} times, was common law, equity, or both. Initially {{a court of}} both common law and equity, it {{lost much of its}} common law jurisdiction after the formation of the Court of Common Pleas, and from then on concerned itself with equitable matters and those common law matters it had discretion to try, such as actions brought against Exchequer officials and actions brought by the monarch against non-paying debtors. With the Writ of Quominus, which allowed the Exchequer to look at [...] "common" [...] cases between subject and subject, this discretionary area was significantly expanded, and it soon regained its standing in common law matters. Cases were formally taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but in practice were heard by the Barons of the Exchequer, judicial officials led by the Chief Baron. Other court officials included the King's Remembrancer, who appointed all other officials and kept the Exchequer's records, and the <b>sworn</b> and side <b>clerks,</b> who acted as attorneys to parties to a case.|$|R

'Be that my task' (replies {{a gloomy}} <b>clerk,</b> <b>Sworn</b> foe to mystery, yet divinely dark; [...] 460 Whose pious hope aspires {{to see the}} day When moral evidence[429] shall quite decay, And damns {{implicit}} faith, and holy lies, Prompt to impose, and fond to dogmatise:) 'Let others creep by timid steps and slow, On plain experience lay foundations low, By common sense to common knowledge bred, And last, to Nature's cause through Nature led: All-seeing in thy mists, we want no guide, Mother of arrogance, and source of pride! [...] 470 We nobly take the high priori road,[430] And reason downward, till we doubt of God: Make Nature still[431] encroach upon his plan; And shove him off as far as e'er we can: Thrust some mechanic cause into his place; Or bind in matter, or diffuse in space.[432] Or, at one bound o'erleaping all his laws, Make God man's image, man the final cause, Find virtue local, all relation scorn, See all in self, and but for self be born: [...] 480 Of nought so certain as our reason still, Of nought so doubtful as of soul and will. O! hide the God still more! and make us see, Such as Lucretius drew, a God like thee: Wrapt up in self, a God without a thought, Regardless of our merit or default. Or that bright image[433] to our fancy draw, Which Theocles[434] in raptured vision saw, While through poetic scenes the genius roves, Or wanders wild in academic groves; [...] 490 That Nature our society adores,[435] Where Tindal dictates, and Silenus[436] snores.' ...|$|R
50|$|Thomas Smith died in December 1609, and Bowyer was <b>sworn</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Parliaments on 30 January 1610, resigning {{his seat}} in Commons. He soon brought Elsynge on to assist him in the Lords. He and Elsynge {{continued}} to serve as joint Keepers of the Records in the Tower until 1612. Bowyer spent {{the remainder of his}} years organising and preserving the Parliamentary records which he had found in a sadly neglected state. Bowyer died 15 March 1621 and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West on 16 March. He died unmarried, leaving his books and papers to Henry Elsynge who succeeded him as Clerk of the Parliaments. His will was proved 22 November 1622.|$|E
