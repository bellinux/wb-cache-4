5|$|Bran Stark is awakened {{from one}} of his {{recurring}} dreams of a three-eyed crow with the pleasant <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> specially designed saddle that will allow him to ride has been finished. He goes to test it in the forest under the supervision of his brother Robb and Theon Greyjoy.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E
5|$|The black raven shakes himself, and he {{responds}} {{that he and}} the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes opened}} to their widest, so <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lashes {{had no time}} for their usual play.|$|R
2500|$|... "(I was <b>{{surprised}}</b> <b>that)</b> <b>the</b> water boiled" [...] → [...] "(I {{was surprised}} at) the boiling of the water" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{object of}} our visit {{should have been}} thus abandoned, the {{minstrel}} ran forward, and sought an explanation.|$|R
5|$|The player character, a boy scout, has {{approached}} a mansion {{looking for work}} during Bob a Job week. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses—the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boy has managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E
25|$|After the {{candidates}} were dismissed after the task, Sir Alan expressed <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girls had lost this task {{as he had}} bet {{that they would have}} won, considering the task involved flowers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a handful}} of {{accounts}} by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa'ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad as-Saffar, show their <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French sometimes deliberately mistranslated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young female, to maintain their social norms and morals.|$|E
60|$|The queen {{was greatly}} <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old woman knew her secret wish so well, {{and promised to}} follow her advice.|$|R

25|$|While {{it was no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ABC did {{not make}} an {{immediate}} announcement about the show's fate - many Australian television series will often miss a year due to actor's schedules and production demands - it was eight months before an announcement was made. During this time, Jason Donovan and Felix Nobis both {{moved on to other}} projects.|$|E
25|$|Tacitus (Hist. ii. 2, 3) records a {{visit of}} the {{youthful}} Titus to Paphos before he acceded to the empire, who inquired with much curiosity into {{its history and}} antiquities. (Cf. Suetonius Titus c. 5.) Under this name the historian doubtless included the ancient {{as well as the}} more modern city: and among other traits of the worship of the temple he records, with something like <b>surprise,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only image of the goddess was a pyramidal stone.|$|E
25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, from CH4 to C4H10 alkanes are gaseous; from C5H12 to C17H36 {{they are}} liquids; and after C18H38 they are solids. As {{the boiling point}} of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, {{it should not be}} a <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size (molecular weight) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30°C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.|$|E
60|$|We {{followed}} up the white stone side-staircase <b>that</b> leads to <b>the</b> bachelors' wing. Mr. Wontner seemed <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boys {{were not in}} the coal-cellar.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Narborough hit {{him with}} her fan. [...] "Lord Henry, I am not at all <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world says <b>that</b> you are {{extremely}} wicked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, we can't do {{anything}} on that till Abner gets well," [...] said Toby, as if <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> matter should even be spoken about.|$|R
25|$|Oulton Park has a vast {{catchment}} area which includes Liverpool, Manchester, Chester and Crewe {{so it is}} little <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second meeting and last of 1953 on 3 October, attracted a crowd of 40,000. It was a joint motorcycle and car event, the Wirral 100 Motor Club joining the Mid-Cheshire Car Club in organising it. The car side {{of the day was}} confined to three Formula III races and a final which was won by Glaswegian Ninian Sanderson from Ken Tyrrell.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it came as no <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E
25|$|It {{might have}} been well if Nubar had {{confined}} himself to this modest programme, but it was perhaps hardly to be expected of {{a man of his}} ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with no <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion seek the advice of the British agent.|$|E
50|$|Three letters form {{a thread}} <b>that</b> {{illustrates}} <b>the</b> volleying back and forth. The first {{was written by}} a mother, <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> school acted on its own.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, very well, thank you,' said Robina, rather <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lengthy {{catechism}} on {{the family}} health did not as usual start from 'poor dear Miss Geraldine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You seem <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> time of {{a female}} should have been thus employed," [...] she observed, {{with a view to}} arouse his {{attention}} to the impropriety of his observation.|$|R
25|$|In 1846 another Act of Parliament {{established}} the Great Western Dock Company to provide full facilities for shipping at Millbay. Gill sold his Millbay Pier to this company {{and became a}} director. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was engaged to design new docks; both he and Gill {{were involved in the}} South Devon Railway, so it is no <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first railway station in Plymouth was opened nearby in 1849. The next year a railway extension was built to the new docks, customs facilities were granted and the docks were recognised as a Government mail packet station.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the aims}} of the {{developers}} was to create a world which doesn't encourage any particular kind of behavior from players. They considered implementing a system similar to DayZ in which players who kill other players get unique outfits that identify them as 'bandits', or possibly a rating or color-coded system. However, the developers ultimately rejected all of these, as they felt it would detract from player freedom. Instead, they found to their <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> implementation of voice chat had a noticeable effect on player behavior. With the ability to communicate, many players would no longer kill each other on sight out of fear.|$|E
25|$|The {{four others}} {{who also have}} no cape: are all brought down from behind by Greeks: BM 526:1, BM 524:2, BM 528:23, BM 529:1. They must {{have been part of}} the {{procession}} and, lacking the advantage of <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attacking centaurs had, were the first victims of the Greeks. The two pairs of slabs that form the north part of the frieze share the same general figural pattern. A male and female pair, divine or mortal, dominate the left slab. On the right slab, a female and centaur are placed at left and a centaur and hoplite at right. This repetition highlights the contrasting movements in each pair away from the central axis.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cope {{was not at}} all <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work {{of mercy}} was blessed to all the little household, nor that it drew out all the better side of their dispositions.|$|R
25|$|BCCI and IPL {{officials}} are <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two cheerleaders did not {{complain about the}} alleged racist behaviour {{while they were in}} India and spoke about it only after they returned to London.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gentleman {{should not}} {{understand}} Messire Eustace of St. Peter's," [...] said the ghostly individual addressed as Mr. Sterne. [...] "Your reading doubtless {{has not been}} very extensive?" ...|$|R
25|$|Since prehistoric times, {{trade routes}} like the Lindenweg or Linienweg {{connected}} the Rhine-Main plain with the Usingen basin, {{which had been}} a centre of population since the Neolithic. Such routes would have followed a course {{from the mouth of}} the Nidda near Höchst, northwards across the low Taunus ridge, as does the modern Bundesstraße 456. A location along major communication routes almost always equals a strategic importance. Thus, it is no <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mountain pass beside the Saalburg was first fortified by Roman troops during Domitian's wars against the Chatti (AD 81-96), when two simple earthen enclosures were erected (Schanzen A and B, located between the restored fort and the modern road).|$|E
25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, {{it should come as no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{disagreements}} {{about the}} structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, it is no <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the second world war to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were polyphyletic, i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially Sidnie Manton. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus there was no point looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the monophyletic theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, which raises the problem of head homology once more.|$|E
50|$|Disarmed, Oswald retreats {{and quickly}} {{returns to the}} casket where he left his friend. Upon opening the coffin's lid, he is <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> doll wasn't there but only <b>the</b> {{skeleton}} <b>that</b> took over.|$|R
6000|$|She was so <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> meat {{dropped from}} her hand, and she nearly dropped the turtle, too. But {{she managed to}} control her astonishment, and asked, {{in a voice that}} trembled a little: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{judge was}} <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main accused {{could not be}} pinpointed; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accused {{received}} no benefit; and that no investigation was done prior to the arrest, all leading to his questioning the motive of the arrest.|$|R
