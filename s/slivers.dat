5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many <b>Slivers</b> that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. <b>Slivers</b> are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. <b>Slivers</b> were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E
5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses and charged, their lances each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck. This time however the lances shattered, sending <b>slivers</b> of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the spine of Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to thrust his own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>SLIVER</b> {{cells are}} thin, {{single-crystal}} silicon solar cells fabricated using standard fabrication technology. <b>SLIVER</b> modules, composed {{of several thousand}} individual <b>SLIVER</b> cells, can be efficient, low cost, bifacial, transparent, flexible, shadow-tolerant and lightweight. Compared with current conventional PV technology, mature <b>SLIVER</b> Technology will need less than 10 % of the pure silicon, and fewer than 5 % of the wafer starts per MWp of factory output. There are two distinct challenges for <b>SLIVER</b> technology: devising a robust cell fabrication method for high yield, high efficiency <b>SLIVER</b> cells, suitable for transfer to industry; and handling, electrically interconnecting, and encapsulating billions of <b>SLIVER</b> cells at low cost. We have recently fabricated <b>SLIVER</b> cells with efficiencies exceeding 20 % using an optimised process. We {{believe this is the}} first commercial thin crystalline-type technology to reach 20 % efficiency. We believe there is a path to laboratory cell efficiencies of 22 % and commercially-produced cell efficiencies of 21 %. A 100 MWp <b>SLIVER</b> factory will produce several billion individual <b>SLIVER</b> cells annually. We have developed a sub-module technology for rapid, reliable, and low-cost assembly of arrays of <b>SLIVER</b> cells to form two main types of conventional solar cell analogues that, because of their appearance, we call “Rafts ” and “Sheets”. Using our invention, Rafts and Sheets can be reliably produced at high speed using low-cost equipment and entirely conventional materials, and can be assembled into solar power modules using simple adaptations of conventional solar cell handling and stringing equipment...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sliver</b> Polygons {{are small}} areas which result from spatial {{overlays}} of different GIS layers.

25|$|Combing: Oiled <b>slivers</b> are wound into laps, {{and placed}} in the {{circular}} comber. The worsted yarn gathers together to form a top. The shorter fibres or noils remain behind and are removed with a knife.|$|E
25|$|The combed <b>slivers</b> {{produced}} on {{any type of}} combing machine are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of gill boxes in which the fibres are redistributed, the <b>slivers</b> made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|E

25|$|Note: In a wider sense Carding {{can refer}} to these four processes: Willowing- {{loosening}} the fibres; Lapping- removing the dust to create a flat sheet or lap of cotton; Carding- combing the tangled lap into a thick rope of 1/2 inch in diameter, a sliver; and Drawing- where a drawing frame combines 4 <b>slivers</b> into one- repeated for increased quality.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The new {{technology}} {{is based on the}} original four-color gill box, and adding the application of the controller. On the one hand, achieve the <b>sliver</b> color’s order can be matched at will, and every single <b>sliver</b> can be changed about the color and length, and the length of changeover portion can be designed easily, so that the final product color can be achieved in a color from deep to shallow gradients, and also can be two colors that is one of them becomes shallow gradually while another color deepened gradually; on the other hand, achieve the ratio of the colored <b>sliver</b> is adjustable without basal <b>sliver</b> feeding. In the other words, on the premise of output <b>sliver</b> thickness to maintain constant, the cross-section’s color of the <b>sliver</b> is ensured to be any independent color of the four feeding <b>sliver</b> colors, you can also have two or more color combinations. Using this {{new technology}} to produce the gradient product has been very popular in foreign countries, but is still rare in the domestic market. So this new technology will have positive effect on textile field, it can provide more new opportunities to the textile enterprises...|$|R

40|$|The Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems (CSES) at The Australian National University, with Origin Energy, has {{developed}} a novel cell fabrication process for single crystal silicon PV. The <b>Sliver</b> ® cell fabrication process produces narrow and long cells. With some modifications to the current fabrication process {{it is possible to}} produce <b>Sliver</b> ® cells suitable for concentrator systems with low to medium concentration ratios (10 to 40 suns). Such a concentrator cell may be considerably less costly to produce per unit area than conventional silicon concentrator cells. Already under development at CSES is a solar concentrator technology which is a suitable candidate for concentrator <b>sliver</b> ® cells. The existing Combined Heat and Power Solar (CHAPS) systems operates at a concentration of around 30 suns, using mirrors to focus light onto solar cells. Following development of concentrator <b>Sliver</b> ® cells it is proposed that the conventional cells be replaced by strings of series connected concentrator <b>Sliver</b> ® cells. The strings of cells will be high voltage, low current devices. In this paper designs for cells suitable for concentrated sunlight applications are investigated using 2 -D semiconductor device modelling software and the application of concentrator <b>Sliver</b> ® cells to the current solar concentrator technology is explored. It is expected that the successful production of concentrator <b>Sliver</b> ® cells will also pave the way for new concentrator PV technologies at ANU...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Sliver</b> ® solar cells, invented and {{developed}} at the ANU, allow {{a reduction in the}} consumption of silicon by a factor of 5 to 12 compared with state of the art conventional crystalline silicon modules, resulting in a {{decrease in the number of}} wafers that need to be processed to produce a kW rated system by a factor of 15 to 30. Both of these features reduce the embodied energy of <b>Sliver</b> ® modules. We have calculated an energy payback time of 1. 5 years for <b>Sliver</b> ® modules compared to 4. 1 years for conventional crystalline silicon modules. The equivalent greenhouse gas emissions embodied in <b>Sliver</b> ® modules also compares favourably to emissions from fossil fuel sources used for the generation of electricity in Australia...|$|R

25|$|West of 75-mile Creek in {{the central}} Grand Canyon, the strata of the Dox Formation occurs in small, rotated, downfaulted blocks or <b>slivers,</b> and {{commonly}} are only partially exposed. In these downfaulted blocks, only the lower two members, the Escalante Creek and Solomon Temple members, are preserved as {{the remainder of the}} Dox Formation and Unkar Group has been removed by pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion. The only complete section of the Dox Formation is exposed in the eastern Grand Canyon. In that area, the Dox formation, which is the thickest unit of the Unkar Group, has been subdivided into four members. In ascending order, they are the Escalante Creek, Solomon Temple, Comanche Point, and Ochoa Point members. The contacts between members of the Dox Formation are gradational and are based mainly on topographic expression, the sedimentary depositional environment, and color changes.|$|E
25|$|The next {{process is}} to draw the <b>slivers</b> out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to {{strengthen}} the resulting slubbing such {{that it can be}} wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Dox Formation and {{associated}} strata of the Unkar Group rocks dip northeast (10°-30°) toward normal faults that dip 60+° toward the southwest. This {{can be seen}} at the Palisades fault {{in the eastern part of}} the main Unkar Group outcrop area (below East Rim). Within the central Grand Canyon, these strata occur in small, rotated, downfaulted blocks or <b>slivers</b> where they commonly are only partially exposed. Within this part of the Grand Canyon, the Unkar Group is incomplete because pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion has removed strata above the level of the middle part of the Dox Formation. The missing part of the Dox Formation and overlying Cardenas Basalt and Chuar Group are preserved in a prominent syncline and fault block that is exposed in the eastern Grand Canyon. The Dox Formation contains thick basaltic sills and a number of small, dark dikes. In the area of Desert View and west of Palisades of the Desert, the basaltic sills form very prominent, dark gray cliffs.|$|E
