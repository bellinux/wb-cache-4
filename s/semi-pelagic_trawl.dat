40|$|Minimising {{catches of}} non-target animals in a trawl fishery reduces {{the impact on}} a marine {{community}} and may help to sustain the fishery resource in the long term. Hence the desirability for trawls that minimise impacts on non-target species while maintaining catches of target species. This study resulted from a need to further develop easily handled, semi-pelagic style trawls for Australia's Northern Fish Trawl Fishery. In November 1993 we compared catches from three differently rigged versions of a demersal wing trawl: one fished in a standard demersal configuration with its footrope on the sea bed, and two fished semi-pelagically, with their footropes raised to either 0. 4 - 0. 5 or 0. 8 - 0. 9 m above the sea bed. At two sites in the northeast Gulf of Carpentaria, each trawl type was used on the same combination of sites, grids within sites and times of day. Catches of the main target species (Lutjanus malabaricus and Lutjanus erythropterus) by the three trawl types were not significantly different. However, the mean catches of both these species and of other commercially important snappers, were highest in the <b>semi-pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> raised 0. 4 - 0. 5 m above the sea bed. This increase {{could be due to}} a larger trawl spread or to the whole rig fishing higher in the water column. Of the 107 species of fishes analysed, 61 were caught in greater abundance in the demersal trawl. Seven species were caught more effectively in the <b>semi-pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> with the footrope 0. 4 - 0. 5 m above the substrate; none was caught most effectively with the footrope set at 0. 8 - 0. 9 m. Epibenthic byproduct species (squid and Thenus orientalis), fish bycatch, sponges and other epibenthic invertebrates were also caught in lower numbers in the semi-pelagic trawls. The semi-pelagic trawls convincingly caught less (in both numbers and biomass) of the unwanted species which are normally discarded. Semi-pelagic fish trawls of the types tested would be suitable for Australia's Northern Fish Trawl Fishery and probably other demersal trawl fisheries that would benefit from the conservation of non-target epibenthic communities...|$|E
40|$|In 2013, new {{knowledge}} on <b>semi-pelagic</b> <b>trawling</b> {{has been created}} in MultiSEPT project. The achievements in the project have been possible because of extensive cooperation between the scientific and industrial partners. This report briefly describes the activities {{carried out in the}} MultiSEPT project in 2013. Full scale tests of the semi circular spreading gear (SCSG) showed that this ground gear was easy to rig and operate, its geometry was stable during towing and it had good bottom contact. The spreading (distance between wing-ends) was approximately 7 % higher with the SCSG than with the rockhopper gear for the same gear and door spreading. The SCSG had good bottom contact and passed bottom obstacles (e. g. stones) easily. The size distribution of fish caught with the SCSG was very similar to that caught with the rockhopper. However, the number of hauls performed with the SCSG and with the rockhopper was too small to draw a clear conclusion on catch efficiency. The SCSG is a gear that is easy to rig and handle on deck, it does not require accurate adjustments, it has few control points and low weight, and the results indicate that its performance at sea is at least comparable to the rockhopper gear for given bottom conditions. Further development of the SCSG should emphasise on improving the construction materials used today in oder to reduce the wearing and increase its lifetime. Two full scale tests were carried out in spring and autum 2013 to assess the effect of sweep length on herding of fish during <b>semi-pelagic</b> <b>trawling</b> for cod and haddock. The results showed that sweep length can {{have a significant effect on}} the catches. Fixing the 450 -kg chain weights right in front of the ground gear captured in up to 50 % less cod and up to 60 % haddock (of all sizes) than when the chain weights were fixed 45 m in front of the ground gear. These results demonstrate that at least under the conditions encountered in these trials, the sweeps have a major role on the fish herding process of the gear. The state estimator model (the core of of the Roll Royce Marine's e-Trawling system) was compared with data from small scale tests in SINTEF's test tank in Hirtshals, Denmark, carried out in July 2013. The results showed that the model apparently works well. The state estimator model is currently being validated against acoustic sensor data from full scale trials with <b>semi-pelagic</b> <b>trawling</b> carried out in November 2013. A concept for remote control of existing trawl doors, which is based on manipulating the moment Balance of the trawl doors, has been designed by SINTEF. This is achieved using control lines between points on the trawl door and external lines (warps or bridles). By tensioning such lines, the orientation of the trawl door is controlled, which again is used to control the hydrodynamic forces created by the trawl door. The energy consumption of this concept is greatly reduced by changing the rigging of the trawl door to reduce its stability. A pair of 0. 6 m 2 Injector XF 9 semi-pelagic doors are currently being instrumeted with actuator and will be tested in Hirtshals' flume tank in early 2014. <b>Semi-pelagic</b> shrimp <b>trawling</b> showed approx. 6 - 8 % lower fuel consumption than bottom shrimp trawling. The 2. 5 m 2 semi-pelagic doors tested during our trials were overdimensioned for the coastal trawler "Gullholmen", and they had to be set at the lowest angle of attack to reduce spreading force and match that of the bottom trawl doors normally used by the vessel. A set of smaller doors (approx. 2 m 2) would had been a better choice to achieve the spreading force necessary for a 1500 # shrimp trawl. This would have reduced the fuel consumption even more. Shrimp catches were too low (15 â€“ 45 kg/hour) and very variable from haul to haul to draw any conclusion on the fishing efficiency of the gear with the different sets of doors. Further experiments with coastal shrimp trawlers are planned for winter 2014...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, large {{quantities}} of low value bycatch (LVB) are landed by trawlers for use as fish meal and in fertilizer. Several fish meal plants have been established and high demand for the raw material is acting as an incentive for catching and landing {{large quantities}} of LVB. In Karnataka (a coastal state along west coast of India) alone, the annual turnover of fish meal and fertilizer plants {{is estimated to be}} around 270 million rupees (= 4. 6 million US). The landed LVB {{is turning out to be}} a sizeable income to the trawl operators. There are several concerns related to increasing bycatch of the trawlers. The bycatch is comprised of a high percentage of juveniles of commercially important species, resulting in recruitment overfishing. With the introduction of high speed <b>semi-pelagic</b> <b>trawls,</b> the adults of low-valued, small-sized adult fishes are also removed in large quantities, impacting the coastal marine resources. The current situation demands a robust management plan addressing the issues of the bycatch and in this regard information on quantities, value and composition of lVB landed and/or discarded, and seasonality of the catch are essential...|$|R

40|$|Baltic Sea Benthic {{ecosystem}} impacts from demersal {{fishery in}} the western Baltic is assumed to come mainly from Nephrops trawling in the central and southern Kattegat, mussel dredging in the Belt Sea, and mixed cod trawling {{in the western}} Baltic Sea. These fisheries both impact the seabed, as well as produce substantial amounts of discards. The western Baltic Sea offer {{a unique opportunity to}} analyse the benthic effects of fishingthanks to the closure of Ã˜resund to towed gears since the 1920 s, and the introduction of the Kattegat MPA in 2009 (including cod closure) and the western Baltic Sea Natura- 2000 areas. Furthermore an extensive benthic nationalmonitoring and data collection effort has taken place in the area over a number of years, which can be usedto investigate spatial and temporal differences in the development of benthic communities in (chronically) towed and non-towed areas. To evaluate benthic impacts of towed gears in the Baltic Sea a number of gear technological innovations to reduce effort, benthic contact of fishing gears, and discarding are evaluated. There are conducted experimental fisheries in relation to evaluation and comparison of direct ecosystem and habitat impacts, catch efficiency (target/by-catch/discard/invertebrates), selectivity (discard), energy efficiency, and economic efficiency (vessel specific cost-efficiency/cost-benefit analyses) of different gear modifications compared to standard gears. Furthermore, the case study evaluates potential fishing closures directed towards sensitive benthic habitats and communities. A review of known regional benthic impacts of fishery with demersal towed gears in the area is evaluated with focus on the mussel dredging, demersal cod trawl fishery and Nephrops trawl fishery, where latter is also compared to Nephrops creel fishery. Subtidal dredging and benthic trawling in the area has been reported to affect the benthic fauna and flora as well as to change the structure of the sea bed. The impact of towed gears may also reduce substrate complexity owing to by-catch and movement of shells and stones. Among other this has been demonstrated to locally reduce survival of juvenile blue mussels as well as the population structure of sessile epibenthic organisms. Benthic towing also potentially impact on water transparency either directly owing to resuspension of sediment or {{as a result of a}} reduction in the filtering biomasser. Resuspension is induced at the bottom and in the water column during towing and at the surface when by-catch of sediment is released when heaving/washing the catch. Besides reducing transparency, resuspension of sediment has been found to increase levels of ammonia and silicate in the water column and to reduce the oxygen content. The innovations evaluated comprise: A) Lighter mussel dredges with less benthic impact; B) Smart mussel and cod fishery with previous acoustic or video monitoring or test fishery on the resources before fishery to optimize the catch and to reduce total effort as well as effort on more sensitive habitats resulting in reduced benthic impact; C) Semi-pelagic doors and alternative gear riggings to lift the doors off the seafloor in the western Baltic trawl mixed cod trawl fishery. For species like cod and plaice, which are herded by the sweeps/bridles, an off-bottom door rigging where these other gear components are on the bottom, may be a solution to maintain catchability and eliminate the seabed impact of the doors. The technical challenge with such rigging is to keep the trawl door distance above bottom nearly constant. D) Another focus is scenario evaluation of different effort (re-) allocation schemes with respect to benthic impacts and catch efficiency of W. Baltic mixed trawl fishery by reduction of overall effort or effort in more sensitive habitats through potential closures. The evaluation use the DISPLACE spatial explicit bio-ecomic model (Bastardie et al. 2013; 2014). E) Use short sweep lengths to reduce benthic impacts in the Nephrops trawl fishery (standard of 74 m compared to 5 - 10 m sweeps). Shorter sweeps are not expected to change the selectivity and catch of Nephrops, because Nephrops are not herded by the sweeps, while fish by-catch and discard is expected to be reduced because of less herding. Benthic impacts of demersal trawl fishing in an open fishing area, a short-term closed area, and a long term closed area in the Kattegat and the Sound is investigated. F) Evaluate benthic impacts of creels to be compared to benthic impacts of the Nephrops-fish mixed trawl fishery through overlapping fishery, creel fishery on soft bottom, and test attachment points of creels and inside creel shelters. The comparative analysis of all the above points of changed fishing methods with less benthic impact will involve comparative analyses of catchefficiency, benthic impacts, cost benefit (CBA), energy efficiency, and by-catch and discard. Pilot investigations on use of a light mussel dredge indicate that: a) the weight of sediment retained and re-reduction in energy transfer to the sediment, c) catch efficiency tend to increase â€“ reducing effort and area of impact and reducing fuel consumption - and accordingly increasing economic efficiency, and d) Sea floor tracks made by the two dredges could be distinguished by use of a side-scan sonar and the tracks were still detectable two months after fishing. Pilot investigations in relation to use of <b>semi-pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> doors indicate similar catch rates between door settings, however, there are area and seasonal differences in the catch efficiency when using pelagic doors, possibly due to substrate or seasonal related behavior differences of cod in reaction to the gears. Pilot investigations with evaluation of mixed trawl fishery impact on W. Baltic and Kattegat sensitive habitats with respect to effort pressure is presented here and will be made finally reported under WP 2 when the actual impact of the specific gear is known. Pilot investigations of bio-diversity and presence/absence of species from benthic sampling in open and short term closed trawl fishing areas in Kattegat is ongoing. Pilot investigations with creels in (Frandsen et al. 2013 b) indicate that i) the creels sank very much down into the soft sediment (camera monitoring); ii) the creels were not directly lifted off the bottom but were dragged for several minutes making a footage (camera monitoring); iii) the bait attracted Hagfish (Myxine spp.) which scared the Nephrops in the creels => some escapement; iv) all by-catch thrown overboard immediately went to the bottom, and no predation from sea birds was observed, and there were observed no visible deviations in the cod's behaviour when they swam to the bottom; v) the catch rates were about 180 g/creel per day; vi) CBA indicate a daily profit about 3800 DKK per day which is comparable to trawl fishery for trawlers 18 m (12 - 17 m) and < 18 m (18 - 32 m) which are common for Black Sea trawl fishery fleet. In each sampling period, the catches were recorded on board from at least two commercial vessels representing the study area. Fieldwork included estimating the total catch and the relative fractions per haul and recording the faunal composition as standardized for per haul duration or per day. The sediment samplings were taken from totally 40 stations and particle size analysis were realized. The stations for sediment sampling were assigned as on a vertical line to land at certain distances from each other and at four different depths. The data derived from PSA (Particle Size Analysis) and also the information of coordinates applied to the ArcMap Sediment Classification Tool (ArcGIS ver 9. 2) to derive the habitat map of the substrate in SSA. The abundance of macro benthic fauna is greater in summer months than in winter, spring and fall. The fishing mortality is increasing in this period. 70. 3 % of total catch is composed of Rapa whelk and 29. 7 % is the bycatch species. The reasons for the heavy pressure on red mullet and whiting populations were the low selectivity of meshes and the long operation durations. The high exploitation rate generally causes the catch of relatively small and immature individuals. Though the rate of discarded catch in weight is lower than the marketed catch, as it is considered in number of individual the discarded portion is larger than the market. The age composition of red mullet was composed of 0 and 1 age groups and of whiting are 0, 1 and 2 age groups. In the whiting fishery of the 2013 and 2014, the mean values of fishing effort are found to have no significant difference between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is estimated in fall and the lowest in spring but the difference is not statistically significant. In red mullet fishery for the same years, the trend seems similar within the whiting fishery. The mean values of fishing effort in red mullet are also not significantly different between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is determined in winter and the lowest in spring with no statistical difference. Though the rate of discard by weight seems less than of landings, the rate of discard by individual number is significantly high and cause great bio-economic losses. SSA can be accepted as a soft bottom habitat that is mostly composed of muddy sand and sandy mud. Stations having hard substratum is very limited. This soft bottom is highly available for all kind of drag-net fisheries and this makes this habitat highly sensitive because of heavy fishing pressure...|$|E
