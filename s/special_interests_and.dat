5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to <b>special</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{as the price}} of silver rose, Treasury Department vaults were {{depleted}} of silver dollars by the public. No silver dollars had been minted in the United States since 1935, and a shortage developed in the Western United States, especially in areas in which gambling was common. As a result, Congress voted to authorize production of 45 million new silver Peace dollars on August 3, 1964. However, the move drew strong condemnation from critics who believed that the issuance of the coins was influenced by <b>special</b> <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> that they would be quickly removed from circulation. The dollars were subsequently melted, and the Coinage Act of 1965, enacted on July 23, 1965, forbade all production of dollar coins for a period of five years.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts <b>special</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E

2500|$|The central {{character}} in the Flaxborough Chronicles, Inspector Walter Purbright, is perhaps not the most intellectually dazzling detective in fiction. [...] He does, though, provide an unusually solid core of decency and civilisation around which more fanciful and sometimes whimsical events can be strung. [...] His understanding of the case in hand emerges from a process of polite, measured enquiry. [...] Purbright's decency {{is at the heart}} of Watson's thesis: that civilised life depends on basic tolerance, decency and the honesty of its guardians.

In Spain, for example, Catalonia by now has a high degree of autonomy within the Spanish state. The Basque Country also has a high degree of autonomy. In England, Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom are moving towards a form of autonomy and self-determination and I think there are similar developments throughout Europe. Though [...] they're mixed with a lot of pros and cons, but by and large I think it is a generally healthy development.

On January27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, [...] "Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities." [...] On television, the camera shifted {{to a shot of}} the SCOTUS judges in the front row {{directly in front of the}} President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his head side to side while mouthing the words [...] "Not true".|$|E

Cronkite criticized the present system of campaign finance which allows elections to [...] "be purchased" [...] by <b>special</b> <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> he noted that all the European democracies [...] "provide their candidates with extensive free airtime." [...] "In fact," [...] Cronkite pointed out, [...] "of all the major nations worldwide that profess to have democracies, only seven – just seven – do not offer free airtime" [...] This put the United States on a list with Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Trinidad and Tobago. Cronkite concluded that [...] "The failure to give free airtime for our political campaigns endangers our democracy." [...] During the elections held in 2000, the amount spent by candidates in the major TV markets approached $1 billion. [...] "What our campaign asks is that the television industry yield just a tiny percentage of that windfall, less than 1 percent, to fund free airtime." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was on a}} Sunday {{morning that}} Clara's letter reached Aylmer Park, and Frederic Aylmer found it on his plate as he took his place at the breakfast-table. Domestic habits at Aylmer Park had grown {{with the growth of}} years till they had become adamantine, and {{domestic}} habits required prayers every morning at a quarter before nine o'clock. At twenty minutes before nine Lady Aylmer would always be in the dining-room to make the tea and open the post-bag, and as she was always there alone, she knew more about other people's letters than other people ever knew about hers. When these operations were over she rang the bell, and the servants of the family, who by that time had already formed themselves into line in the hall, would march in, and settle themselves on benches prepared for them near the side-board,--which benches were afterwards carried away by the retiring procession. Lady Aylmer herself always read prayers, as Sir Anthony never appeared till the middle of breakfast. Belinda would usually come down in a scurry as she heard her mother's bell, {{in such a way as}} to put the army in the hall to some confusion; but Frederic Aylmer, when he was at home, rarely entered the room till after the service was over. At Perivale no doubt he was more strict in his conduct; but then at Perivale he had <b>special</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> influences which were wanting to him at Aylmer Park. During those five minutes Lady Aylmer would deal round the letters to the several plates of the inmates of her house,--not without looking at the post-office marks upon them; and on this occasion she had dealt a letter from Clara to her son.|$|E
