5|$|Another study {{analysed}} {{the tissues}} of Adamussium colbecki and compared them {{with those of}} Pecten jacobaeus, a temperate water species of <b>scallop.</b> It was found that copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic <b>scallop.</b> Cadmium levels in particular {{were higher in the}} Antarctic <b>scallop</b> than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.|$|E
5|$|Chlamys hastata, {{the spear}} <b>scallop,</b> spiny <b>scallop</b> or {{swimming}} <b>scallop,</b> is {{a species of}} bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North America from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego, California. A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the <b>scallop.</b> A study showed that its larvae preferentially settled {{in the vicinity of}} other epibionts, usually on <b>scallop</b> shells, and that the <b>scallop</b> larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the <b>scallop</b> benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged by the failure of its larvae to establish themselves in their preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scallops</b> are a {{significant}} commercially {{important part of the}} global seafood industry. Bermuda alone imports an estimated 50,000 pounds of <b>scallops</b> a year, almost all of which are frozen. Globally, almost one million tons of <b>scallops</b> are cultured every year. Until recently, zigzag <b>scallops</b> had not been cultured, mainly because their low densities usually cannot support commercial fisheries.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the true}} oysters (family Ostreidae), <b>scallops</b> {{have a single}} central {{adductor}} muscle, thus the inside of their shells has a characteristic central scar, marking the point of attachment for this muscle. The adductor muscle of <b>scallops</b> is larger and more developed than those of oysters, because <b>scallops</b> are active swimmers; some species of <b>scallops</b> are known to move en masse from one area to another. In <b>scallops,</b> the shell shape tends to be highly regular, and is commonly used as an archetypal form of a seashell.|$|R

5|$|The Antarctic <b>scallop</b> is {{monitored}} {{in connection with}} the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) classification set up by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). As such, notification is required to be made by vessels that land the <b>scallop</b> as by-catch during their fishing activities.|$|E
5|$|The spiny <b>scallop</b> anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the <b>scallop</b> with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the <b>scallop</b> ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the <b>scallop</b> starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large <b>scallop</b> can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E
5|$|The spiny <b>scallop</b> can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink <b>scallop</b> (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth. The glossy white interior of the spiny scallop's shell often has a purplish blotch near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E

5000|$|Partial, some of {{the high}} frets are <b>scalloped</b> for fast soloing. Popular {{examples}} include half <b>scalloping</b> (12th to the last fret, used by Kiko Loureiro of Angra, among others) or few top frets <b>scalloping</b> (19-24, 17-22, etc.), used by such guitarists as Steve Vai. When done by hand, sometimes fretboards can be <b>scalloped</b> half below D or G string, {{as in the case}} for Turkish luthier Kenan Turgut.|$|R
5|$|The spiny <b>scallop</b> {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the <b>scallop</b> and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet that it needs to force the two valves of the <b>scallop</b> apart.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic <b>scallop</b> {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the <b>scallop</b> and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a <b>scallop</b> they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The <b>scallop</b> is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E

5|$|Roman myth {{has it that}} Venus, {{the goddess}} of love, {{was born in the}} sea and emerged {{accompanied}} by fish and dolphins, with Botticelli depicting her as arriving in a <b>scallop</b> shell. The Romans revered her and erected shrines in her honour in their gardens, praying to her to provide water and verdant growth.

Its depiction is used in architecture, furniture and fabric design and it is the logo of Royal Dutch Shell, the global oil and gas company.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic <b>scallop</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as Pecten colbecki. He worked at the British Museum and was responsible for examining and describing shells from collections made {{over the years that}} had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that the characteristics of the Antarctic <b>scallop</b> were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear.|$|E

Its shape is a significant link with early Christianity. The <b>scallop</b> had long been associated with love, fertility and birth and was a symbol of the classical goddesses Aphrodite and her Roman counterpart Venus, who was said to have floated ashore on a <b>scallop</b> shell (as in Sandro Botticelli's famous depiction of The Birth of Venus). By the 4th century, however, Christians had adopted the <b>scallop</b> as a symbol of rebirth through baptism and life as a journey towards a heavenly reunion with God. It came to be particularly associated with pilgrimages and was later adopted as a pilgrim's badge.|$|E

5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the <b>scallop</b> prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty <b>scallop</b> shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|Within C.pepo, the pumpkins, the scallops, and {{possibly}} the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of C.pepo have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C.pepo, botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and <b>scallop</b> are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the <b>scallop</b> and the pumpkin.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny <b>scallop</b> include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The <b>scallop</b> can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E

50|$|<b>Scallops</b> use larval {{motility}} {{to distribute}} themselves, as the adult <b>scallops</b> have limited mobility. The {{distribution of the}} larvae is affected by factors such as local hydrographic regimes and their survival, and this results in the <b>scallops</b> having an aggregated distribution within their geographic range. This means that the major fishing grounds are normally widely separated and each fishing ground's environmental conditions mean there are marked differences in structures of the populations, although the genetics of <b>scallops</b> are rather uniform across its range.|$|R
