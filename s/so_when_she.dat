25|$|Briony's apologies are not accepted. Robbie, enraged at her presence, nearly hurts her, but Cecilia calms him down, and {{the couple}} instead demands that Briony confess her lie in writing and have the legal records rectified. Briony {{promises}} to do <b>so.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> tells them the real assailant was Paul {{and that he was}} just married to Lola, Cecilia is disappointed: Paul is now unlikely to be punished, being immune to Lola's testimony as his wife, and with Briony's having become an unreliable witness.|$|E
25|$|The mother collapses at the funeral, {{and spends}} {{the next month}} in the {{hospital}} crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes {{it upon himself to}} treat her personally with psychotherapy.

25|$|Cornwallis {{was built}} {{probably}} at Surat and around 1789. Her name was originally Britannia, {{but it was}} changed to Cornwallis shortly before her completion. She served for some years in India as a country ship, before transferring her registry to Britain in 1797. She then served in private trade between Britain and India until 1809 or <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> transferred her registry back to Bombay. Thereafter she served as a country ship, though in both 1810 and again in 1817 she performed a voyage to Britain for the British East India Company. Thereafter she apparently continued {{to serve as a}} country ship with homeport of Bombay. She burnt there in June 1841 as she was about to take a cargo of cotton to China.|$|E
25|$|However, {{her back}} was still painful, more <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> ran shorter distances, so {{she decided to go}} for the 800 metres at the 1969 European Athletics Championships in Athens that September. Still inexperienced at the longer event and ranked only 8th in Europe on her {{performances}} that season, she was not strongly fancied for 800 m gold. She won her heat comfortably (2:04.2) and then, two days later, produced a superb performance in the final on 18 September sprinting away from her rivals on the final bend and winning by eight metres in a personal best time of 2:01.4, a new championship record. She was the first British woman to win this European title, the second being Lynsey Sharp in 2012.|$|E
25|$|One of Mrs. Claus's {{most unusual}} {{television}} appearances is in The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy Christmas special Billy and Mandy Save Christmas. In this story {{her name is}} Nancy {{and she is a}} powerful vampiress who, angry that Santa leaves most of the work for her, turns him into a vampire so she can take a break (which is about the six or seventh time she's done <b>so),</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> gets the idea from Mandy to try and take over the world before Billy reconciles them. Another unusual appearance is in the Robot Chicken Christmas Special, during which, in a Dragon Ball Z parody sketch, she gains powers from the North Pole's radiation, and becomes a giant monster that Goku, Gohan, and Rudolph must destroy.|$|E

Jean reveals the key is for Brian's safety deposit box in a bank. Stacey opens the box but it is empty, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> confronts Jean, Jean reveals that Brian had another family with another woman, saying they planned to give Stacey the key when she turned 21 but after Brian's death, Sean stole it. Jean reveals that Kyle {{has been trying to}} contact her and Stacey through letters, making Stacey realise that Kyle is her half-brother. Kush tells Stacey that they must tell the truth to Shabnam and Martin about the paternity of Stacey's baby. Stacey gives birth at Lily's nativity play and Martin names the baby Arthur Fowler, after his father. When Kush holds the baby, his behaviour makes Shabnam realise that he could be the baby's father. Shabnam confronts Stacey but she denies Kush is the father.|$|E

He performs as a stripper at Bianca Jackson's (Patsy Palmer) hen party. After the party, Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) catches him in bed with Lucy. Lucy tries to break Leon and Zsa Zsa up when they are kissing in The Queen Victoria public house, managing to drag Leon back to her house until her father Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) interrupts them and asks Leon to leave. Lucy watches Leon and Zsa Zsa around the Square and reveals to her stepmother Jane (Laurie Brett) that she is pregnant. Leon humiliates Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) by filming her cleaning {{a bench in the}} Square and sending it to people, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> hears Ian talking about the pregnancy, she decides to tell Leon. He confronts Lucy in The Queen Victoria and asks if the baby is his. They meet the next day and he says he is willing to go with her to get an abortion, but she lies that the baby is not his. When Leon demands the truth, Lucy tells him she had an abortion.|$|E
500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really funny how little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> talks about how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy." ...|$|E

500|$|Atwell {{referred}} to Carter's relationship with Jarvis as the series' comic relief, while Fazekas called their relationship [...] "the center {{relationship of the}} show". Executive producer Tara Butters compared the relationship to that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the early seasons of The X-Files, where [...] "you really believed they cared about each other but it wasn’t sexual. That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts is a really interesting story for him, which is, how much did he really understand about what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... we will see in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E
500|$|Linda Laubenstein {{was born}} on May 21, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Priscilla and George Laubenstein. She grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island. [...] Her mother worked as a special-education {{preschool}} teacher, while her father worked as a purchasing agent for Providence Gas Company. As a child, she had severe asthma and contracted polio {{at the age of}} five. She was placed in an iron lung for three months to prevent respiratory failure and was left paraplegic; she would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of her}} life. Because she was unable to physically attend elementary school, an intercom was set up from her classroom to her home. Her high school did not have an elevator, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> needed to attend classes on the second floor, members of the school's football team would carry her wheelchair up and down the stairs. She chose to attend Barnard College because the campus was accessible for wheelchair users. Aspiring to become a doctor, she took mostly science classes. She went on to study at the New York University School of Medicine, receiving her M.D. in 1973 and completing her internship, residency and fellowship by 1978.|$|E

She longs to leave the mansion but {{does not want to}} burden Ai whom she knows does not have the willpower to deal with such responsibilities. Mai has a tomboyish personality and is very short-tempered, {{especially when it comes to}} Chris, the more <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> thinks she'll lose face.

2500|$|With no {{survivors}} and no {{witnesses to the}} actual sinking, what happened on Sophia to drive her off the reef {{is a matter of}} reconstruction from the available evidence and conjecture. [...] Based on the evidence it appears that the storm, blowing in from the north, raised water levels on the reef much higher than previously, causing the vessel to become buoyant again, but only partially so. [...] The bow of the vessel remained on the reef, and the force of the wind and waves then spun the vessel almost completely around and washed her off the reef. [...] Dragging across the rock ripped out the ship's bottom, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> reached deeper water near the navigation buoy, she sank. [...] This process, based on the evidence, seems to have taken about an hour.|$|E
2500|$|Grace is sent {{to prison}} {{awaiting}} trial for her involvement in the supposed murder of Mercedes. Wall explained that her character refused {{to tell the truth}} about Mercedes being alive. She fears Esther will back out of their surrogacy deal if she knows that she carried on her feud with Freddie against her wishes. Kim begins to miss Grace, Wood-Davis told Carena Crawford from All About Soap that Kim is [...] "one determined woman" [...] and makes it her mission to join Grace in prison. She believes Grace is the only one to make her feel complete. Kim knows it is unlikely she will get the chance to be with Grace. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> enters prison she schemes against Grace's cell mate Reenie McQueen (Zöe Lucker), resulting in Kim being moved into Grace's cell. Wood-Davis said that it marked the first time Grace became unnerved by Kim's behaviour.|$|E

Candace is depressed, but the boys find the day to be a successful one. Candace is helped inside by Isabella and Linda. At the end, the DJ from the beginning congratulates Phineas and Ferb and also says that tomorrow will be hot and sunny too, but then Ferb adds [...] "with a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes", to which Phineas (and probably a lot of viewers) laughs. Then there is a zoom-out and the gnomes that crashed into the Flynn-Fletcher household roof are seen.|$|E

Rawle said that Silas delights in the idea that Lynsey thinks she is good enough to play him. Silas puts a webcam in Lynsey's flat in order to watch her. He sneaks into the house and plays tricks on Lynsey by turning the gas on and writing a [...] "sinister" [...] message on her mirror with lipstick. Of this, Rawle explained: [...] "Silas alters Lynsey's reality — <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> insists that one thing is happening, it appears not to be the case the next minute." [...] Silas sneaks into Lynsey's flat at night and moves her things around which Rawle said is [...] "a subtle way of sending a person barmy". Lynsey's friends do not believe her accusations and question her state of mind, so she leaves the village. Lynsey's friend, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), sees Silas watching Lynsey as she is leaving and Hassan said that [...] " [...] starts to think there's something odd about him".|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E
2500|$|Women had a {{relatively}} high status in ancient Egypt and enjoyed {{the legal right to}} own, inherit, or will property. A woman becoming pharaoh was rare, however; only Sobekneferu, Khentkaus I and possibly Nitocris preceded her. The existence of this last ruler is disputed and is probably a mis-translation of a male king. Nefernferuaten and Twosret may have been the only women to succeed her among the indigenous rulers. In Egyptian history, there was no word for a [...] "queen regnant" [...] as in contemporary history, [...] "king" [...] being the Ancient Egyptian title regardless of gender, and by the time of her reign, pharaoh had become the name for the ruler. Hatshepsut is not unique, however, in taking the title of king. Sobekneferu, ruling six dynasties prior to Hatshepsut, also did <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> ruled Egypt. Hatshepsut had been well trained in her duties as the daughter of the pharaoh. During her father's reign she held the powerful office of God's Wife. She had taken a strong role as queen to her husband and was well experienced in the administration of her kingdom by the time she became pharaoh. There is no indication of challenges to her leadership and, until her death, her co-regent remained in a secondary role, quite amicably heading her powerful army—which would have given him the power necessary to overthrow a usurper of his rightful place, if that had been the case.|$|E
