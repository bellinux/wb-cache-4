More than 1,000 {{players have}} {{registered}} to play the <b>sport.</b> <b>Participation</b> in the game grew during the 1970s. Much of this is possible because of the national governing organisation, the Cook Islands Netball Association which is a member of Oceania Netball Federation. Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the World Games, the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if baseline motor competence, weight status and <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> in early childhood predict <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> two years later. Design longitudinal study. Methods: In 2010, motor competence (object control and locomotor skills), weight status and <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> were assessed in 292 children between three and five years-of-age. In 2012, <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> was re-evaluated in 206 of the original 292 children. Logistic regression was implemented to examine if initial <b>sports</b> <b>participation,</b> motor competence and weight status would predict <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> two years later. Results: In the final model, <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> in 2010 (OR = 9. 68, CI: 3. 46 to 27. 13) and locomotor skills (OR = 1. 21, CI: 1. 01 to 1. 46) significantly predicted <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> after two years.

40|$|Introduction: Sport is {{a social}} category. What people label as sport, varies {{historically}} and across cultures. That {{makes it difficult to}} compare outcomes of <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> research. In this article, we will draw out how and to what extent methodological differences have influenced outcomes of Dutch <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> surveys. In addition, we will go into attempts to enhance comparability between surveys by issuing a Guideline for <b>Sports</b> <b>participation</b> Research (GSR). Methods: secondary analyses were performed on different <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> surveys in the Netherlands. In addition, we report on two specific case studies to describe why outcomes of <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> research differ between surveys, even if they appear to use similar questions. Also we go into the experiences with the GSR. Results: the Netherlands are characterized by a high <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> rate. Incomparability of sport research appear to stem from three different aspects: (1) sampling and field work, (2) question formulation and (3) analysis procedures. It was found that <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> was positively correlated with response, meaning that social surveys generally overestimate <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> rates. Experiences with the GSR learn that in order to enhance our understanding of <b>sports</b> <b>participation,</b> it is simply not enough to issue guidelines on how to conduct the research. There is a clear need for more coordinated research...|$|R

2500|$|In {{areas in}} and around Cape Town, netball was a {{favourite}} sport for coloured schools to have {{because it was the}} cheapest one to play. During the 1930s and 1940s, some coloured girls would play rugby. By the time they reached puberty, they were encouraged to start playing a more feminine game such as netball. Rates of <b>sport</b> <b>participation</b> were higher amongst non-Muslim coloured children than amongst Muslim coloured children. In 1940, the Bantu Inter-schools League in Johannesburg had 145 netball teams that shared ten courts. At the time, only 6.6% of black South African students attended school, so their participation in this netball league was small. [...] Issues like hunger and inadequate housing coupled with lack of facilities and the distance to get to them discouraged young black South African girls from playing the sport. Secondary issues for black South African women regarding netball arose because of gender struggles in the black South African community; coloured men controlled most aspects of sport for coloured women, who were dependent on them for getting to use existing sport facilities or getting new facilities built. Despite these issues during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, some dedicated sportswomen worked hard for their sport by organising local leagues and inter-provisional competitions.|$|E

40|$|While total {{physical}} activity decreases {{over the life}} course, sports and leisure-time {{physical activity}} (LTPA) have shown to increase after transition to retirement. This paper aimed to investigate whether this change in <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> differs (1) between non-migrant persons (NMP) versus persons with a migrant background (PMB), and (2) by acculturation status. Data was drawn from 16 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) including 2664 NMP and 569 PMB. PMB were grouped according to acculturation status (integrated, assimilated, marginalised, separated), assessed regarding three dimensions (language, social interaction and identification). We applied multilevel logistic regression models, adjusting for sex, retirement age, socioeconomic status, health status and body mass index. Our results show that (1) transition to retirement led {{to an increase in}} the <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> of NMP during the first 5 years and the subsequent 5 years after retirement. Changes in <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> were modified by migration status: In PMB <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> increased to a lesser extent than in NMP. (2) While <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> of integrated PMB was not significantly different from NMP in the preretirement phase, <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> among integrated PMB increased less after retirement compared with NMP. Marginalized and assimilated PMB did not show consistent <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> patterns before retirement, but seemingly increased their <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> less than NMP over the retirement transition. Separated PMB had particularly low levels of <b>sports</b> <b>participation.</b> Considering that LTPA is a key factor for healthy ageing, the increasing gap in levels of <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> after transition to retirement indicates the need for interventions targeting physical activity of the older migrant population...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{assessed}} whether {{differences in}} children's <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> and television time according to parental education were mediated by parental modeling. Moreover, we explored {{the differences between}} parental and child reports on parental <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> and television time as potential mediators. Methods: 5729 children and 5183 parents participating in the EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth (ENERGY-project) during 2010 in seven European countries provided information on <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> and television time using validated self-report questionnaires. Multilevel country-specific mediation models analyzed the potential mediation effect of parental self-reports and child-reports on parental <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> and television time. Results: Significant mediation effect was found for parental self-reported television time in four countries (Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands and Slovenia), with the highest proportion for Slovenia (40 %) and the lowest for Greece (21 %). Child-reported parental television time showed mediation effect in Greece only. Parental self-reported <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> showed significant mediation effect only in Greece. With child-reported parental <b>sports</b> <b>participation,</b> significant mediation was observed in Greece and Norway. Conclusions: Parental behaviors appear {{to be important in}} explaining parental educational differences in children's <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> and television time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore the {{determining}} factors of household expenditures on <b>sports</b> <b>participation.</b> Due to a relatively large amount of zero-expenditures, simple regression methods are not suited. Because of methodological reasons, the two-step Heckman approach is used over the Tobit approach and the Double Hurdle approach. The participation decision (spend money or not) is influenced by <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> of the parents, family income, education, sports club membership, and sports frequency. Determining factors of the intensity decision (amount of money that is spent on <b>sports</b> <b>participation)</b> are family income, <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> of parents during their youth, sports club membership, sports frequency, age of youngest child, and household size. Moreover, the results indicate that a two-stage approach is needed because it gives a more in-depth insight in the household spending behavior. For example, higher educated households more often spend money on <b>sports</b> <b>participation.</b> However, this research demonstrates that once higher educated households have decided to spend money on <b>sports</b> <b>participation,</b> the amount of money spent does not differ from lower educated households...|$|R

Only data concerning personal and amputation characteristics together with the data concerning <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> were used for this study. Results: Of the 816 questionnaires received, 780 were suitable for statistical analysis. The mean age of the participants was 59. 6 years (SD 14. 8), 62 % were men and 27 % of the amputations was due to vascular diseases or diabetes. Only 15 % of all respondents participate in sports at least 5 hours a month. Smoking (odds ratio: 0. 55), an age older than 60 (odds ratio: 0. 97 per year), and a vascular cause of amputation (odds ratio: 0. 42) were negatively associated with <b>sports</b> <b>participation.</b> Conclusion: Less than 15 % of the Dutch lower limb amputees participate in sports at least 5 hours per month.

A total of 247 adolescents (48 % boys, mean age at follow-up 15 years) completed the surveys at baseline and follow-up. At baseline, adolescents completed a survey that assessed engagement in <b>sports</b> <b>participation,</b> attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and intention towards <b>sports</b> <b>participation.</b> Availability of <b>sports</b> facilities (availability) was assessed using a geographic information system.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to explore whether {{availability}} of sports facilities, parks, and neighbourhood social capital (NSC) and their interaction are associated with leisure time <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> among Dutch adolescents. Methods Cross-sectional analyses were conducted on complete data from the last wave of the YouRAction evaluation trial. Adolescents (n[*]=[*] 852) completed a questionnaire asking for <b>sports</b> <b>participation,</b> perceived NSC and demographics. Ecometric methods were used to aggregate perceived NSC to zip code level. Availability of sports facilities and parks was assessed by means of geographic information systems within the zip-code area and within a 1600 meter buffer. Multilevel logistic regression analyses, with neighborhood and individual as levels, were conducted to examine associations between physical and social environmental factors and leisure time <b>sports</b> <b>participation.</b> Simple slopes analysis was conducted to decompose interaction effects. Results NSC was significantly associated with <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> (OR: 3. 51 (95 %CI: 1. 18; 10. 41)) after adjustment for potential confounders. Availability of sports facilities and availability of parks were not associated with <b>sports</b> <b>participation.</b> A significant interaction between NSC and density of parks within the neighbourhood area (OR: 1. 22 (90 %CI: 1. 01; 1. 34)) was found. Decomposition of the interaction term showed that adolescents were most likely to engage in leisure time sports when both availability of parks and NSC were highest. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that leisure time <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> is associated with levels of NSC, but not with availability of parks or sports facilities. In addition, NSC and availability of parks in the zip code area interacted in such a way that leisure time <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> is most likely among adolescents living in zip code areas with higher levels of NSC, and higher availability of parks. Hence, availability of parks appears only to be important for leisure time <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> when NSC is high. </p...|$|R

We used multilevel logistic regression to analyze the interactions between perceived neighborhood safety and individual cognitions (attitude, self-efficacy, social influence, and intention) on <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> (yes/no). Results: In its association with <b>sports</b> <b>participation,</b> perceived neighborhood safety interacted significantly with self-efficacy and attitude (p < 0. 05). Among persons who perceived their neighborhood as safe, a positive attitude was strongly associated with <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> (OR = 2. 00, 95 %CI = 1. 48 - 2. 71). In contrast, attitude was not associated with <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> in persons who perceived their neighborhood as unsafe (OR = 0. 65, 95 %CI = 0. 34 - 1. 24). Further, self-efficacy was significantly stronger associated with <b>sports</b> <b>participation</b> in persons who perceived their neighborhood as unsafe (OR = 1. 85, 95 %CI = 1. 31 - 2. 60) than in those who perceived their neighborhood as safe (OR = 1. 19, 95 %CI = 1. 05 - 1. 36). Social influence and intention did not interact with perceived neighborhood safety.
