For Saving Private Ryan, he teamed up with Steven Spielberg {{to make a film}} about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring back a soldier.

It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the antecedents of job satisfaction, commitment and turnover intentions for 229 information systems development personnel (ISDP) employed by nine companies within several industries. The antecedents studied include boundary spanning, role ambiguity and role conflict. A model {{of these variables}} is built and tested via path analysis. A secondary analysis is performed to explore the impacts of task differences on the study variables. The task differences include analytic and programming tasks. The analyses revealed the following. <b>Systems</b> <b>analysts</b> span more boundaries than programmers. The major hazard faced by <b>systems</b> <b>analysts</b> when they span boundaries is role conflict which negatively impacts their job satisfaction, commitment and intention to quit. The overall effect of boundary spanning is to reduce ISDP intention to quit despite its positive relationship with role conflict. <b>Systems</b> <b>analysts</b> and programmers are both intolerant of role ambiguity. Role ambiguity is very detrimental greatly reducing ISDP job satisfaction, commitment and increasing ISDP intention to quit. Role ambiguity {{is not related to}} boundary spanning nor is it related to analytic or programming duties. Programmers are less committed than <b>systems</b> <b>analysts</b> {{and are more likely to}} express intentions to leave. The above information is used to make recommendations to IS management.
