40|$|OBJECTIVES: Little {{is known}} so far {{about the health}} of newly {{immigrant}} adolescents. The present study aimed to evaluate their health and quality of life (QoL) and to reinforce prevention and health promotion in <b>school</b> <b>medicine.</b> METHODS: One hundred and fifty-eight adolescents (mean age: 15, 4 years) from 37 nationalities were included in the study in two health centers in Brussels. This study was carried out by medical records analysis and administration of a questionnaire about health and QoL (VSP-A) in several languages. RESULTS: The results showed adolescents in good physical health. Nevertheless their quality of life deteriorated over time in Belgium. The QoL was significantly lower for adolescents without social support: 48, 0 (SD= 13, 5) vs 60, 6 (SD= 11, 1) compared with adolescents with social support - i. e. with one resource person - on a scale from 0 to 100. Adolescents had many subjective health problems, like "the future" cited by half of them. CONCLUSION: This study shows the importance of developping a specific approach to newly immigrant adolescents health and the contribution of <b>school</b> <b>medicine</b> in the identification of biological, psychological and social needs and hightlights the preventive answers carried out by <b>school</b> <b>medicine.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Croatia {{never had}} a {{separate}} vocation (occupation) of a health educator. Health education {{is one of the}} main tasks in the long tradition of preventive work of doctors-school medicine specialists. Additionally, in the school curriculum in the Republic of Croatia the health-educational contents are integrated into various subjects, and are conducted by teachers. However, there are requests to introduce a new subject into schools called Health Education. We asked physicians of <b>school</b> <b>medicine</b> their opinion on the introduction of this new subject. 30 % of the physicians were dissatisfied with the current condition, 10 % were satisfied, while there were no very satisfied <b>school</b> <b>medicine</b> doctors. They believe that health education goals are oriented solely to passing on knowledge (facts), while efforts are not done to change habits and attitudes of young people. They recognize themselves as persons mostly involved in health education in schools. Half of the <b>school</b> <b>medicine</b> doctors believe that the school curriculum should contain both a separate subject as well as integration of health education into other subjects. Before introducing any changes into healthcare or education system, it is necessary to examine the attitudes of students and parents, to direct the changes towards the promotion of the cooperation between the healthcare system, education, civil society, school and community where investing into the health of young people is done through comprehensive and holistic programmes...|$|E
