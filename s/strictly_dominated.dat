50|$|In this {{solution}} concept, players {{are assumed to}} be rational and so <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> strategies are eliminated from the set of strategies that might feasibly be played. A strategy is <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> when there is some other strategy available to the player that always has a higher payoff, regardless of the strategies that the other players choose. (<b>Strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> strategies are also important in minimax game-tree search.) For example, in the (single period) prisoners' dilemma (shown below), cooperate is <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> by defect for both players because either player is always better off playing defect, regardless of what his opponent does.|$|E
50|$|In a Bayesian game a {{strategy}} determines what a player plays at every information set controlled by that player. The requirement that beliefs {{are consistent with}} strategies is something not specified by subgame perfection. Hence, PBE is a consistency condition on players’ beliefs. Just as in a Nash equilibrium no player’s strategy is <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated,</b> in a PBE, for any information set no player’s strategy is <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> beginning at that information set. That is, for every belief that the player could hold at that information set there is no strategy that yields a greater expected payoff for that player. Unlike the above solution concepts, no player’s strategy is <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> beginning at any information set {{even if it is}} off the equilibrium path. Thus in PBE, players cannot threaten to play strategies that are <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> beginning at any information set off the equilibrium path.|$|E

50|$|First, we {{need the}} concept of a dominator: we say that a node A <b>strictly</b> <b>dominates</b> a {{different}} node B in the control flow graph if it is impossible to reach B without passing through A first. This is useful, because if we ever reach B we know that any code in A has run. We say that A dominates B (B is dominated by A) if either A <b>strictly</b> <b>dominates</b> B or A = B.|$|R

40|$|Locking is {{considered}} {{as a means to}} achieve serializable schedules of concurrent transactions. Transactions are assumed to be predeclared such that a pre-analysis for locking becomes feasible to increase concurrency. A condition for safety is introduced which, based on a pre-analysis, allows the design of policies <b>strictly</b> <b>dominating</b> known policies such as 2 -phase locking. The static case, in which the complete set of transactions is known in advance, and the online case, in which a transaction is known when it is started, are considered. It is shown that a policy <b>strictly</b> <b>dominating</b> 2 -phase locking and some other interesting pre-analysis policies can also be applied in an online environment...|$|R
50|$|In {{games with}} more than two players, however, there may be {{strategies}} that are not <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated,</b> but which can never be the best response. By the iterated elimination of all such strategies one can find the rationalizable strategies for a multiplayer game.|$|E

5000|$|Conversely, for two-player games, {{the set of}} all rationalizable {{strategies}} can be found by iterated elimination of <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> strategies. For this method to hold however, one also needs to consider strict domination by mixed strategies. Consider the game on the right with payoffs of the column player omitted for simplicity. Notice that [...] "b" [...] is not <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> by either [...] "t" [...] or [...] "m" [...] in the pure strategy sense, {{but it is still}} dominated by a strategy that would mix [...] "t" [...] and [...] "m" [...] with probability of each equal to 1/2. This {{is due to the fact}} that given any belief about the action of the column player, the mixed strategy will always yield higher expected payoff. This implies that [...] "b" [...] is not rationalizable.|$|E

50|$|In game theory, {{normal form}} is a {{description}} of a game. Unlike extensive form, normal-form representations are not graphical per se, but rather represent the game by way of a matrix. While this approach can be of greater use in identifying <b>strictly</b> <b>dominated</b> strategies and Nash equilibria, some information is lost as compared to extensive-form representations. The normal-form representation of a game includes all perceptible and conceivable strategies, and their corresponding payoffs, for each player.|$|E

40|$|Non binary {{constraints}} {{have recently}} been studied quite ex-tensively since they represent real life problems very natu-rally. Specifically, extensions to binary arc consistency into generalised arc consistency (GAC), and forward checking that incorporates {{a limited amount of}} GAC have been pro-posed, to handle non-binary constraints directly. Enforc-ing arc consistency on the dual encoding has been shown to <b>strictly</b> <b>dominate</b> nforcing GAC on the primal encoding. More recently, modifications to dual arc consistency have ex-tended these results to dual encodings that are based on the construction of compact onstraint coverings, that retain the completeness of the encodings, while using a fraction of the space. In this paper we present results that combine the en-forcement of arc consistency in these covering based dual en-codings, with performing forward checking based search in the primal encoding. We demonstrate how this new scheme can be shown to <b>strictly</b> <b>dominate</b> standard non-binary for-ward checking, while being able to efficiently enforce ex-tremely high levels of consistency...|$|R
