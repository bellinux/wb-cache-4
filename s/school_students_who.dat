25|$|In 1999, Hughes {{said that}} his request to direct the film met with {{resistance}} and skepticism because he lacked filmmaking experience. Hughes ultimately convinced the film's investors that due to the modest $1 million budget and its single location shoot, he could greatly minimize their risk. Hughes originally thought that The Breakfast Club would be his directorial debut.

25|$|The {{impact of}} the rise in abstinence-only {{education}} remains a question. To date, no published studies of abstinence-only programs have found consistent and significant program effects on delaying the onset of intercourse. In 2007, a study ordered by the U.S. Congress found that middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> took part in abstinence-only sex education programs were {{just as likely to}} have sex (and use contraception) in their teenage years as those who did not. Abstinence-only advocates claimed that the study was flawed because it was too narrow and began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and that other studies have demonstrated positive effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{first year}} of {{secondary}} education is Year 9.

Year 13 is seen as the traditional end of secondary school, with an extra funding year available for students who choose to remain after Year 13.|$|E

25|$|The {{dramatic}} increase of emigration (Republikflucht, brain drain) {{in the first}} half of 1953, already high since the establishment of the GDR, constituted a serious economic and social problem. Another factor that contributed to an already complicated political situation was the high number of political prisoners in the GDR. Suppression of the illegal organisation Junge Gemeinde (Young Congregation), wrongly perceived as the central youth organisation of the Evangelical Church, played a role here. Numerous trainee pastors were imprisoned (e.g. Johannes Hamel and Fritz Hoffmann). Ecclesiastic recreation centres were closed and taken over by the FDJ (e.g.: Schloss Mansfeld and Huberhaus Wernigerode). High <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> belonged to a church were often expelled by the school authorities, sometimes even shortly before school graduation.|$|E

The main playable character is Satoshi Mochida, a kindhearted high school student who is teased by his classmates for his cowardly nature. Three of the other characters are students from Satoshi's class: Naomi Nakashima, Satoshi's childhood friend; Yoshiki Kishinuma, an intimidating yet good-natured student; and Ayumi Shinozaki, the class representative. Rounding out the group is Yuka Mochida, Satoshi's younger sister. The game's antagonist is the red ghost of a teenage girl who seeks vengeance for her wrongful death.|$|E
