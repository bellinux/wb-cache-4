Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentence' should be "balanced" with <b>the</b> criminal responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method <b>of</b> judgment ignores <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentence' in order to clarify <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2.

Quebec, while a member, did not operate in the NHL for the first two years. Instead the owners of the Toronto Arena Gardens operated a new Toronto franchise. While the NHL was intended as a temporary measure, the continuing dispute with Livingstone led to the four NHA owners meeting and making the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHA permanent one year later.|$|E
5|$|The state underage {{drinking}} {{statute is}} a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), which upon conviction is punishable {{by up to}} 6 months in jail (rarely imposed), a $500–$1000 fine, and a mandatory 6-month <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person's driver's license. The penalties are the same for using fake identification. Those who unlawfully serve alcohol to an underage person, entice an underage person to drink, knowingly permit underage drinking on their property, or bring alcohol onto a public school property face similar sanctions, except that their driver's license will not be suspended. A licensed business which serves alcohol to a person under age 21, even unintentionally, may be fined or have their liquor license suspended or revoked.|$|E
5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

A paper mill constructed in 1988 had been dumping toxic wastewater into the Meng river, destroying crops and harming wildlife. The chemicals also reportedly caused skin and digestive problems among villagers living downstream from the mill. Chen organized villagers in his hometown and 78 other villages to petition against the mill. The effort was successful, and resulted in the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper mill. In addition, Chen contacted the British embassy in Beijing, informing them of the situation and requesting funding for a well to supply clean water to locals. The British government responded by providing £15,000 towards a deep water well, irrigation systems and water pipelines.|$|E
5|$|In British Guiana, {{the leftist}} People's Progressive Party (PPP) {{candidate}} Cheddi Jagan won {{the position of}} chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953, but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> still-dependent nation's constitution. Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues. Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961; despite Britain's shift to a reconsideration of its view of the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time, the United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana's independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office.|$|E

He made nineteen appearances during the season, scoring three goals – against Swansea City, Nottingham Forest and Yeovil Town.

He also received the first red card of his professional career in October 2006, in a defeat at Bristol City. He was dismissed for violent conduct after a challenge on Louis Carey, though the referee's decision was reported as 'harsh' and 'strange' by the Bristol City website.
