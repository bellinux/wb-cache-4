50|$|French and Vierck {{provide a}} one-paragraph {{description}} of <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> that aptly summarizes the concept.|$|E
50|$|One might ask, if parts must be {{selected}} for mating, then what makes <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> {{any different from}} the oldest craft methods? But there {{is in fact a}} significant difference. <b>Selective</b> <b>assembly</b> merely grades the parts into several ranges; within each range, there is still random interchangeability. This {{is quite different from the}} older method of fitting by a craftsman, where each mated set of parts is specifically filed to fit each part with a specific, unique counterpart.|$|E
5000|$|The {{other main}} area of {{application}} for <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> is in contexts where total interchangeability is in fact achieved, but the [...] "fit and finish" [...] of the final products can be enhanced by minimizing the dimensional mismatch between mating parts. Consider another application {{similar to the one}} above with the 12 mm pin. But say that in this example, not only is the precision important (to produce the desired fit), but the accuracy is also important (because the 12 mm pin must interact with something else {{that will have to be}} accurately sized at 12 mm). Some of the implications of this example are that the rejection rate cannot be lowered; all parts must fall within tolerance range or be scrapped. So there are no savings to be had from salvaging oversize or undersize parts from scrap, then. However, there is still one bit of value to be had from selective assembly: having all the mated pairs have as close to identical sliding fit as possible (as opposed to some tighter fits and some looser fits—all sliding, but with varying resistance).|$|E
50|$|The SCARA acronym {{stands for}} <b>Selective</b> Compliance <b>Assembly</b> Robot Arm or Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm.|$|R
50|$|The SCARA, <b>Selective</b> Compliance <b>Assembly</b> Robot Arm, {{was created}} in 1978 as an efficient, 4-axis robotic arm. Best used for picking up parts and placing them in another location, the SCARA was {{introduced}} to assembly lines in 1981.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{a theory}} {{to support the}} design of assemblies. It describes a top-down process for designing kinematically constrained assemblies that deliver geometric key characteristics (KCs) that achieve top-level customer requirements. The theory applies to assemblies that {{take the form of}} mechanisms (e. g., engines) or structures (e. g., aircraft fuselages). The process begins by creating a kinematic constraint structure and a systematic scheme by which parts are located in space relative to each other, followed by declaration of assembly features that join parts {{in such a way as}} to create the desired constraint relationships. This process creates a connective data model containing information to support relevant analyses such as variation buildup, constraint analysis, and establishment of constraint-consistent assembly sequences. Adjustable assemblies, assemblies built using fixtures, and <b>selective</b> <b>assemblies</b> can also b...|$|R
5000|$|There {{is another}} mode of assembly, called [...] "selective assembly", which gives {{up some of}} the {{randomness}} capability in trade-off for other value. There are two main areas of application that benefit economically from selective assembly: when tolerance ranges are so tight that they cannot quite be held reliably (making the total randomness unavailable); and when tolerance ranges can be reliably held, but the fit and finish of the final assembly is being maximized by voluntarily giving {{up some of the}} randomness (which makes it available but not ideally desirable). In either case the principle of <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> is the same: parts are selected for mating, rather than being mated at random. As the parts are inspected, they are graded out into separate bins based on what end of the range they fall in (or violate). Falling within the high or low end of a range is usually called being heavy or light; violating the high or low end of a range is usually called being oversize or undersize. Examples are given below.|$|E
5000|$|A toolroom lathe is a lathe {{optimized}} for toolroom work. It is essentially just a top-of-the-line center lathe, {{with all of}} the best optional features that may be omitted from less expensive models, such as a collet closer, taper attachment, and others. The bed of a toolroom lathe is generally wider than that of a standard centre lathe. There has also been an implication over the years of <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> and extra fitting, with every care taken in the building of a toolroom model to make it the smoothest-running, most-accurate version of the machine that can be built. However, within one brand, the quality difference between a regular model and its corresponding toolroom model depends on the builder and in some cases has been partly marketing psychology. For name-brand machine tool builders who made only high-quality tools, there wasn't necessarily any lack of quality in the base-model product for the [...] "luxury model" [...] to improve upon. In other cases, especially when comparing different brands, the quality differential between (1) an entry-level center lathe built to compete on price, and (2) a toolroom lathe meant to compete only on quality and not on price, can be objectively demonstrated by measuring TIR, vibration, etc. In any case, because of their fully ticked-off option list and (real or implied) higher quality, toolroom lathes are more expensive than entry-level center lathes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contexts}} {{where the}} application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance ranges, the requirement may push slightly past {{the limit of}} {{the ability of the}} machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within the range. In such cases, <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> is used to compensate for a lack of total interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a sliding fit in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as 12.00 +0 −0.01 mm for the pin, and 12.00 +.01 −0 for the hole. Pins that came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily scrap, but they can only be mated with counterparts that also came out oversize (say a hole at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching undersize parts with undersize counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's application, the 12 mm dimension does not require extreme accuracy, but the desired fit between the parts does require good precision (see the article on accuracy and precision). This allows the makers to [...] "cheat a little" [...] on total interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort by reducing the rejection rate (scrap rate). This is a sound engineering decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for machines {{for which there is no}} intention for any future field service of a parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit), this makes good economic sense. It lowers the unit cost of the products, and it does not impede future service work.|$|E

40|$|Tolerancing {{has long}} been {{identified}} as a crucial part in the development of optical systems. It aims at finding the best balance between quality and cost as tolerances closely tie together manufacturing expenses and performance. Tolerance effects have been included into the optimization function (merit function) by some lens designers to find insensitive designs 1 - 5 and frequently compensators are employed to further improve the performance of assembled lenses. Compensators are limited to a small number of system parameters, but <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> of components can extend the number of parameters available for compensation. It can be employed to reduce tolerance effects of disturbed parameters by finding the best matches out of a set of components. In this work we discuss how desensitization and <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> can be combined to loosen tolerances and increase as-built performance.

40|$|A {{technique}} for shape-selective directed assembly of anisotropic, deformable, chemically-identical microcomponents onto patterned rigid templates based on {{shape and size}} differences is modeled and demonstrated. The assembly method not only controls the selective placement of the components, but also aligns the components with the assembly sites. Unlike the assembly of isotropic (spherical) microcomponents, in which only size differences {{can be used to}} discriminate among chemically-identical components to achieve selective placement, differences in both shape and size can enable selectivity in the assembly of anisotropic (non-spherical) microcomponents. The present <b>selective</b> directed <b>assembly</b> is driven by shape-matching to a microfabricated template to provide selectivity, uniform chemical surface functionalization to promote assembly, and megasonic excitation to prevent assembly into poorly shape-matched binding sites. A theoretical framework quantifies the predicted selectivity of this approach and predicts that it will be effective for many material combinations, including hydrogels and bio-compatible polymers. Experiments demonstrate successful directed assembly of cylindrical, hydrogel colloidal microcomponents with 26 μm mean diameter and 50 μm length into silicon templates patterned with hemicylindrical assembly sites. During the assembly, tapered microcomponents with 150 μm length and a nominal diameter of 26 μm that decreases along the components’ lengths were successfully excluded from hemicylindrical assembly sites. These results provide the first demonstration of <b>selective</b> directed <b>assembly</b> of non-spherical microcomponents by this approach.

40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>assembly</b> {{systems are}} found in several {{manufacturing}} contexts, above all automotive and mechanical components manufacturing, where the tolerances imposed on the assembled product is much tighter than the tolerance imposed on the sub-components. <b>Selective</b> <b>assembly</b> consists in measuring the key quality characteristics of each sub-component after the machining/forming process and sorting the components into quality classes according to the measurement outcome. In order to improve the product quality, the assembly station is allowed to assemble only components from matching quality classes.

40|$|AbstractAMPA receptors {{are thought}} to be a tetrameric {{assembly}} of the subunits GluR 1 - 4. We have examined whether two coexpressed subunits (GluR 1 / 2) combine at random to form channels, or preferentially assemble with a specific stoichiometry and spatial configuration. The subunits carried markers controlling ion permeation and desensitization, and these properties were monitored as a function of relative expression level and subunit composition. Homomeric receptors assembled stochastically while heteromeric receptors preferentially formed with a stoichiometry of two GluR 1 and two GluR 2 subunits, and with identical subunits positioned {{on opposite sides of the}} channel pore.

One of the error models is the position error model, which uses robot position errors with respect to an accurate robot base frame built before the measurement commenced. The other model is the distance error model, which uses only the robot moving distance to calculate errors. Because calibration requires the end-effector to be accurately measured, a laser tracker was used to measure the robot position and distance errors.

LV and canister are made of nos of sections and their respective positions are fixed in a assembly. Due to tolerance stack up in the assembly shape of the canister and LV varies from a perfect cylinder. Optimum size of the interface is found out for the assemblies where it satisfies the functionality without any interference or extra clearance for canister-LV assembly. Various sets of sections are available for LV and canister in production line and they are assembled selectively based on their effect on final assembly deviation. Assembly deviations are accepted such that the range of deviation for LV or for canister is minimum. One particular size of the interface suits to all the canister-LV combination without affecting the mission requirement.

Even under uniform forcing, polarization of the colloid induces the formation of strong, three-dimensional gradients at its surface - essentially repurposing it into a portable floating electrode whose precise location can be manipulated to reconfigure the electric field in real time.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents novel methodologies {{for five}} problem areas in modern quality improvement and computer experiments, i. e., <b>selective</b> <b>assembly,</b> robust design with computer experiments, multivariate quality control, model selection for split plot experiments, {{and construction of}} minimax designs. <b>Selective</b> <b>assembly</b> has traditionally been used to achieve tight specifications on the clearance of two mating parts. Chapter 1 proposes generalizations of the <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> method to assemblies with any number of components and any assembly response function, called generalized <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> (GSA). Two variants of GSA are considered: direct <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> (DSA) and fixed bin <b>selective</b> <b>assembly</b> (FBSA). In DSA and FBSA, the problem of matching a batch of N components of each type to give N assemblies that minimize quality cost is formulated as axial multi-index assignment and transportation problems respectively. Realistic examples are given to show that GSA can significantly {{improve the quality of}} assemblies. Chapter 2 proposes methods for robust design optimization with time consuming computer simulations. Gaussian process models are widely employed for modeling responses as a function of control and noise factors in computer experiments. In these experiments, robust design optimization is often based on average quadratic loss computed as if the posterior mean were the true response function, which can give misleading results. We propose optimization criteria derived by taking expectation of the average quadratic loss with respect to the posterior predictive process, and methods based on the Lugannani-Rice saddlepoint approximation for constructing accurate credible intervals for the average loss. These quantities allow response surface uncertainty {{to be taken into account}} in the optimization process. Chapter 3 proposes a Bayesian method for identifying mean shifts in multivariate normally distributed quality characteristics. Multivariate quality characteristics are often monitored using a few summary statistics. However, to determine the causes of an out-of-control signal, information about which means shifted and the directions of the shifts is often needed. We propose a Bayesian approach that gives this information. For each mean, an indicator variable that indicates whether the mean shifted upwards, shifted downwards, or remained unchanged is introduced. Default prior distributions are proposed. Mean shift identification is based on the modes of the posterior distributions of the indicators, which are determined via Gibbs sampling. Chapter 4 proposes a Bayesian method for model selection in fractionated split plot experiments. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical model that takes into account the split plot error structure. Expressions for computing the posterior model probability and other important posterior quantities that require evaluation of at most two uni-dimensional integrals are derived. A novel algorithm called combined global and local search is proposed to find models with high posterior probabilities and to estimate posterior model probabilities. The proposed method is illustrated with the analysis of three real robust design experiments. Simulation studies demonstrate that the method has good performance. The problem of choosing a design that is representative of a finite candidate set is an important problem in computer experiments. The minimax criterion measures the degree of representativeness because it is the maximum distance of a candidate point to the design. Chapter 5 proposes algorithms for finding minimax designs for finite design regions. We establish the relationship between minimax designs and the classical set covering location problem in operations research, which is a binary linear program. We prove that the set of minimax distances is the set of discontinuities of the function that maps the covering radius to the optimal objective function value, and optimal solutions at the discontinuities are minimax designs. These results are employed to design efficient procedures for finding globally optimal minimax and near-minimax designs. Ph. D...|$|E
