Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E

5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green facial mask {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hissing tone.|$|E

25|$|Dwight often <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> halting, intense manner, even {{in casual}} conversations. At the office, his most {{recurring}} formal wear is a mustard-colored, short-sleeved collar shirt, {{with a dark}} necktie and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses one-upmanship to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to appease Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk {{in a manner that}} made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.|$|E

25|$|The {{report on}} Duke Wiser, {{mentioned}} above, {{on the other}} hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, {{had been a member of}} Hubertia since 1877. Krutina {{on the other hand}}, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia. If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then we should be able to deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.|$|E
25|$|During the 1660s, Shrew {{was adapted}} by John Lacy as Sauny the Scot, {{to make it}} better match with Fletcher's sequel. Originally {{performed}} under the Taming of the Shrew title, the play was published in 1698 as Sauny the Scot: or, The Taming of the Shrew: A Comedy. This version inconsistently anglicised the character names and recast the play in prose. Lacy also expanded the part of Grumio into the title role Sauny (who <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavy Scottish brogue), which he played himself. Sauny is an irreverent, cynical companion to Petruchio, and is comically terrified of his master's new bride. Lucentio was renamed Winlove, Baptista became Lord Beaufoy and Katherina was renamed Meg. In Sauny, Petruchio is much more vicious, threatening to whip Meg if she doesn't marry him, then telling everyone she is dead, and tying her to a bier. The play ends with her thoroughly tamed. Lacy's work premiered at Drury Lane in 1667, starring Susanna Verbruggen and George Powell. Samuel Pepys saw it on 9 April and again on 1 November, enjoying it on both occasions. The play was popular enough that it was still being performed as late as 1732, when it was staged at Goodman's Fields Theatre, and it seems to have supplanted Shrews place on the English stage {{for the rest of the}} seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth.|$|E

500|$|The American {{journalist}} George Thayer, who {{met with}} Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being [...] "blonde and balding", with [...] "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall [...] "had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." [...] In {{his study of the}} National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off [...] "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as [...] "a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic, and he <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loud voice with a clipped inflection." [...] Walker described him as having a [...] "keen political mind", with a [...] "concern for organisation [...] meticulous planning".|$|E
500|$|Wondering {{why he has}} {{not seen}} any of his GE colleagues, Jack's office {{assistant}} Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) suggests that maybe they are the last people on Earth, as he references the 2007 film I Am Legend, [...] "You're Will Smith and I'm the dog!" [...] In I Am Legend, Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order {{to figure out what}} is going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of [...] (1996). After Kenneth convinces her to call her [...] "future husband", Liz, who <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Jamaican accent as Dr. Kaplan's dental assistants are Jamaican women, tells the man he needs to come into Dr. Kaplan's office for some work, and Liz ends the call with [...] "Cool Runnings, man! Bobsled!" [...] This is a reference to the comedy movie Cool Runnings (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team made their debut in the 1988 Winter Olympics. In another scene, Liz's ringtone is the song [...] "Fuck the Pain Away" [...] by Canadian electronic musician Peaches.|$|E

Parthiban, was ranked at number 8 in the magazine's {{list of the}} 13 Cheesiest, Chalkiest Lines in Indian Cinema. In April 2012, Rediff.com included the film in its list The A to Z of Tamil Cinema. In a January 2015 interview with The Times of India, playwright Y. G. Mahendra said, [...] "most character artists today lack variety [...] Show me one actor in India currently who can do a Kattabomman, a VOC, a Vietnam Veedu, a Galatta Kalyanam and a Thiruvilayadal." [...] Actor Rana Daggubati, {{in an interview with}} Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu, said that Ganesan's performances as Kattabomman and Karna (in the 1964 film Karnan) served as inspirations for his role in [...] (2015). The scene between Ganesan and Parthiban was later featured in the 2016 film Jackson Durai, which was titled after Parthiban's character. M. Sasikumar's Balle Vellaiyathevaa, released in the same year, was named after a dialogue uttered by Ganesan's character.|$|E

500|$|Leno {{considered}} the dame roles {{in two of}} his last pantomimes, Bluebeard (1901) and Mother Goose (1902), written by J. Hickory Wood, to be his favourites. He was paid £200 (£ in [...] adjusted for inflation) {{for each of the}} pantomime seasons. Leno appeared at Drury Lane as Sister Anne in Bluebeard, a character described by Wood as [...] "a sprightly, somewhat below middle aged person who was of a coming on disposition and who had not yet abandoned hope" [...] The Times drama critic noted: [...] "It is a quite peculiar and original Sister Anne, who dances breakdowns and sings strange ballads to a still stranger harp and plays ping-pong with a frying-pan and potatoes and burlesques Sherlock Holmes and wears the oddest of garments and dresses her hair like Miss Morleena Kenwigs, and <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> piping voice– in short it is none other than Dan Leno whom we all know". [...] Mother Goose provided Leno {{with one of the most}} challenging roles of his career, in which he was required to portray the same woman in several different guises. [...] Wood's idea, that neither fortune nor beauty would bring happiness, was illustrated by a series of magical character transformations. [...] The poor, unkempt and generally ugly Mother Goose eventually became a rich and beautiful but tasteless parvenu, searching for a suitor. The production was one of Drury Lane's most successful pantomimes, running until 28 March 1903.|$|E
500|$|Ben, {{although}} extremely well-mannered, has an impeccable {{ability to}} lie and manipulate {{the people around}} him, even when he is at a physical disadvantage. He often <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low, emotionless monotone when at his most unreadable, frequently sprinkling his speech with sarcasm or dry, humorless jokes. He can also be petty and vindictive, {{even to the point}} of murder, when he does not get what he wants. He claims to have been born on the Island, leading to him being thought of as a miracle by the Others, as pregnant women die on the island; but later confesses to Locke that he was lying. He unsuccessfully tries to convince the survivors he is Henry Gale, although succeeds in manipulating Locke to turn against Jack while held prisoner under this guise. While he claims he will not sacrifice innocent lives in order to accomplish his goals, he has been shown to do quite the opposite. In the third-season finale, Ben is informed by Tom Friendly (M. C. Gainey), an Other, that they have captured three of the crash survivors: Sayid Jarrah, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). When Tom tells Ben they are unwilling to reveal any information about the rest of the survivors, Ben quickly replies [...] "Shoot Kwon... You want them to answer questions, kill Kwon - do it now". Conversely, Ben refuses to allow his spy on the freighter to destroy it long before it reaches the Island, as he would not kill anyone who [...] "did not deserve to die". Furthermore, when Locke confronts Ben about causing the freighter to explode, Ben coldly replies, [...] "So?" ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} one of very few {{that focuses on the}} {{religious}} aspects of the Futurama universe. In most episodes, it is indicated that the Planet Express crew, along with most beings in the year 3000, are [...] "remarkably unreligious". [...] It introduces two of the religious figures of Futurama, The Robot Devil and Reverend Lionel Preacherbot, both of whom make appearances in later episodes. Preacherbot, who <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner typical of inner-city African-American pastor stereotypes, converts Bender to the religion Robotology. This leads to a series of events that are similar in many ways to the experiences of real world religious converts. Mark Pinsky states that the episode has a [...] "double-edged portrayal of religion" [...] as it portrays both an improvement in Bender's character but also some of the [...] "less pleasant characteristics of the newly pious". The Robot Devil is introduced after Bender's fall back into sin. Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons, that while explaining to Bender his claim on his soul, the Robot Devil uses logic similar to that used by many Southern Baptists: [...] "Bender tried to plead his case, without success. 'You agreed to this when you joined our religion,' the devil replies, in logic any Southern Baptist would recognize. 'You sin, you go to robot hell— for all eternity." [...] By the end of the episode, Bender has returned to his old ways and states that he will no longer try to be either too good or too bad, a parody and contradiction of the Book of Revelation statement that one should not be lukewarm in his faith.|$|E
