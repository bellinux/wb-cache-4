40|$|The term “eco {{friendly}} ” leather {{meant the}} “chrome free ” leather. Around 80 % of leather is tanned using chromium. The chromium {{used in the}} tannery {{may be in the}} form of chromium III, IV and chromium VI compounds. The chromium tanned leathers use chromium III salts (Trivalent chromium) in the form of chromium sulfate. This form of chromium is found naturally in the environment and is necessary nutrient for the human body. However the chromium III oxidizes to chromium VI (Hexavalent chromium) in the presence of oxygen combined with other factors, such as extremes in pH. This happens during the tanning process. The hexavalent chromium produces allergic reaction and easily moves across the membranes such as skin, and it is a major cause for many diseases. This research work suggests using <b>silicate</b> <b>tanning</b> process by eliminating the chrome tanning process to make eco friendly leather. The present tanneries which use chrome tanning process can be modified in to <b>silicate</b> <b>tanning</b> process to make pollution free tanneries and the future generations can be protected from very dangerous environmental impacts caused by chromium compounds...|$|E
