40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} main trends in the development of <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures. In order to reach the purpose it is necessary to conduct a review of the known structural concepts, nodal connections and specifics of the <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures and to make conclusions on feasibility improvement of the considered structural concepts that make it possible to develop new solutions without disadvantages residing in the analogues. Analysis of papers written by foreign and national scientists and devoted to theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of stress-strain state, influence of different factors on it and geometrical optimization and designing of <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures has been conducted in order to achieve the objectives. <b>Space</b> <b>grid</b> structures and, in particular, flat double-layer grid and most frequent nodes have been studied in the paper. The paper contains a short review of the history on development of <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures. It has been found that a rapid development of structural designs was caused by scientific and technical progress and, in particular, improvement of physical and mechanical properties of materials, development of calculation methods, application of software systems for simulating behavior of the structure under load, which significantly increased the calculation accuracy and reduced complexity of design. It has been also established that main parameters that have influence on effectiveness of a structural design are geometric dimensions of its modular elements, ratio of its depth to the span. The world experience on development of connection components has been studied in the paper. The paper presents general classification of nodal connections. Main advantages and disadvantages of existing <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structures are highlighted and it allows to determine possible methods for their improvement. Theoretical research has permitted to establish that the main direction of spatial grid structures improvement consists in development of new node connection types. Several methods for node improvement have been proposed while taking into account the obtained results. </p...|$|R

In this paper, square pyramid <b>space</b> <b>grid</b> structure, orthogonal <b>space</b> truss structure, three way latticed grid and honeycomb triangular pyramid grid structure will be analyzed using this method to identify single damage and multi-damage location.

Skeletons provide an alternative to classical boundary or volumetric representations, which is especially effective for applications where one needs to reason about, and manipulate, {{the structure of a}} shape. These skeleton properties make them powerful tools for many types of shape analysis and processing tasks. For a given shape, several <b>skeleton</b> <b>types</b> can be defined, each having its own properties, advantages, and drawbacks. Similarly, a large number of methods exist to compute a given <b>skeleton</b> <b>type,</b> each having its own requirements, advantages, and limitations. While using skeletons for two-dimensional (2 D) shapes is a relatively well covered area, developments in the skeletonization of three-dimensional (3 D) shapes make these tasks challenging for both researchers and practitioners. This survey presents an overview of 3 D shape skeletonization. We start by presenting the definition and properties of various types of 3 D skeletons. We propose a taxonomy of 3 D skeletons which allows us to further analyze and compare them with respect to their properties. We next overview methods and techniques used to compute all described 3 D <b>skeleton</b> <b>types,</b> and discuss their assumptions, advantages, and limitations. Finally, we describe several applications of 3 D skeletons, which illustrate their added value for different shape analysis and processing tasks...|$|R
40|$|Many {{scholars}} have {{stressed the importance}} of the role of interaction in the language learning process (Kramsch, 1986; Van Lier, 1996; Ellis, 2000; Walsh, 2011). However, studies on classroom interaction between foreign language (FL) teachers and a group of FL learners are rare, because they are multifaceted and complex. Few techniques or observation systems are able to track the development of student-teacher interactions over time. A potentially powerful tool for researching time series is the State <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> technique (Lewis, Lamey & Douglas, 1999 & Hollenstein, 2007). A State <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> is a two-dimensional representation of a dynamic system, in which the cells represent all possible states of a system. State <b>Space</b> <b>Grids</b> are suitable for visualizing the dynamic system, and analyzing measures such as cell range, dispersion, cell visits, cell transitions and duration. The present study sets out to explore if and how sequential teacher-group interactions develop dynamically over time, and to reveal successful or unsuccessful verbal teacher scaffolding. We used teacher questions in relation to FL learner utterances as our unit of analysis, and applied the State <b>Space</b> <b>Grid</b> technique to study these two dimensions together. Coding categories for the system dimensions include teacher clarification, elicitation, elaboration, referential questions and display questions (Lyster, 2007, Dalton-Puffer, 2007) in relation to length and quality of FL learner responses. We analyzed video data from five different naturalistic Dutch secondary EFL classrooms. We will present some preliminary results and outline practical applications of the State-Space Grid for teacher education purposes...|$|R

40|$|Every {{abstract}} {{type of a}} belief-closed <b>type</b> <b>space</b> corresponds to an infinite belief hierarchy. But only finite order of beliefs is necessary for most applications. As we demonstrate, many important insights from recent development {{in the theory of}} Bayesian games with higher-order uncertainty involve belief hierarchies of order 2. We start with characterizing order 2 "consistent priors" and show that they form a convex set and contain the convex hull of both the naÃ¯ve and complete-information <b>type</b> <b>spaces.</b> We establish conditions for private-value heterogeneous naÃ¯ve priors to be embedded in order- 2 consistent priors, so as to retro-fit the Harsanyi doctrine of having nature generate all fundamental uncertainties in a game at the very beginning. We then extend the notion of consistent priors to arbitrary finite order k. We define an abstract belief-closed space to be of order k if it can be mapped via a type morphism into the "canonical representation" of an order-k consistent prior. We show that order-k <b>type</b> <b>spaces</b> are those in which any two types of each player must be either identical implying one of them is redundant or separable by their order (k- 1) belief hierarchies. Finite <b>type</b> <b>spaces</b> are always of finite orders. We consider "finite-order projection" or a <b>type</b> <b>space</b> and show that they are finite-order <b>type</b> <b>spaces</b> themselves. The condition of global stability under uncertainty ensures the convergence of the Bayesian-Nash equilibria with the projection <b>type</b> <b>spaces</b> to those with the original <b>type</b> <b>space.</b> By defining a total variation norm based on finite-order projections, we generalize Kajii and Morris's (1997) idea of equilibrium robustness to Bayesian games. We then establish the robustness of Bayesian-Nash equilibria that generalizes the robustness results of Monderer and Samet (1989) for complete-information games. We apply our framework of finite-order <b>type</b> <b>spaces</b> or consistent priors to review several important models in the literature and illustrate some new insights.

40|$|In {{variable}} <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> tomography {{the underground}} velocity distribution is parameterized with model cells of different sizes. This method can simultaneously {{take into account}} the spatially varying resolution inherent in most datasets. E. g., due to experimental design or logistic constraints, the shallow and deep subsurface velocity distribution may be very differently determined by the available data. The variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> tomography and regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> tomography are similar in most other aspects. There are two main differences between the variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method and the regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method. First, ray segments calculated in the forward model cells should be divided into the larger cells of the inversion model. Second, the smoothness constraint equations needed to inhibit wild velocity variations need to be modified where the cells change in size. In a synthetic checkerboard reconstruction test with differently sized checkers the variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method recovers the small and large checkers better than the regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method in both two and three-dimensional test cases. For a real dataset, the variable <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method distinguishes two low velocity zones better than the regular <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> method.
