5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A single storey building connects the south-east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to the main prison wall.|$|E
5|$|Perry Ellwood {{undertook}} major renovations which {{added and}} changed rooms in 1910. On the home's exterior the porte cochere was {{moved from the}} south facade to its present position on the north facade. On {{the south side of}} the home a large brick terrace was added and the conservatory moved from the southwest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to the rear (west). The full-length tower on the home's southwest corner was entirely removed during this renovation.|$|E
50|$|Nordman was {{generally}} respected by members on all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
50|$|In week ten <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> merged and housemates could {{nominate}} {{any other}} housemate.|$|R
50|$|A 1961 {{addition}} {{was designed}} by Small, adding bedrooms to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and separate living and dining rooms.|$|R
5|$|Robert {{went on to}} rent further {{land around}} the north of Plas Mawr. The land {{at the south end}} of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne {{purchased}} this in 1585, probably for the relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain {{in the kitchen and}} housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} by Charles Payne, an engraver {{who founded the}} firm of Payne & Taylor for calico printers in 1849. In 1849, Payne becan to purchase parcels of land that he would later construct the house on. The main block {{of the house was}} erected in 1855–1856 and later expanded with a north wing in the mid-1870s. The final major addition was an ell on the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> the date of construction occurred prior to 1902. Though the house {{has been the subject of}} some alterations, these changes are largely inconspicuous.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{letters to}} the President signed by Congressmen and women from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> - have {{recommended}} negotiations with New Zealand ...|$|R
50|$|Mr Madam Speaker, The Queen {{commands}} this honourable House {{to bow to}} both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> {{to attend}} Her Majesty immediately in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Peers.|$|R
50|$|Charles' sons John Ross McCulloch and Frederick McCulloch {{eventually}} {{lived on}} both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> It was also <b>the</b> residence <b>of</b> prominent local architect Charles R. Weatherhogg.|$|R
5|$|Local {{architect}} Thomas Bower performed some alterations to {{the house}} for Robert Crewe-Milnes in 1896, including extending the service wing. Few changes to the hall itself occurred during Calmic's tenancy. The company installed central heating in around 1948, and later constructed an office extension on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> which was demolished {{a few years after}} the building's conversion into an hotel. Calmic had undertaken only cosmetic maintenance work, and by the 1970s the fabric of the building was in poor repair. A major stonework fall from the north gable during high winds in 1974 led Wellcome to carry out an extensive restoration programme to both the interior and the exterior, which was completed in 1979 at a cost of £500,000 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|On 9June 2004, the {{day after}} the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few yards away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is an orangery, {{which was built}} as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides {{the view of the}} servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E
50|$|A broad {{flight of}} steps leads {{up to the}} main entrance, and there are similar steps on {{the north and south}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> inside {{contains}} a series of elegant rooms, especially the dining hall decorated in gold and white and the entrance hall with its double staircase.|$|R
50|$|It is a wood {{frame house}} on a {{limestone}} foundation, with a modified gambrel roof. Its front is asymmetrical {{and it has a}} porch around three <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Lobb <b>House</b> is a two-and-one-half-story structure, 42 feet by 28 feet, {{sided with}} clapboard. The roof is hipped, with hipped dormers, and the exposed eaves extend {{well beyond the}} {{exterior}} walls. A veranda with Ionic columns graces two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> interior uses {{a large amount of}} oak woodwork.|$|R
5|$|Perry is the pet platypus of the Flynn-Fletcher family, and is {{perceived}} as mindless and domesticated. In secret, however, he lives a double life {{as a member of}} an all-animal espionage organization referred to as O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). Many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house; such as the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard, and several other everyday objects that seem to elude the family's attention. Perry also has entrances in Hawaii and North Dakota. He engages in daily battles with Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, an evil scientist who desires to take over the Tri-state area with obscure contraptions that work perfectly according to his intended function but fail in his application of them every time.|$|E
5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the Dolley Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch on the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in the space where the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E
5|$|The low granite block {{foundation}} {{of the house is}} more exposed on the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> allowing for a full-height door exiting from the cellar. The stone stack supports four fireplaces that each support the hall, hall chamber, parlor and the cellar. Also there is a smoke chamber in the stack in the attic. The original kitchen, now in the hall, features a large fireplace with bake oven in the rear wall of the firebox. The attic once housed a large loom that was later moved down to {{the west side of the}} cellar. Amos G. Avery, who owned and restored the house prior to its 1992 National Register of Historic Places listing, removed a 1871 Victorian balustrade on the front staircase installed by the second Theophilus Avery.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Elizabeth Wright Ingraham, Wright's granddaughter and was built in 1958. It has just clerestory windows on some <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and larger windows facing towards the Red River.|$|R
5000|$|Ferguson {{served as}} chair of public {{accounting}} during {{his time in the}} legislature. [...] His biographical entry in the Canadian Parliamentary Guide indicates that he was popular with both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
50|$|When Esch, {{defeated}} for re-election, left <b>the</b> <b>House</b> for <b>the</b> {{last time}} on March 3, 1921, it paid him an unusual honor: both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> stood and cheered {{him as he}} left.|$|R
5|$|The main {{family living}} {{quarters}} {{are located in}} the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to the staircase hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and {{he became one of the}} most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms {{scattered over the}} two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E
2500|$|The MECA {{contains}} a Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP). The TECP, designed by Decagon Devices, has four short fat probes and one port on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> that made <b>the</b> following measurements: ...|$|R
5000|$|Edith {{called on}} former White House {{gardener}} Henry Pfister {{to help her}} design a colonial garden on <b>the</b> west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White <b>House.</b> [...] A similar garden was eventually placed on <b>the</b> east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White <b>House.</b>|$|R
50|$|FHM's {{projection}} {{of a naked}} picture of Gail Porter on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> Parliament in 1999 was subverted by Bragster {{ten years after the}} original stunt by projecting a nude man on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tate Britain.|$|R
25|$|Viewfield House had {{substantial}} grounds {{surrounded by}} {{trees in the}} nineteenth century, as shown on J. Wood's 1823 town plan, and (illustrated) the 1854 Ordnance Survey 1:1056 map, which also shows the staircase extension on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that a cock egg would hatch out as a cockatrice, and this could be {{prevented}} by tossing the egg over the family house, landing on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> without allowing the egg to hit the house.|$|E
