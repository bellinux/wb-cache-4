Length of stemming column and types of stemming materials can influence the result of blasting fragmentation. Longer stemming will produce a boulder while shorter stemming will produce fly rock and the fragment size is too small. <b>Stemming</b> <b>material</b> too soft can cause the blast energy distribution not separated well so the blasting operation achievement is not optimum. This research observed and evaluated the blasting fragment size, boulder, and blasting recovery that occur from mining blasting activity used two types <b>stemming</b> <b>material</b> such drill cutting and crushed stone. The result indicated use of drill cutting material is not strong enough to withstand the blast energy towards to the top of blasting hole then produce fly rock and 26. 6 % boulder. Crushed stone material gives the best result for 10. 09 % boulder and 93 % blasting recovery but need more expense for it.

40|$|Drill {{cuttings}} {{are generally}} used in open pits and quarries {{as the most}} common <b>stemming</b> <b>material,</b> since these are most readily available at blast sites. The plaster stemming method {{has been found to}} be better than the drill cuttings stemming method, due to increased confinement inside the hole and better utilization of blast explosive energy in the rock. The main advantage of the new stemming method is the reduction in the cost of blasting. At a limestone quarry, blasting costs per unit volume of rock were reduced by 7 %. This is obtained by increasing burden and spacing distances. In addition, better fragmentation was obtained by using the plaster stemming method. Blast trials showed that plaster stemming produced finer material than the conventional methods. In the same blast tests, + 20 cm size fragments reduced to 42. 6 % of the total, compared to 48. 7 % in the conventional method of drill cuttings stemming...|$|E
40|$|Stemming {{is used in}} {{blasting}} operations to help contain explosive gases as long as possible. Stemming can reduce airblast, improve fragmentation, and reduce the chances of hot explosive gases igniting methane and dust explosions in underground mines. Stemming is required in underground coal mines but is generally not used in underground metal and nonmetal mines. Some underground metal and nonmetal mines are classified as gassy and can require special blasting procedures {{such as the use}} of stemming to minsure the safety of miners. The types and amounts of <b>stemming</b> <b>material</b> that are desirable in underground metal and nonmetal mine blasting to ensure good or improved fragmentation while containing the hot gases are largely unknown. This Bureau of Mines research examined the effectiveness of differing lengths of stemming by measuring stemming ejection times as related to burden movement. With properly stemmed blasts, stemming is contained until some burden movement has occurred. Test blasts at two surface limestone quarries were evaluated using high-speed photography. For the conditions of these tests, a stemming length of at least 26 charge diameters was found to prevent premature stemming ejection. In tests with stemming lengths of 16 charge diameters, the stemming was effective but there was early venting of hot gases through fractures in the rock. Further testing with other rock types, hole diameters, explosive types, and stemming materials as they affect incendivity is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Stress {{shielding}} in the cemented {{hip prosthesis}} occurs {{due to the}} mismatching in the mechanical properties of metallic stem and bone. This mismatching in properties is considered {{as one of the}} main reasons for implant loosening. Therefore, a new <b>stem</b> <b>material</b> in orthopedic surgery is still required. In the present study, 3 D finite element modeling is used for evaluating the artificial hip joint stem that is made of Function Graded (FG) material in terms of joint stress distributions and stem length. Method 3 D finite element models of different stems made of two types of FG <b>materials</b> and traditional <b>stems</b> made of Cobalt Chromium alloy (CoCrMo) and Titanium alloy (Ti) were developed using the ANSYS Code. The effects on the total artificial hip joint stresses (Shear stress and Von Mises stresses at bone cement, Von Mises stresses at bone and stem) due to using the proposed FG <b>materials</b> <b>stems</b> were investigated. The effects on the total artificial hip joint system stresses due to using different stem lengths were investigated. Results Using FG stem (with low stiffness at stem distal end and high stiffness at its proximal end) resulted in a significant reduction in shear stress at the bone cement/stem interface. Also, the Von Mises stresses at the bone cement and stem decrease significantly when using FG material instead of CoCrMo and Ti alloy. The stresses’ distribution along the bone cement length when using FG material was found to be more uniform along the whole bone cement compared with other <b>stem</b> <b>materials.</b> These more uniform stresses will help in the reduction of the artificial hip joint loosening rate and improve its short and long term performance. Conclusion FE results showed that using FG stem increases the resultant stresses at the femur bone (reduces stress shielding) compared to metallic stem. The results showed that the stem length has significant effects on the resultant shear and Von Mises stresses at bone, stem and bone cement for all types of <b>stem</b> <b>materials.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} ball milling on {{structural}} components of maize (Zea mays L.) stem {{was investigated in}} relation to enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates. Ball milling of extractive-free maize <b>stem</b> <b>material</b> was carried out with different milling times up to 12 h. Carbohydrate conversion from ball-milled maize <b>stem</b> <b>material</b> with cellulolytic preparation Onozuka R- 10 increased to 79 % with increasing ball milling time up to 4 h, but did not thereafter increase further. Ball milling caused drastic depolymerization of hemicelluloses as revealed by increasing amounts of monosaccharides released in absence of enzymes. Infrared spectroscopy showed that cellulose crystallinity decreased within the first 6 h milling thereafter reaching a plateau. Thioacidolysis of solid residue fractions obtained after treatment of ball-milled samples with Onozuka R- 10 suggested that no extensive degradation of lignin occurred during the milling. The effect of lignin structure on enzymatic hydrolysis of associated carbohydrates was further studied independently of cellulose crystallinity. Two lignin-carbohydrate fractions comprising hemicellulose and lignin with either high or low amount of aryl ether linkages were used as model materials. Lignins abundant in aryl ether linkages appeared more detrimental than condensed lignins to enzymatic hydrolysis of associated carbohydrates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
