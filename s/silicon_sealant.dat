30|$|Thirty green square lumbers of Sugi (115  ×  115  ×  3000  mm 3) were {{obtained}} from Ehime Prefecture in Japan. Each lumber was cut to yield 4 boards with the dimensions of 35  ×  110  ×  300 (longitudinal direction) mm 3. Both end surfaces of the boards were sealed with <b>silicon</b> <b>sealant</b> and air-dried for 32  days in a room temperature atmosphere. After air-drying, the boards were finished by a planer and their sealed end section was cut off. Consequently, a total of 120 boards with the final dimensions of 30  ×  110  ×  250 (longitudinal direction) mm 3 were prepared. The boards were placed for 1  day in a conditioning room at a temperature and relative humidity of around 20  °C and 30  %RH until just before NIR measurement.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a new design of waterproof ground for rest rooms in basements by using new materials and new combination. First use cement mortar to paste the waterproof and heat resistance foam glass furring bricks which have low density and high strength on the ground. Then use <b>silicon</b> <b>sealant</b> {{to fill the}} gap between the bricks. Roll brush the multifunctional transparent elastic waterproof coating pure acrylic JQ- 168 on the bricks as surface. The combination of the two formed a sealed waterproof ground in indoor restrooms with certain strength and toughness. So this kind of ground surface can have stable and reliable waterproof function when in face of the situation that groundwater upwelling through fissures in concrete created by resistless damage like earthquake and so on. Research background Nowadays in China, the use of underground space more and more appear in all kinds of civil and public buildings due to the pressure of population and demand for land conservation, such as subway, underground shopping malls, residential basement, etc. So here come many underground restrooms. A restroom itself is in a moist environment. Cause the ground of restrooms directl...|$|E
30|$|The {{obtained}} nanocomposites {{can be used}} as {{an optical}} media with high refraction coefficient since it is possible to increase the refraction index of the composite material from 1.54 for pure polymer matrix up to 1.68 for the A 15 S nanocomposite. At the same time, composites are optically transparent, with very low scattering, which allows their use as <b>silicon</b> <b>sealants</b> or adhesives in LED production, in solar cells, or as waveguide coatings.|$|R
40|$|Oxidation {{protection}} for the Orbiter reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC consists of three components: silicon carbide coating, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) impregnated into the carbon substrate and a <b>silicon</b> based surface <b>sealant</b> (designated Type A). The Orbiter Type A sealant is being consumed each mission, which results in increased carbon-carbon substrate mass loss, which adversely impacts the mission life of the RCC components. In addition, the sealant loss in combination with launch pad contamination (salt deposit and zinc oxide) results in RCC pinholes. A sealant refurbishment schedule to maintain mission life and minimize affects of pin hole formation has been implemented in the Orbiter maintenance schedule. The objective of this investigation is to develop an advanced sealant system for the RCC that extends the refurbishment schedule by reducing sealant loss/pin hole formation {{and that can be}} applied to existing Orbiter RCC components. This paper presents the results of arc jet screening tests conducted on several sealants that are being considered for application to the Orbiter RCC...|$|R
40|$|Background: The tracheobronchial {{pattern of}} human lungs is well known. An {{attempt was made}} to compare the pattern with that of sheep lung using luminal {{plastination}} of sheep lung. Several similarities were observed between the two patterns, due to which, the sheep lung serves as an ideal experimental model to study the effect of treatment in several human airway diseases. Objective: The first objective was to compare the two tracheobronchial patterns. Moreover the study also provided an opportunity to the authors to attempt a luminal plastination. The final objective is to highlight the various advantages of advances in luminal plastination in current medical education and research. Materials and methods: <b>Silicon</b> <b>sealant</b> was injected into the tracheobroncheal tree of sheep after thoroughly cleaning the lungs with saline. After the sealant solidified the surrounding lung tissue was destroyed by boiling. Thus a luminal cast was prepared. Result: The result was a splendid luminal cast of the sheep lung showing its tracheobronchial pattern. Conclusion: It was observed that the tracheobronchial division pattern showed significant similarities and a single variation. Therefore the sheep lung is an ideal experimental model and luminal plastination can be applied to comparative anatomical study to identify more such models...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} micro-push-out bond {{strengths}} of a fiber-post cemented with two dentine adhesive systems in extracted human teeth {{with and without}} simulated occlusal loading. Methods: Human extracted, single-rooted teeth were decoronated above the CEJ to a standard length, root canal-treated, and then randomly divided into four groups (n= 16 each). A fiber-reinforced root canal post system (Radix; Dentsply Maillefer) was cemented either with a chemically cured (Panavia F; Kuraray) or a self-etch self-adhesive resin composite cement (SmartCem 2; Dentsply Maillefer) {{according to the manufacturer}} instructions, followed by a resin composite build-up to a standard shape. A layer of <b>silicon</b> <b>sealant</b> was painted over the root surface to about 2 mm below the CEJ, to imitate the periodontal ligament before embedding the root in mold for simulated occlusal loading. A total of 120, 000 load cycles up to 70 N were applied for each tooth. Then, the roots were horizontally sectioned into slices of about 1 mm thick. Push-out test was performed at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min in a universal testing machine (Instron). Data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA and two-sample t-test, where appropriate, at a significance level of 0. 05. Results: No significant difference was found in the micro-push-out bond strengths at various horizontal levels for specimens of each individual group (ANOVA, P > 0. 05). Panavia and SmartCem 2 demonstrated similar bond strengths without loading (14. 0 ± 5. 3 and 15. 5 ± 7. 2 MPa, respectively). There was a significantly reduction in bond strength for both materials due to the simulated loads (P < 0. 05). After loading, Panavia (5. 9 ± 3. 3 MPa) showed a significantly lower bond strength than SmartCem 2 (13. 0 ± 7. 8 MPa) (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: While the “static” bond strength for retaining a fiber-post is comparable, the two types of resin cement are both adversely and significantly affected by functional loads, but to different extents.
