5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} â€” The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a <b>segregated</b> basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as <b>segregated</b> schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially <b>segregated</b> school, so that the schools could reopen on a <b>segregated</b> basis.|$|E

40|$|Allvac 718 Plus and Haynes 282 are {{relatively}} new precipitation hardening nickel based superalloys with good high temperature mechanical properties. In addition, the weldability of these superalloys enhances easy fabrication. The combination of high temperature capabilities and superior weldability is unmatched by other precipitation hardening superalloys and {{linked to the}} amount of the Î³â€™ hardening precipitates in the materials. Hence, it is these properties that make Allvac 718 Plus and Haynes 282 desirable in the manufacture of hot sections of aero engine components. Studies show that cast products are less weldable than wrought products. Segregation of elements in the cast results in inhomogeneous composition which consequently diminishes weldability. Segregation during solidification of the cast products results in dendritic microstructure with the <b>segregating</b> elements occupying interdendritic regions. These <b>segregating</b> elements are trapped in secondary phases present alongside Î³ matrix. Studies show that in Allvac 718 Plus, the <b>segregating</b> phase is Laves while in Haynes 282 the <b>segregating</b> phase is not yet fully determined. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of homogenization heat treatments in eliminating segregation in cast Allvac 718 Plus and Haynes 282. Paramount to the study was the effect of different homogenization temperatures and dwell time in the removal of the <b>segregating</b> phases. Experimental methods used to both qualify and quantify the <b>segregating</b> phases included SEM, EDX analysis, manual point count and macro Vickers hardness tests. Main results show that there is a reduction in the <b>segregating</b> phases in both materials as homogenization proceeds hence a disappearance of the dendritic structure. In Allvac 718 Plus, plate like structures is observed to be closely associated with the Laves phase at low temperatures and dwell times. In addition, Nb is found to be <b>segregating</b> in the interdendritic areas. The expected trend of increase in Laves {{as a result of the}} dissolution of the plate like structures at the initial stage of homogenization is only detectable for few cases. In Haynes 282, white and grey phases are clearly distinguished and Mo is observed to be <b>segregating</b> in interdendritic areas...|$|R

We presented non-segregating and occasionally <b>segregating</b> textures in two different conditions: 1. a condition where subjects were not informed about the presence of the <b>segregating</b> textures {{while at the same time}} engaged in a foveal task, resulting in prolonged inattentional blindness and 2. a condition with similar task demands, in which, however, the subjects perceived the <b>segregating</b> textures. BOLD responses from early visual areas (V 1, V 2, V 3, V 4) and MEG responses up to 240 ms showed a significant difference between <b>segregating</b> and not <b>segregating</b> textures in both conditions and did not differ from each other, indicating that scene segmentation processes proceed normally during inattention.

40|$|In this paper, we {{illustrate}} {{laboratory experiments}} whose {{purpose is to}} study the vertical segregations that are commonly observed in deposits of dense geophysical flows (such as pyroclastic flows and rock avalanches). In these experiments, we use rock cuboids with 5 mm long edges as matrix and rock cuboids with 2 cm long edges as <b>segregating</b> clasts. A rotating disk is used to apply frictional stresses {{at the base of}} the granular masses. In our experiments, <b>segregating</b> cuboids with density smaller than or equal to that of the matrix particles rise whereas <b>segregating</b> cuboidswith density larger than that of the matrix particles sink. The granular flows are imaged through the glass container of the experimental apparatus by a high-speed video camera at 2000 fps. By means of particle image velocimetry analysis of the movies, we study the vertical gradient of particle agitation that exists within the granular flows where agitation increases downward because of the interaction with the subsurface asperities. The high-speed movies show that it is the particle agitation within the flows that exerts an upward force and that, when this force is larger than theweight of the <b>segregating</b> clast, the clast riseswhereas, when it is smaller, the clast sinks. The most important result in our set of experiments is that the threshold which separates the values of density of the <b>segregating</b> clasts that <b>segregate</b> upward and the values of density of the <b>segregating</b> clasts that <b>segregate</b> downward is larger than the density of the matrix particles. This explains the upward segregation of dense lithics that is frequently observed in deposits of geophysical flows. This upward segregation is due to the fact that the resultant of the collisions exerted by the matrix particles is a force strong enough to push upward also dense and heavy fragments...|$|R
