40|$|While most {{academic}} set ups used {{to study}} combustion instabilities are limited to <b>single</b> <b>burners</b> and are submitted mainly to longitudinal acoustic modes, real gas turbines exhibit mostly azimuthal modes due to the annular shape of their chambers. This study presents a massively parallel Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of a full helicopter combustion chamber in which a self-excited azimuthal mode develops naturally. The whole chamber is computed from the diffuser outlet to the High Pressure Stator nozzle. LES captures this self-excited instability and results (unsteady pressure RMS and phase fields) show that it is characterized by two superimposed rotating modes with different amplitudes. These turning modes modulate the flow rate through the fifteen burners and the flames oscillate {{back and forth in}} front of each burner, leading to local heat release fluctuations. LES demonstrates that the first effect of the turning modes is to induce longitudinal pulsations of the flow rates through individual burners. The transfer functions of all burners are the same and no mechanism of flame interactions between burners within the chamber is identified...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe premise for the {{exploration}} of new sensors and methods of diagnostics of the combustion process are the difficulties encountered during the implementation of low emission combustion technology. Averaging and delay are the main drawbacks of traditional methods of measurement {{of the majority of}} combustion parameters. There is a lack of method that allows measurement of output parameters of an individual burner. It is therefore necessary to use indirect optical methods. They are noninvasive, virtually not delayed and additionally spatially selective. Although they provide large amounts of information, their interpretation requires the use of complex data processing techniques. The authors prove {{that it is possible to}} obtain quantitative information, in the article it is demonstrated on the example of nitrogen oxides.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{provides an}} overview on the applicability of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) in combustion test facilities and summarizes experiences gained {{in a number of}} applications that were performed in the past 6 years. Emphasis is placed on the experimental aspects of each application rather than the interpretation of the acquired flow field data because many of the encountered problems and chosen solution strategies are unique to this area of planar velocimetry application. In particular imaging configurations, seeding techniques, data acquisition strategies as well as pre- and post-processing methodologies are outlined. The paper describes four similar applications of PIV in atmospheric and pressurized combustors containing <b>single</b> <b>burners</b> that are operated either with kerosene or natural gas. Aside from providing adequate optical access to the respective facilities the most challenging issue has been the reliable supply of non-volatile and non-reacting solid particle seeding. Given the rather large mass flows of up to 1 kg/s inside the combustors, sufficient seeding quantities could best be delivered by fluidized bed particle generators, sometimes even operated in parallel. The devices have been continually improved to allow constant delivery rates only during data acquisition periods, thus preventing unnecessary collection of seeding in the facility. The choice and handling of the seeding particle powder was found to be crucial for the overall success of the measurements. The first application describes initial trials on a swirled kerosene spray fuel nozzle at 3 bars and illustrates problems encountered due to flame luminosity as well as strong light scattering from the fuel droplets. The second application summarizes the challenges faced in obtaining phase-resolved, three-component velocity data from a generic atmospheric gas combustor using stereoscopic PIV. A much larger, swirl stabilized gas burner as utilized in stationary power generation was the subject of the third described application. Here a novel methodology of data acquisition and post-processing provides phase resolved velocity maps even of flows that have non-constant oscillation frequencies. Finally, the fourth application describes how the combination of PIV with DGV can yield three-component velocity data in areas of limited optical access using only one viewing window and one separate window (or probe) for light sheet delivery...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the low NOx burner design and analysis task of the Conceptual Design of Oxygen-Based PC Boiler study is to optimize the burner design to ensure stable ignition, to provide safe operation, and to minimize pollutant formation.

40|$|International audienceIn annular {{combustion}} chambers of aero-engines and gas turbines, acoustic coupling {{may arise from}} azimuthal modes which are less well damped than axial modes. Also, since the circumference is the largest length in the combustor, the azimuthal modes have the lowest resonance frequencies and are most prone to instability. Such a coupling raises many scientific issues which are considered in {{a small number of}} funda- mental experiments. The present investigation focuses on this problem and provides experimental data on a special type of combustion instability in which the thermo-acoustic resonant coupling involves a combina- tion of modes. This produces an unusual pattern of flame responses in which the distribution of heat release rate is slanted. Data are provided in the form of free radical light intensity patterns (interpreted as heat release rate distributions) and microphone signals detected in the plenum and chamber. It is shown that the slanted pattern is the signature of a combination of two modes with coinciding frequencies, the first being a standing azimuthal mode while the second is an axial mode. Measurements of the flame describing function on a <b>single</b> matrix <b>burner</b> at the fundamental frequency are used to explain the observed phase shift and amplitude in the flame responses of the different injectors in the annular combustor...|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} most {{portable}} gas cartridge stoves {{is similar to}} that of many pressurized burner stoves, except the fuel tank or cartridge contains a liquefied gas - typically butane, propane or a mixture of hydrocarbons - that is held under pressure. While the gas in the cartridge is in a liquid state when stored under pressure, it vaporizes immediately as it leaves the storage bottle (i.e., without priming), arriving at the burner as a gas. The principal advantage of gas cartridge stoves is convenience: no priming is required, they are generally maintenance-free and capable of immediate high heat output, the flame is easily adjusted and they are generally considered simpler to operate. There are two basic designs for most gas cartridge stoves used for camping: the burner assembly is fitted into the top of the gas cartridge, which serves as the stove's base, or the stove is free-standing and the cartridge is separated from the burner and connected by means of a small hose or pipe. <b>Single</b> <b>burner</b> propane stoves commonly used in food service have the gas container integrated into the body of the stove.

40|$|An initial testing {{campaign}} {{was carried out}} {{during the summer of}} 2000 to evaluate the impact of multiburner firing on NOx emissions. Extensive data had been collected during the Fall of 1999 and Spring of 2000 using a single pulverized-coal (PC) burner, and this data collection was funded by a separate Department of Energy program, the Combustion 2000 Low Emission Boiler System (LEBS) project under the direction of DB Riley. This single-burner data was thus available for comparison with NOx emissions obtained while firing three burners at the same overall load and operating conditions. A range of operating conditions were explored that were compatible with single-burner data, and thus the emission trends as a function of air staging, burner swirl and other parameters will be described below. In addition, a number of burner-to-burner operational variations were explored that provided interesing insight on their potential impact on NOx emissions. Some of these variations include: running one burner very fuel rich while running the others fuel lean; varying the swirl of a <b>single</b> <b>burner</b> while holding others constant; increasing the firing rate of a <b>single</b> <b>burner</b> while decreasing the others. In general, the results to date indicated that multiburner firing yielded higher NOx emissions than <b>single</b> <b>burner</b> firing at the same fuel rate and excess air. At very fuel rich burner stoichiometries (SR < 0. 75), the difference between multiple and single burners became indistinguishable.

The model consisted of a reactive computational fluid dynamics three-dimensional spatial grid and a 71 -species chemical mechanism with propane combustion capability. Simulations were conducted with a simplified fuel mixture containing methane, ethane, and propane in proportions that yield properties similar to fuels distributed throughout much of California now and in recent years (baseline fuel), as well as with two variations of simulated liquefied natural gas blends. A variety of simulations were conducted with baseline fuel to explore the effect of several key parameters on pollutant formation and other flame characteristics. Simulations started with fuel and air issuing through the burner port, igniting, and continuing until the flame was steady with time. Conditions at this point were analyzed to understand fuel, secondary air and reaction product flows, regions of pollutant formation, and exhaust concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and formaldehyde. A sensitivity study was conducted, varying the inflow parameters of this baseline gs about real-world operating conditions. Flame properties responded as expected from reactive flow theory. In the simulation, carbon monoxide levels were influenced more by the mixture's inflow velocity than by the gas-to-air ratio in the mixture issuing from the inflow port. Additional simulations were executed at two inflow conditions - high heat release and medium heat release - to examine the impact of replacing the baseline gas with two mixtures representative of liquefied natural gas.

30|$|The {{materials}} and constructions discussed above for passing TB 129 are generally used for institutional mattresses. Ticking with polyester or polyester blends {{that are used}} in many residential mattresses behave very differently in the presence of fire barriers. Moreover, the test methods employed for mattresses used in public occupancies (Cal TB 129) and residential mattresses (16 CFR 1633) use different ignition sources thus the thermal insult seen by tickings in such mattresses would be significantly different. The Cal TB 129 uses <b>single</b> propane gas <b>burner</b> which is applied to the mattress side whereas 16 CFR 1633 uses dual burner (also known as NIST burner) to apply flaming ignition to both the side and top surfaces of the mattress. The NIST burner replicates burning bedclothes on mattress and mimics pool fire caused by melting of bedclothes. The effects of melting and dripping can have a varied impact on the flammability of a mattress. Fire barriers often fail to protect the underlying material when melting and shrinkage occur. This can cause tensile stresses to develop within the barrier material, resulting in breakage that allows flame and heat to penetrate. This particular failure mechanism is a major concern for barriers based on charring organic fibers.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThermoacoustic instabilities are an {{important}} concern {{in the design of}} gas turbine combustion chambers. Most modern combustion chambers have annular shapes and this leads to the appearance of azimuthal acoustic modes. These modes are often powerful and can lead to structural vibrations being sometimes damaging. Therefore, they must be identified at the design stage {{in order to be able}} to eliminate them. However, due to the complexity of industrial combustion chambers with a large number of burners, numerical studies of real configurations are a challenging task. The following work shows results obtained on an industrial annular gas turbine combustor with 24 burners using an acoustic approach.

These operating conditions produce in some cases combustion instabilities which can have dramatic effects for the turbine. Extended experimental and numerical studies are then required to analyze the possible behavior of the end design. Unfortunately tests on the real set-up are not possible and simplified cases are used.

High Temperature Air Combustion, HiTAC, is an innovative combustion technology which offers improved heat transfer {{and a reduction in}} fuel consumption and NOx emissions. This paper describes a project in which a computational fluid dynamic model of a furnace working on high temperature air combustion technology was developed using FLUENT® CFD software. The model was validated against experimental data obtained from KTH in Sweden. The predicted results compared very well with this experimental data, and were also closer than the predictions from the model built by KTH. The model was applied to a steam boiler of Malta’s Delimara Power Station. Two scenarios were considered: the boiler with conventional combustion and the boiler converted to HITAC. To reduce computational time, a 400 : 1 scaled down version of the boiler was modelled based on NOx scaling. Further reductions were made by taking advantage of the symmetry of the boiler and by obtaining the solution for a <b>single</b> <b>burner,</b> and then prescribing the parameter profiles for the <b>single</b> <b>burner</b> to the full boiler model as boundary conditions.

NOx emissions (< 12 mg/MJ) were relatively constant with changes in oxygen enrichment levels below ~ 60 % and decreased at higher oxygen enrichment. NOx emission increased with increasing stack oxygen concentration at all oxygen enrichment levels. Air infiltration resulted in NOx emissions similar to those observed with no air infiltration but with similar stack oxygen concentrations. The standard deviation of the temperature distribution for the furnace roof and blind sidewall was in the range, 19 – 27 °C with no oxygen enrichment and 31 – 34 °C with 90 % oxygen enrichment.

40|$|The {{need for}} a Combustion and Melting Research Facility focused on the {{solution}} of glass manufacturing problems common to all segments of the glass industry was given high priority in the earliest version of the Glass Industry Technology Roadmap (Eisenhauer et al., 1997). Visteon Glass Systems and, later, PPG Industries proposed to meet this requirement, {{in partnership with the}} DOE/OIT Glass Program and Sandia National Laboratories, by designing and building a research furnace equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostics in the DOE Combustion Research Facility located at the Sandia site in Livermore, CA. Input on the configuration and objectives of the facility was sought from the entire industry by a variety of routes: (1) through a survey distributed to industry leaders by GMIC, (2) by conducting an open workshop following the OIT Glass Industry Project Review in September 1999, (3) from discussions with numerous glass engineers, scientists, and executives, and (4) during visits to glass manufacturing plants and research centers. The recommendations from industry were that the melting tank be made large enough to reproduce the essential processes and features of industrial furnaces yet flexible enough to be operated in as many as possible of the configurations found in industry as well as in ways never before attempted in practice. Realization of these objectives, while still providing access to the glass bath and combustion space for optical diagnostics and measurements using conventional probes, was the principal challenge {{in the development of the}} tank furnace design. The present report describes a facility having the requirements identified as important by members of the glass industry and equipped to do the work that the industry recommended should be the focus of research. The intent is that the laboratory would be available to U. S. glass manufacturers for collaboration with Sandia scientists and engineers on both precompetitive basic research and the solution of proprietary glass production problems. As a consequence of the substantial increase in scale and scope of the initial furnace concept in response to industry recommendations, constraints on funding of industrial programs by DOE, and reorientation of the Department's priorities, the OIT Glass Program is unable to provide the support for construction of such a facility. However, it is the present investigators' hope that a group of industry partners will emerge to carry the project forward, taking advantage of the detailed furnace design presented in this report. The engineering, including complete construction drawings, bill of materials, and equipment specifications, is complete. The project is ready to begin construction as soon as the quotations are updated. The design of the research melter closely follows the most advanced industrial practice, firing by natural gas with oxygen. The melting area is 13 ft x 6 ft, with a glass depth of 3 ft and an average height in the combustion space of 3 ft. The maximum pull rate is 25 tons/day, ranging from 100 % batch to 100 % cullet, continuously fed, with variable batch composition, particle size distribution, and raft configuration. The tank is equipped with bubblers to control glass circulation. The furnace can be fired in three modes: (1) using a <b>single</b> large <b>burner</b> mounted on the front wall, (2) by six burners in a staggered/opposed arrangement, three in each breast wall, and (3) by down-fired burners mounted in the crown in any combination with the front wall or breast-wall-mounted burners. Horizontal slots are provided between the tank blocks and tuck stones and between the breast wall and skewback blocks, running the entire length of the furnace on both sides, to permit access to the combustion space and the surface of the glass for optical measurements and sampling probes. Vertical slots in the breast walls provide additional access for measurements and sampling. The furnace and tank are to be fully instrumented with standard measuring equipment, such as flow meters, thermocouples, continuous gas composition analyzers, optical pyrometers, and a video camera. The output from the instruments is to be continuously recorded and simultaneously made available to other researchers via the Internet. A unique aspect of the research facility would be its access to the expertise in optical measurements in flames and high temperature reacting flows residing in the Sandia Combustion Research Facility. Development of new techniques for monitoring and control of glass melting would be a major focus of the work.

Since CO{sub 2 } is a greenhouse gas, which may have an adverse impact on the world's climate/weather patterns, studies have been conducted to determine the feasibility and economic impact of capturing power plant CO{sub 2 } emissions for pipeline transport to a sequestration/storage site. The stack gas that exhausts from a modern coal-fired power plant typically contains about 15 % CO{sub 2 } on a dry volume basis. Although there are numerous processes available for removing CO{sub 2 } from gas streams, gas scrubbing with amine solvent is best suited for this application because of the large gas volumes and low CO{sub 2 } concentrations involved. Unfortunately the energy required to regenerate the solvent for continued use as a capturing agent is large and imposes a severe energy penalty on the plant. In addition this ''back end'' or post combustion cleanup requires the addition of large vessels, which, in retrofit applications, are difficult to accommodate. As an alternative to post combustion scrubbing, Foster Wheeler (FW) has proposed that the combustion process be accomplished with oxygen rather than air. With all air nitrogen eliminated, a CO{sub 2 }-water vapor rich flue gas will be generated. After condensation of the water vapor, a portion of the flue gas will be recirculated back to the boiler to control the combustion temperature and the balance of the CO{sub 2 } will be processed for pipeline transport. This proposed oxygen-carbon dioxide (O{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 }) combustion process eliminates the need for CO{sub 2 } removal/separation and reduces the cost of supplying a CO{sub 2 } rich stream for sequestration. FW has developed a conceptual design of an O{sub 2 } fired boiler to determine overall plant performance and economics. Five subtasks were conducted: (1) a literature review, (2) a system design and analysis, (3) a low NOx burner design and analysis, (4) a furnace and heat recovery area design analysis, and (5) an economic analysis. The objective of the literature search is to locate any data/information relevant to the Oxygen-Based PC Boiler conceptual design. The objective of the system design and analysis task is to optimize the PC boiler plant by maximizing system efficiency within practical considerations. Simulations of the oxygen-fired plant with CO{sub 2 } sequestration were conducted using Aspen Plus and were compared to a reference air-fired 460 MW plant. Flue gas recycle is used in the O{sub 2 }-fired PC to control the flame temperature. Parametric runs were made to determine the effect of flame temperature on system efficiency and required waterwall material and thickness. The degree of improvement on system efficiency of various modifications including hot gas recycle, purge gas recycle, flue gas feedwater recuperation, and recycle purge gas expansion were investigated. The selected O{sub 2 }-fired design case has a system efficiency of 30. 6 % compared to the air-fired system efficiency of 36. 7 %. The design O{sub 2 }-fired case requires T 91 waterwall material and has a waterwall surface area of only 65 % of the air-fired reference case. The objective of the low NOx burner design and analysis task is to optimize the burner design to ensure stable ignition, to provide safe operation, and to minimize pollutant formation. The burners were designed and analyzed using the Fluent CFD computer program. Four burner designs were developed: (1) with no OFG and 65 % flue gas recycle, (2) with 20 % OFG and 65 % flue gas recycle, (3) with no OFG and 56 % flue gas recycle and (4) with 20 % OFG and 56 % flue gas recycle. A 3 -D Fluent simulation was made of a <b>single</b> wall-fired <b>burner</b> and horizontal portion of the furnace from the wall to the center. Without primary gas swirl, coal burnout was relatively small, due to the low oxygen content of the primary gas. Consequently, the burners were modified to include primary gas swirl to bring the coal particles in contact with the secondary gas. An optimal primary gas swirl was chosen to achieve sufficient burnout. The objective of the furnace and heat recovery area design and analysis task is to optimize the location and design of the furnace, burners, over-fire gas ports, and internal radiant surfaces. The furnace is designed with opposed wall-firing burners and over-fire air ports. Water is circulated in the furnace by natural circulation to the waterwalls and divisional wall panels. Compared to the air-fired furnace, the oxygen-fired furnace requires only 65 % of the surface area and 45 % of the volume. Two oxygen-fired designs were simulated: (1) without over-fire air and (2) with 20 % over-fire air...|$|R
