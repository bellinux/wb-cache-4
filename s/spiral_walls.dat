5000|$|Wordpower, Vol. 2: Directrix is {{the third}} album by Divine Styler, {{released}} in 1999 on Mo' Wax. This was his first album released in seven years, his last being 1992's <b>Spiral</b> <b>Walls</b> Containing Autumns of Light. However, this album could be considered more as a sequel to his debut album, Word Power, due to the [...] "Vol. 2" [...] in the album's name {{and because of the}} more straightforward hip hop the album contains when compared to the wildly experimental <b>Spiral</b> <b>Walls.</b> This album features Divine Styler's Original Scheme Team member(s) Cokni O'Dire (only on the re-released version) and Bilal Bashir.|$|E
50|$|After {{the release}} of <b>Spiral</b> <b>Walls,</b> strangely, Divine Styler {{disappeared}} from the music scene for almost four years. However, he later returned with original Scheme Team member Cokni O'Dire on House of Pain's last album Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again, exhibiting a more traditional hip-hop style of lyricism similar to his work on Word Power.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst it is {{generally}} accepted that Tortilicaulis was moss-like, {{it has not yet}} been recovered in a sufficiently good state of preservation to allow the detailed study necessary to firmly assign it to a taxonomic group. Fossils consist of an elongate apical sporangium (spore-forming organ), which may be branched, with <b>spiralled</b> <b>walls</b> attached to an undivided stalk that is also twisted. [...] Unusually for plants of its time, spores of Tortilicaulis were covered all over with small granules.|$|R

Many of the songs on <b>Spiral</b> <b>Walls</b> Containing Autums of Light are songs of praise to Allah, and the 1999 song [...] "Make it Plain" [...] (recorded for the Funky Precedent compilation) details the joy he feels at having finally found {{a way of life}} he loves after decades of uncertainty and woes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>Walls</b> Containing Autumns of Light is {{the second}} album by hip hop artist Divine Styler, {{released}} in 1992 on Giant Records. This album marked {{a significant change in}} Divine Styler's musical direction, incorporating a much broader range of styles and influences than 1989's Word Power. Despite the album's unusual style, it was actually released by a major label but, perhaps inevitably, failed to sell as well as record executives expected. Although the album was largely regarded as a commercial failure, it has since developed a large cult following. Styler was signed to Giant because of Ice-T’s relationship with Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
5000|$|He first {{emerged as}} part of Ice-T's Rhyme Syndicate. His first LP, Word Power, was hailed by critics and fans, but was not a {{commercial}} success. His second album, the wildly experimental <b>Spiral</b> <b>Walls</b> Containing Autumns of Light, also failed to sell well. In 1998, Divine Styler hooked up with the Quannum Records crew, teaming up with his dear friend and fellow Rhyme Syndicate alumni Everlast, Styles of Beyond, and the Beat Junkies. The latter also appeared on his third LP, Wordpower, Vol. 2: Directrix (Featuring Exceed), which trafficked in information-age paranoia. Although he did not bask in much commercial success he is a well respected factor from the early 1990s West Coast Underground scene. His poetical approach and unorthodox dance crew [...] "The Scheme Team" [...] influenced the likes of Abstract Rude Tribe Unique (ATU). Although {{there is not much}} footage of Divine Styler and the Scheme Team he did make a live appearance on Rapmania, an historic 1989 televised concert that included almost every active Hip Hop artist of that year. Divine performed [...] "Tongue Of Labyrinth" [...] an abstract rhyme style accompanied with the wild dance style of the Scheme Team was a great audio visual performance that captured the essence of Divine Styler.|$|E

40|$|Monographic {{studies on}} Anthostomella and related genera have yielded an {{interesting}} taxon having immersed, obpyriform ascomata {{with a central}} ostiole. The ascospores are relatively large, olivaceous, with conspicuous <b>spiral</b> <b>wall</b> ornamentations, and are surrounded by a hyaline mucilaginous sheath. At the transmission electron microscopic level, the ascospore wall comprises a thin, electron-dense episporium and a thick, electron-transparent mesosporium, with verrucose ornamentations arising from the episporium. The sheath surrounding the ascospores comprises fibrillar material. The subapical ring observed in the ascus is typically xylariaceous.

The {{pattern of the}} wall whirlpool mirrors {{the movement of the}} wheels turned by water stored in the adjacent lodges which once powered the local felt factory. The five exits continue as paths meandering through a planted belt of hawthorn, cherry and apple whose, when in flower, mass of white blossom will give the appearance of turbulent water around a waterwheel. This sculpture, with an oak tree at its centre, acknowledges the circular motion of time that will return this land back to woodland.|$|R
40|$|The new {{subfamily}} Gifuellinae {{is composed}} of two genera, Gifuella Honjo and Gifuelloides n. gen., and is assigned to the family Neoschwagerinidae, superorder Fusulinoida (Forami-nifera). This new subfamily is based on extensive and on-going studies by Kobayashi of fusulinoid material from the Akasaka Limestone of Japan and a careful literature survey. In both Gifuella and Gifuelloides, the <b>spiral</b> <b>wall</b> consists of a uniform tectum and a very fine alveolar keriotheca, which forms a consistent, thin layer that {{gives rise to the}} septula. Both genera are characterized by relatively small proloculi. Of the two genera, species of Gifuella are simpler, smaller, and have fewer whorls and they have well-developed, thin, planar primary transverse septula and almost completely lack secondary transverse septula.

40|$|Haemochorial placentation, as {{it occurs}} in the human and other primate and rodent species, {{requires}} a connection of the placenta with supplying maternal (uteroplacental) arteries. Very little is known of the initial stages but endovascular trophoblast invasion seems to represent an essential element for further elaboration of an adequate uteroplacental circulation. In the human, endovascular trophoblast arrives in myometrial segments of spiral arteries only from about 15 weeks of pregnancy. This is preceded by an interstitial type of cytotrophoblast invasion {{which seems to be}} associated with regressive changes in <b>spiral</b> artery <b>walls.</b> It is possible that the latter forms an essential priming factor to allow subsequent endovascular migration. Endovascular trophoblast invasion has been documented in different laboratory animals, including the rat and the golden hamster. Especially in the latter case a sequence of changes in the maternal component, i. e. the maternal cellular elements in the <b>spiral</b> artery <b>walls,</b> precede the arrival of trophoblast. Besides, there is also some evidence of haemodynamical factor(s) influencing trophoblast migration. Because of the importance of this phenomenon in the establishment of an adequate uteroplacental circulation, it is essential to develop further experimental models for studying pathological situations as exist in human pregnancy. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Preeclampsia is complicating 3. 5 % of pregnancies in Norway, and is {{associated}} with increased mortality and morbidity for both mother and offspring. Deficient placentation with release of substances from the placenta to the maternal circulation is believed to cause hypertension and proteinuria, which are diagnostic of the disease. The uterine endometrium (decidua) contains blood vessels that are important for placental nutritional transport to the fetus. The <b>walls</b> of these <b>spiral</b> arteries often contain lipid depositions (acute atherosis), causing reduced {{blood flow to the}} placenta, hypoxia and oxidative stress. Gynecologist Nina Kittelsen Harsem demonstrated that a new method for collecting decidual tissue after delivery was better than traditional knife biopsies from the uterine endometrium, as more spiral arteries were collected for demonstration of lipid deposition in morphological investigations. The lipid depositions in the <b>spiral</b> artery <b>walls</b> were more frequent in women with preeclampsia than in women with normal pregnancies, but not all women with preeclampsia demonstrated these vascular changes. In addition, some few women with apparently healthy pregnancies also demonstrated similar evidence of arterial lipid deposition. Among circulating substances found in increased concentration in preeclampsia are oxidized lipids, including isoprostanes, which could result in a state of increased oxidative stress. In the preeclampsia group there was evidence of augmented oxidative stress in the maternal circulation. In the fetal umbilical cord blood there was not found any difference between preeclampsia and controls. She then explored whether there is an association between the lipid deposition in the <b>spiral</b> arterial <b>wall</b> and signs of augmented oxidative stress in maternal blood, but no such association were demonstrated. This study supports the concept that preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disease that does not affect all women, fetuses or placentas similarly...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing the {{magneto-optic}} Kerr {{effect and}} Kerr microscopy measurements, we investigated the antiferro-magnetic (AFM) domain switching process at different magnetic fields in a single-crystalline Fe/CoO bilayer grown on MgO(001) substrate. In {{spite of the}} zero-net magnetic moment in the CoO layer, {{we find that the}} activation energy barrier of CoO AFM domain switching decreased at larger magnetic field. To separate the different behaviors of domain nucleation and domain wall motion during the CoO spin switching process, a new analytical method was developed. Using this method, we found that the CoO domain nucleation energy barrier exhibited a jump at a critical magnetic field while the CoO domain wall motion experienced only a tiny energy barrier variation. The field-dependent behaviors of the energy barriers were attributed to the formation of a <b>spiral</b> domain <b>wall</b> in the Fe layer during its magnetization reversal and this was supported by micromagnetic simulations...|$|R

40|$|It {{this work}} {{it has been}} shown that it is {{possible}} to produce thin wall ductile iron (TWDI) castings with considerably length using Archimedes <b>spiral</b> with <b>wall</b> thickness of 1, 2 and 3 mm. Inmould technique was used to produce TWDI. It has been estimated castability and metallographic investigations were made using different moulding materials. From castability measurements result that it is possible to obtain thin wall ductile iron castings with wall thickness down to 1 mm with castability of 200 mm. Using mould with small ability to absorb heat castability increases twice. At wall thickness equal 3 mm castability reaches 1000 mm and using LDASC sand its value increases to over 1500 mm. Structure parameters for different wall thickness and moulding materials (graphite nodule count, ferrite and cementite fraction) are plotted versus distance from the beginning of spiral.

40|$|An intense {{activity}} of enzymes which actively {{participate in the}} renin-angiotensinaldosterone system was shown in extravillous trophoblast cells which {{are involved in the}} performing of spiral arteries into uteroplacental vessels. The hydrolase activity in villous trophoblast underwent important variations, but it was constant in cells of the extravillous trophoblast. Activity of lysosomal hydrolases, of leucine aminopeptidase and N-acetyl glucosaminidase type, was markedly positive in X-cells, while negative in the villous trophoblast. Beta glucuronidase activity has shown moderate activity in cells of extravillous trophoblast, while in villous trophoblast it was weakly emphasized or negative. Intense {{activity of}} prostaglandin E 2 dehydrogenase in the way of strongly emphasized microsomal reaction was noted exclusively in extravillous cells of basal plate, especially in perivascular cell groupings. Within all examined enzymes activities, only the membranous activity of alkaline phosphatase was of the same intensity in cells of extravillous trophoblast.

40|$|Objective. Structural {{changes of}} the spiral arteries needed for the {{pregnancy}} do not completely resolve following parturition. We tested the hypothesis that these anatomical changes {{are related to the}} number of previous pregnancies. Methods. Video image analysis was performed on Masson-stained sections from 28 hysterectomy specimens, examining the proportion of non-muscular tissue within the <b>spiral</b> arterial <b>walls.</b> Semi-quantitative analysis of {{changes of the}} internal elastic lamina was performed on orcein-stained sections. The extent of changes was tested for correlation with parity using regression analysis. Results. Duplication and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina increased with increasing parity (P= 0. 019) with differences between milliparity and parity 1, 2, 3 or 4 but not between other parity pairings. The proportion of non-muscular tissue increased with increasing parity (P= 0. 010). Conclusions. These results suggest that pregnancy results in permanent anatomical changes in the spiral arteries that may modify subsequent vascular remodelling in the next pregnancy. This could provide an anatomical basis to explain the epidemiological data showing an increasing birth weight with increasing parity, particularly of the second born. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
