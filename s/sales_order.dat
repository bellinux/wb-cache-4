25|$|The SADT {{supplies}} {{a specific}} functional view of any enterprise by describing the functions and their relationships in a company. These functions fulfill {{the objectives of}} a company, such as <b>sales,</b> <b>order</b> planning, product design, part manufacturing, and human resource management. The SADT can depict simple functional relationships and can reflect data and control flow relationships between different functions. The IDEF0 formalism is based on SADT, developed by Douglas T. Ross in 1985.|$|E
25|$|While {{investigators}} {{focused on}} the foam material that had been installed behind the stage, claiming the foam was intended for use in packaging and product display, testimony {{available to the public}} contradicts this. Testimony by Barry Warner, the salesman from American Foam who sold the foam to the Derderians, confirmed that there was a <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> for high-density acoustic soundproofing foam. Chemical analysis of the actual foam that was in the nightclub on the evening of the fire was never released to the public. A roll of foam confiscated from the basement of the nightclub after the fire was removed by the ATF but the testing done on that specific foam was never released to the public. Witnesses to the fire reported that once ignited, flames spread across the foam at approximately one foot per second.|$|E
500|$|While at the show, {{they met}} Quinn again, and, {{a few days}} later, {{set up a meeting}} with him to obtain a <b>sales</b> <b>order.</b> In order to gain {{approval}} from the Sporting Goods department, Quinn suggested Atari demonstrate the game to executives in Chicago. Alcorn and Lipkin traveled to the Sears Tower and, despite a technical complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as the game, obtained approval. Bushnell told Quinn he could produce 75,000units in time for the Christmas season; however, Quinn requested double the amount. Though Bushnell knew Atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150,000units, he agreed. Atari acquired a new factory through funding obtained by venture capitalist Don Valentine. Supervised by Jimm Tubb, the factory fulfilled the Sears order. The first units manufactured were branded with Sears' [...] "Tele-Games" [...] name. Atari later released a version under its own brand in 1976.|$|E

2500|$|Tommy and Richard {{are denied}} {{entry to the}} Zalinsky {{boardroom}} since Tommy {{does not have any}} standing (his shares having been repossessed due to the apparent failure). After briefly wallowing on the curb in self-pity, Michelle arrives with Paul and Beverly's police records. Tommy devises 'a plan': dressed as a suicide bomber by using road flares, he gains the attention of a live television news crew and then, with Michelle and Richard, forces his way into the boardroom. Back in Sandusky, Callahan workers watch the drama on a television. In a final move of pure persuasion, Tommy quotes Zalinsky's own advertising slogan, that he {{is on the side of}} the [...] "American working man." [...] As the TV audience watches, Zalinsky signs Tommy's purchase order for 500,000 brake pads. Although Zalinsky says that the purchase order is meaningless since he will soon own Callahan Auto, Michelle reveals the police records, which include Paul's outstanding warrants for fraud. Since Paul is the true husband of Beverly, her marriage to Big Tom was bigamous and therefore illegitimate. Therefore, Beverly's inheritance is voided and Tommy is the next of kin, and thus the rightful heir of Big Tom. Since Tommy refuses to sell the shares, the deal with Zalinsky is off, and since Tommy still holds Zalinsky's purchase order, the company is saved. Paul attempts to escape but is arrested. Zalinsky admits that Tommy outplayed him and honors the large <b>sales</b> <b>order.</b> Later, Tommy assumes the presidency of Callahan Auto Parts, giving a speech to the employees that the door is always open to them. The film ends with Tommy drifting in his dinghy on a lake, telling his father's spirit he will continue his legacy at Callahan and says he must go ashore to have dinner with Michelle's family.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> is an {{internal}} document of the company, meaning it {{is generated by}} the company itself. A <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> should record the customer's originating purchase order which is an external document. Rather than using the customer's purchase order document, {{an internal}} <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> form allows the internal audit control of completeness to be monitored as a sequential <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> number {{can be used by}} the company for its <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> documents. The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the <b>sales</b> <b>order.</b> A <b>sales</b> <b>order,</b> being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> can be converted into a work order to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.|$|E

50|$|In {{business}} or commerce, an order is a stated intention, either spoken or written, {{to engage in}} a commercial transaction for specific products or services.

From a seller's point of view it expresses the intention to sell and is referred to as a <b>sales</b> <b>order.</b> When the purchase order of the buyer and the <b>sales</b> <b>order</b> of the seller agree, the orders become a contract between the buyer and seller.|$|E

Consider if we change the code 45 another meaning to [...] "Sales to Free Membership Individuals".
