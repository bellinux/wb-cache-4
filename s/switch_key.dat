40|$|In {{concurrent}} schedules {{of reinforcement}} relative response allocation or time allocation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} preference. In the present study response allocation to a <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> was developed as an alternative measure of preference for concurrently available food key stimuli. In experiment 1 the switching response was placed on a variable interval schedule of 30 seconds and proved to be a more sensitive measure of preference than food key responding. Experiment 2 investigated the effect of systematically varying the food <b>key</b> and <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> schedules; results were inconclusive, but switching performance remained the more sensitive measure of preference. In experiment 3 preferences for components of a multiple food key schedule were investigated but the <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> performance was at best only an ordinal indicator of preference. In experiment 4 <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> performance was more sensitive to reinforcement duration than was food key performance. The concluding experiment investigated switching performance as an indicator of preference for small frequent rewards versus large delayed rewards. The subjects' preferences for small frequent reward were modified by rewarding switching into large delayed food schedules and by punishing switching into small frequent food schedules.

40|$|This study {{addressed}} the question: Can novel social behavior arise {{even though the}} organism has had no explicit training in that particular social pattern? Seven pigeons were trained individually to peck keys for brief access to food. Four of these birds were also trained to peck two “switching keys” which, at first, raised or lowered the requirements on their own food <b>keys.</b> Later, these <b>switching</b> <b>keys</b> no longer affected an animal's own requirements, but raised or lowered the requirements imposed on a second pigeon working concurrently for food in an adjacent chamber. The second animal was trained only on the food key. In each such pair, the pigeon trained on the <b>switching</b> <b>keys</b> reliably pecked whichever one raised its partner's schedule-requirements. This novel pattern of behavior did not directly benefit the first bird, arose spontaneously as a recombination of previously established nonsocial repertoires, {{and seemed to be}} maintained entirely by its effects on the animal in the adjacent chamber...|$|R

30|$|The common {{distributed}} video coding (DVC) systems treat input video frames {{group by}} group. In {{each group of}} pictures (GOP), usually the first frame, called key frame, is intra-coded {{and the others are}} Wyner-Ziv (WZ)-coded. This GOP coding structure presents a fixed and inefficient coding mode <b>switch</b> (<b>key</b> or WZ) at group boundaries, thus preventing a DVC system from adapting the rate-distortion (R-D) performance to varying video content. In this work, a structure of temporal group of blocks (TGOB) with dynamic coding mode (key/WZ) decision is presented. This dynamic TGOB coding architecture determines each image block to be a key block or a WZ block based on spatiotemporal image analysis, resulting in a mode switch of fine granularity in both the spatial and temporal domains. As a consequence, not only the overall coding efficiency is improved, but also the temporal flickering artifacts for the reconstructed video are reduced substantially. Experimental results show that our proposed DVC scheme with block mode decision achieves up to 2.85 dB of quality gain and also up to 51 % of temporal flickering reduction, compared to the well-known DISCOVER system.|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide {{sequences}} called Chi (5 '-GCTGGTGG- 3 ') enhance {{homologous recombination}} near their location by the RecBCD enzyme in Escherichia coli (Chi activation). A partial inhibition of Chi activation measured in A redgam mutant crosses was observed after treatment of wild-type cells with DNA-damaging agents including UV, mitomycin, and nalidixic acid. Inhibition of Chi activation was not {{accompanied by an}} overall decrease of recombination. A IexA 3 mutation which blocks induction of the SOS system prevented the inhibition of Chi activation, indicating that an SOS function could {{be responsible for the}} inhibition. Overproduction of the RecD subunit of the RecBCD enzyme from a multicopy plasmid carrying the recD gene prevented the induced inhibition of Chi activation, whereas overproduction of RecB or RecC subunits did not. It is proposed that in SOS-induced cells the RecBCD enzyme is modified into a Chi-independent recombination enzyme, with the RecD subunit being the regulatory <b>switch</b> <b>key.</b> The major pathway of homologous recombination in Esch-erichia coli relies on the RecA protein and the RecBCD enzyme (for reviews, see references 8 and 24).

40|$|Only {{one of two}} keys {{reinforces}} the subject with food. This key can assume one of two colors, each associated with a different fixed-ratio schedule for obtaining reinforcement. The function of the second key is to permit the animal to switch from the long schedule to the short schedule. If {{the difference between the}} ratio schedules is large enough, a preference for the shorter schedule is demonstrable. A quantitative index of preference is obtained as follows: each time the animal switches to the shorter schedule, the number of pecks required to produce the next switch is increased. As the “ante” on the <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> increases, the effective difference between the two ratio schedules decreases. After each food reinforcement, when the bird is exposed to the choice-situation, it takes longer before the bird switches again. This is used to “titrate” the bird's preference. If it does not switch within x sec, the progressively increasing ratio schedule of the <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> is decreased. A specific value, in terms of a rather specific number of responses the bird settles at on the choice key, is obtained. This equilibrium is employed as a dependent variable.

40|$|During the {{extinction}} {{component of a}} multiple variable-interval extinction schedule, four pigeons learned to peck a second <b>key</b> that <b>switched</b> off the keylights. Two experiments attempted to isolate the events that control this behavior. In the first experiment, switching into blackout was equally maintained when switches were restricted to the first minute as when they were restricted to the last minute of {{the extinction}} component. When switches could be emitted {{in the first and}} last minutes, they occurred more frequently in the first. Restricting switching to the first minute of each component and eliminating the blackout between components had no effect on switching. In the second experiment, when the stimulus correlated with extinction was omitted, switching decreased slightly. Omission of both multiple schedule stimuli decreased the switching rate, but switching was still maintained. Food reinforcement was then omitted and switching by two birds increased. Switching ceased when blackout was no longer the consequence of pecking the <b>switching</b> <b>key.</b> It was concluded that switching was not controlled by the similarity of the blackouts produced by the <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> and those that occurred between components; nor was it maintained by the temporal proximity of switching responses to the onset of the reinforced component.
