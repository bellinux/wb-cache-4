(Confusingly there {{appear to have been}} two men called Gerard of Cremona, both translators of Arabic texts into Latin.

The encyclopaedic content, <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement,</b> and combination of Galen's medicine with Aristotle's science and philosophy helped the Canon enter European scholastic medicine. Medical scholars started to use the Canon in the 13th century, while university courses implemented the text from the 14th century onwards. The Canons influence declined in the 16th century as a result of humanists' preference in medicine for ancient Greek and Roman authorities over Arabic authorities, although others defended Avicenna's innovations beyond the original classical texts. It fell out of favour in university syllabi, although it was still being taught as background literature as late as 1715 in Padua.|$|E

2500|$|As to the radula of this species, it is a {{very small}} and rather obscure object, and only by teasing it to pieces, I could get an idea of the shape of the teeth. The uncini quite cover the median rows, and cross even the uncini of the {{opposite}} side. The rhachidian or median tooth has a subquadrate basal part, with rounded, convex posterior and less convex lateral margins. It has a broad, triangular cusp, with one small median denticle and about 6 smaller ones on each side. The laterals one on each side, have a transversely triangular shape, with an unarmed, arched upper and concave proximal and basal margin, with blunt points at the proximal and distal extremities of the basal margin. On each side I see at least 3, but I suppose there are 4 uncini which are long, slender and strongly curved. Though this radula has some resemblance with that of Aporrhais, like Verrill (Mollusca of the New England coast. Transact. Connecticut Acad, of arts and sciences, Vol. VI, May 1884, p. 1S6 and 188) has stated, and like his figure (I.e. pi. 31, fig. 14b) affirms, I cannot agree without doubt with his view that it should be taenioglossate, as the [...] "Siboga"-specimen has a radula with at least 9 rows of teeth and probably 11. The nacreous character of the shell agrees with the Rhipidoglossa, and so does the larger number of uncini. I should think the genus will belong to the Rhipidoglossa with a restricted number of teeth, such as Basilissa.

Without going into the controversial question of socialized medicine, it is clear that health is a national asset, and the undisputed judgment of the people is that it is worth conserving, more or less regardless of whether it can be done on purely commercial principles. JM Clark, 1950 (1) One might assume that the foregoing quotation is from recent debates on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) (2); however, it actually appeared in an article written more than 60 years ago. The author, an economist, was articulating his perspective on the effect of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and the influences of Keynesian economics. His remarks illustrate that issues related to health care reform — now the PPACA — are long-standing. Discussions of health care reform have been a major part of American public discourse in nearly every decade since President Theodore Roosevelt’s 1912 platform for re-election included a proposal for universal health insurance (3).

It should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine distinct species of finches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the contrary, brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder.

40|$|Proseriata is {{a diverse}} and species-rich taxon of Neoophora (Platyhelminthes). The group {{is divided into}} two morphologically {{well-characterised}} taxa: Lithophora and Unguiphora. Previous molecular analyses, aimed at ascertaining in-group relationships of the Proseriata, were equivocal in supporting the monophyly of the Lithophora, and of one of its families, the Coelogynoporidae. Here we present a new phylogeny of the Proseriata, based on complete ssrDNA and partial (D 1 -D 6) lsrDNA. The analysis includes 36 proseriate species. 13 new sequences from seven species are used, four of which from species of the Coelogynoporidae and one from a new species of the recently established family Calviriidae. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Bayesian Inference (BI), maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP). Clades were considered to have high nodal support if BI posterior probability and ML and MP bootstrap percentages were > 90 %. The resulting cladogram strongly supports the monophyly of the Lithophora. In addition, the monophyly of the Coelogynoporidae and their inclusion in the Lithophora are corroborated. Within the Lithophora, two sister clades are supported, including Coelogynoporidae+Calviriidae, and Otoplanidae+Archimonocelididae+Monocelididae respectively. In the Coelogynoporidae, there was a poor correspondence between estimates of phylogeny and the monophyly of genera, suggesting the family is in need of systematic revision. Current morphology-based <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangements</b> of Otoplanidae and Monocelididae are not supported by molecular results.
