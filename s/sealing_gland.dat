40|$|Extracellular matrix (ECM) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the maintenance of mammary epithelial differentiation in culture. We asked whether changes in mouse mammary specific function in vivo correlate with changes in the ECM. We showed, using expression of beta-casein as a marker, that the temporal expression of ECM-degrading proteinases and their inhibitors during lactation and involution are inversely related to functional differentiation. After a lactation period of 9 d, mammary epithelial cells maintained beta-casein expression up to 5 d of involution. Two metalloproteinases, 72 -kD gelatinase (and its 62 -kD active form), and stromelysin, and a serine proteinase tissue plasminogen activator were detected by day four of involution, and maintained expression until at least day 10. The expression of their inhibitors, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, preceded the onset of ECM-degrading proteinase expression and was detected by day two of involution, and showed a sharp peak of expression centered on days 4 - 6 of involution. When involution was accelerated by decreasing lactation to 2 d, there was an accelerated loss of beta-casein expression evident by day four and a shift in expression of ECM-remodeling proteinases and inhibitors to a focus at 2 - 4 d of involution. To further extend the correlation between mammary-specific function and ECM remodeling we initiated involution by <b>sealing</b> just one <b>gland</b> in an otherwise hormonally sufficient lactating animal. Alveoli in the <b>sealed</b> <b>gland</b> contained casein for at least 7 d after sealing, and closely resembled those in a lactating gland. The relative expression of TIMP in the <b>sealed</b> <b>gland</b> increased, whereas the expression of stromelysin was much lower than that of a hormone-depleted involuting gland, indicating that the higher the ratio of TIMP to ECM-degrading proteinases the slower the process of involution. To test directly the functional role of ECM-degrading proteinases in the loss of tissue-specific function we artificially perturbed the ECM-degrading proteinase-inhibitor ratio in a normally involuting gland by maintaining high concentrations of TIMP protein with the use of surgically implanted slow-release pellets. In a concentration-dependent fashion, involuting mammary glands that received TIMP implants maintained high levels of casein and delayed alveolar regression. These data suggest that the balance of ECM- degrading proteinases and their inhibitors regulates the organization of the basement membrane and the tissue-specific function of the mammary gland.

40|$|TutorialMechanical seals are {{the most}} common means of sealing {{industrial}} centrifugal pumps. There are a wide variety of seal options including the use of single or dual seal arrangements. While dual seals provide benefits in leakage containment and monitoring, single seals continue to be widely used due to their lower cost and simpler designs. Newer piping plans however offer options to increase leakage detectability and containment in single seals without sacrificing the simplicity of the seal design. A Plan 65 piping plan was introduced in API 682 Third Edition and ISO 21049. This captured leakage detection practices which were currently in use in the pipeline industry. The upcoming Fourth Edition of API 682 changes the designation of this plan to Plan 65 A and adds an alternative version designated as Plan 65 B. In addition, the Fourth Edition of API 682 will introduce Plan 66 A and 66 B which provide additional alternatives for monitoring and containing seal leakage in the <b>seal</b> <b>gland.</b> The selection of piping plans in any seal application depends not only on the application conditions but also on the expectations of the end user.

5000|$|The {{change of}} air cooling to liquid cooling {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} World War II when the US military needed reliable vehicles. The subject of boiling engines was addressed, researched, and a solution found. Previous radiators and engine blocks were properly designed and survived durability tests, but used water pumps with a leaky graphite-lubricated [...] "rope" [...] <b>seal</b> (<b>gland)</b> on the pump shaft. The seal was inherited from steam engines, where water loss is accepted, since steam engines already expend large volumes of water. Because the pump seal leaked mainly when the pump was running and the engine was hot, the water loss evaporated inconspicuously, leaving at best a small rusty trace when the engine stopped and cooled, thereby not revealing significant water loss. Automobile radiators (or heat exchangers) have an outlet that feeds cooled water to the engine and the engine has an outlet that feeds heated water {{to the top of the}} radiator. Water circulation is aided by a rotary pump that has only a slight effect, having to work over such a wide range of speeds that its impeller has only a minimal effect as a pump. While running, the leaking pump seal drained cooling water to a level where the pump could no longer return water to the top of the radiator, so water circulation ceased and water in the engine boiled. However, since water loss led to overheat and further water loss from boil-over, the original water loss was hidden.|$|R

40|$|<b>Gland</b> <b>sealing</b> {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 ’s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform packing compression to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of <b>gland</b> <b>sealing</b> and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry pump <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> to cause wear of the sacrificial shaft sleeve. Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the shaft sleeve. The wear of the shaft sleeve was normalised by travel distance and gland follower load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the shaft sleeve and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the shaft sleeve SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mammary gland}} {{undergoes}} a sophisticated programme of developmental changes during pregnancy/lactation. However, {{little is known}} about processes involving initiation of apoptosis at involution following weaning. We used fur seals as models to study the molecular process of involution as these animals display a unique mammary <b>gland</b> phenotype. Fur <b>seals</b> have long lactation periods whereby mothers cycle between secreting copious quantities of milk for 2 to 3 days suckling pups on land, with trips to sea alone to forage for up to 23 days during which time mammary glands remain active without initiating apoptosis/involution. Results We show the molecular basis by which alpha-lactalbumin (LALBA), a secreted milk protein, is absent in Cape fur seals and demonstrate an apoptotic function for LALBA when exposed to mammary cells. Conclusion We propose that apoptosis does not occur in fur <b>seal</b> mammary <b>glands</b> due to lack of LALBA in fur seal milk, allowing evasion of involution during a foraging trip. Our work identifies LALBA as a milk factor that feeds back on the mammary gland to regulate involution. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pressure-energized {{seal rings}} {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized seal rings have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to seal rings used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized seal ring generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} seal ring tighter against the <b>gland</b> and body <b>sealing</b> surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the seal ring is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the seal ring so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative seal rings according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional seal ring to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the seal ring directly against the both <b>gland</b> and body <b>sealing</b> surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the seal ring against a <b>gland</b> <b>sealing</b> surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the seal ring into a smaller volume bounded by the <b>gland</b> and body <b>sealing</b> surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the seal ring more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the seal ring, the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the <b>seal</b> <b>gland.</b> These extensions would help to restrain the seal ring against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the sealing ring in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the seal ring when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal seal rings may be preferred. The bottom part of Figure 2 shows one example of an alternative gland configuration with an all-metal seal ring...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a <b>seal</b> <b>gland,</b> which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|R

The other end of the cantilever structure connects at a bendable area to one end of an outer cylindrical wall. The opposite end of cylindrical wall terminates in a thickened portion, the radially outer surface of which is adapted to accommodate a tool for rotating the gland. The terminal end of cylindrical wall also includes an abutment surface, which is adapted to engage a seal, which in turn engages a surface of a receiver. The receiver further includes a threaded portion for engagement with the threaded portion of gland whereby a tightening rotation of gland relative to receiver will cause relative movement between cylindrical walls and of gland. This movement causes a rotation of the conical structure and thus a bending action at bending area and at the bending end of the upper end of inner cylindrical wall. These rotational and bending actions result in a forcing of the deformable portion radially inwardly so as to contact and deform a pipe. This forcible contact creates a <b>seal</b> between <b>gland</b> and pipe, and simultaneously clamps the pipe in position...|$|R
50|$|By 1925 the {{vertical}} {{arrangement of the}} engine had been taken advantage of to improve steam porting and access for maintenance. The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end of}} the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the crosshead trunk guide, was enclosed and provided with oil splash lubrication. A small plenum was left exposed between the cylinder's piston rod stuffing box and another <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> into the crankcase. This allowed any steam that did leak past the seals to be vented to the atmosphere, rather than condensing within the crankcase.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{colostrum}} {{trypsin inhibitor}} (CTI) gene and transcript were cloned from the Cape fur <b>seal</b> mammary <b>gland</b> and CTI identified by in silico {{analysis of the}} Pacific walrus and polar bear genomes (Order Carnivora), and in marine and terrestrial mammals of the Orders Cetartiodactyla (yak, whales, camel) and Perissodactyla (white rhinoceros). Unexpectedly, Weddell seal CTI was predicted to be a pseudogene. Cape fur seal CTI was expressed in the mammary gland of a pregnant multiparous seal, {{but not in a}} seal in its first pregnancy. While bovine CTI is expressed for 24 – 48 h postpartum (pp) and secreted in colostrum only, Cape fur seal CTI was detected for at least 2 – 3 months pp while the mother was suckling its young on-shore. Furthermore, CTI was expressed in the mammary gland of only one of the lactating seals that was foraging at-sea. The expression of β-casein (CSN 2) and β-lactoglobulin II (LGB 2), but not CTI in the second lactating seal foraging at-sea suggested that CTI may be intermittently expressed during lactation. Cape fur seal and walrus CTI encode putative small, secreted, N-glycosylated proteins with a single Kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) domain indicative of serine protease inhibition. Mature Cape fur seal CTI shares 92 % sequence identity with Pacific walrus CTI, but only 35 % identity with BPTI. Structural homology modelling of Cape fur seal CTI and Pacific walrus trypsin based on the model of the second Kunitz domain of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and porcine trypsin (Protein Data Bank: 1 TFX) confirmed that CTI inhibits trypsin in a canonical fashion. Therefore, pinniped CTI may be critical for preventing the proteolytic degradation of immunoglobulins that are passively transferred from mother to young via colostrum and milk...|$|R
40|$|Mammary glands are physiologically {{active in}} female mammals only during nursing. Immediately after weaning, most lactation-related genes are downregulated and milk {{production}} ceases. In our previous study, we have detected an inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir) 2. 1 -like current in mammary secretory (MS) cells freshly isolated from lactating mice. This current is highly sensitive to external Ba 2 +. The potassium permeability of the Kir channels {{may contribute to}} the secretion and/or preservation of ions in milk. We hypothesized that the functions of the Kir channels in MS cells are regulated after weaning. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of forced weaning on the Ba 2 +-sensitive Kir current and Kir 2. 1 expression in the mouse mammary glands. Twenty-four hours after weaning, the lumina of mammary acini were histologically enlarged by milk accumulation. The whole-cell patch-clamp analyses showed that the Ba 2 +-sensitive Kir current in the post-weaning MS cells was smaller than in the lactating MS cells. The inward conductances of the current in the lactating and post-weaning cells were 4. 25 ± 0. 77 and 0. 93 ± 0. 34 nS, respectively. Furthermore, real-time PCR and Western blot analyses showed that Kir 2. 1 mRNA and protein expression decreased in the post-weaning mammary gland (mRNA, 90 % reduction; protein, 47 % reduction). Moreover, the local milk accumulation caused by teat sealing decreased Kir conductance in MS cells (2. 74 ± 0. 45 and 0. 36 ± 0. 27 nS for control and <b>sealed</b> mammary <b>glands,</b> respectively). This was concomitant with the reduction in the Kir 2. 1 mRNA expression. Our results suggest that milk stasis after weaning immediately decreases the Kir conductance in MS cells. This decrease in the Kir conductance may be partly caused by the reduction in the Kir 2. 1 mRNA and protein expression. These alterations during the post-weaning period may be involved in the cessation of ion secretion and/or preservation in the milk...|$|R
