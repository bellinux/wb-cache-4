5000|$|Purdue Crew Women's Team was {{established}} in 1979. An article written in Purdue's Exponent titled Women shove off on new challenge describes {{the beginning of the}} Women's program. [...] "When they first showed up we thought they were there to be coxswains, but they wanted to row." [...] That was the comment made by Kevin Sauer, president of the Purdue Crew Club, when asked about the reaction when four women showed up at the crew club callout last fall. [...] "They sort of laughed at us at first," [...] said Jan Pahl, one of the four. Because of their size the women couldn't row next to the men, but they still wanted to handle the oars. With the help of Jack Young from the alumni association, the women's crew was created. Now {{as a part of the}} Purdue Crew Club, they are practicing daily on the Wabash. The initial 50 at the callout have been trimmed to 25 women who practice regularly under the coaching of Chris Polhemus, John North and Kevin Sauer from the men's varsity team. There is one drawback to the practices, though. Because of limited funding - $3000 a year for men and women combined - both teams must share boats. The men's club practices in the afternoon, making use of all the equipment at that time. So every morning, at 6:30, the women's team starts practice. What do they think about while pulling the 12-foot-one-inch long oars? [...] "Going back to bed," [...] said one woman. [...] "Making the dock on the last run," [...] said another. According to the women, falling in the water is the most unpleasant aspect of rowing. For the past month, morning temperatures have been in the low 40's or high 30's. When pushing off from the dock in the capsizable one-or-two-individual shells, they have learned to be careful. Once on the river, the early rise and hard work seem worth it all. [...] "It's so pretty once you get out there," [...] remarks Kathy Brady. The women's feeling of self-satisfaction is also a compensating factor. [...] "It feels so good at the end of practice when you head for the dock and know that you've done it," [...] one member said.Public reaction has been one of surprise. A myth exists that the exercises, weight lifting, running and of course rowing, would turn the women into muscular hulks. On the contrary, the exercises are designed to tone the muscles much like a swimmer's long muscles. None of the women have confirmed the myth by turning into amazons.The newly-formed team hasn't yet participated in any intercollegiate meets, but starting next spring the women will compete everywhere the men's crew does. For the present they are concentrating on achieving form. Varsity crew member and women's Coach Sauer said, [...] "One thing the girls have in their favor is that they have good balance and coordination in the boats." [...] Such qualities can make the difference between winning and losing. Eventually the women's crew may become a [...] "separate but equal" [...] counterpart to the men's. The reason is that the women don't think the coaches should have to come to practice at 6:30 in the morning in addition to practicing with the men's team in the afternoon. The main impetus for sharing facilities with the men is financial. A used shell costs $3,000, the same amount the men and women's crew together are budgeted each year. As a <b>supplementary</b> <b>measure,</b> the women's team has had a bake sale. In an effort to raise more funds, the crew club is sponsoring a dance this weekend. But the women cannot operate on an independent basis immediately. The two teams co-exist in harmony. The women are in no way pampered as they were warned in the beginning. Their efforts are the proof of their success this season. Harvey Gerry, Staff Writer; As printed in the Purdue Exponent Thursday, November 11, 1974 ...|$|E

This study utilizes a CGE model to simulate and analyze the economic impacts of the draft Energy Tax Bill and its complementary fiscal measures. Under the assumption of tax revenue neutrality, the use of energy tax revenue generated for the purpose of reducing income tax is the best choice with double dividend effects since it will effectively stimulate domestic consumption and investment, and, consequently, mitigate the negative impacts of the distortionary tax regime. The double dividend effect is less significant, however, when the <b>supplementary</b> <b>measures</b> being used are for government expenditure.

Methods EORTC quality of life (QOL) translation guidelines were followed to create a Japanese version of the EORTC QLQ-HCC 18. This was then administered to 192 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma along with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and FACT-Hep questionnaires. Tests for reliability and validity were conducted including comparison of scores between the EORTC and FACT questionnaire and detailed assessment of the new scales and items in clinically distinct groups of patients. Results Multi-trait scaling analysis confirmed three putative scales in the QLQ-HCC 18, fatigue, fever and nutrition. Cronbach’s alpha for these scales were between 0. 68 and 0. 78. The QLQ-HCC 18 scales correlated with scales measuring similar items in the FACT-Hep and the questionnaire was stable over time with an intra-class correlation score of 0. 70 for almost all scales. The questionnaire {{had the ability to}} distinguish between patients with different Karnofsky Performance Status, and Child-Pugh liver function class.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the gender differences}} in driving and visual behaviour observed under a high mental workload. The impacts of performing a set of in-vehicle auditory tasks on the behaviour of 34 drivers were studied in an on-road experiment using an instrumented vehicle. The results show that female participants tended to drive more attentively in baseline driving than males, {{but they were also}} more affected by the higher workload. The latter effect was identified by an increase in steering wheel adjustments and a slightly lower auditory task performance. Females adopted a more conservative coping strategy to compensate for the higher workload, as identified by increased headways and more stable lateral control. By contrast, male drivers {{did not appear to be}} affected in the same way, but their eye movements revealed significant gaze concentration and less mirror-checking. This suggests that male drivers may be less aware of the impact of mental distractions on their driving performance and visual behaviour, and adopt a simplification strategy to cope with the extra workload. These gender differences in behaviours and coping strategies can be explained only through a combination of traditional measurements and drivers' eye movements, which provide a <b>supplementary</b> <b>measure</b> for understanding driving behaviour. Increased understandings of such gender differences may have significant implications for the design and safe operation of future in-vehicle technologie...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{renal disease}} is {{prevalent}} in approx. 13 % of the population. It {{is accompanied by}} renal function decline which can render patients dependent on dialysis or renal transplantation. Furthermore, chronic renal disease is associated with cardiovascular disease, in particular hypertension and proteinuria. Hypertension and proteinuria are maintained by over-activation of the RAAS hormone system (Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System) and by excess retention of sodium chloride. Key elements of current treatment are reduction of proteinuria and hypertension by RAAS blocking medication, i. e., ACEi (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors) or ARB (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers). Unfortunately this treatment is often insufficiently effective. In this thesis we investigated whether standard treatment can be improved by correcting sodium retention with dietary sodium restriction, and sodium-reducing medication (diuretics), and/or by intensified RAAS blockade. We found that dietary sodium restriction, with or without diuretics, highly improves the effects of standard treatment with ACEi or ARB. Combining sodium restriction (and diuretics) with ACEi or ARB better reduces proteinuria and hypertension, and lowers markers of injury, scarring, or a possible lack of oxygen in the kidneys. Combining ACEi with ARB (dual RAAS blockade) is less effective than sodium restriction, but may be a <b>supplementary</b> <b>measure</b> in some patients. Our research shows that a relatively modest reduction in sodium intake allows considerable health gains.

Recently, a <b>supplementary</b> <b>measure,</b> transplantation of submerged macrophytes after fish removal, has been applied to restore warm Chinese shallow lakes in order to compensate for the expected lack of increasing grazing control of phytoplankton after the biomanipulation. These measures have successfully shifted turbid warm lakes to a clear water state, but {{little is known about the}} responses to restoration of key physico-chemical variables. We analyzed the seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations in two subtropical and one tropical biomanipulated shallow Chinese lakes subjected to restoration. In all three lakes, a marked decline occurred in the concentrations of lake total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), and chlorophyll a (Chl a), while the transparency (SD:WD ratio, Secchi depth to water depth ratio) increased. A clear water state was established, lasting so far for 7 to 23 months, and TN, TP, Chl a, and TSS levels in the three restored lakes decreased to, on average, 49 %, 58 %, 41 %, and 18 % of the level prior to restoration and/or the level in a reference lake, respectively, while the annual mean SD:WD ratio exhibited a 1. 5 – 4 fold increase.

METHOD: Data from three nationwide surveys on drinking habits carried out among a random sample of all Icelanders, men and women, 20 - 69 years old, are analyzed. A questionnaire was mailed to the prospective respondents and in 1988 the response rate was 75. 1 %, in 1989 it was 73. 3 % and in 1992 it was 74. 7 %. RESULTS: Total alcohol consumption peaked the year after strong beer was introduced, but leveled off in the following years as the novelty of the new beverage faded away and real income declined. A shift in beverage preference towards beer took place as soon as it became available. The survey data indicate that almost all sociodemographic groups are moving from the traditional distilled spirits to weaker beverages, beer in particular. The groups contributing most to the current preference for lighter beverages are those living in the capital area, women, individuals aged 30 - 49 years, people in the academic professions and management, and men belonging to the service professions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest some important conclusions regarding alcohol policy. The collective behavior of drinkers documented in this study supports the view that the general population is an important target group for alcohol policy measures.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the nineties the high rate of absenteeism and the rising number of employees drawing disablement benefits prompted the Dutch government to review the financial arrangements around incapacity for work. The present cabinet is aiming to reshape the measures and provisions in the context of disablement and inability to work so that both employers and employees become more aware of the necessity of reducing the demand on social security provisions for persons on extended sick leave or with a long-term incapacity for work.

Especially small businesses are reluctant to employ staff with a disability because they fear absenteeism and higher costs. Special training for managers, personnel department and company doctors must contribute to more successful reintegration...|$|R
40|$|Describes three related {{investigations}} into {{differences between the}} official ASHE <b>measure</b> and <b>supplementary</b> LFS <b>measure.</b> The UK uses two major surveys to produce low pay estimates; the official ASHE <b>measure</b> and <b>supplementary</b> LFS <b>measure.</b> The differences between these measures have been accepted as a consequenceof the different survey methods and purposes. This article describes three related {{investigations into}} these differences. The first shows how the timing of measurement is important and suggests evidence of non-compliance. The second examines the perceived inaccuracy ofresponses in household surveys and how this affects LFS low pay estimates. The third shows that the measure of hourly rate used can explain much {{of the difference between}} the estimates. This work supports the current methods for generating low pay estimates and highlights the need for an awareness of these background issues when interpreting the estimates.
