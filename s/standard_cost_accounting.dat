For example, a policy {{decision}} to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's performance evaluation.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on the deployment of cost techniques in early public sector organizations largely relies on archival evidence gathered from late eighteenth and nineteenth-century settings. Arguably, these contexts are characterized {{by a number of}} idiosyncratic characteristics that advise caution in generalizing conclusions beyond the institutional elements that forged those settings. Our investigation examines the case of the Royal Textile Mill of Guadalajara (RTM), a setting characterized by state ownership, competitive markets, organization of production around medieval guilds, and recruitment of foreign experts to conduct productive operations. Our findings show that the management of RTM deployed <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> techniques that comprised aspects such as control of raw materials and waste, control of labour and management, and allocations of overhead to product costing.

However, GPK is not exclusive to highly complex organizations; GPK is also applied to less complex businesses.|$|R

The calculation is based on the aggregates in the loss and profit account. Consequently, it does not suit to analysis. The productivity model Saari is purely based on variance accounting known from the <b>standard</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting.</b> The variance accounting is applied to elementary variables, that is, to quantities and prices of different products and inputs. Variance accounting gives the user most possibilities for analysis. The model of Gollop is a mixed model by its calculation technique.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{critique}} of early US <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> practice, Hoskin and Macve (1996) conclude that Lawrence Manufacturing Company's 1848 <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> reports were purely mercantile and provided no managerial utility. Despite finding mathematically exact allocations and unit costs for different cloth grades and production locations, Hoskin and Macve argue that mill accounting was neither modern nor managerial, descriptors they {{limit to the}} exercise of disciplinary control over labour through <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> and variances. They conclude that scholars have overstated the managerial utility of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> {{during the first half}} of the nineteenth century. In rebuttal, this paper garners archival evidence to show that <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> was used by early nineteenth-century US textile owner/managers in a variety of decision-making, management control and problem-solving scenarios. Specific attention was directed to evidence in forms other than accounting ledgers and summary statements, i. e. letters, memoranda, cost reports, etc., which might reveal if and how accounting was used to address issues such as make-or-buy, product pricing, wage setting, site selection and asset expansion and acquisition. While the absence of <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> and variances affirms Hoskin and Macve's narrow interpretation of managerialism, evidence presented refutes their wider, more substantive claim that <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> served only mercantile purposes at the US mills.

50|$|Single-factor {{productivity}} {{refers to}} the measurement of productivity that is a ratio of output and one input factor. A most well-known measure of single-factor productivity is the measure of output per work input, describing work productivity. Sometimes it is practical to employ the value added as output. Productivity measured {{in this way is}} called Value-added productivity. Also, productivity can be examined in cost accounting using Unit costs. Then it is mostly a question of exploiting data from <b>standard</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> for productivity measurements. Efficiency ratios, which tell something about the ratio between the value produced and the sacrifices made for it, are available in large numbers. Managerial control ratio systems are composed of single measures which are interpreted in parallel with other measures related to the subject.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{model the}} {{interaction}} of financial market transparency and different accounting regimes. This paper provides a theoretical rationale for the recently proposed shift in <b>accounting</b> <b>standards</b> from historic <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> to marking to market. The paper shows that marking to market can provide investors with an early warning mechanism while historical cost gives management a "veil" under which they can potentially mask a firm's true economic performance. The model provides new explanations for several empirical findings and has some novel implications. We show that greater opacity in financial markets leads to more frequent and more severe crashes in asset prices (under a historic-cost-accounting regime). Moreover, our model indicates that historic <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> can make the financial market more rather than less volatile, which runs counter to conventional wisdom. The mechanism shown in the model also sheds light on the cause of many financial scandals in recent years.
