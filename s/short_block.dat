500|$|Route 59, at [...] long, is the {{shortest}} state highway in New Jersey, United States. The route consists entirely of a <b>short</b> <b>block</b> of Lincoln Avenue from Union County Route 610 (known locally as South Avenue) in Cranford to New Jersey Route 28 (known locally as North Avenue) along the Cranford–Garwood border. The route functions as an underpass under the Raritan Valley Line of New Jersey Transit, under which it crosses about halfway down the block, along the municipal border. Route 59 was originally a proposed alignment of Route 22, {{which was supposed to}} head from an intersection with current day New Jersey Route 159 in Morris County at the Pine Brook Bridge before heading through several counties, terminating at an intersection with New Jersey Route 27 in Rahway. Most of the route was not constructed, and a portion in Garwood and Cranford was re-designated Route 59 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953.|$|E

40|$|Summary form only given. In this paper, {{we examine}} the effect of block size on the {{performance}} of trellis based quantization. In particular, the Viterbi and tailbiting BCJR algorithms are compared. It is shown that for <b>short</b> <b>blocks</b> of data, the T-BCJR algorithm achieves a superior performance over the Viterbi algorithm (VA). One approach is to use the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) heuristic and the T-BCJR algorithm. If the MAP-encoder does not produce a tailbiting state sequence, the path is modified for a number of stages {{at the beginning and end}} of the block such that it tailbites. The enclosed figure shows MSE as a function of block size and sample position, respectively, for a rate R= 1 bit per sample, 32 -state trellis quantizer and an IID Gaussian source. The effects of start-up are clearly visible. For the T-BCJR algorithm, the distortion is evenly distributed across the whole block. The performance decrease for <b>short</b> <b>blocks</b> stems from the increase in the number of tailbiting violations for <b>short</b> <b>blocks</b> and the suboptimal modification to ensure tailbiting. The results presented here hold for a large class of trellis constructions, such as TC...|$|R
