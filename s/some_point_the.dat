5|$|Although the United States Navy was {{prevented}} from developing fortifications on the Aleutian Islands {{due to the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed that at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> United States' treaty obligations would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases. In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility of establishing anchorages off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E

The Uí Briain interlopers, however, do not appear to have been well received; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen, perhaps led by supporters of Lǫgmaðr himself.|$|E
5|$|During the march, Amangkurat {{tried to}} gain the loyalty of the lords in the territories he passed through. Many were {{previously}} loyal to Kajoran, who sided with Trunajaya, or were wavering between the two sides. The presence of the king and his forces, {{as well as the}} possibly booty to be gained in the campaign, motivated them to declare allegiance to Amangkurat and join his forces.

5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot hound to Britain.

5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a post road {{in the years that}} followed. At <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> section of the highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a corduroy road, was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E
5|$|At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> Seljuks {{or their}} Arab allies lost al-Rahba, but in 1093 the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, Tutush {{captured}} {{it along with}} several other Upper Mesopotamian towns. Following his death, possession of al-Rahba reverted to the Uqaylids, but in 1096, Karbuqa of al-Hillah captured and looted the town. He held onto it until 1102 when Qaymaz, a former mamluk (slave soldier) of the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan, took control of it. Tutush's son Duqaq and the latter's deputy Tughtakin besieged the town, but failed to capture it. Qaymaz died in December 1102 and al-Rahba passed {{to one of his}} Turkish mamluks named Hasan, who dismissed many of Qaymaz's officers and arrested several of al-Rahba's notables due to suspicions of a coup against him. Duqaq renewed the siege, but this time was welcomed in by al-Rahba's townspeople, forcing Hasan to retreat into the citadel. Hasan surrendered after receiving guarantees of safe passage from Duqaq as well as an iqta (fief) elsewhere in Syria. According to the 12th-century chronicler Ibn al-Athir, al-Rahba's inhabitants were treated well by Duqaq, who reorganized the administration of the town, established a garrison there, and assigned to it a governor from the Banu Shayban tribe, Muhammad ibn Sabbak.|$|E

5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
5|$|Gofraid {{died in the}} Hebrides {{the year}} after his {{expulsion}} from Dublin. Whether this is evidence {{that he had been}} driven from Mann is uncertain. According to the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, Gofraid was succeeded in the Isles by his eldest son, Lagmann, who appears to have been forced to fend off factions supporting the claims of his younger brothers. At <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach, and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lagmann's younger brother, Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 1153), was old enough to assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lagmann faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lagmann by itself, it approached Muirchertach for assistance in placing Amlaíb mac Gofraid upon the throne. Muirchertach was certainly a formidable potential ally, having recently imposed his dominance over the kingdoms of Connacht, Leinster, Mide, and Dublin. In consequence of this predominance, the clause as stated by the chroniclethat Muirchertach was to provide the Isles with a regent from his own kinmay well have been a condition on his intervention, rather than a request of the Islesmen themselves. Whatever the case, the chronicle reveals that Muirchertach then installed Domnall upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E

5|$|The Waterworks River {{underwent}} considerable {{change over}} the years. In 1850, it left the channel of the Old River Lee much further to the north, to the south-west of Temple Mills railway depot. It was called Lead Mills Stream at this point. Near Temple Mills bridge, now on the A12 road, Channelsea River split off. The two channels ran parallel to the Old River Lee, before Channelsea River turned to the south-east. There was another small connection between the Old River Lee and the Waterworks River called Bully Fence, where the northern Channelsea River is shown on modern maps. By 1870, it was called Waterworks River {{as far north as}} Temple Mills depot, and by 1896, its present connection to the old river near to Carpenters Road had been established. Twenty years later, the northern Waterworks River rejoined the Lee at Bully Fence, and the section between there and Carpenters Road had been filled in. At <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> connection at Bully Fence became the main source for the Channelsea River, although the 1953/66 map still shows it connected to the remnants of the system to the north, for drainage. Administrative boundaries still follow the northern course of the Waterworks River.|$|E
