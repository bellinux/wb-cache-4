5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more <b>sustainable.</b> <b>Consumption</b> {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

This paper focuses {{on the role of}} regional government in <b>sustainable</b> production and <b>consumption</b> polices, one of the specific topics in the framework of the European Regional Sustainable Development Network activities.

The paper starts with a short overview of current (policy) thinking in the field of regional <b>sustainable</b> production and <b>consumption.</b> We then identify the theoretical and practical issues for both regional policy development and regional stakeholder involvement in the field of regional <b>sustainable</b> production and <b>consumption.</b> Finally, we explore examples of good practice in the development of regional public policy related to <b>sustainable</b> production and <b>consumption</b> patterns and identify some key messages for both the EU and the regions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} conceptual confusions of <b>sustainable</b> seafood <b>consumption,</b> practical challenges, {{and potential}} anchors from where this behaviour can be fostered. The main focus lies on psychological variables. The resulting framework comprises (1) {{a definition of}} <b>sustainable</b> seafood <b>consumption,</b> (2) suggestions for corresponding behaviours, (3) the identification of facilitating and hindering factors, (4) an assemblage of these factors into a theoretical model, and (5) a short discussion of how the model adds up value to {{the current state of}} the art in marine resource conservation. Behavioural models significantly contribute to behavioural change research. The originality and value of this research are that it tackles the so far relatively neglected field of <b>sustainable</b> seafood <b>consumption</b> as important part of sustainable development and marine conservation in the future. From an interventional perspective, the developed model facilitates the identification of contact points to approach consumers and disseminate <b>sustainable</b> seafood <b>consumption</b> among modern Western consumers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore consumers’ {{descriptions}} of <b>sustainable</b> food <b>consumption.</b> The concept of sustainability can be difficult to grasp, but is often defined in terms of three pillars; environment, society and economy. Prior research of <b>sustainable</b> food <b>consumption</b> have often focused on one of the pillars rather than all of them together in relation to consumers understandings of <b>sustainable</b> food <b>consumption.</b> Notwithstanding, previous research have mentioned that in order to fully comprehend sustainability it is essential to take all of the three pillars into consideration. Therefore, this study acknowledged this gap, as it focused on the three pillars of sustainability as a base, and further connected the three pillars to the four food concepts; organic, Fairtrade, sustainable diets and waste, in order to fully understand consumers descriptions of <b>sustainable</b> food <b>consumption.</b> The study was conducted using a qualitative approach, and the data was collected through semi-structured interviews with a sample of students and employees at Linnaeus University in Sweden. The interviewees gave varied and interesting answers, which later were analyzed in comparison to the theory on the subject. With the answers from the interviews it was concluded that environmental and social sustainability were prioritized to economic sustainability among participants. As the participants’ descriptions of <b>sustainable</b> food <b>consumption</b> was varied, and all of the four concepts in relation to three pillars were analyzed, a framework was developed in order to clarify how the consumers describe <b>sustainable</b> food <b>consumption.</b> The study also presents a number of implications for further research as well as managerial implications.   Keywords <b>Sustainable</b> food <b>consumption,</b> consumers description, three pillars of sustainability, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, social sustainability, organic, Fairtrade, sustainable diets, vegetarian, locally produced, waste reduction, food wast...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve <b>sustainable</b> <b>consumption,</b> two {{developments}} have to take place: it requires both {{an increase in the}} efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries. The first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak <b>sustainable</b> <b>consumption.</b> Here, technological improvements and eco-efficiency support a necessary reduction in resource consumption. Once this aim has been met, the second prerequisite, the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable. Strong <b>sustainable</b> <b>consumption</b> approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of well-being and assess the need for changes based on a risk-averse perspective.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} {{investigation was}} to gain an insight into and understanding of young women’s attitudes and behaviours towards <b>sustainable</b> fashion <b>consumption.</b> In doing so, the researcher sought to explore its potential through behavioural change amongst these young women. For {{the purpose of this}} study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with young female fashion consumers living in Germany during June 2013. The regional focus of the study was on the city of Münster and its surroundings. Research participants belonged to the age group of 20 - 26, whereas most of the interviewees were students with an average age of 24 years. Through a combination of purposive sampling and snowball sampling, a final sample size of ten research participants was achieved following the concept of theoretical saturation. Data analysis was based on thematic analysis through the application of the framework approach. Five core concepts with several overarching metathemes emerged from the research. First, respondents appeared to acknowledge unsustainable fashion consumption within our society while holding fashion retailers and the government responsible for increased levels of fashion consumption. Second, attitudes towards <b>sustainable</b> fashion <b>consumption</b> were multifaceted. However, a general market potential for the <b>consumption</b> of <b>sustainable</b> fashion was reflected in the respondents’ accounts. Third, several influencing factors on <b>sustainable</b> fashion <b>consumption</b> were identified amongst research participants, whereas promotional, social and emotional factors as well as the level of information provision and influence of celebrities seemed to be most relevant. Fourth, facilitating conditions of <b>sustainable</b> fashion <b>consumption</b> manifested themselves most strongly in terms of a general low availability and affordability of sustainable fashion. Finally, behaviours towards <b>sustainable</b> fashion <b>consumption</b> were mixed. While most interviewees showed relative sustainable behaviours during the use and postuse phases of the consumption process, the pre-purchase and purchase phases have room for improvements. Accordingly, it should be focused on these phases of the consumption process. Based on the research findings, a conceptual model for <b>sustainable</b> fashion <b>consumption</b> was proposed as a modification of Triandis’ Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (1977, cited in Jackson, 2005) ...|$|R
