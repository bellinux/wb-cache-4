50|$|A {{precursor}} to the soda pulping process was the paper making process developed by Matthias Koops in 1801 which involved washing wood shavings in limewater, adding soda crystals and then boiling the mixture. Soda pulping {{was one of the}} first chemical pulping methods and was invented in 1851 by Burgess (United States) and Watts (England). In France in 1852 Coupier and Mellier patented a soda process the patent of which preceded that of Watt and Burgess, which was filed in 1854. The first mill was started in 1866 in the USA. In 1865 they patented a method for recovery of the cooking liquors by incineration of the <b>spent</b> <b>liquor.</b> Many of the early soda mills converted to kraft mills once it was discovered.|$|E

The clean pulp (stock) can be bleached in the bleach plant or left unbleached, depending on the end use.

Recent developments in Chemrec's black liquor gasification process, adapting the technology to use in the sulfite pulping process, could make second generation biofuels production an alternative to the conventional recovery boiler technology.

There is a long-term worldwide effort to keep all chromium under control, ideally in a closed loop, since chromium, especially in its hexavalent form, has a negative impact on the environment and human health. The filtration cake obtained by hydrolysis contains a significant amount of chromium and, due to its alkaline character it could be used for the treatment of <b>spent</b> tanning <b>liquor.</b> The work demonstrates that total dechroming of <b>spent</b> tanning <b>liquor</b> is possible. The efficiency of the process depends on the weight ratio between chromium cake and <b>spent</b> tanning <b>liquor</b> and on the retention time. Using a ratio of 0. 3 and a retention time of 1 hour, the dechroming level achieved was 81. 6 %; for a ratio of 1, the dechroming reached up to 98. 3 %.

In this dissertation, the adsorption concept was considered to separate lignocelluloses from the <b>spent</b> <b>liquors</b> (SL) s of TMP and NSSC processes. Various adsorbents such as activated carbon, fly ash, bentonite, kaolin, kaolinite, calcium carbonate, talc and aluminium silicate were used in order to adsorb lignocelluloses. The operating conditions of adsorption were optimized by adjusting pH, temperature and time of treatment. Moreover, various alternatives, such as pH adjustment, polymer addition and multi-stage adsorption processes were considered to improve the overall extraction of lignocelluloses from SLs. The properties of adsorbents, e. g. charge density and surface area, {{were related to the}} adsorption performance and the properties, e. g. turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD), of SLs after adsorption. The high removals in turbidity and COD showed that the suggested processes were not only effective in extracting lignocelluloses but also efficient in decreasing the load of wastewater treatment of the plant. Generally, the results showed that fly ash and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) were the best adsorbents for lignin removal, and the products could be used as fillers in composites...|$|R

In the present study, four types of lignin obtained from the <b>spent</b> <b>liquors</b> produced by the pulping processes using the abovementioned feedstocks were isolated and characterized.

Additionally, chemical composition of lignin fractions was also measured. Even though they were of different botanical origin, all the studied samples except for wheat straw lignin had a similar chemical composition and thermal behaviour, and identical chemical structure. Wheat straw lignin showed a greater amount of Klason lignin and lower carbohydrate content. Furthermore, this lignin sample showed a higher thermal stability and significantly different cross-peak patterns in the 2 D-NMR experiments.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} uses pulping chemicals for the treatment of bagasse, straw and wood chips. <b>Spent</b> <b>liquor</b> or effluent liquor, with high carbon content is produced and sent to chemical recovery to recover pulping chemicals. In addition, energy from the <b>spent</b> <b>liquor</b> is recovered and utilised to generate steam for electricity supply, thereby reducing fossil fuel power consumption. <b>Spent</b> <b>liquor</b> is destroyed using conventional incineration technology, in a recovery furnace or recovery boiler, which is the heart of chemical recovery. These units have {{over the past few decades}} been prone to numerous problems and are a major concern to the {{pulp and paper}} industry. They pose a threat to the environment, are expensive to maintain and constitute a safety hazard. Thus the {{pulp and paper industry}} is now looking at a replacement technology; an alternative that will effectively regenerate pulping chemicals and recover energy for generating electricity, ultimately to make the plant energy self-sufficient. Gasification technology may be the chosen technology but is yet to be applied to the pulp and paper sector. However, this technology is not new. It has been integrated and used successfully in the petroleum industry for decades, with applications in coal mining and the mineral industry. The overall objective of tills study is to develop a better understanding of gasification using a pilot-scale fluidised bed reactor which was designed and developed at the University of Natal. The reactor, "the Gasifier", is operated at temperatures below the smelt limits of inorganic salts (< 750 °C) in the <b>spent</b> <b>liquor.</b> In this investigation, <b>spent</b> <b>liquor</b> is injected directly into an inert bed of alwninium oxide grit, which is fluidised by superheated steam. The atomized liquor immediately dries when it contacts the grit in the bed, pyrolyses and the organic carbon is gasified by steam. Pyrolysis and steam gasification reactions are endothennic and require heat. Oxidised sulphur species are partially reduced by reaction with gasifier products, which principally consist of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The reduced sulphur is said to be unstable in the gasifier environment, and reacts with steam and carbon dioxide to form solid sodium carbonate and gaseous hydrogen sulphide. (Rockvam, 2001). The focus of this study will be to determine the Gasifier's ability to gasify <b>spent</b> <b>liquor,</b> from soda and sulphite pulping of bagasse, at different operating conditions. In addition, the fate of process and non-process elements will be investigated. The product gas generated in the gasification of spent soda and sulphite liquors consisted of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. In the gasification of spent sulphjte liquor, hydrogen sulphide was also produced. The water-gas shift reaction, which was the main reaction, was found to be temperature dependent. In adilition, organic carbon conversion increased with temperature. Furthermore, most of the sulphur in the bed predominated in the form of hydrogen sulphide with very little sulphur in the form of sulphate. This indicated that gasification would reduce sulphate levels, which are responsible for dead load in a chemical recovery cycle. Finally, an important result was that the aluminium oxide grit was successfully coated. It was previously speculated that this would not be possible...|$|E

Industrial samples were obtained from one sulfite and three kraft pulp mills. Nonlinear relationships were found between liquor fluorescences and Kappa numbers for the kraft mill samples, due to alterations in production parameters between samples. The results from the analysis of the sulfite mill samples verify the laboratory findings that a maximum fluorescent intensity is attained near the end of a normal sulfite cook.
