40|$|Africa (HPCSA) {{brought in}} a new {{requirement}} for the registration of clinical specialists in South Africa namely the completion of ‘ … a relevant research study … reported in the format of a dissertation’. [1] Since the National Health Act requires health research studies {{to be approved by}} a ‘ … registered health research ethics committee, which is registered with the National Health Research Ethics Council …’,[2] the Wits Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) (Wits HREC (Medical)) began planning for an increase in application numbers from registrars in medicine and dentistry enrolled for the MMed and MDent degrees which fulfill the new HPCSA requirement. Such pre-emptive forward planning recognises that the facilitation of ethical conduct among researchers is an institutional governance issue which should best be imbedded within the institution’s broader governance framework. [3] In addition, transparent, visible preparedness goes a long way to improving the relationship between researchers and ethics committees. At the time, based on the numbers of specialist registrars in the Faculty of Health Sciences, it was estimated that there would be 250 extra applications for ethics clearance per year from 2012 probably until 2015 when a plateau could be expected.

40|$|Transaction costs (TCs) must {{be taken}} into account when {{assessing}} the performance of policy instruments that create markets for the diffusion and commercialization of low-carbon technologies (LCTs). However, there are no comprehensive studies on the development and application of transaction cost analysis to LCTs. In this meta-analysis, a wide-ranging evaluation of TCs associated with energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon market technologies is provided. There is a plethora of different definitions of, and measurement techniques to estimate, TCs. There is wide variation in the quantitative estimates, which can be attributed to factors such as the definition used, data collection, quantification methods, the type and size of technologies, the regulatory frameworks, the complexity of transactions, and the maturity of policy instruments. It is concluded that TCs are highly specific to both LCTs and policy instruments and that a common methodological approach is needed to avoid misleading policy analysis of the extant and future assessments. Policy relevance Transaction costs (TCs) accrued by, for instance, the search for information, due diligence, monitoring and verification (M&V) activities, must be considered in the design, implementation, and assessment of policy instruments. Such costs can have a negative effect on the performance of policy instruments aimed at the diffusion and commercialization of low-carbon technologies. It is shown here that TC analysis is mostly technology and policy context-specific and hence that it is not advisable to make generalizations about sources and estimates. The nature and scale of TCs are likely to differ due to a variety of endogenous determinants (e. g. size and performance of technologies), exogenous drivers (e. g. regulatory policy frameworks), and methodological aspects (e. g. quantification techniques). Several measures and strategies have the potential to reduce TCs, including standardized full cost accounting systems, an ex ante M&V approach, project bundling, and <b>streamlining</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: IMRT of the {{prostate}} consists of multiple stages of treatment planning and dose delivery, each with inherent anatomical uncertainties. Differential filling of the bladder and rectum can displace {{the prostate}} during a course of treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of adapting to these anatomical changes using various CTimage‐guided adaptive (IGART) strategies. Methods: Our computermodel is based on the Philips Pinnacle treatment planning system. A multi‐fraction simulation of 5 ‐field IMRT (76 Gy/ 35 fractions) yields the daily dose accumulation in individual tissue elements. Using megavoltage CT studies of 13 prostate cases, cumulated dose distributions are mapped onto the reference treatment plan. Total dose‐volume histograms are then processed to estimate the changes in tumorcontrol probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for various IGART scenarios. Results: Retargeting {{of the prostate}} generally maintains the intended TCP (typically 0. 9 versus 0. 8 with No Image Guidance) but is often associated with an enhanced risk of rectal toxicity (NTCP rises to 0. 05 when Image Guidance is applied). This effect is due mainly to a systematic anterior shift caused by sag in the treatment couch (average 10 mm). Without image‐guidance, this offset goes uncorrected, resulting in poorer coverage of the target with consistent avoidance of rectal exposure. Conclusions: Geometric repositioning without dose re‐planning is sufficient to maintain the intended TCP. IGART corrects for sag in the treatment couch and this results in greater risk of rectal toxicity, compared with no IGART. Smaller PTV margins could offset this effect, emphasizing the need for integrated image guided and intensity modulated delivery for optimal results. In the extreme, daily IMRT re‐planning based on in‐room imaging could exploit maximum benefits of this technology but this would require significantly more computing resources and <b>streamlining</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> at the treatment console.

40|$|Organic farms face {{numerous}} challenges {{unique to}} organic production {{that can lead}} to cessation of the farm business or conversion to conventional production. In California, one of the leading U. S. states for organic production, all producers of commodities marketed as organic are required to register with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Organic Program. The purpose of this survey study was to compare farmers who had recently discontinued their registration with the program with farmers still registered, to determine whether deregistered farmers leave farming altogether or convert to conventional production, and to shed light on the main challenges faced by organic farmers. Results indicate 26 % of those identified as deregistered were mistakenly identified as such (due to late submissions, name changes, or other reasons), and 35 % had stopped farming altogether. Significantly fewer actually deregistered farmers owned their own land than still registered producers, and a significantly higher percentage had farm revenues lower than US$ 100, 000. Deregistered producers considered regulatory issues as the most problematic, especially paperwork requirements, while registered producers ranked production issues as most problematic. Accordingly, registered farmers were more likely to request technical production assistance in the form of organic-focused research and extension, while deregistered farmers responded that financial assistance with certification and registration costs and more <b>streamlining</b> and clarification <b>of</b> the certification process and organic rules would have helped them more as organic farmers. These results point to a continuing need for certification cost share programs, especially for small farms, and <b>streamlining</b> <b>of</b> regulatory <b>procedures.</b> Additional strategies to retain more organic farmers include trained organic advisors who can facilitate between farmers and certifying and regulatory agencies, more organic-focused research, and producer cooperatives for small organic farms to pool information and labor resources and marketing efforts...|$|R

Important and unique features of CSF biobanking are intensive collaboration in international networks and the tight application of standardized protocols. The current adoption of standardized protocols for CSF and blood collection as presented in this review enables biomarker studies in large cohorts of patients and controls. Another topic of this review is the selection of control groups, which influences the outcome of biomarker investigations. Control groups in CSF biobanks mainly consist of different disease controls. This is {{in part due to}} the fact that lumbar punctures are mostly performed for clinical indications and rarely for research purposes only, as it is a relatively invasive procedure. Moreover, there is a lack of homogenous criteria and definition of control groups. We therefore propose uniform consensus definitions for such control groups in biomarker research, i. e. Healthy controls (HC), Spinal anesthesia subjects (SAS), Symptomatic controls (SC), Inflammatory Neurological Disease Controls (CINDC), Peripheral Inflammatory Neurological Disease Controls (PINDC) and Non-inflammatory Neurological Disease Controls (NINDC). Another important aspect of CSF biobanking is quality control. Systematic studies to address effects of pre-analytical and storage variation on a broad range of CSF proteins are needed. In conclusion, biomarker research in neurodegenerative diseases has entered a new era due to the collaborative and multicenter efforts of many groups.
