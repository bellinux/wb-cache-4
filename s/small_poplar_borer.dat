40|$|We {{performed}} a ﬁeld trial {{to evaluate the}} response of different poplar clones to heavy metals. We found that poplar plants of the same clone, propagated by cuttings, had a marked variability of survival and growth in different zones of the ﬁeld that were characterized by very similar physical–chemical prosperities. Since metal uptake and its accumulation by plants can be affected by soil microorganisms, we investigated soil microbial populations that were collected in proximity {{to the roots of}} large and <b>small</b> <b>poplar</b> plants. We used microbiological and molecular tools to ascertain whether bacterial strains or species were associated with large, or <b>small</b> <b>poplars,</b> and whether these were different from those present in the bulk (without plants) soil. We found that the culturable fraction of the bacteria differed in the three cases (bulk soil, <b>small</b> or large <b>poplars).</b> While some taxa were always present, two species (Chryseobacterium soldanellicola and Variovorax paradoxus) were only found in the soil where <b>poplars</b> (large or <b>small)</b> were growing, independently from the plant size. Bacterial strains of the genus Flavobacterium were prevalent in the soil with large poplar plants. The existence of different microbial populations in the bulk and in the poplar grown soils was conﬁrmed by the DGGE proﬁles of the bacterial culturable fractions. Cluster analysis of the DGGE proﬁles highlighted the clear separation of the culturable fraction from the whole microbial community. The isolation and identiﬁcation of poplar-associated bacterial strains from the culturable fraction of the microbial community provided the basis for further studies aimed at the combined use of plants and soil microorganisms in the remediation of heavy metal polluted soils...|$|R

30|$|In a 4 -year field trial, we {{evaluated}} growth characteristics of transgenic poplars with decreased xyloglucan from overexpression of AaXEG 2. The field trial {{showed that the}} aboveground biomass of transgenic poplars was reduced by constitutive overexpression of AaXEG 2, {{in contrast to the}} growth chamber and greenhouse conditions in which <b>smaller</b> <b>poplar</b> plants were grown in pots with sufficient moisture and nutrients. In addition to biomass reduction, root sucker formation and growth was reduced in transgenic poplar lines. It is known that a knockout Arabidopsis mutant with altered xyloglucan biosynthesis disrupts root hair growth [21]. Leaves of the transgenic <b>poplars</b> are <b>smaller</b> and greener than those of wild-type poplars [9]. Disturbed root hairs and abnormal leaves might be associated with reduced growth of transgenic poplars in the field. Distinct expression of xyloglucanase in stems or xylem by a specific promoter will not disrupt root hair growth and not affect leaf morphology. Consequently, there will be no interruption of growth traits, and improved xylem suitable for pulping and saccharification can be expected.|$|R
40|$|Metabolism of Chlorinated Hydrocarbons Laboratory {{and field}} tests with poplar in tissue culture, bioreactors, and field sites have shown that, unlike bacteria, these plants {{are able to}} carry out {{complete}} degradation of fully chlorinated alkanes and alkenes to carbon dioxide and chloride. Carbon dioxide was produced as a product of the degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE), carbon tetrachloride (CT), and perchloroethylene (PCE) when axenic tissue cultures of poplar cells were exposed to radiolabelled compounds. The apparent degradation of PCE and CT, fully chlorinated hydrocarbons, in these aerobic plants is remarkable when contrasted to the lack of comparable aerobic degradation by bacteria. Oxidized metabolites, such as trichloroethanol, and di- and trichloroacetic acid, were detected in cell cultures exposed to TCE, suggesting the involvement of cytochrome P 450 s or other monooxygenase activities. Mass balance experiments with <b>small</b> <b>poplar</b> plants in laboratory reactors showed that significant TCE and CT was volatilized from the leaves, while a similar fraction of radiolabeled carbon from these chlorinated solvents was retained in the plant tissue. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The narrowleaf cottonwood, Populus angusti-folia, {{occurs in}} {{occasionally}} flooded, low elevation zones along river valleys near the North American Rocky Mountains. This <b>small</b> <b>poplar</b> has narrow leaves and fine branching and thus resembles willows, which are com-monly flood-tolerant. We investigated the flood response of narrowleaf cottonwoods and a related native hybrid, jackii cottonwood (P. 9 jackii = P. balsamifera 9 P. deltoides), by studying saplings of 24 clones in a greenhouse, with some pots being inundated {{to provide the}} flood treatment. Flooding slightly reduced leaf numbers (- 10 %), and leaf sizes were reduced by about 21 % in female P. angustifolia versus a 50 % reduction in the female hybrids. Flooding-reduced stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate, and reduced transpiration particularly in P. 9 jackii. The effects on foliar gas exchange declined over a 5 -week interval, suggesting compensation. The moderate impact of flooding supports the hypothesis that narrowleaf cotton-woods are flood-tolerant, and we anticipate that these trees could provide traits to increase the flood tolerance of fast-growing hybrid poplars. The results further indicate that female cottonwoods may be more flood-tolerant than males, and females could be more successful in lower, flood-prone sites...|$|R

40|$|Poplar is {{distributed}} widely throughout the world. There are about 30 natural species. Taxonomically poplars {{are divided into}} six groups. Poplar tree can be 200 - 300 years old. Normally two sets of 19 chromosomes {{are present in the}} nucleus of Poplar, while the size of genome is remarkably <b>small.</b> <b>Poplar</b> is a fast growing species. Poplar species are deciduous and semi evergreen and are distributed widely on the northern hemisphere. Poplars have various ecological habitats. They can grow in pure stands or mixed with other hardwood and conifer species. Poplars are also used in short rotation forestry for production of biomass for bio energy, fiber and environmental services. The short rotation forestry in Sweden is based on Salix but in this study the focus is on poplar. Discoloration occurs normally in the core wood for most poplar species. Present thesis is made in order to study the distribution of the discoloration for poplars. In the study 36 poplar trees from three provinces in Sweden (Lat. 56 - 60 ˚ N.) were measured. Discs were collected at different percentages of different stem height. The objective of work was to observe the relationship of discoloration with diameter and height of poplar tree. Besides these 36 sample trees, a clear felled poplar stand at Valsätra in Uppsala Municipality was studied. Diameter and discoloration on 110 stumps were measured. In the third part the measurements of shootings of poplar species in Valsätra are shown. The discoloration in stems was directly proportional with the height of the tree.

40|$|In {{energy crops}} for biomass {{production}} a proper plant structure {{is important to}} optimize wood yields. A precise crop characterization in early stages {{may contribute to the}} choice of proper cropping techniques. This study assesses the potential of the Microsoft Kinect for Windows v. 1 sensor to determine the best viewing angle of the sensor to estimate the plant biomass based on poplar seedling geometry. Kinect Fusion algorithms were used to generate a 3 D point cloud from the depth video stream. The sensor was mounted in different positions facing the tree in order to obtain depth (RGB-D) images from different angles. Individuals of two different ages, e. g., one month and one year old, were scanned. Four different viewing angles were compared: top view (0 °), 45 ° downwards view, front view (90 °) and ground upwards view (− 45 °). The ground-truth used to validate the sensor readings consisted of a destructive sampling in which the height, leaf area and biomass (dry weight basis) were measured in each individual plant. The depth image models agreed well with 45 °, 90 ° and − 45 ° measurements in one-year poplar trees. Good correlations (0. 88 to 0. 92) between dry biomass and the area measured with the Kinect were found. In addition, plant height was accurately estimated with a few centimeters error. The comparison between different viewing angles revealed that top views showed poorer results due to the fact the top leaves occluded the rest of the tree. However, the other views led to good results. Conversely, <b>small</b> <b>poplars</b> showed better correlations with actual parameters from the top view (0 °). Therefore, although the Microsoft Kinect for Windows v. 1 sensor provides good opportunities for biomass estimation, the viewing angle must be chosen taking into account the developmental stage of the crop and the desired parameters. The results {{of this study indicate that}} Kinect is a promising tool for a rapid canopy characterization, i. e., for estimating crop biomass production, with several important advantages: low cost, low power needs and a high frame rate (frames per second) when dynamic measurements are required.

40|$|Poplars (Populus sp.) {{are widely}} used in short {{rotation}} forestry for production of biomass for bioenergy, fibre and environmental services. Swedish short rotation forestry is based on Salix sp., and {{little is known about}} the production potential of poplar plantations and their effects on the environment. This thesis focuses on four aspects of intensive short rotation forestry with poplars: 1) Biomass production and partitioning at several initial densities and a range of latitudes and growing conditions in Sweden, 2) the effects of poplar plantation on floristic diversity in the Swedish agricultural landscape, 3) the pattern of wind damage and its effects on production in poplar plantations in southern Sweden, and 4) ecological characterisation of poplar varieties in short-term experiments with pot-grown plants. Annual biomass production in poplar plots and plantations over a rotation period of 9 - 14 years ranges between 3. 3 and 9. 2 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1. These high production figures are achieved on relatively fertile, non-fertilised and non-irrigated agricultural land. The production assessments for commercial poplar plantations established at lower initial densities (1000 trees ha- 1) in southern Sweden indicate a similar production potential as in closely spaced cultures (5000 trees ha- 1 yr- 1), though at 3 - 5 years longer rotations. Lower initial densities enable higher pulpwood yields along with the production of biomass for bioenergy. A comparison among 21 poplar plots, 0. 1 - 13 ha large and adjacent arable fields, indicates that <b>small</b> <b>poplar</b> plantations may increase floristic diversity on a landscape scale, mainly by providing a different type of habitat that may favour shade-tolerant and draught-sensitive species. This is reflected by a relatively low number of species shared by both types of habitat. Wind damage in two poplar plantations, 15 and 33 ha large, was assessed using wind damage classes based on leaning angle of individual trees on plots established before wind damage occurred. The loss of increment on the strongest damaged plots during the two-year period after the storm was 30 %, whereas there was no difference in growth between damaged and undamaged plots in the third year after the storm. A short-term experiment using pot-grown plants revealed differences in clonal growth response in terms of physiological and morphological variables that determined relative growth rate and nutrient productivity, despite that most of clones were of the same species and geographic origin. The importance of different response variables in determining growth also shifted as an effect of irrigation and fertilisation treatment. Provided that suitable plant material is selected and widely available, commercial SRF with poplars represent a valuable alternative crop for surplus agricultural land with a potential to produce multiple benefits to society through the high production of biomass and fiber and positive effects on the environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of organic nitrogen (N) for plant nutrition and productivity is increasingly being recognized. Here {{we show that}} {{it is not only the}} availability in the soil that matters, but also the effects on plant growth. The chemical form of N taken up, whether inorganic (such as nitrate) or organic (such as amino acids), may significantly influence plant shoot and root growth, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). We analysed these effects by synthesizing results from multiple laboratory experiments on <b>small</b> seedlings (Arabidopsis, <b>poplar,</b> pine and spruce) based on a tractable plant growth model. A key point is that the carbon cost of assimilating organic N into proteins is lower than that of inorganic N, mainly because of its carbon content. This carbon bonus makes it more beneficial for plants to take up organic than inorganic N, even when its availability to the roots is much lower – up to 70 % lower for Arabidopsis seedlings. At equal growth rate, root:shoot ratio was up to three times higher and nitrogen productivity up to 20 % higher for organic than inorganic N, which both are factors that may contribute to higher NUE in crop production...|$|R

In order to improve the global efficiency and the entire production chain, we have to evaluate the energetic aspects linked to the process of transformation, handling and transport of these materials. This paper reports results on a comparison between two chippers of similar size using different cutting technology: disc and drum tool respectively. During trials, fuel consumption, PTO torque and speed, processing time and weight of processed material were recorded. Power demand, fuel consumption, specific energy and productivity were computed. The machine was fed with four different feedstock types (chestnut logs, poplar logs, poplar branches, poplar sawmill residues). 15 repetitions for each combination of feedstock-tool were carried out. The results of this study show that the disc tool requires, depending on the processed material, from 12 to 18 % less fuel per unit of material processed than the drum tool, and consequently, from 12 to 16 % less specific energy. In particular, the highest difference between tools was found in branches processing whereas the <b>smallest</b> was in <b>poplar</b> logs.

40|$|An {{integrated}} physiological, biochemical and proteomic {{approach was}} used to systematically investigate the salt stress responses of Populus cathayana Rehder. Cuttings of a one-year-old female clone were used. Saline treatments had the NaCl concentrations of 0, 50 and 100 mM added to full-strength Hoagland's solution. Salinity significantly decreased the relative water content (RWC) of leaves, the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, CO 2 assimilation rate (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) in both salt stress treatments, which suggested that the chloroplast function was affected by salt stress. The observed increases of H 2 O 2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, and electrolyte leakage suggested that salinity caused cellular damage, whereas the increases in compatible solutes and {{in the activities of}} antioxidant enzymes enhanced the salt tolerance. Total proteins of the leaves were extracted by a combination of TCA-acetone and phenol, and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis at pH 4 - 7. More than 1000 protein spots were reproducibly detected on each gel, and 38 salt-responsive proteins were successfully identified by peptide mass fingerprint (PMF). Although the proteins identified in this investigation represent only a very <b>small</b> part of <b>poplar</b> leaf proteins, some of the novel salt-responsive proteins identified here may be involved in physiological and biochemical responses to salt stress in P. cathayana, while the other identified proteins play a role in numerous cellular functions, including signal transduction, mRNA processing and the regulation of the cell cycle. The analysis of physiological and proteomic alterations, and the identification of stress-related proteins contribute to knowledge of salt acclimation in poplar. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
