5|$|During dinner, {{the family}} is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} about {{what they should be}} doing with them. Aliens Kang and Kodos <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E

25|$|The September 6, 2008 conservatorship and the {{subsequent}} planned Treasury infusion of capital support the senior liabilities, subordinated indebtedness, and mortgage guarantees of the two firms.

25|$|Santa Maria {{is one of}} the {{municipalities}} in Bulacan with a high {{population growth}} rate due to in migration. Its rapid population growth contributes largely to the establishment of more commercial and trading activities as some people <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for business. In 2004, the registered business totalled to 4,042 with employment size of 6,168 individuals. The number just got better in 2005 as the registered businesses rose to 5,754 and the employment size to 18,968 individuals. Today there are more than 30 banking and financial institutions in Santa María. These include commercial, savings and rural banks.|$|E
25|$|Public {{institutions}} in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam {{at the expense of}} taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using tax-payers' money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, a San Diego public elementary school is being criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and they <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> endorsement of Islam.|$|E

500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E

The residents, who see the march as sectarian, triumphalist and supremacist, have sought to ban it from their area. The Orangemen <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attack on their traditions; they had marched the route since 1807, when the area was mostly farmland.

Im Tirtzu CEO Matan Peleg stated: [...] " [...] <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> act that is at its very core both anti-Zionist as well as anti-Israeli, an act which dangerously threatens all of the Israeli society." ...|$|E

[...] However, he didn't <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inherent problem; [...] "regardless of how it is achieved, the result is much the same: oodles of rapid-fire killing and the satisfaction of hacking up enemies more numerous than in any console action game that has gone before."
