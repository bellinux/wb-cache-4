5000|$|Unlike [...] "normal" [...] {{application}} of seeds where a draw {{is made to}} ensure that the top seeds don't meet until the latter stages of the competition, the draw for the FFA <b>Cup</b> is <b>seeded</b> {{in such a way that}} it ensures the progression of lesser seeds to generate exposure and revenue for grassroots football clubs. The <b>seeded</b> FFA <b>Cup</b> draw ensures at least three Member Federation Clubs will qualify for the Quarter Finals with one club guaranteed to make the Semi Final.|$|R
50|$|To {{calculate}} the seeding for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, FIFA used the FIFA World Rankings {{in combination with}} performances of national teams in the three previous World Cups. The formula is virtually identical with the one used for the 1998 FIFA World <b>Cup</b> <b>seeding.</b>|$|R

The methanolic extract of plant seeds showed minimum to moderate activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria indicating {{a broad spectrum of}} activity. A preliminary phytochemical screening was conducted on plant extract using standard qualitative procedures that revealed the presence of two (tannins, phenolic compounds and fats and oils) secondary metabolites.

50|$|The {{criteria}} for the seeding was released on 2 December and was, in contrast to previous World <b>Cup</b> <b>seeding</b> criteria, based solely upon the October 2009 FIFA World Rankings.

40|$|The {{present study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Cedar seed germination and the handling of different substrates to elucidate what is the best condition for the species. The experiment was conducted in the laboratory, without control of incidence of light or temperature, leaving them as much as possible under natural conditions. Treatments consisted of four treatments and four repetitions, each repetition consisted of 10 subrepetitions, totaling 40 units (plastic <b>cups)</b> per treatment. <b>Seeds</b> were sown with two <b>seeds</b> per <b>cup.</b> The characteristics evaluated were the percentage of germination and germination speed index (GSI). It is concluded this way that the seeds subjected to the earth and sand worked to conduct tests for germination cedar seeds were those that gave higher percentages of germination and IVG.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{cheating}} occurs in sports. In cup competitions, a common type of sports competition, one method of cheating is in manipulating the seeding to unfairly advantage a particular team. Previous empirical and theoretical studies of seeding manipulation have focused on competitions with unrestricted <b>seeding.</b> However, real <b>cup</b> competitions often place restrictions on seedings to ensure fairness, wide geographic interest, and so on. In this paper, we perform an extensive empirical study of seeding manipulation under comprehensive and realistic sets of restrictions. A generalized random model of competition problems is proposed. This model creates a realistic range of problem instances that are used to identify the sets of seeding restrictions that are hard to manipulate in practice. We end with a discussion of the implications of this work and recommendations for organizing competitions so as to prevent or reduce the opportunities for manipulating the seeding. ...|$|R
