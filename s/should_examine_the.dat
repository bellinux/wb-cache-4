5|$|The {{decision}} in Pepper {{has been linked}} to a positive move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Previously, the dominant approach was that of the literal rule, supplemented by the golden and mischief rules (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes, British courts began to use a more purposive approach, which directed that when interpreting a statute they <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> purpose behind it, rather than simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and Royal Commissions. The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{comparatively}} easy to dig through limestone {{and there}} are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often been proposed that the area <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> idea of building subways for public transportation. In theory, it could be less expensive in the Twin Cities than in many other places, but the cost would still be much greater than surface projects.|$|E
25|$|In {{any given}} All-Age Stake, {{it may be}} very {{difficult}} to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard; therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate the standard. The standard, when applied, <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> total performance of the dog with range being kept foremost in mind. Range is the “sine qua non” of an all-age dog and it should take precedence over and not be compromised for a short, practical, methodical, unexhilarated, uninspiring performance, no matter how immaculate the bird work of the latter.|$|E

25|$|The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was {{the third}} {{occasion}} on which the developing countries have confronted the rich {{with the need to}} use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.|$|E
500|$|In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, the United States Supreme Court {{established}} {{a framework for}} determining whether a suspect's consent is voluntary. The Court noted that historically, when [...] "determining whether a defendant's will was overborne in a particular case, the Court has assessed the totality of all the surrounding circumstances—both {{the characteristics of the}} accused and the details of the interrogation". Consequently, the Court held that voluntariness should be determined [...] "from the totality of all the circumstances". The Court also clarified that judges <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> [...] "possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents" [...] to determine whether a suspect was coerced into consenting, and [...] "account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions". However, the Court also held that suspects may still give valid consent even if they do not know that they can refuse to consent to the search.|$|E
2500|$|Other traits like dispositional optimism, a {{tendency}} to believe that things will turn out positively, were also considered but later not included. [...] The reasons behind this decision are not clear, but include {{the fact that this}} construct is not as well represented in literature. [...] It has also been suggested that dispositional optimism may not be distinct from neuroticism or other dispositional traits. [...] Future research <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> theory more empirically and provide a distinction of how broad, fundamental, and evaluative a trait must be in order to be included in core self-evaluations research.|$|E
50|$|After the {{complaint}} has been filed and either a {{response has been}} received or {{the complaint}} has entered default, a single examiner selected by the provider determines the outcome. <b>The</b> examiner <b>should</b> then <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> evidence and issue a verdict using a standard of clear and convincing evidence.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} {{evidence}} addresses {{the effectiveness of}} a treatment does not mean that all patients will necessarily benefit from that.

6000|$|... § 18. The most {{wonderful}} instance of this feeling at its uttermost which I remember, is the missal in the British Museum, Harl. MSS. 1892. The {{drawings of the}} principal subjects in it {{appear to have been}} made first in black, by Martin Schöngauer (at all events by some copyist of his designs), and then another workman has been employed to paint these drawings over.

60|$|Having settled {{himself in}} his new quarters, the dominie seems to have read over the code, and come at once to the {{conclusion}} that it would be idle to think of straightforwardly fulfilling its requirements. The inspector he regarded as a natural enemy, who was to be circumvented by much guile. One year that admirable Oxford don arrived at the school, to find that all the children, except two girls--one of whom had her face tied up with red flannel--were away for the harvest. On another occasion the dominie met the inspector's trap some distance from the school, and explained that he would guide him by a short cut, leaving the driver to take the dog-cart to a farm where it could be put up. The unsuspecting inspector agreed, and they set off, the obsequious dominie carrying his bag. He led his victim into another glen, the hills round which had hidden their heads in mist, and then slyly remarked that he was afraid they had lost their way. The minister, who liked to attend the examination, reproved the dominie for providing no luncheon, but turned pale when his enemy suggested that he <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> boys in Latin.|$|E

6000|$|The {{horror of}} the {{bystanders}} began now {{to give way to}} indignation, and the sight of a favourite companion murdered in the midst of them, the provocation being, in their opinion, so utterly inadequate to the excess of vengeance, might have induced them to kill the perpetrator of the deed even upon the very spot. The constable, however, did his duty on this occasion, and with the assistance of some of the more reasonable persons present, procured horses to guard the prisoner to Carlisle, to abide his doom at the next assizes. While the escort was preparing, the prisoner neither expressed the least interest, nor attempted the slightest reply. Only, before he was carried from the fatal apartment, he desired to look at the dead body, which, raised from the floor, had been deposited upon the large table (at the head of which Harry Wakefield had presided but a few minutes before, full of life, vigour, and animation), until the surgeons <b>should</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> mortal wound. The face of the corpse was decently covered with a napkin. To the surprise and {{horror of the}} bystanders, which displayed itself in a general AH! drawn through clenched teeth and half-shut lips, Robin Oig removed the cloth, and gazed with a mournful but steady eye on the lifeless visage, which had been so lately animated that the smile of good-humoured confidence in his own strength, of conciliation at once and contempt towards his enemy, still curled his lip. While those present expected that the wound, which had so lately flooded the apartment with gore, would send forth fresh streams at the touch of the homicide, Robin Oig replaced the covering with the brief exclamation, [...] "He was a pretty man!" ...|$|E
