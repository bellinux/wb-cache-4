5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Af9 protein {{acts as a}} {{repressor}} of Tbr1 in {{the upper}} layers of the six-layer developing cerebral cortex, thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, subplate, layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby interfering with RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{consensus}} view {{in contemporary}} palaeontology {{is that the}} flying theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids. Together, these form a group called Paraves. Some basal members of this group, such as Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence {{raises the possibility that}} the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, have been able to glide, or both. Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first avialans were omnivores.|$|E
5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> paleoenvironment of the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active {{floodplain}} {{covered by}} forests {{and subject to}} strong seasonal rainfalls. The climate was moist and warm, though subject to seasonal variations. Vegetation consisted of ferns (Cladophlebis), horsetails, and giant conifers (Protojuniperoxylon). These plants formed lowland forests {{along the banks of}} rivers. Herrerasaurus remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. It lived in the jungles of Late Triassic South America alongside another early dinosaur, the one-meter-long Eoraptor, as well as Saurosuchus, a giant land-living rauisuchian (a quadrupedal meat eater with a theropod-like skull); the broadly similar but smaller Venaticosuchus, an ornithosuchid; and the predatory therapsid chiniquodontids. Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by rhynchosaurs such as Hyperodapedon (a beaked reptile); aetosaurs (spiny armored reptiles); and therapsids, including kannemeyeriid dicynodonts (stocky, front-heavy beaked quadrupedal animals) such as Ischigualastia and traversodontid cynodonts (somewhat similar in overall form to dicynodonts, but lacking beaks) such as Exaeretodon. These non-dinosaurian herbivores were much more abundant than early ornithischian dinosaurs like Pisanosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea of object {{permanence}} {{may not be}} an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
