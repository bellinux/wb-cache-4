These goals are met through updating the USUBC master plan {{to account for}} the newly built man-made stream as well as other future buildings. Trails, overlooks and information nodes are part of the new master plan. The planting plan includes representations of six natural plant communities found in Northern Utah. Additionally, the stream design improves the water quality of USUBC ponds on site. All of these designs will contribute to USUBC goals. The Utah State University Botanical Center Master Plan and Planting Plan is a plan B thesis project...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} pluviometric event {{occurred in}} the central-eastern Ligurian Riviera, 15 km from Genoa, on 1 June 2007. This event caused landslides and hydraulic problems between Sori and Camogli and in the inland area of the Recco Valley. An analysis of the heavy rainfall was conducted. Hourly precipitation data revealed a critical event between 04 : 00 a. m. and 07 : 00 a. m. local time, with more than 220 mm of precipitation over three hours. Slope movements were mainly debris flows that detached from the lateral valleys of the Recco Stream catchment and from well-maintained, wooded slopes that were also characterised by cultivated terraces. Numerous slide planes corresponded to the interface between the surface cover and the underlying bedrock, which presents an unfavourable geologic structure in terms of stability assessment. In most cases, the displaced material had a limited thickness. Debris cover was rapidly channelled along small valleys, which controlled the critical hydraulic conditions in the secondary drainage network. Man-made drainage systems were partially or totally blocked {{in a very short}} time and, like the natural watercourses, accumulated thick and extensive alluvial fans. Most of the instability phenomena occurred in areas that had been designated medium or low-risk areas during land planning, and in sectors that were defined as stable, because they lacked geomorphic indicators connected to landslide risks. The above considerations highlight some gaps of the Recco <b>Stream</b> <b>Master</b> Plan. Therefore, to update this land planning tool, it is necessary to extensively investigate local geomorphological characteristics and to adopt a different method for assigning weights to the geohazard maps...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} waterfalls {{at the edges}} of Ranchi plateau where rivers coming from over the plateau surface form waterfalls when they descend through the precipitous escarpments of the plateau and enter the area of {{significantly}} lower height. The North Karo River has formed a 17 m high Pheruaghaugh Falls at the southern margin of Ranchi plateau. Such falls are called scarp falls. Hundru Falls (75 m) on Subarnarekha River near Ranchi, Dassam Falls (39.62 m) on Kanchi River, east of Ranchi, Sadni Falls (60 m) on Sankh River (Ranchi plateau) are examples of scarp falls. Sometimes waterfalls of various dimensions are formed when tributary <b>streams</b> join the <b>master</b> <b>stream</b> from great height forming hanging valleys. At Rajrappa (10 m), the Bhera river coming over from the Ranchi plateau hangs above the Damodar River at its point of confluence with the latter. The Jonha Falls (25.9 m) is another example of this category of falls. In fact the Gunga River hangs over its <b>master</b> <b>stream,</b> Raru River (to the east of Ranchi city) and forms the said falls.|$|R

50|$|Fog nozzles play an {{important}} part in firefighting tactics due to their versatility. The wide variety of fog nozzle manufacturers allows them to accommodate different sizes of fire hose- most often attack hand line- and streams and are capable in both fire protection and attack. With regard to flow rate, it is imperative to be sure that each fog nozzle be able to handle the flow rate of its water supply because the <b>master</b> <b>stream</b> devices to which they are sometimes attached can expel up to 2000 gal per minute. Nevertheless, as with almost all fog nozzles, those on <b>master</b> <b>stream</b> devices come with either automatic or manual spray pattern and stream adjustments. However, one significant disadvantage of fog nozzles is that Compressed Air Foam (CAF) bubbles' ratio of surface area to volume (which are formed by mixing air into a solution of water and foaming agents at the pump) exceeds that of fog nozzles' water droplets; therefore, the mechanical deflection in the nozzles themselves causes a loss of bubble structure, thereby reducing the CAF's ability to absorb heat. Despite this drawback, provided an appropriate nozzle pressure and water supply, fog nozzles are effective for any ground fire situation.|$|R

40|$|With the {{popularity}} of digital cameras and camera phones, {{it is common for}} different people, {{who may or may not}} know each other, to attend the same event and take pictures and videos from different spatial or personal perspectives. Within the realm of social media, it is desirable to enable these people to select and share their pictures and videos in order to enrich memories and facilitate social networking. However, it is cumbersome to manually manage these photos from different cameras, of which the clocks settings are often not calibrated. In this paper, we propose automatic algorithms to address the above problems. First, we accurately align different photo streams or sequences from different photographers for the same event in chronological order on a common timeline, while respecting the time constraints within each photo stream. Given the preferred similarity measures (e. g. visual, and spatial similarities), our algorithm performs photo stream alignment via matching on a bipartite kernel sparse representation graph that forces the data connections to be sparse in an explicit fashion. Furthermore, we can produce a summary <b>master</b> <b>stream</b> from the aligned super stream of photos for efficient sharing by removing those redundant photos in the super stream while accounting for the temporal integrity. Based on a similar kernel sparse representation graph, our <b>master</b> <b>stream</b> summarization algorithm performs greed...|$|R
