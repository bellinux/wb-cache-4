5|$|The {{enhanced}} performance VE range sold by Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) is marketed as the E Series and it comprised the variants listed below. For the first time, {{in order to}} more greatly differentiate its products from the mainstream donor cars, HSV invested in revised <b>sheetmetal</b> (chiefly, different front fender panels with dedicated air vent and different tail lights). E Series HSV vehicles {{have been the most}} successful and mass-produced vehicles in HSV's history.|$|E
25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld <b>sheetmetal,</b> since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for <b>sheetmetal</b> welding in the industrialized world.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model was}} {{completely}} restyled—It replaced the 1977-based rectilinear design with rounded, more aerodynamic <b>sheetmetal.</b> While {{the body and}} interior were all new, excluding the Anti-Lock Braking System, the chassis and powertrain were carried over from the 1990 model. Several major components (including the floor pan) are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996.|$|E

The first part deal with common dissertation about surface mechanical working, mainly about cutting {{and meaning of}} cutting gap in accordance with final cutting. The second part deals with transfer of the new pieces of knowledge from foreign technical literature of surface mechanical working. In the last part there is done an aplication on the particular component...|$|R

In the late 1950s the {{workshop}} was sold and renamed Gisborne Engineering. In the 1970s it moved to Parkinson St. In 1991 Max Carruthers, bought the company to expand his sheet metal business, Endeavour <b>Sheetmetals</b> Ltd, which was renamed Gisborne Engineering Ltd in 1995.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{expanding}} context of device miniaturization, forming processes of ultra thin <b>sheetmetals</b> are gaining importance. Numerical simulation {{of these processes}} requires accurate material modeling. In this study, both the phenomenological modeling approach and the crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) are considered. Theoretical definitions of both models, numerical implementation {{as well as their}} parameter identification procedures are outlined. Subsequently they are compared on a one to one basis, mainly with regards to their ability to predict mechanical responses for a variety of strain loading paths...|$|R
25|$|One Javelin {{race car}} had the {{distinction}} of having different sponsors and being piloted by Mark Donohue, Vic Elford, George Follmer, Peter Revson, and Roy Woods. This Javelin actually began life as a 1970 model, but was updated to 1971 <b>sheetmetal.</b> The race car is now restored to its 1972 livery and is driven at Vintage Trans-Am events.|$|E

Consists of usually single, sometimes double layer thin circuitboard based on e.g. FR-4, laminated on an aluminium <b>sheetmetal,</b> commonly 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2 or 3mm thick. The thicker laminates sometimes come also with thicker copper metalization.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Water supply Sewerage and Drainage Board {{were based}} at Loftus Street Leederville {{with the head}} office {{remaining}} there, in 1977 the workshops were relocated to Lemnos Street Shenton Park with Mechanical Fitting,(both on site and workshop based), Machining, Welding, Drawing, Automotive Mechanical, instrument sections, <b>sheetmetal,</b> and separate pipe line maintenance crews. There were also smaller depots, among these were Balcatta and Tinga Place at Kelmscott.|$|E
25|$|Roger Olian, a <b>sheetmetal</b> foreman at St. Elizabeths Hospital, a Washington {{psychiatric}} hospital, {{was on his}} {{way home}} across the 14th Street Bridge in his truck when he heard a man yelling that there was an aircraft in the water. He was the first to jump into the water to attempt to reach the survivors. At the same time, several military personnel from the Pentagon—Steve Raynes, Aldo De La Cruz and Steve Bell—ran down to the water's edge to help Olian.|$|E
25|$|The model lasted {{five years}} with minimal changes, {{although}} there was a fairly substantial facelift in 1976 (for the coupe only — sedans stayed with original 1973 <b>sheetmetal</b> through 1977), which incorporated the recently legalized square headlights (horizontally mounted on coupes, and vertically on sedans — much like the mid-1960s Pontiacs). The Regal coupe sold reasonably well, although it lagged behind the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme which had become the best-selling cars in America by 1976. Regal sedans and all Century models had far fewer takers.|$|E
25|$|Much {{was done}} in the design process to make the second {{generation}} LH sedans look more distinct from each other. The 1998 Concorde differed far greater from the Dodge Intrepid and the new 1999 Chrysler 300M (successor to the Eagle Vision), than did the first generation models. With the exception of the doors and roof, the Concorde shared little <b>sheetmetal</b> with the Intrepid and 300M. The new Concorde's front end was underscored by a striking full-width grille, relocated to the front bumper to give the impression of a bottom breather. Sweeping curves and a more rounded front end also helped set the Concorde apart from the Intrepid and 300M.|$|E
25|$|The new {{custom-built}} Imperial sedan {{was based}} on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and broadcloth Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler <b>sheetmetal.</b> Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. The really new models didn't arrive until March, 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stoneguards, full length lower window trim and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.|$|E
25|$|For 2007, Ford's Special Vehicle Team {{launched}} Shelby GT500, {{a successor}} to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic live axle rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker <b>sheetmetal</b> supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned strut towers to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission used a 3.31:1 rear drive ratio. Wheels are 18×9.5inch with P255/45ZR18 tires in the front and P285/40ZR18 tires in the rear. Brembo 14-inch disc brakes with aluminum four-piston calipers are on the front with 11.8-inch disc brakes with single-piston calipers in the rear.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of all the}} LH sedans, {{the first}} {{generation}} Concorde was most {{closely related to the}} Eagle Vision. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all <b>sheetmetal</b> in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, body side moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler's signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body colored strips with the Chrysler Pentastar logo on the center strip. The Concorde's rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height lightbar between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde's body side moldings incorporated bright chrome (later golden colored) work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray came {{all the way up to}} the chrome beltline; on Visions the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans (Concorde, LHS, New Yorker); Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles.|$|E
500|$|The {{model was}} {{continued}} for longer in Brazil, {{where it was}} marketed with the 2.4-litre V8 {{under a variety of}} names like [...] "Tufão", [...] "Jangada", and [...] "EmiSul". It was eventually replaced by a version with new <b>sheetmetal,</b> called the Simca Esplanada.|$|E
500|$|After {{repair of}} the Pullman B-29 at Wright Field, testing resumed with three Thin Man and nine Fat Man shapes {{dropped in the}} last two weeks of June 1944. High speed {{photographs}} revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a [...] "California Parachute", a cubical tail box with eight fins within the <b>sheetmetal</b> box [...] "frame", 45° apart from each other (four [...] "orthogonal" [...] fins, and four more, one at each 45º angle to each corner) to the line of fall was approved.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 LeSabre {{received}} new <b>sheetmetal</b> {{with more}} squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new <b>sheetmetal,</b> the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, {{along with the}} roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at [...]|$|E
2500|$|For 1961, Chevrolet again had {{a totally}} new body, not just new <b>sheetmetal.</b> Its {{wheelbase}} remained , but its length was now reduced slightly to [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, the Belvedere - {{along with}} the rest of Chrysler's B-body offerings - was reskinned with [...] "Coke bottle styling." [...] The Belvedere II was dropped, but the Sport Satellite was added to the overall lineup, using the same <b>sheetmetal.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 1978 {{brought a}} {{downsizing}} of the Grand Prix {{and the other}} A-bodies. This version of the A-body also received some <b>sheetmetal</b> revisions for 1981. The 1978 GP was about [...] shorter and [...] lighter than the 1977 model with an overall length of [...] and a [...] wheelbase.|$|E
2500|$|Wanting {{to avoid}} {{internal}} {{competition with the}} [...] "Euro-styled" [...] Pontiac Grand Am, and looking for an entry into the compact muscle market populated by the Plymouth Duster 360, Ford Maverick Grabber and AMC Hornet X, Pontiac moved the 1974 GTO option to the compact Pontiac Ventura, which shared its basic body shell and <b>sheetmetal</b> with the Chevrolet Nova.|$|E
2500|$|For 1980, all 88s got new {{and more}} {{aerodynamic}} <b>sheetmetal</b> for improved fuel economy highlighted by rounded square taillights similar to mid-70s 88s, but overall dimensions stayed the same and coupes received a revised roofline. New to the engine lineup was the 307 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and [...] All other engines except the now-discontinued 403 were carried over from 1979.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most obvious}} {{change for the}} 1973 model saw was a new front fascia, {{required}} to meet new federal regulations. The new regulation mandated that all cars manufactured after September 1, 1972 {{must be able to}} take a [...] strike to the front without damaging safety related components such as headlamps and the fuel system. For 1973 only, rear bumpers had a [...] requirement. The Torino's front end featured totally new <b>sheetmetal</b> from the firewall forward, with a blunt, more squared-off fascia replacing the previous year's pointed prow. The new large square [...] energy absorbing bumper replaced the almost body-fitting chrome bumper used {{on the front of the}} 1972 Torino. The new larger bumpers caused all Torino models to increase in length by at least 1", and weight also increased by at least [...] for all models. [...] Rear bumpers and taillights were unchanged from 1972, but used new brackets that increased the space between the bumper and the <b>sheetmetal.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although {{identical}} mechanically, {{and nearly}} as much internally, the Matrix and Vibe had different <b>sheetmetal</b> and exterior trim designed by their respective brands. Both vehicles are narrow, tall station wagons styled in a quasi-SUV fashion (called a crossover utility vehicle or [...] "CUV" [...] by Toyota) and marketed to a fairly youthful market segment. This type of car is also {{commonly referred to as}} a sport wagon.|$|E
2500|$|LeSabre and {{all other}} {{full-sized}} Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier <b>sheetmetal.</b> Wheelbases remained at [...] but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, <b>sheetmetal</b> {{revisions}} {{gave the}} bodies a more squared-up stance following the coke bottle styling, and interiors were also redesigned. The 1970 Chevelle shared many sheet metal body parts with the 1970 Buick Skylark GSX, both are GM automobiles and have interchangeable sheet metal. They are [...] {{also the only}} two muscle cars to share the same roofline. The 1970 Chevelle came in sport coupe, sport sedan, convertible, four-door sedan, a couple of wagons, and coupé utility (the El Camino) body styles. [...] Only three of these (Malibu sport coupe, Malibu convertible and El Camino pickup) were available {{with a choice of}} one of 2 SS options; RPO Z25 with the SS 396 (402 cid) engine and RPO Z15 with the new 454 cid engine. [...] The base model was now simply called Chevelle in lieu of the former base 300 Deluxe, and was only available as a Sport Coupe or four-door sedan. In Canada, the base series retained its 300 Deluxe name, with appropriate badging on each front fender just behind the front wheel well. The hardtop, convertible, and sedan received the upgraded <b>sheetmetal</b> but the station wagons and El Camino retained the previous year <b>sheetmetal</b> panels (which went on for the next 2 model years). Station wagons were the entry level Nomad, the Chevelle level Greenbrier, the Malibu level Concours and an upscale Concours Estate. New options included power door locks and a stalk-mounted wiper control. Production was expanded to the GM Arlington Assembly plant in Arlington, Texas (where the Chevelle was assembled with its corporate siblings in this case the Oldsmobile Cutlass).|$|E
2500|$|For 1986, the Delta 88 {{switched}} platforms {{from the}} GM B platform {{to the smaller}} front-wheel drive H platform, with a wheelbase of only [...] The headlights changed from square sealed beam quads to integrated regular/high beam composite lamps in 1987. A few NASCAR teams built racecars with 1986 Delta 88 <b>sheetmetal</b> and ran them on the circuit in the 86-88 seasons; however only one victory (with Terry Labonte) was scored.|$|E
2500|$|Revised <b>sheetmetal</b> with rounded {{but even}} more {{pronounced}} Coke bottle styling highlighted the 1967 Grand Prix and other full-sized Pontiacs. [...] A convertible was new, which lasted only the 1967 model year. Also new to the GP were concealed headlights with horizontal mounting (all other full-size '67 Pontiacs retained the vertical headlights for one more year), concealed windshield wipers and ventless front windows on hardtop coupes. Out back were louvered taillights {{similar to those found}} on the GTO.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 {{model year}} had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba {{share the same}} new body based on the B platform. The Chrysler Cordoba had {{replaced}} the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. [...] The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came {{with a wide variety}} engines from the [...] "LA" [...] series small block V8 to three versions of [...] big block V8. The standard engine was the [...] 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225 hp) being available as an option. Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812. Because of the extreme squareness of the bodystyle, NASCAR teams were forced to rely on the previous years (1974) <b>sheetmetal</b> for race-spec cars. In order for Dodge to be represented, NASCAR allowed the 1974 <b>sheetmetal</b> to be used until January 1978, when the new Dodge Magnum was ready for race use. In 1976 a Dodge Charger was one of two NASCAR stock cars to compete in the 24hrs at LeMans, having been modified with head-lamps, tail-lamps and windshield wipers. It was driven by Herschel and Doug McGriff and sponsored by Olympia Beer, earning the nickname [...] "Oly Express".|$|E
2500|$|For 1963, the Grand Prix {{received}} revised <b>sheetmetal</b> {{shared with}} other full-size Pontiacs, but {{with its own}} squared-off roofline with a concave rear window that contrasted with the convertible-like roofline of the 1962 Grand Prix and continued on the 1963 to 1964 Catalina and Bonneville. Also new was a Pontiac-trademark split grille with vertical headlights and round parking lights and [...] "hidden" [...] taillights out back. Aside from grillework, taillight covering and bumpers, chrome trim was limited to lower rocker panels, wheel arches and roofline.|$|E
2500|$|Station wagon {{models for}} 1970 were offered {{initially}} {{in three different}} levels: the Fairlane 500 wagon, the Torino wagon, and the Torino Squire wagon. Mid-year 1970, the Falcon wagon became the new base station wagon. The <b>sheetmetal</b> on the station wagons was not changed as drastically as 2-door and 4-door models. The majority of the <b>sheetmetal</b> behind the front doors was carried over from the 1968-69 body style. As a result, the wagons appeared more upright and square than the sedans and coupes. The Torino Squire was the top level wagon and it featured simulated woodgrain sides, headlamp covers and a trim level similar to the Torino Brougham sedan. The Squire came standard with a 302-2V V8 engine, as well as power front disc brakes; other wagons had 4-wheel drums and the 250 CID I-6. All wagons still featured Ford's [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] two-way tailgate, while the power rear window, rear-facing third seat and roof rack remained options. Ford offered a trailering towing package for all Torinos that would allow Torino to have a Class II tow rating (...) [...] This package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty battery and alternator, extra cooling package, and power front disc brakes. The [...] or [...] engine, power steering and the Cruise-O-Matic transmission were required options.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1975, the Monza Towne Coupe was {{introduced}} — a notchback body-style with a conventional trunk featuring different <b>sheetmetal</b> than the 2+2 hatchback, but sharing its windshield, front fenders, and doors. [...] It features single round headlamps, {{instead of the}} dual rectangular headlamps on the 2+2. [...] The Towne Coupe was offered {{in response to the}} sales success of the Ford Mustang II notchback coupe and its luxury version, the Mustang II Ghia. The Towne Coupe is [...] shorter and [...] lighter than the 2+2 and has slightly more rear head room.|$|E
2500|$|Teague joined American Motors Corporation (AMC) as {{a member}} of Edmund E. Anderson's design team in 1959, and became {{principal}} designer when Anderson left in 1961. Teague's first assignment, according to designer James W. (Jim) Alexander, was to re-do the front <b>sheetmetal</b> on the 1961 Ambassador. The first cars influenced by Teague's styling were the 1963 Rambler Classic and Ambassador, AMC's first all-new models since 1956. With the ascendancy of Teague in the early 1960s, [...] "AMC Styling began to be written of in a more positive manner" [...] within the industry and automotive press.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Ford {{was already}} {{at work on the}} next Thunderbird {{generation}} by 1986, the company sought to continue {{to cash in on the}} existing generation's success. As such, for 1987 the Thunderbird received a significant refresh complete with new <b>sheetmetal</b> and a revised front fascia with more aerodynamic single-piece headlamps. Mechanically the car was mostly unchanged. V6s models carried over port fuel injection from 1986 while the Turbo Coupe's turbocharged 4-cylinder engine gained an intercooler, increasing output to [...] and 240lbs of torque. 1988 was this Thunderbird generation's last as Ford prepared to unveil an all-new Thunderbird for 1989.|$|E
2500|$|A highly trimmed, two-door coupe, {{the first}} Regal shared its {{front and rear}} styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and {{taillight}} lenses. The Regal shared the same [...] "Colonnade" [...] pillared hardtop roofline (a hardtop with B-pillars (center pillars) but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme {{as well as the}} lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by <b>sheetmetal,</b> instead of the traditional roll-down windows.|$|E
