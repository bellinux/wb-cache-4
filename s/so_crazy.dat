25|$|A {{number of}} {{conspiracy}} theories have been published, based on CIA and FBI surveillance of Lennon {{due to his}} left-wing activism, and on the actions of Mark Chapman in the murder or subsequent legal proceedings. Barrister and journalist Fenton Bresler raised the idea in a book published in 1990. Liverpool playwright Ian Carroll, who has staged a drama conveying the theory that Chapman was manipulated by a rogue wing of the CIA, suggests Chapman was not <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> {{that he could not}} manage a long trip from Hawaii to New York shortly prior to the murder. Claims include that Chapman was a Manchurian candidate, including speculation on links to the CIA's Project MKULTRA. At least one author has argued that forensic evidence proves Chapman did not commit the murder, while others have criticized the theories as based on possible or suspected connections and circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{progression}} from MercyMe's first album Almost There to {{the songs on}} Spoken For, [...] MercyMe's lead singer Bart Millard said in an interview: [...] "Our goal early on {{was to make sure}} our songs were 'singable' and make sure they fit on power point because we wanted to write songs for corporate worship. Spoken For is filled with songs that I pray the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There. Millard said [...] of the origin of the album title: [...] "Over the last year I’ve been consumed with the idea that God is <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> in love with us—just knowing that we are part of something bigger and we worship a God who’s in complete control no matter how good or bad things get.

500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E

You couldn't even get in to see this guy unless you had $2 million to invest." [...] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be [...] "a crook running a Ponzi scheme" [...] which is [...] "legal robbery." [...] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script, feeling Loeb's draft was [...] "so great" [...] that he did not feel the need to touch it, although he did have the option.|$|E

I'm so thankful that it got <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> and turned so upside down, and how nuts this character is. It's so fun."

500|$|The team {{hired an}} Indian film crew, {{and spent the}} entire budget in India. Stratum Films in Mumbai helped find {{locations}} and cast extras. Choreographer Devang Desai assembled Indian dancers, and worked with Azalea on a Bollywood dance routine unique to [...] "Bounce" [...] and Azalea's style. With {{the exception of the}} video's celebration scenes, BRTHR filmed in guerilla [...] "run and gun" [...] style, and occasionally paid local police to facilitate a setup. According to Azalea, the Indian elephant in the clip took a month to find, and [...] "the Indian mafia" [...] were needed to shut down a street in Mumbai for the filming of her scene with it. Avinash Shankar was later hired to consult to the filming's cultural and visual issues. BRTHR stated that [...] "Bounce" [...] was the most difficult music video they had ever directed because of the persistent difficulties they encountered with its on-location production and final version-editing. A narrative with a speech introducing Azalea at the wedding was cut from the final version. In an interview for Rap-Up, Azalea stated, [...] "It's just <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> to dream something so big and actually see it happen".|$|E

Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post applauded the development, feeling that Blair had [...] "more chemistry" [...] with Dan than with Chuck. New York magazine's Chris Rovzar called Blair and Dan's story line [...] "believable", citing their common ground {{in education and}} taste.

[...] An article from The Huffington Post declared that [...] "Dan and Blair together are like Harry Burns and Sally Albright reincarnated — the couple was obviously inspired by When Harry Met Sally." [...] It further commented that the couple paralleled Pacey and Joey’s relationship from Dawson's Creek and concluded that Dan and Blair were [...] "the most inspired storyline and couple of the show". Entertainment Weekly stated that Dan and Blair were like stars in an [...] "updated version of You've Got Mail". Tierney Bricker of E! ranked all 25 Gossip Girl couples placing 'Dair' as the third best couple after Blair and Serena (#1) and 'Chair' (#2). Bricker stated that “, out of all the main characters, were the most well-suited for each other. In real life, they would've been 'endgame'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot.

[...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{informed}} the fans waiting outside the venue {{that the show}} would be general admission, and told everyone to get {{as close to the}} stage as possible, regardless of the seating assignment on their tickets. Fey wanted to cancel the show but was flying to Denver from the US Festival in California with Morris when the decision to continue was made. After arriving in Denver, Fey called the amphitheatre asking to where the concert was being moved, unaware that the band had decided to proceed with the show. Guitarist the Edge said that when Fey learned of the group's decision, he could not believe it. The Edge said, [...] "I don't think he'd ever heard anything quite <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> in his life, going on with an outdoor show in the worst kind of weather, rain and wind in the mountains. He thought we'd lost our minds completely." [...] Bono went on the radio that day to confirm that the Red Rocks concert was still taking place, and to promote a concert that the band planned for the following night at the CU Events Center to accommodate fans who were unable to attend the Red Rocks show. Clayton said during the band's radio interviews, [...] "We know it's raining now but we're sure it won't be when the show starts, so please come." [...] Two hours before the concert, the downpour subsided and settled into a misty drizzle.

500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! <b>So</b> <b>crazy</b> right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E

We thought we'd keep the name just for two weeks. Then, the word got around in London that there was a band playing rock & roll called The Babys and it seemed so off the wall, <b>so</b> completely <b>crazy,</b> that it was worth taking a shot with.

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{came along}} {{late into the}} {{production}} of Fearless. Swift wrote [...] "Love Story" [...] {{about a man who}} was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him. [...] "His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care", said Swift. Swift also felt like {{it was the first time}} she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, [...] "The only people who wanted them to be together were them." [...] She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: [...] "I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it matters—it's not simple or easy but it's real'." [...] She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the [...] "Love Story"'s second refrain. All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "I feel like they had such promise and they were <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy." [...] Instead, she chose to write a happy ending. She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved. She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself. [...] "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." [...] Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about. Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.|$|E

So we decided let's write somebody who's <b>so</b> <b>crazy</b> they end up in Briarcliff. I had heard Ian McShane really loved American Horror Story.

5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in September 2008 that Pakistan regards the Haqqani {{as an important}} force for protecting its interests in Afghanistan {{in the event of}} American withdrawal from there and therefore is unwilling to move against them. Pakistan presumably feels pressured that India, Russia, and Iran are gaining a foothold in Afghanistan. Since it lacks the financial clout of the other countries, Pakistan hopes that by being a sanctuary for the Haqqani network, it can assert some influence over its turbulent neighbor. In the words of a retired senior Pakistani official: [...] "We have no money. All we have are the <b>crazies.</b> <b>So</b> the <b>crazies</b> it is." [...] The New York Times and Al Jazeera later {{reported in}} June 2010 that Pakistan's Army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and chief of the ISI General Ahmad Shuja Pasha were in talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to broker a power-sharing agreement between the Haqqani network and the Afghan government. Reacting to this report both President Barack Obama and CIA director Leon Panetta responded with skepticism that such an effort could succeed. The effort to mediate between the Haqqanis and the Afghan government was launched by Pakistan after intense pressure by the US to take military action against the group in North Waziristan. Karzai later denied meeting anyone from the Haqqani network. Subsequently, Kayani also denied that he took part in the talks.|$|R
