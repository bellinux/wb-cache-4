40|$|Sodium fluoroacetate (1080) is a {{vertebrate}} pesticide, {{originally developed}} in the 1940 s and principally used for the control of unwanted introduced animals in New Zealand and Australia. Fluoroacetate is also a toxic component of poisonous plants found in Australia, Africa, South America, and India. In relation to its use as a pesticide, recent {{research has focused on}} further elucidation of its potential sub-lethal effects, on animal welfare issues, on understanding and reducing its risk to non-target species, on its ecotoxicology, and fate in the environment following use in baits. 1080 acts by interfering with cellular energy production through inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and lethal doses can kill animal pests within 6 – 48 h of eating baits. Exposure to sub-lethal doses has been shown to have harmful effects on the heart and testes in animal studies, and strict safety precautions are enforced to protect contractors and workers in the pest control industry. Considerable care must be taken when using 1080 for the control of animal pests.

40|$|Indospicine is a non-proteinogenic {{amino acid}} which occurs in Indigofera species with {{widespread}} prevalence in grazing pastures across tropical Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. It accumulates in the tissues of grazing livestock after ingestion of Indigofera. It is a competitive inhibitor of arginase and causes both liver degeneration and abortion. Indospicine hepatoxicity occurs universally across animal species but the degree varies considerably between species, with dogs being particularly sensitive. The magnitude of canine sensitivity {{is such that}} ingestion of naturally indospicine-contaminated horse and camel meat has caused secondary <b>poisoning</b> <b>of</b> <b>dogs,</b> raising significant industry concern. Indospicine impacts on the health and production of grazing animals per se has been less widely documented.

40|$|Indospicine (L- 2 -amino- 6 -amidinohexanoic acid) is {{a natural}} {{hepatotoxin}} found {{in all parts of}} some Indigofera plants such as I. linnaei and I. spicata. Several studies have documented a susceptibility to this hepatotoxin in different species of animals, including cattle, sheep, dogs and rats, which are associated with mild to severe liver disease after prolonged ingestion. However, there is little published data on the effects of this hepatotoxin in camels, even though Indigofera plants are known to be palatable to camels in central Australia. The secondary <b>poisoning</b> <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> after prolonged dietary exposure to residual indospicine in camel muscle has raised additional food safety concerns. In this study, a feeding experiment was conducted to investigate the in vivo accumulation, excretion, distribution and histopathological effects of dietary indospicine on camels. Six young camels (2 – 4 year old), weighing 270 − 390 kg were fed daily a roughage diet consisting of Rhodes grass hay and lucerne chaff, supplemented with Indigofera and steam flaked barley. Indigofera (I. spicata) was offered at 597 mg DM/kg body weight (bw) /day designed to deliver 337 µg indospicine/kg bw/day, and fed for a period of 32 days. Blood and muscle biopsies were collected over the period of the study. Concentrations of indospicine in the plasma and muscle biopsy samples were quantitated by validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC−MS/MS). The highest concentrations in plasma (1. 01 mg/L) and muscle (2. 63 mg/kg fresh weight (fw)) were found at necropsy (day 33).

Primary cultures <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> leucocytes were found to support the in vitro cultivation of Neorickettsia helminthoeca as were canine sarcoma 503 cells and mouse lymphoblasts MB III. Quantitative methods were not applied to in vitro studies of multiplication of the rickettsia because it failed to grow sufficiently in laboratory animals or in chicken embryo yolk sacs to do so. By ultrastructural analysis it was learned that Neorickettsia helminthoeca was structurally similar to other rickettsiae. Rickettsial cells were seen as circular profiles or rod-shaped cells 0. 5 μ wide and up to 0. 7 μ. long. They were bounded by a cell wall and an underlying cytoplasmic membrane. Each of the membranes was a trilayered structure and showed the unit membrane structure. Koch's postulates were fulfilled as completely as possible for an organism that is an obligate intracellular parasite.

Clinically, the classic course <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> disease developed in all <b>of</b> the <b>dogs.</b> Parasitemia began on day 8 to 11 postinfection, when the dogs developed a febrile peak, and continued until euthanasia. At necropsy, characteristic gross and microscopic lesions of the disease were present. A Neorickettsia sp. was also isolated from liver and spleen samples of these animals. The isolates have been continuously propagated and passed in DH 82 cells for more than 6 months. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that the rickettsial organisms multiplied in the membrane-bound compartment of DH 82 cells and that they morphologically closely resembled rickettsia belonging to the genus Ehrlichia. An indirect fluorescent antibody test using Neorickettsia organisms cultured in DH 82 cells showed that all dogs seroconverted 13 to 15 days postinfection.

Broken Hill has been an important lead/zinc mining town for more than 100 years. The mine {{is in the middle of}} the town, the sire is arid and often with little ground cover. Approximately 400 children are born each year in Broken Hill. Fatal lead <b>poisoning</b> <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> is common. Aim: To monitor blood lead levels in preschool children and identify risk factors for elevated PbB in the community as part of a program to manage PbB in young children. Methods: The work consists of a cross sectional study of 864 children in 1992, a case control study of 300 children conducted in 1992 and a cross sectional study of 478 children conducted in 1993. The work also uses data from a prevalence study of 899 children conducted in 1991. The children were recruited as volunteers with over 70 % of children in the older age groups participating over the study period. Venous blood was collected from the children, soil and other environmental samples taken, and questionnaires completed. Results: The geometric mean PbB was 16. 3 μg/dl in 1991 but decreased steadily to 12. 7 μg/dl in 1993. The percentage of children with PbB> 25 μg/dl decreased from 21. 0 % to 9. 6 % and the percentage with PbB> 10 μg/dl decreased from 84. 5 % in 1991 to 68. 5 % in 1993. Risk factors for elevated PbB included soil lead level where the child lived, amount of dirt eaten, frequency of playing in dirt and sandpit, frequency of vacuuming, frequency of changing vacuum filter, hand washing, time spent playing outside, percentage of the yard that was bare dirt and frequency of hand washing. Soil lead levels were elevated but were similar to or lower than those in other mining communities. Unlike other mining sites (PbB is often not elevated), the lead species in Broken Hill are highly bioavailable and the particles are often finely divided. Conclusions: PbB in preschool children was elevated in 1991 and declined significantly over the next two years. The number of children with very high PbB has been halved. The results of the work were used to manage individual cases, produce pamphlets, media releases and a video for Broken Hill parents, influence NSW government, local government and industry practices, and to lobby for funds to continue the management of the situation. The decline in PbB has continued after the completion of this work with the establishment of the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Centre.

The list includes Melia azedarach (syringa), Brunfelsia spp. (yesterday, today and tomorrow), Datura stramonium (jimsonweed, stinkblaar), a wide variety of lilies and lily-like plants, cycads, plants that contain soluble oxalates, plants containing cardiac glycosides and other cardiotoxins and euphorbias (Euphorbia pulcherrima, E. tirucalli). Poisoning by plant products such as macadamia nuts, onions and garlic, grapes and raisins, cannabis (marijuana, dagga) or hashish and castor oil seed or seedcake is also discussed. Many of the poisonings are not usually fatal, but others frequently result in death unless rapid action is taken by the owner and the veterinarian, underlining the importance of awareness of the poisonous potential of a number of familiar plants...|$|R

"At the time, I {{certainly}} {{suspected that}} he had been guilty <b>of</b> <b>poisoning</b> the <b>dog</b> and, in spite of his denying {{that he had}} anything to do with it, as he was unable to account for where he was at the time the boy was seen, I discharged him. I wish to say publicly that I have deeply regretted having done so, ever since, and that I consider I acted hastily and wrongly in so doing. Considering his previous good character, I ought not to have assumed his guilt without more positive evidence than I had before me. I may also say that the schoolmaster of our village will give the prisoner the highest character for truthfulness, and he has known him ever since. His present employer, Mr. Penfold, is also, I believe, ready to testify to his excellent conduct during his four years of apprenticeship." ...|$|R
