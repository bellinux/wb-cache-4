40|$|Background. People with {{a history}} <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> or <b>heart</b> disease are at {{increased}} risk of future stroke; therefore, identification of risk factors by GPs is critical. Objectives. To compare the following among general practice patients with and without a history <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> or <b>heart</b> disease: (i) self-reported prevalence rates of lifestyle risk factors; (ii) accuracy of GP detection of patient-reported risk factors and (iii) average proportion of patient-reported risk factors detected by GPs. Methods. Consecutive patients attending a participating general practice clinic were invited to participate in a cross-sectional touchscreen survey assessing lifestyle risk factors in 2010 - 11. The GP of each consenting patient completed a corresponding survey assessing the patient's risk factors. Demographic characteristics of patients and GPs were obtained. Results. Data from 51 GPs and 564 patients were analysed. Patients without a history <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> or <b>heart</b> disease reported significantly higher rates of smoking (12 %) and risky alcohol consumption (56 %) than patients {{with a history}} <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> or <b>heart</b> disease (6 % and 36 %, respectively). Low sensitivity of GP detection of risk factors was found for all risk factors for all patients. Patients with a history <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> or <b>heart</b> disease have a significantly higher mean proportion of risk factors detected by their GP compared to patients without a history <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> or <b>heart</b> disease (P = 0. 00). Conclusion. Given low sensitivity and specificity of GP detection of risk factors among patients, alternate methods of identification are needed. Research is required to determine strategies to facilitate secondary care of patients with a history <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> or <b>heart</b> disease by GPs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of endocardial endothelium in quail embryos was investigated usingin vivoandin vitrosystems. Based on {{the expression of}} an quail endothelial marker, QH- 1, the initial emergence of endothelial precursor cells in the embryo occurs at stage 7 +(two somites) in the posterior parts <b>of</b> the bilateral <b>heart</b> forming <b>regions.</b> Cells that expressed the QH- 1 antigen were mesenchymal and positioned between the mesodermal epithelium <b>of</b> the <b>heart</b> <b>region</b> and the endoderm. By confocal microscopy, an asymmetrical distribution of QH- 1 positive cells was observed between the two heart regions: specifically between 7 +and 8 −, more precursor cells were seen in the right region than the left. Endothelial precursor cells did not appear outside <b>of</b> the <b>heart</b> forming <b>regions</b> until stage 8 −(three somites). Free, mesenchymal-like endothelial precursor cells intrinsic to the <b>heart</b> <b>regions</b> also expressed two extracellular antigens, JB 3, a fibrillin-like protein, and cytotactin, both associated with segments <b>of</b> the primary <b>heart</b> tube where endothelial cells “re-transform” back to a mesenchymal phenotype during cardiac cushion tissue formation. Between stages 8 and 9 (four to seven somites), (1) QH- 1 positive cells within the <b>heart</b> forming <b>region</b> established vascular-like connections with QH- 1 positive cells located outside <b>of</b> the <b>heart</b> <b>region,</b> as initially shown by Coffin and Poole (1988), (2) after fusion <b>of</b> the <b>heart</b> <b>regions,</b> a plexus <b>of</b> QH- 1 positive cells was formed ventral to the foregut, and (3) the definitive endocardial lining <b>of</b> the primary <b>heart</b> tube formed directly from the ventral plexus of endothelial precursor cells. Because the QH- 1 positive, endothelial precursor cells <b>of</b> each <b>heart</b> forming <b>region</b> were always in close association with anterior endoderm, we sought {{to determine if the}} endoderm mediated the {{formation of}} precursor cells committed to a cardiac endothelial lineage as reflected by their expression of QH- 1, JB 3 antigen, and cytotactin. To test this hypothesis, precardiac mesodermal explants were isolated from stage 5 <b>heart</b> forming <b>regions</b> prior to their expressing of either endocardial or myocardial markers and cultured on the surface of collagen gels in {{the presence or absence of}} endoderm. In the absence of endoderm, precardiac mesoderm of each stage 5 explant remained epithelial, formed contractile tissue, but did not exhibit any QH- 1 positive cells or mesenchymal cells. Conversely, when cocultured with endoderm or endoderm conditioned medium, in addition to the formation of contractile tissue, the explant formed mesenchymal cells. The latter invaded the gel lattice and, asin vivo,expressed QH- 1 antigen, JB 3 antigen, and cytotactin. These findings suggest that endoderm induces mesoderm <b>of</b> the <b>heart</b> fields to undergo an epithelial to mesenchyme transformation that results in the segregation of myocardial and endocardial precursor cells...|$|R
