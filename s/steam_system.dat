5|$|Following {{enquiries}} by the media, Paramount and Namco {{released a}} joint statement explaining {{that it was an}} issue with the <b>Steam</b> <b>system,</b> and was something that the company was seeking to fix shortly. While others stated issues with co-op gameplay on the PS3, the companies stated that they were not aware of any issues and recommended that faults should be reported via Twitter. After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay. A day after the co-op issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 2008, it was {{announced}} that the game would be released on Valve Corporation's content delivery system Steam on the official release date of 6 February; the game requires Steam to install and run for both retail and electronic versions and is integrated into Valve's Steamworks programme to allow updates and multiplayer to function more efficiently. The game's release was delayed in December 2008 to allow for the development of extended multiplayer features, with a new release date for March 2009. A demonstration of the game, featuring the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Lagos, was released over Steam on 20 February 2009. The game was released on 3 March 2009. Since release, Empire: Total War has been subject to updates delivered through the <b>Steam</b> <b>system,</b> aimed at optimising performance and removing any bugs remaining in the game.|$|E

50|$|Morpholine is {{a common}} additive, in parts per million concentrations, for pH {{adjustment}} in both fossil fuel and nuclear power plant <b>steam</b> <b>systems.</b> Morpholine is used because its volatility {{is about the same}} as water, so once it is added to the water, its concentration becomes distributed rather evenly in both the water and steam phases. Its pH-adjusting qualities then become distributed throughout the steam plant to provide corrosion protection. Morpholine is often used in conjunction with low concentrations of hydrazine or ammonia to provide a comprehensive all-volatile treatment chemistry for corrosion protection for the <b>steam</b> <b>systems</b> of such plants. Morpholine decomposes reasonably slowly in the absence of oxygen at the high temperatures and pressures in these <b>steam</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

25|$|Development on Left 4 Dead {{started in}} mid-2005. Turtle Rock Studios aimed {{to create a}} horror film-inspired game that merges single player games' character-driven {{narrative}} structure with multiplayer games' social interaction and high replayability. The game was first revealed in the Christmas 2006 publication of PC Gamer UK with a six-page article describing a playthrough at Turtle Rock Studios headquarters. A teaser was released with The Orange Box. The game was first playable at the Showdown 2007 LAN in San Jose and at QuakeCon 2007. Turtle Rock Studios announced Left 4 Dead on November 20, 2006, and was acquired by Valve Corporation on January 10, 2008, because {{of the game and}} long-standing relationship between the companies.

25|$|Two {{things are}} {{characteristic}} for the {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: coolant loop separation from the <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> and pressure inside the primary coolant loop. In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its liquid state as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the primary coolant loop is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a boiling water reactor (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the bulk fluid. By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the primary coolant is designed to boil.|$|E

25|$|The launch {{from the}} {{submarine}} occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge {{in a separate}} container which is separated by seventeen titanium alloy pinnacles activated by a double alloy <b>steam</b> <b>system.</b> The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike {{is strong enough to}} eject the missile out of the tube and give it enough momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial motion sensors are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the boost phase begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000ft/s (6,000m/s), or 13,600mph (21,600km/h).|$|E

2500|$|At the time, reactor-plant {{operating}} procedures precluded a rapid reactor restart following a scram, {{or even the}} ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to [...] "drive" [...] the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the main <b>steam</b> <b>system,</b> cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an over-rapid cool-down of the reactor. Threshers Reactor Control Officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole, was not at his station in the maneuvering room, or indeed on the boat, during the fatal dive. McCoole was at home caring for his wife who had been injured in a household accident—he had been all but ordered ashore by a sympathetic Commander Harvey. McCoole's trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from nuclear power school, probably followed standard {{operating procedures}} and gave the order to isolate the <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> after the scram, even though Thresher was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> isolation valves could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole was sure he would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to [...] "answer bells" [...] and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. Admiral Rickover later changed the procedure, creating the [...] "Fast Recovery Startup" [...] procedure. The Fast Recovery Startup allows an immediate reactor restart and for steam to be withdrawn from the secondary system in limited quantities for several minutes following a scram.|$|E

40|$|Many {{associated}} benefits accrue from plant projects which comprehensively address <b>steam</b> <b>systems.</b> The DOE-Alliance to Save Energy Steam Challenge {{program was}} initiated shortly after last year's IETC on April 30, 1998 to promote awareness of these benefits.

Emphasizing a "systems" approach to steam efficiency is necessary for optimal operation. This takes into consideration the importance of technologies and practices affecting boilers, distribution <b>systems,</b> <b>steam</b> applications and condensate return. Each of these areas offers energy, pollution, and cost savings, as well as important productivity and safety benefits. Particularly important to consider is the interaction effect among these technologies and practices. As an example, poor water treatment can result in early steam trap failure or pipe corrosion down the line.

2500|$|Developed in the 1950s, steam catapults {{have proven}} {{exceptionally}} reliable.

With no feedback, there often occurs large transients in tow force that can damage or reduce the life of the airframe." [...] The <b>steam</b> <b>system</b> is massive, inefficient (4–6%), and hard to control.

2500|$|The {{complicated}} {{routine of}} restarting went forward smoothly and within twenty minutes Ohio was steaming at sixteen knots again.
