25|$|The {{countess of}} Bedford wrote “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” in {{response}} to Donne’s first elegy that characterized Death as a gluttonous monster. In the poem, <b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> Donne’s Holy Sonnet 10, which starts with the famous line, “Death be not proud.” Russell argues that Donne’s interpretation of Death was more accurate in this Holy Sonnet instead of in his elegy. She says that Death is something {{that should not be}} proud, and that Donne’s elegy gave Death too much credit. As a Christian, Boulstred went to Heaven when she died, and Donne did not give Boulstred enough credit when he characterized her as a helpless victim of Death in his elegy. After this criticism, Donne wrote his second elegy for Boulstred, focusing on Boulstred’s virtues instead of on Death.|$|E

25|$|Willow's {{earliest}} {{and most}} consistent relationships are with Buffy and Xander, {{both of whom}} <b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> as her best friends although they have their conflicts, and Giles as a father figure. Willow takes on the leadership role when Buffy is unavailable, and her growing powers sometimes make her resent being positioned as Buffy's sidekick. Some scholars see Willow as Buffy's sister-figure or the anti-Buffy, similar to Faith, another Slayer whose morals are less strict. In early seasons, Willow's unrequited crush on Xander creates some storylines involving the relationships between Xander, Cordelia, and Oz. Willow {{is part of a}} powerful quartet: she represents the spirit, Giles intelligence, Xander heart, and Buffy strength of the Scoobies. Although they often drift apart, they are forced to come together and work in these roles to defeat forces they are unable to fight individually.|$|E
25|$|In 1749 {{her father}} was {{appointed}} to a position as Canon-Residentiary at Lichfield Cathedral and {{the family moved to}} that city, where her father educated her entirely at home. They lived in the Bishop's Palace in the Cathedral Close. When a family friend, Mrs. Edward Sneyd, died in 1756, the Sewards took in one of her daughters, Honora Sneyd, who became an 'adopted' foster sister to Anna. Honora was nine years younger than Anna. Anna Seward describes how she and her sister first met Honora, on returning from a walk, in her poem The Anniversary (1769). Sarah (known as 'Sally') died suddenly at the age of nineteen of typhus (1764). Sarah was said to be of admirable character, but less talented than her sister. Anna consoled herself with her affection for Honora Sneyd, as she describes in Visions, written a few days after her sister's death. In the poem she expresses the hope that Honora ('this transplanted flower') will replace her sister (whom <b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> as 'Alinda') in her and her parents affections.|$|E

In Angelou's favorite poem, [...] "Still I Rise", which has been compared with spirituals that express hope, <b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the indomitable spirit of Black people.

For Godchild, she traveled to London to do historical research and visited seven historical sites there. In the series, <b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the Bible as well as real-life literary works, films and people. Reviewers have found a range of themes in the series. Critical reaction to The Cain Saga was mixed: some felt that the mysteries were well-done with detailed art, while others found the art crude and the short stories confusing and predictable. Reviewers praised Godchild as an overdone, entertaining series with detailed and distinct art.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{states that}} {{currently}} {{many women are}} silly and superficial (<b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> them, for example, as [...] "spaniels" [...] and [...] "toys"), but argues {{that this is not}} because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women's deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: [...] "Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison." [...] She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.|$|E

500|$|In Angelou's {{favorite}} poem, [...] "Still I Rise", which shares {{its title}} with a play {{she wrote in}} 1976, <b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the indomitable spirit of Black people, using repetition and the categorization of injustices against them. She quoted it during interviews and often included it in her public readings. Despite adversity and racism, Angelou expresses her faith that one will overcome and triumph. Hagen compares [...] "Still I Rise" [...] with spirituals that express hope. As she does in [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] and throughout her poetry and autobiographies, Angelou speaks not only for herself, but for her entire gender and race. [...] Reviewer Ellen Lippmann calls [...] "Still I Rise" [...] a [...] "proud, even defiant statement of behalf of all Black people".

500|$|Suddenly, {{the action}} starts over. Mulder wakes {{to find that}} his {{waterbed}} has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, {{and he needs to}} pay his landlord for water damage. To the audience, time itself is stuck in a loop. Everyone is oblivious to the repetition of events except for one person, Pam (Carrie Hamilton), Bernard's girlfriend. [...] Over multiple iterations of the events, Pam does everything in her power to save the agents, including trying to prevent them from entering the bank, trying to inform them of the time loop, and even begging Skinner not to let the police into the building. It is implied that she has lived these events many times, as <b>she</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> having had Mulder ask her the same question over fifty times. There are subtle changes in the events, and Mulder and Scully's conversation is worded differently each time, but the results are always the same: Bernard detonates the bomb, usually after shooting Mulder, and they all die.|$|E

Kanhopatra also asserts the importance of repeating the names of God and reveals how chanting His names has helped her. She says that even Death would fear God's name, which purified the sinner king Ajamila – who ascended to heaven when he coincendentally called to God at his death bed, the [...] "robber" [...] Valmiki – who {{was transformed into a}} great sage by utterance of God's name – and even the prostitute Pingala. Kanhopatra says, she wears the garland of His names. She hoped that her chanting would ultimately lead her to salvation. Kanhopatra also extols the deeds of Dnyaneshwar—the first great saint of the Varkaris—and his siblings.|$|E
500|$|Some of the cantatas {{composed}} by Bach {{in his second}} year were chorale cantatas, a format he chose for services between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday. For Easter he had returned to cantatas on more varied texts. Nine of the cantatas for the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts of Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, including this cantata. Bach later assigned it to his third annual cycle. Ziegler begins the cantata with the same quotation from the gospel as an unknown poet one year earlier in , the prediction of persecution of Christians. [...] "They will put you under banishment, but the time will come, when, whoever kills you will think that he does God a service by it" [...] (...) [...] She continues stressing the lack of fear possible for a follower who relies on [...] "" [...] (the protective arm of Jesus).

500|$|Warren and Alan Jones cite a {{scene where}} a {{character}} is killed in a public square as evoking the work of Alfred Hitchcock; Rostock agrees that the editing of the sequence is in a Hitchcockian vein, while the lighting is more influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni. The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh argues that Argento's influences for Tenebrae were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. <b>She</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the strong narrative in the film {{as an example of}} [...] "the most paranoid excesses of film noir." [...] McDonagh suggests that Fritz Lang's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956) ("in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence... is in fact guilty of the murder") and Roy William Neill's Black Angel (1946) ("in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he himself is the killer") both use such a similar plot twist to Tenebrae that Argento may have used them as partial models for his story.|$|E
