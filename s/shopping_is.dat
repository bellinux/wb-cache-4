2500|$|Anderson {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} writer on the British crime drama comedy series El C.I.D., which ran for three series, from 1990 to 1992, and starred Alfred Molina in its first two. He met producer Jeremy Bolt and together they founded Impact Pictures in 1992, looking {{to raise money for}} Anderson's feature film debut as director, from an action crime drama script of his own, called Shopping. After much trouble to secure funding, Shopping, which stars Sean Pertwee, Jude Law (on his first feature film role) and Sadie Frost, was released in the United Kingdom in 1994. The censors of the British Board of Film Classification weren't happy with the violence of the film and delayed its release for months, hurting its commercial prospect. When it was eventually released, critics panned it and some cinemas decided to ban it for promoting an [...] "irresponsible" [...] outlook. In the United States it only gained an edited, direct-to-video release two years later. Anderson credits Shopping for inspiring Channel Four Films, who had financed it, to also finance the more successful Shallow Grave and Trainspotting films by Danny Boyle, which in turn, he believes, made critics reassess his film in more positive light in later years, {{as one of the first}} in a new wave of British films that concern its youth. <b>Shopping</b> <b>is</b> Anderson's one and only British film, as he grew up watching American and mainland European movies, never seeing himself becoming a British filmmaker. Shopping was accepted in the Sundance Film Festival, which made him noticed by American studios, for the film's look and style despite its limited $2 million budget, and opened for him the doors to Hollywood.|$|E

60|$|Here {{our advice}} is simple but positive. Shopping {{should never be}} done over the {{telephone}} or by telegraph. The good housekeeper instead of telegraphing for his food will insist on seeing his food himself, and will eat nothing {{that he does not}} first see before eating. This is a cardinal rule. For the moment, then, the range must be turned low while our housekeeper sallies forth to devote himself to his breakfast shopping. The best costume for <b>shopping</b> <b>is</b> a simple but effective suit, cut in plain lines, either square or crosswise, and buttoned wherever there are button-holes. A simple hat of some dark material may be worn together with plain boots drawn up well over the socks and either laced or left unlaced. No harm is done if a touch of colour is added by carrying a geranium in the hand. We are now ready for the street.|$|E

None the less the Things had to be shown--for what <b>shopping</b> <b>is</b> to the woman showing off his town is to the right-minded man. First came the suburbs--miles on miles of the dainty, clean-outlined, wooden-built houses, where one can be so happy and so warm, each unjealously divided from its neighbour by the lightest of boundaries. One could date them by their architecture, year after year, back to the Early 'Nineties, which is when civilisation began; could guess within a few score dollars at their cost and the incomes of their owners, and could ask questions about the new domestic appliances of to-day.|$|E
