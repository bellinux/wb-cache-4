High Efficiency Particulate Air filters range in size from 7. 6 cm (3 inch) by 10. 2 cm (4 inch) cylindrical shape filters to filter array assemblies up to 2. 1 m (7 feet) high by 1. 5 m (5 feet) wide. <b>Spent</b> <b>filters</b> are grouped by contaminates trapped in the filter media and become one of the components in the respective waste stream. Waste minimization and pollution prevention efforts are applied for both radiological and non-radiological applications.

High Efficiency Particulate Air filters also are generated from intake or pre-filtering applications, decontamination activities, and asbestos abatement applications. The disposal avenues include sanitary/industrial waste, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Toxic Substance Control Act, regulated waste, solid low-level waste, contact handled transuranic, and remote handled transuranic waste.

Until recently, the whole filter was used for estimation; however a part-filter method has been shown to improve the accuracy of estimated HS yields. The part-filter method uses only the mouth-end portion of the filter, downstream of the ventilation holes, for analysis. In this portion, the filtration efficiency is relatively constant irrespective of typical puff flow rates of humans and also minimizes butt length effects (e. g. nicotine condensation) on filtration efficiency. Therefore, the estimations of HS cigarette yields are more robust to human smoking conditions than previous whole-filter methods...|$|E
40|$|Dry {{cleaning}} facilities using tetrachloroethene, {{also known}} as perchloroethylene (PCE) produce a solid waste consisting of <b>spent</b> <b>filtering</b> powder, mainly calcined diatomaceous earth, benthonites or other absorbent materials. These powders are normally used during dry washing for the organic solvent filtration and discoloration prior to its recovery by distillation and condensation with refrigerating fluid.

Before entering the filtering bowl, the liquid metal isseeded with massive artificial inclusions. A theoretical analysis of the filtration of massiveinclusions shows that there are two preponderant deposition mechanisms, i. e., direct interceptionand sedimentation, which explain qualitatively the effect of the operating conditions on themeasured filtration efficiency. Furthermore, it is observed that the filtration efficiency measuredby two Coulter counters reaches a minimum value for a diameter close to 30 µm.

It is expected that oxide films are the mostnumerous inclusion type for diameters less than 25 µm and have an apparent volume muchlarger than their absolute volume (contrary to massive inclusions), leading to a higher filtrationefficiency. In addition, a metallographic analysis of <b>spent</b> <b>filters</b> shows that the density of thecaptured massive inclusions decreases exponentially between the filter inlet and the filter outlet.

Further, technology developed under this proposal would also have application for the use of liquid based fuels for fuel cell power generation. The program consisted of four phases. Phase I focused on developing a concept design and analysis and resolution of technical barriers concerning removal of sulfur-containing species in low sulfur fuels.

40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: <b>Spent</b> <b>filter</b> {{backwash}} water (SFBW) {{consists of}} 1 - 5 % {{of the total}} treated water typically {{and it has a}} high turbidity. Because of the scarcity of water resources and in order to prevent the environmental contamination, effluent treatment of rapid sand filter backwashing is unavoidable. One of the new technologies for removal of turbidity from the effluent is ElectroCoagulation (EC) processes. This study aimed to examine the efficiency of continuous electrocoagulation in turbidity removal from <b>spent</b> <b>filter</b> backwash water. 			Materials & Methods: This study was non-continuous experiment. A rectangular cube electrocoagulation tank in 24 cm× 17 cm× 18 cm dimensions from Plexiglas with the volume of 7. 35 liter was made. In this tank there were 4 metal plates (electrode) (15 × 22 × 0. 1 cm); two electrodes as cathode and anode which were made of aluminum and iron, respectively. All of the tests were done in continuous flow. According to the study criteria (Time, Turbidity and pH), 126 sample got with the turbidity 320, 350, 400 NTU from rapid sand filter backwashing water, so they were tested in current density; 1, 1. 4, 1. 8, 2, 2. 4, 2. 8 and 3. 2 ampere in 3 selected detention times (10, 20 and 30 min).

40|$|Deterioration in {{the quality}} of surface waters {{worldwide}} is associated with losses of phosphorus (P) from diffuse sources. Controlling such losses is rather difficult, but their significance in reducing the effects of eutrophication is crucial. Phosphorus losses from diffuse sources represent a significant share of total P transfers to surface waters. Researchers have studied and implemented numerous methods to curb non-point P losses during the past decades, but such studies have generally been insufficient to change the impact of agriculture on the course of surface waters eutrophication. For example, even though inputs of P and nitrogen (N) into the Baltic Sea have significantly decreased over the past two decades, the Baltic Sea still represents a eutrofied body of water. To further reduce P losses from agriculture, current P abatement methods must be amended with additional techniques. One such technique involves the use of P-retaining materials as filters placed in ditches within agricultural areas. This study encompasses a set of laboratory, meso- and large-scale set-ups to identify potential P-retaining materials available in Finland for the treatment of agricultural runoff. The laboratory studies investigated the P retention potential of fresh and weathered Ca-rich (Sachtofer PR®, steel slag, Filtra P®, Filtralite P®) as well as Fe-rich materials (mine drainage residual - MDR) in flow-through tests when applying a high influent P concentration of 50 mg/l. The weathering process served to leach out soluble species such as Ca 2 + and OH-, thus mimicking aged filters. In addition, desorption/dissolution tests involved the placement of P-saturated materials in solutions of variable pH as well as one-month extraction with large volumes of water. Sachtofer PR®, steel slag, Filtra P® and MDR retained relatively large amounts of P, varying between 12 and 24 mg P/g material. As desorption/dissolution tests show, two distinct mechanisms controlled the materials retention of P: precipitation of Ca-phosphates and sorption of P onto Fe-hydroxide surfaces. As the most promising material, Sachtofer PR® was further employed in meso- (20 kg) and large-scale (7 tons) filters that treated influents with significantly lower P concentrations, up to 6 mg/l and 0. 25 mg/l, respectively. The feed solution in the meso-scale filter alternated between P-enriched tap and river waters, whereas the large filter treated agricultural runoff from 17 ha of cropland. As the application of Sachtofer was scaled up, and influent P concentration declined, cumulative P retention decreased from 19 mg P/g in the laboratory to 0. 06 mg P/g in the field. The meso-scale experiment indicated that the P removal efficiency decreased also due to the presence of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the influents; the filter retained about 10 % of the total amount of DOC added to the system. As for the large filter, the formation of preferential water pathways resulting from material decomposition and freezing-thawing cycles greatly reduced its efficiency. Moreover, in high flow conditions during spring snowmelts or high rainfalls, the large filter treated {{only a small portion of}} the incoming flow; the estimated treated flow during the entire test period was about 20 %. Maintaining a low effluent limit is rather challenging, and such techniques should instead serve to remove a significant part (e. g., 30 - 40 %) of the dissolved mass of P in agricultural runoff. To justify the potential P recovery from <b>spent</b> <b>filters</b> and to ensure cost-efficiency, the P-retaining material should reach a significant P saturation. In addition, P removal structures should be coupled with other best management practices to minimize losses of P from agriculture.

40|$|Coagulation is an {{effective}} pre-treatment process in membrane filtration for recycling <b>spent</b> <b>filter</b> backwash water (SFBW). To optimize {{the operation of the}} coagulation/filtration process for SFBW recycling, {{it is important to understand}} the critical role of coagulation mechanism on membrane filtration. In this study, SFBW samples were coagulated with polyaluminum chloride (PACI), followed by a dead-end micro-filtration (MF), and the mean permeate flux and permeate quality were determined. The results showed that pre-coagulation improved the flux decline and the degree of the improvement was closely related to coagulation mechanisms. The permeate flux was enhanced most effectively by precipitation charge neutralization (PCN) coagulation, followed by charge neutralization and then sweep flocculation. Close examination of cake properties indicated that the reduced cake resistance (R(c)) was subjected to the coagulated SFBW flocs in response to different coagulation mechanism. Smaller flocs, induced by PCN, were more compact and stronger, forming less compressible cake, which facilitated membrane filtration, while slower membrane filtration was observed when more compressible cake formed from larger flocs of looser and weaker structure. Coagulation mechanism also governed the size distribution of SFBW floc, which is strongly related to the subsequent cake compressibility as well as membrane permeability in membrane filtration.

Plans were drawn for two disposal caverns for ILRW, one for dry LLRW, two for concentrated and DAW LLRW, and one LLRW repository for <b>spent</b> resins and <b>filters,</b> and concentrated wastes. Each cavern is designed to slope towards the entrance to prevent pooling of groundwater.|$|R
30|$|In {{a simple}} {{performance}} test, we simulated a 40  ×  40 scan producing 1600 raw data frames which were sent by a virtual FCCD {{at a rate}} of 10 Hz. At the end of the pipeline, we observed a complete reconstructed image after around 5 min. This translates into a streamlining pipeline rate of about 2 Hz, with most of the time <b>spent</b> on <b>filtering</b> and cleaning the individual frames. A significant portion of the pre-processing time is unique to the FCCD pipeline. While this rate is still far from ideal, it can be easily be sped up and scaled by using parallel execution, load-balancing strategies, and eventually through high-throughput GPU optimizations. With further improvements on the performance on the individual components as well as optimization of the network communication, we expect a substantial increase of the processing rate.|$|R

[...] "The sharpness of his drawings is <b>spent</b> by Renaissance <b>filters</b> and has that agility and good taste who always carry him to look in beautiful women the elegant postures and dance steps, or to recreate with a firm and tender line the strength of men and women that fight and dream, the revolts, the Quixotes of all times." ...|$|R
5000|$|Is Anyone Up? {{was founded}} in late 2010. Founder Hunter Moore stated that {{the idea for the}} site came from a woman who {{continually}} sent him exposed pictures. He then created a blog hosting nude photographs from anyone and it eventually became isanyoneup.com. As of November 2011, the website was netting as much as $13,000 monthly. Moore said that he spent generally 12 hours, five days a week managing posts, and that the website had over 30 million page views a month. Another partner, Sam Boyd, also <b>spent</b> timemoderating and <b>filtering</b> requests.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHaploops nirae is a gregarious tubiculous amphipod {{that uses}} its {{two pairs of}} {{antennae}} to filter particles from the water column. Recent sonar mappings of Haploops seabeds revealed that thousands of hectares of softbottom muddy sediments in South Brittany coastal ecosystems are now colonized by this amphipod. The present study investigates (1) {{the structure of the}} feeding organs and the mechanisms involved in particle capture, (2) the effect of environmental parameters (current velocity, turbidity and food concentration) on the feeding activity of H. nirae, quantified by the percentage of active individuals, the frequency of antennae beats and the number and duration of feeding events and (3) the retention efficiency and clearance rate of H. nirae individuals, so extrapolation to colonized areas and grazing impact of this species can be estimated. Staining techniques and scanning electron microscopy revealed that Haploops antennae have a more complex structure than congeneric Ampelisca species, involving long setae bearing short setules and that mucus is involved in particle capture. An increase in current velocity seemed to have very little effect on feeding activity but unexpectedly slightly increased the frequency of antennae beats. However, an increase in both organic and inorganic matter both exponentially increased the number of filtering individuals and showed that Haploops are well adapted to feed in turbid conditions: the total time individuals <b>spent</b> <b>filtering</b> remained constant while inorganic particulate matter increased from 10. 7 to 85. 6 mg. L- 1. Using a flow-through system, evaluation of retention efficiency showed that only particles larger than 20 mu m equivalent spherical diameter were 100 % retained by feeding structures, which corresponds to the mean distance between two setules. Clearance rate was estimated at 14. 6 +/- 0. 4 mL. h(- 1). ind(- 1) or standardized to 25. 2 +/- 0. 7 L. h(- 1). g(- 1) dry weight. Those values are discussed in light of values obtained in other suspension-feeding species and also extrapolated to the whole Haploops community. We estimated that Haploops have the capacity to filter the entire water column in 4 - 5 days and a volume of water equivalent to the whole bay in 29 - 30 days. This study provides evidence that changes in the spatial extent of Haploops communities may have serious impacts within coastal ecosystem they have colonized...|$|R
40|$|Process mining aims at {{discovering}} {{new knowledge}} {{based on information}} hidden in event logs. Two important enablers for such analysis are powerful process mining techniques and the omnipresence of event logs in today's information systems. Most information systems supporting (structured) business processes (e. g. ERP, CRM, and workflow systems) record events in some form (e. g. transaction logs, audit trails, and database tables). Process mining techniques use event logs {{for all kinds of}} analysis, e. g., auditing, performance analysis, process discovery, etc. Although current process mining techniques/tools are quite mature, the analysis they support is somewhat limited because it is purely based on labels in logs. This means that these techniques cannot benefit from the actual semantics behind these labels which could cater for more accurate and robust analysis techniques. Existing analysis techniques are purely syntax oriented, i. e., much time is <b>spent</b> on <b>filtering,</b> translating, interpreting, and modifying event logs given a particular question. This paper presents the core building blocks necessary to enable semantic process mining techniques/tools. Although the approach is highly generic, we focus on a particular process mining technique and show how this technique can be extended and implemented in the ProM framework tool...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cigarette filters trap a {{significant}} portion of carcinogen-containing smoke particulate and may provide an indication of cigarette constituent exposure. A technique for quantifying filter tar staining with digital imaging has shown predictive value between typical total puff volume and filter tar stain intensity. The current study uses smoking topography data acquired during an examination of compen-satory smoking of Quest cigarettes and digital analyses of the tar stains of the <b>spent</b> Quest cigarette <b>filters.</b> Due to reduced nicotine levels, we hypothesized compensatory smoking to occur. The purposes of the current study were to describe the physical characteristics of the Quest cigarettes, to further validate the effect of puff volume on filter tar staining, and to examine the effect of compensatory smoking on change...|$|R
