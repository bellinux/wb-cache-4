In particular, a focus is placed on how these models can have utility within the context of working robotic systems. Behavior-based control serves as the primary vehicle through which emotions and motivations are integrated into robots ranging from hexapods to wheeled robots to humanoids. Starting from relatively low-level organisms, such as the <b>sowbug</b> and praying mantis, and then moving upward to human interactions, a progression of motivational/emotional models and robotic experiments is reported. These capture a wide set of affective phenomena including social attachment, emotional behavior in support of interspecies interaction, multiscale temporal affect, and various motivational drives such as hunger and fear.

Although they may {{occasionally}} invade the home, they normally prefer moist areas outdoors at the soil surface in mulched flowerbeds, leaf litter, grass clippings and other debris around foundations. However, cracks between slabs and porches and in basement walls provide excellent hiding places from which these occasional invaders can enter homes. These pests do not pose an economic or health threat to humans, but some <b>sowbugs</b> occasionally damage roots or the tender stems of plants. Millipedes and centipedes rarely damage seedlings. <b>Sowbugs,</b> pillbugs and millipedes do not harm humans or other animals, and centipedes usually are too small to injure humans.

40|$|Longterm {{climate changes}} are an inseparable {{part of the}} {{evolution}} of Earth. In the last few milions of years the changing of glacials and interglacials was as ordinary and regular phenomenon as changing from day to night or from spring to summer. These cycles also have similar influance on evolution of nature on Earth. Eventhough the state of nature appears to us stable for the few last human generations, the reality from the long term point of view is differnt. During these cycles, the location of climatic zones, size of glaciers, deserts, savannahs, steppes or rainforests have changed. Organisms changed locations of their areas of distribution, many nowadays widespread species were pushed into isolated local populations. This Master's thesis reveals the impact of glacial cycles on a freshwater crustacean aquatic Isopod (Asellus aquaticus). Very variable mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced within 139 individuals of this species from 62 different localities in Europe.

40|$|That {{ecological}} and evolutionary processes {{can take place}} on the same time scale is a recent insight. Today we also know that they are directly linked to each other. In the lake Tåkern, in year 2000, there was a structural change when phytoplankton declined and submerged vegetation, mainly stoneworts began to spread. This led to evolutionary changes in the aquatic <b>sowbug,</b> Asellus aquaticus which had previously been limited to the reed, most likely feeding on detritus. But then, sowbugs could exploit the new habitat in stoneworts and a new food resource in terms of periphyton. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the differentiation of the populations has led to specialization in the ecological roles of sowbugs as shredder of coarse detritus and grazer of periphyton. The study was a laboratory experiment in which groups of sowbugs were feeding on decomposing alder (Alnus glutinosa) leaves or periphyton growing on tiles. The results showed that there was no specialization in the habitat-specific food. However, reed animals had a greater (31 %) grazing effect than the stonewort animal on periphyton. There was also a non-significant tendency for reed animals to consume more leaves than the stonewort animals. The conclusion is that the different populations are not different in their functional roles, but the reed animals consume approximate 25 % more food than the stonewort animals, possibly because of higher activity...|$|E

The diets of the adults are more wide-ranging than the larvae because of the amount of habitat that can be exploited, both terrestrial and aquatic. The movements of juveniles and adults usually occurs in the first hour after dark, when they emerge from under their retreats and forage along the stream bank or forest floor.
