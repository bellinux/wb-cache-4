40|$|The {{insufficient}} {{supply of}} <b>serviced</b> <b>land</b> at affordable {{prices for the}} urban poor {{and the need for}} regularization of the consequent illegal occupations in urban areas are two of the most important issues on the Latin American land policy agenda. Taking a structural/integrated view on the functioning of the urban land market in Latin America, this paper discusses the nexus between the formal and the informal land markets. It thus exposes the perverse feedback effects that curative regularization policies may have on the process by which irregularity is produced in the first place. The paper suggests that a more effective approach to the provision of <b>serviced</b> <b>land</b> for the poor cannot be resolved within the prevailing (curative) regularization programs. These programs should have the capacity to mobilize the resources that do exist into a comprehensive program that links regularization with fiscal policy, including the exploration of value capture mechanisms...|$|E

In addition, increasing housing informality, coupled by uncollected refuse {{and the proliferation of}} the informal sector activities sum-up the limitations of sustainable land governance options. Because of these challenges, the urban populace is often in limbo with reverence to what they can do for themselves as they are caught in between forces of market and state failures in efficient land delivery.|$|E

30|$|The {{governments in}} all the {{reviewed}} cities should amend land acts and policies to include alternative and innovate tenure systems that can carter for {{the interest of the}} poor in urban areas and make documentation of rights to land easy, cheap and simple to understand. As a stopgap, the rights of tenure of those occupying public land in the informal settlements should be respected by invoking the bill of rights, which gives them a right to shelter. Under conditions of rapid urbanisation, competition for secure and <b>serviced</b> <b>land</b> increases. This places pressure on existing tenure systems and requires governments to formulate policies, which encourage efficient land use and improve accessibility to land, without sidelining the urban poor. The central policy issue, hence, becomes what forms of land tenure best achieve these objectives of efficiency and equity (Yusuf et al., 2009).|$|E

40|$|For {{decades the}} land {{market in the}} Netherlands has been {{dominated}} by an active municipal land policy. Municipalities acquire land, service the land into lots ready for development and develop the desired infrastructure. These lots are sold to developers for further construction. During periods of growth on the housing market, this strategy proved highly profitable. However, now that the financial and economic crises have caused the housing market to shrink, <b>serviced</b> <b>land</b> has become less valuable. The acquired lands have become a heavy stone around their neck and multiple municipalities are expected to find themselves in serious financial problems in the coming years. A reevaluation of planned area developments is necessary and sustainability ambitions are likely the first to be sacrificed in an attempt to keep projects financially feasible. The question is whether new financial instruments can be used or developed for a project to still meet its sustainability ambitions. The article explores the potential sustainability instruments in three steps...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis explores some of {{the issues}} {{surrounding}} the Tunisian experience with the implementation of two USAID funded shelter projects. A national land development agency, the AFH, had primary responsibility for the oversight of both projects. The first project, a traditional Sites and Services Project, was perceived as a failure because it experienced a series of delays, many of which were attributed to AFH's lengthy production cycle for <b>serviced</b> <b>land.</b> The second project, a small scale Pilot Project, was an effort to circumvent AFH's operations by contracting out {{a major part of the}} project implementation to a private sector developer. Although the Pilot Project did not directly address many of the specific problems of the Sites and Services Project, its success in reducing the length of the project cycle led to the characterization of the project as more "successful " than its Sites and Services predecessor. My study suggests a different interpretation of AFH's project experiences. Th...|$|E
40|$|Providing enough new <b>serviced</b> <b>land</b> in {{our cities}} and towns {{is the key to}} {{successfully}} accommodating our growing population, and is a major challenge for policy makers at all levels of government. This is the seventh edition of the annual State of the Land Report prepared by the Urban Development Institute of Australia. Unlike in previous years, this years’ report has been undertaken in partnership with Charter Keck Cramer and Research 4, which have provided land supply and market performance data from the National Land Survey Program (further details in the last section of this report). This ground breaking partnership allows data sourced from developers on the ground across the country to bring a new level of reliability, consistency and depth to the Report. The modest upswing in development industry activity that we saw emerging in 2013 continued to gather momentum throughout last year, and as a result, 2014 was a strong year for industry, and for new land supply. Nationally, the NLSP data sample indicates that 50, 150 new greenfield lots were released over the 2014 calendar year, up 31 % from 38, 350 in 2013, and the highest level of new releases since the global financial crisis. Despite low interest rates and strong market demand, at the national level, new lot prices have remained largely in check across most cities, with the notable exceptions of Sydney and Perth. As noted in previous years’ State of the Land Reports, median lot sizes across most cities have continued their downward march, a reflection of changing market preferences, land constraints, and affordability pressures. 2015 is currently shaping up to be another good year for the development industry and for new land supply, with continued strong demand and high levels of market activity, with the exception of South Australia. However despite recent improvements, most cities across Australia still face major constraints when it comes to new land supply. Governments cannot afford to be complacent. They must undertake the necessary actions to improve planning systems, increase infrastructure investment, and reduce red tape, to ensure the availability of sufficient <b>serviced</b> <b>land</b> to deliver affordable housing, and to support jobs and economic activity in the development industry...|$|E
