5|$|Salisbury rail crash (1906), a LSWR boat {{train from}} Plymouth's Friary railway station to London Waterloo station failed to {{navigate}} a very <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> {{at the eastern}} end of Salisbury railway station.|$|E
5|$|The CNR {{adopted the}} inquiry recommendations, {{installing}} block signalling {{in the area}} of the accident. In 1953, it modernised its passenger fleet, ordering 302new cars. In later years, the line was rerouted to eliminate the <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> on which the disaster took place.|$|E
5|$|After the accident, the CNR {{installed}} block signals on {{the stretch}} of track on which the crash occurred. The railway later realigned the main line in that area, eliminating a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> that prevented crews from seeing oncoming trains. Diefenbaker's successful defence of Atherton became an asset in his political rise. A number of monuments honour the dead.|$|E
50|$|Easing <b>Sharp</b> <b>Curves</b> - Widening or {{lengthening}} of <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> on {{the elevated}} system, which hinders the speed potential of modern rapid transit cars. Estimated cost of eliminating <b>sharp</b> <b>curves,</b> $6,400,000.|$|R
50|$|The trains {{promoted}} by Pihl had a centre buffer-coupling {{more suited to}} <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> than the original twin buffer and chain model developed by Stephenson. No attempt {{appears to have been}} made to introduce these couplings and <b>sharper</b> <b>curves</b> to standard-gauge lines, although trams which have extremely <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> usually have some kind of centre coupling.|$|R
50|$|Gradients on <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> are {{effectively}} a bit steeper than the same gradient on straight track, so {{to compensate for}} this and make the ruling grade uniform throughout, the gradient on those <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> should be reduced slightly.|$|R
5|$|New London has an {{unconventional}} platform layout {{due to the}} State Street grade crossing and its location on a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve.</b> The two Northeast Corridor tracks (Tracks 1 and 2) are next to the station, while the New England Central Railroad (formerly Central Vermont) freight track (Track 6) is further away.|$|E
5|$|SR666 {{begins at}} a traffic signal with SR60 and SR146, on the {{northeast}} side of Zanesville. The route heads east as a two-lane highway, before curving northeast. While passing through Zanesville the route passes woodland, with some commercial businesses. The highway makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> due west, before another <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> northeast. After the second curve the route leaves Zanesville, running parallel to the Muskingum River and an Ohio Central Railroad track. The road makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> northwest and passes under the Ohio Central Railroad track. After passing under the railroad track the route curves north-northeast and the railroad track curves due east. The roadway passes through the Zanesville State Forest Nursery, followed by a curve northwest, passing through the state forest nursery again. After leaving the state forest nursery, the highway passes through farmland heading due north. The route curves northeast passing through the state forest nursery {{for the last time}} and the highway has an intersection with County Road 40 (CR40), in rural Jefferson Township. Following this intersection, SR666 turns due west, before curving towards the north. This section of roadway passes mostly through farmland, with wooded areas when the route is close to the river. SR666 ends at an intersection with SR208 near Dresden, on the east bank of the Muskingum River.|$|E
5|$|Both NEC tracks have {{high-level}} platforms, {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low platforms). The southbound NEC track is served by a low platform behind the station, {{which leads to a}} short high-level platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC track is served by a high-level platform behind the station building; the low platform south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the <b>sharp</b> <b>curve,</b> the high-level platforms are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid scraping the ends of train cars, and thus bridge plates are needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E
50|$|KMRL has {{proposed}} an elevated route spanning 25.253 km from Aluva to Petta with 23 stations. All platforms will be 70 m long. There will be 17 <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> along the route; the <b>sharpest</b> <b>curve</b> {{will have a}} radius of 120 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{line has}} {{numerous}} <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> from the line's origins as a tramway, built and opened by its predecessor Minoo Arima Electric Tramway (Minoo Arima Denki Kido).

5|$|Now {{travelling}} {{parallel to}} and immediately {{west of the}} Halton–Peel regional boundary and Oakville–Mississauga city boundary, the six-lane Highway407 progresses northwest alongside a power transmission corridor, with subdivisions {{to the east and}} greenspace to the west. The route continues as such northwest to Highway401, passing under Lower Base Line (which continues east as Eglinton Avenue) and interchanging at Britannia Road and Derry Road before crossing the Canadian Pacific Railway's (CP) Galt Subdivision. At Highway401, the route makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> to the northeast, while ramps weave across both freeway over several kilometres, interconnecting them. It enters Peel Region at the Winston Churchill Boulevard (Peel Regional Road19) overpass and follows another power transmission corridor just north of the Brampton–Mississauga boundary.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} crashed into a tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve.</b> After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E
5|$|The first {{identified}} {{tropical storm}} {{of the season}} is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as having formed on June 24, positioned in the western Caribbean Sea; the estimate for this location was based on ship reports, although the information was insufficient to guarantee an accurate position. It initially meandered west-northwestward, though began to turn northwest during {{the latter half of}} following day. Late on June 26, it passed between the Yucatán Peninsula and Cuba, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Mexico shortly thereafter. The tropical storm continued to slowly intensify, and started to make <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> towards the northeast on June 28.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sharp</b> <b>curves</b> {{constitute}} a significant safety risk. The question {{is if it}} is possible to design <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> {{in such a way that}} drivers pass them with greater safety margins? In this work we studied if the drivers´ choice of speed and side acceleration will change with the location of the centre of rotation for banking of <b>sharp</b> <b>curves.</b> Influence of training was studied by repetition of the first experimental session during each of the following three working days for all subjects. The study was carried out in VTI´s driving simulator (Model I). The results show firstly, that the location of the centre of rotation for banking of <b>sharp</b> <b>curves</b> influenced the drivers´ choice of speed and side acceleration and secondly, that these results were not influenced by training...|$|R

5|$|A {{storm of}} {{potentially}} Cape Verde origin was {{detected in the}} Virgin Islands at 1800UTC on August5. Initially moving westward, the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity before making a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> towards the north on August8. The storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward direction on August9. Shortly after, the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern-day Category1hurricane. The hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina at 2030UTC on September21. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), equivalent to a modern-day Category2hurricane. Once inland, the tropical cyclone gradually weakened, and recurved northeastward before dissipating over the Appalachian Mountains on August14.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, an extratropical cyclone {{developed}} into a tropical depression off {{the west coast of}} Florida. Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. Early on August 4, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. Ships {{in the vicinity of the}} storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. After reaching hurricane strength on August 5 south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a modern-day Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg) at 0600 UTC on August 7. The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass, Texas later that day at peak strength. Once inland, the storm executed a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> to the north and quickly weakened, degenerating into a tropical storm on August 8 before dissipating over Arkansas on August 10.|$|E
5|$|The 1940 Louisiana {{hurricane}} caused record flooding {{across much}} of the Southern United States in August1940. The second tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from a frontal low off the west coast of Florida on August3. Initially a weak disturbance, it moved generally westward, slowly gaining in intensity. Early on August4, the depression attained tropical storm intensity. Ships {{in the vicinity of the}} storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested. After reaching hurricane strength on August5 south of the Mississippi River Delta, the storm strengthened further into a Category2hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg) at 0600UTC on August7.

5|$|The {{portions}} of Queens Chapel Road south of Ager Road {{and north of}} Hamilton Street were originally designated MD 210 and MD 500, respectively. The portion of modern Queens Chapel Road from south of Ager Road to Hamilton Street originally did not exist. Instead, Queens Chapel Road turned north along what is now Jamestown Road, then made a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> east onto modern Hamilton Street. The highway had a T intersection with Ager Road and continued east to another T intersection where the road turned north while Hamilton Street continued east into Hyattsville. Ager Road, Hamilton Street, and the portion of Queens Chapel Road connecting them were part of MD 209, which was renumbered {{as an extension of}} MD 410 by 1946; MD 210 was renumbered as an extension of MD 500 at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Following this exit, {{the road}} becomes eight lanes again and crosses over the Bronx River Parkway, the Bronx River, and Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line. Here, the road crosses into White Plains and reaches an {{interchange}} with NY22. Past NY22, I-287 makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> {{to the south}} as it narrows to six lanes and runs near inhabited neighborhoods. The road has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with the Central Westchester Parkway, a road that provides access to the Taconic State Parkway by way of NY22. The freeway runs past commercial areas {{to the east of}} downtown White Plains as it encounters Westchester Avenue, which connects to NY119, NY127, and Anderson Hill Road as well as The Westchester shopping mall in the downtown area. Within this interchange, the Cross-Westchester Expressway turns east along the border between Harrison to the north and White Plains to the south. Westchester Avenue becomes a frontage road for I-287 as the road passes corporate parks to the north and populated neighborhoods to the south.|$|E
25|$|At the T-intersection, SR189 turns {{towards the}} southwest, {{concurrent}} with SR190. The road passes through commercial properties, before the concurrency ends with SR189 turning towards the southeast. SR189 crosses the Auglaize River {{and leaves the}} village of Fort Jennings. The road heads east-southeast through farmland as a two-lane highway. The highway cross over the Ottawa River and enters Rimer. SR189 makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> towards the south, followed by a <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> towards the east. The road makes another <b>sharp</b> <b>curve</b> towards the south, after leaving Rimer the road curves towards the southeast, paralleling the Ottawa River.
