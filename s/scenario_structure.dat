50|$|The {{notion of}} meta-explanation is {{important}} in behavioral scenarios that involve conflicting agents. In these scenarios, implicit of or explicit conflict {{can be caused by}} contradictory agents' interests, as communicated in their explanations for why they behaved in a particular way, by a lack of knowledge of the situation, or by a mixture of explanations of multiple factors. In many cases to assess the plausibility of explanations, one must analyze two following components and their interrelations: (1) explanation at the actual object level (explanation itself) and (2) explanation at the higher level (meta-explanation). Comparative analysis of the roles of both is conducted to assess the plausibility of how agents explain the scenarios of their interactions. Object-level explanation assesses the plausibility of individual claims by using a traditional approach to handle argumentative structure of a dialog. Meta-explanation links the structure of a current scenario with that of previously learned scenarios of multi-agent interaction. The <b>scenario</b> <b>structure</b> includes agents' communicative actions and argumentation defeat relations between the subjects of these actions. The data for both object-level and meta-explanation can be visually specified,and a plausibility of how agent behavior in a scenario can be visually explained. Meta-explanation in the form of machine learning of <b>scenario</b> <b>structure</b> can be augmented by conventional explanation by finding arguments in the form of defeasibility analysis of individual claims, to increase the accuracy of plausibility assessment.|$|E

Uncertainties around technical learning rates; consumer behaviour; and the strategic interactions of governments, automakers and fuel providers are particularly acute. System dynamics and agent-based models, and studies of historical alternative fuel transitions, have furthered our understanding of possible transition dynamics, but these types of analysis exclude broader systemic issues concerning energy system evolution (e. g. supplies and prices of low-carbon energy) and the politics of transitions. This paper presents a hybrid approach to assessing hydrogen transitions in the UK, by linking qualitative scenarios with quantitative energy systems modelling using the UK MARKAL model. Three possible transition pathways are explored, each exploring different uncertainties and possible decision points, with modelling used to inform and test key elements of each scenario. The scenarios draw on literature review and participatory input, and the <b>scenario</b> <b>structure</b> is based on archetypal transition dynamics drawn from historical energy system transitions, reflecting insights relating to innovation system development and resistance to change.

Systems Engineering and Analysis cohort 10 (SEA 10) developed a cost-effective system of systems which increased battlespace awareness and situational responsiveness for 2010. Riverine missions were decomposed into their functional, physical, and operational architectures using the detect-to-engage sequence. This analysis determined critical RF functions. Critical functions detect and engage were then physically represented by feasible force package alternatives that augmented the baseline RF. SEA 10 analyzed these alternatives using agent based models to identify baseline RF capability gaps and provide insights into possible solutions.

40|$|International audienceSafety {{analysis}} in guided transportation systems {{is essential to}} avoid rare but potentially catastrophic accidents. This article presents a quantitative probabilistic model that integrates Safety Integrity Levels (SIL) for evaluating the safety of such systems. The standardized SIL indicator allows the safety requirements of each safety subsystem, function and/or piece of equipment to be specified, making SILs pivotal parameters in safety evaluation. However, different interpretations of SIL exist, and faced with the complexity of guided transportation systems, the current SIL allocation methods are inadequate for the task of safety assessment. To remedy these problems, the model developed in this paper seeks to verify, during the design phase of guided transportation system, {{whether or not the}} safety specifications established by the transport authorities allow the overall safety target to be attained (i. e., if the SIL allocated to the different safety functions are sufficient to ensure the required level of safety). To meet this objective, the model is based both on the operating situation concept and on Monte Carlo simulation. The former allows safety systems to be formalized and their dynamics to be analyzed in order to show the evolution of the system in time and space, and the latter make it possible to perform probabilistic calculations based on the <b>scenario</b> <b>structure</b> obtained...|$|E

40|$|In the {{development}} of a large-scale multimedia application, the design of the overall <b>scenario</b> <b>structure</b> {{is as important as the}} quality of each media content. With current authoring systems, authors cannot start the authoring process and proceed until the media contents are created. Moreover, the overall structure of the application cannot be evaluated until the end. Also, there is not enough support in the early-stage design phase for flexibly constructing the framework and meeting the size/speed limitations of the final application. We have developed an authoring system called Anecdote in order to support the early-design phase as well as the whole development process of multimedia applications. Anecdote employs the concept of surrogate media and surrogate scene. Surrogate media is a type of media, such as sketches, to represent the content of the media data to be created. Surrogate scene can be a design sketch of a screen representing a segment of the application structure. Both can be used to simulate the execution of the scenario and can serve as the specification of the data to be created.

40|$|Abstract Introduction In this work, {{the effect}} of a dynamic visual {{stimulation}} (DS) protocol was used to induce egomotion, the center of pressure (COP) displacement response. Methods DS was developed concerning the <b>scenario</b> <b>structure</b> (chessboard-pattern floor and furniture) and luminance. To move the scenario in a discrete forward (or backward) direction, the furniture is expanded (or reduced) and the black and white background is reversed during floor translation while the luminance is increased (or reduced) by steps of 2 cd/m 2. This protocol was evaluated using COP signals from 29 healthy volunteers: standing on a force platform observing the virtual scene (1. 72 × 1. 16 m) projected 1 m ahead (visual incidence angle: &# 952;l = 81. 4 ° and &# 952;v = 60. 2 °), which moves with constant velocity (2 m/s) during 250 ms. A set of 100 DS was applied in random order, interspersed by a 10 s of static scene. Results The Tukey post-hoc test (p < 0. 001) indicated egomotion in the same direction of DS. COP displacement increased over stimulation (8. 4 ± 1. 7 to 22. 6 ± 5. 3 mm), as well as time to recover stability (4. 1 ± 0. 4 to 7. 2 ± 0. 6 s). The peak of egomotion during DSF occurred 200 ms after DSB (Wilcoxon, p = 0. 002). Conclusion The dynamic configuration of this protocol establishes virtual flow effects of linear egomotion dependent on the direction of the dynamic visual stimulation. This finding indicates the potential application of the proposed virtual dynamic stimulation protocol to investigate the cortical visual evoked response in postural control studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} public {{awareness}} of environmental issues has increased dramatically. This awareness has resulted in increased governmental control of related matters, for example, of waste and of industrial emissions. Consumer and legislative pressures are forcing manufacturers to broaden the manufacturing system to include product take back and recovery. A take-back system necessitates good logistics and information systems. This thesis proposes a decision support system that assists in decision-making in relation to end-of-life (EOL) products. There are several options at the end-of-life of a product: reuse/part reclamation, remanufacturing, recycling, incineration (with or without energy recovery) or discard to landfill. Each option has an economic and an environmental impact. The impacts are described by indicators that have specific values for each option. Decision-makers - who may be recycling companies, original equipment manufacturers or local authorities - need to determine which option, or combination of options, is best in a given situation. A mathematical model to assist in this decision is proposed. The model is based on vectors that contain indicators’ values for each EOL option. A generic EOL scenario, which may comprise a combination of EOL options is expressed as a linear combination of options. This modelling approach permits the use of linear algebra tools in expressing and solving problems related to EOL scenario of products such as: calculate the best <b>scenario</b> <b>structure</b> given the targets set by the EU WEEE Directive and the EOL options vectors; solve ‘What I f situations; when used in combination with a multi-criteria analysis method (such as AHP), identify the best EOL option from an environmental and economic point of view.

40|$|Sustainability {{research}} studies the dynamics and prospects of co-evolving human and ecological systems, {{a subject of}} inherent complexity and deep uncertainty. While work proceeds on facets of the overall problem, an overarching theoretical framework for giving coherence to this new discipline is lacking. Scenario analysis has been proposed as a promising integrative approach, while a recent wave of studies has significantly improved scenario methods. Still, these studies remain most compelling in their opening frames, where quantitative modeling can track unfolding trends, and their closing frames, where qualitative description can provide rich descriptions of long-term social visions. Not surprisingly, given the formidable uncertainties, the trajectories between "now" and "then", remain poorly specified, if addressed at all. This paper suggests {{ways of thinking about}} these pathways and pivots, the "world lines" through the terra incognita between current global realities and alternative futures. It outlines and illustrates a macro-framework, drawing fresh insight into the requirements for a transition to sustainability. It discusses major analytic elements - a systemic perspective, a <b>scenario</b> <b>structure,</b> critical uncertainties, human agency - and combines them into depictions of the broad contours of possible pathways. The analysis highlights two key uncertainties: the form of forthcoming crises and the quality of human response to global challenges. If institutional and cultural innovation fails to mute the precursor stressors of a systemic crisis, the world line could pivot toward a venal future. However, if the world begins to act with foresight, unity, and resolve, development would bend toward a resilient global civilization. This transition requires a sharp upswing in public awareness and engagement, a development that the evolving conditions of our planetary phase of history make possible, but by no means inevitable. Here, sustainability scenarios have a role in changing the future, as well as illuminating it, by expanding the horizon of what is thought possible and deemed desirable. The world lines framework offers a conceptual arena for advancing this effort. ...|$|E
