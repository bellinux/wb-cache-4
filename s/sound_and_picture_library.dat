40|$|Previous {{research}} in digital video orchestration has demonstrated the computer's ability to edit sequences {{based upon a}} cooperation between video databases and encoded story knowledge. These systems, however, manipulate <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> as a single unit.

MILESTONE is comprised of two modules. A video annotation component which builds upon previous {{research in}} video databases provides the means to create a knowledge representation.

5000|$|During the 2007 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Field's {{acceptance}} speech contained an antiwar sentiment: [...] "If the mothers ruled the world, {{there would be}} no goddamn wars in the first place." [...] Fox Broadcasting Company, which aired the Emmys, cut the <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> after the word [...] "god" [...] and did not cut back to the stage after Field finished talking. An e-mail statement from the company the day after the incident explained that the censorship of Field's speech (among two other censorship incidents during the award ceremony) occurred because [...] "some language during the live broadcast may have been considered inappropriate by some viewers. As a result, Fox's broadcast standards executives determined it appropriate to drop <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> during those portions of the show." ...|$|R
50|$|The Indian Film Censor Board {{refused to}} give it a release {{certificate}} without a long list of <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> cuts reducing about 20 minutes of the film.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} more common to see television programmes broadcast with the <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>pictures</b> out of synchronization. Such timing errors can occur very easily today, due to video and audio signals being processed separately, for example by synchronizers and video effects units. The BBC has been concerned with signal synchronization {{for some time and}} has explored various techniques to control it. The most promising approach uses delay codes, carried within the signals themselves, to indicate the amount of delay which each signal has experienced. These codes are updated whenever a signal is further delayed by equipment, and therefore they indicate the extent of the mistiming between <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> vision at any point in the production chain. When required, typically at the point of recording or transmission, the accumulated delay values are read from the signals and used to apply a compensating delay to re-synchronize the <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>pictures...</b>|$|R
