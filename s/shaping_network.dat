40|$|Abstract — A four column Smart {{antenna array}} fed by a 4 x 4 Butler matrix {{augmented}} by a variable beam <b>shaping</b> <b>network</b> {{has been designed}} and simulated. It is demonstrated that using only three phase shifters within the beam <b>shaping</b> <b>network</b> provides dynamic beam flexibility including: four narrow switched beams, a right shaped beam, a left shaped beam and a broad broadcast channel beam. The shaped beams concentrate coverage at high capacity in either the right or left half of a sector while maintaining coverage at lower capacity over the reminder of the sector. The resultant antenna system represents an improvement in performance over a single multiple switched beam smart antenna without the cost and complexity of a fully adaptive smart antenna. Simulated radiation patterns over the full 3 G frequency band show that useful dynamic coverage & capacity enhancement can be implemented with the proposed antenna system.

40|$|Abstract — Several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to meet the demand for faster and more efficient access to the Internet. Different applications have different networking requirements. For example, realtime interactive voice requires a low latency network path, but does not require high bandwidth. QoS refers to the ability of a network to provide improved service to selected network traffic over various underlying technologies including Frame Relay, SONET, and IP-routed networks. In particular, QoS features provide improved and more predictable network service by providing the following services: Supporting dedicated bandwidth, improving loss characteristics, avoiding and managing network congestion, <b>shaping</b> <b>network</b> traffic, setting traffic priorities across the network.

40|$|Abstract—The {{opportunistic}} large array (OLA) with transmission threshold (OLA-T) is {{a simple}} form of co-operative transmission that limits node participation in broadcasts. Performance of OLA-T has been studied for disc-shaped networks. This paper analyzes OLA-T for strip-shaped networks. The results also apply to arbitrar-ily <b>shaped</b> <b>networks</b> that have previously limited node participation to a strip. The analytical results include a condition for sustained propagation, which implies a bound on the transmission threshold. OLA transmission on a strip network with and without a transmission threshold are compared in terms of total energy consumption. I...|$|R

The interplay between dendritic nonlinearities and recurrent cortical microcircuit activity in <b>shaping</b> <b>network</b> response is largely unknown. We simulated detailed conductance-based models of TTCs forming recurrent microcircuits that were interconnected as found experimentally; {{the network was}} embedded in a realistic back-ground synaptic activity. TTCs microcircuits significantly amplified brief thalamocortical inputs; this cortical gain was mediated by back-propagation activated N-methyl-D-aspartate depolarizations and dendritic back-propagation-activated Ca 2 + spike firing, ignited by the coincidence of thalamic-activated somatic spike and local dendritic synaptic inputs, originating from the cortical microcircuit. Surprising-ly, dendritic nonlinearities in TTCs microcircuits linearly multiplied thalamic inputs—amplifying them while maintaining input selectiv-ity. Our findings indicate that dendritic nonlinearities are pivotal in controlling the gain and the computational functions of TTCs micro-circuits, which serve as a dominant output source for the neocortex...|$|E
