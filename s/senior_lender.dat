40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} optimal debt structure when the moral hazard problem is severe. The main {{idea is that the}} optimal debt contract delegates monitoring. to a single <b>senior</b> <b>lender</b> and that seniority allows the monitoring <b>senior</b> <b>lender</b> to appropriate the full return from his monitoring activities. The theory explains (i) why debt contracts are prioritized, (ii) why short-term debt is senior to long-term debt, and (iii) why financial intermediaries usually hold short-term senior debt whereas long-term junior debt is widely held. Another implication of the theory is that covenant and maturity structures will be set to conform to the seniority structure...|$|E
40|$|Federal {{bankruptcy}} law is rarely used by distressed small businesses. For every 100 that suspend operations, at most 20 file for bankruptcy. The rest use state law procedures to liquidate or reorganize. This paper documents {{the importance of}} these procedures and the conditions under which they are chosen using firm-level data on Chicago-area small businesses. I show that business owners bargain with senior lenders over the resolution of financial distress. Federal {{bankruptcy law}} is invoked only when bargaining fails. This tends to occur when {{there is more than one}} <b>senior</b> <b>lender</b> or when the debtor has defaulted on senior debt (harming trust-based relationships with lenders). These findings raise questions about the design of and need for federal bankruptcy law. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} {{collateral}} {{plays an important}} role in the design of debt contracts, the provision of credit, and the incentives of lenders to monitor borrowers. Using a unique data set from a large bank containing timely assessments of collateral values, we find that the bank responded to a legal reform that exogenously reduced collateral values by increasing interest rates, tightening credit limits, and reducing the intensity of its monitoring of borrowers and collateral, spurring borrower delinquency on outstanding claims. We thus explain why banks are <b>senior</b> <b>lenders</b> and quantify the value of claimant priority...|$|R

50|$|Mezzanine {{capital is}} often a more {{expensive}} financing source for a company than secured debt or senior debt. The higher cost of capital associated with mezzanine financings {{is the result of}} its being an unsecured, subordinated (or junior) obligation in a company's capital structure (i.e., in the event of default, the mezzanine financing is only repaid after all senior obligations have been satisfied). Additionally, mezzanine financings, which are usually private placements, are often used by smaller companies and may involve greater overall levels of leverage than issues in the high-yield market; they thus involve additional risk. In compensation for the increased risk, mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or more <b>senior</b> <b>lenders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, {{in various}} jurisdictions and circumstances, {{nominally}} [...] "senior" [...] debt may not {{rank pari passu}} with all other senior obligations. For example, in the 2008 Washington Mutual Bank seizure, all assets and most (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank's liabilities were assumed by JPMorgan Chase. However other debt claims, including unsecured senior debt, were not. By doing this, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) effectively subordinated the unsecured senior debt to depositors, thereby fully protecting depositors while also eliminating any potential deposit insurance liability to the FDIC itself. In this and similar cases, specific regulatory and oversight powers can lead to <b>senior</b> <b>lenders</b> being subordinated in potentially unexpected ways.|$|R

Similar regimes exist in other jurisdictions.|$|R
