5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> dead.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online {{about the lack of}} female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, was in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci. But there was still speculation {{at the time of the}} broadcast of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com was that it was either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. Daily Variety reported that she was cast as someone new to the franchise, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> cast as Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable {{was laid}} down by John Brown & Co. at their {{shipyard}} in Clydebank on 3 November 1939 as Yard Number 565. She was launched on 8 December 1942 by Victoria of Hesse, Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven. Captain Quentin Graham was appointed to command the ship in August 1943. While fitting out, in order to confound the enemy, a ruse known as Operation Bijou, initiated by London Controlling Section, was launched whereby it was made known that Indefatigable had already entered service. Ultra decrypts revealed that the Japanese believed the deception, with operatives including Malcolm Muggeridge and Peter Fleming supplying disinformation {{for more than a}} year, sufficient to make the enemy believe the vessel had gone to the Far East and returned to the Clyde for a refit, by which time <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> finished.|$|E

5|$|Seven months later, Carl {{shows his}} boss that Frank has been forging checks all over western Europe and asks {{permission}} to go to Europe to look for him. When his boss refuses, Carl brings Frank's checks to printing professionals who claim that the checks were printed in France. From an interview with Frank's mother, Carl remembers that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> born in Montrichard, France. He goes there and locates Frank, and tells him that the French police will kill him {{if he does not}} go with Carl quietly. Frank assumes he is lying at first, but Carl promises Frank he would never lie to him, and Carl takes him outside, where the French police escort him to prison.|$|E
5|$|The IJN began reevaluating the Nagato {{design in}} light of {{lessons learned from the}} Battle of Jutland in May 1916, {{experiments}} evaluating armor protection, and newly acquired information on the protective schemes of British and American capital ships. These lessons highlighted the need for better protection of the main gun turrets and magazines, as well as thicker deck armor to protect against plunging fire. Existing methods of defense against mines and torpedoes had also proved to be inadequate and needed improvement. Eleven new designs were rejected between October and early 1917 before Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, superintendent of shipbuilding and the naval architect in charge of the fundamental design of the ships of the Eight-Eight Fleet, presented a heavily modified version of the Nagato design, A-125, to be built in lieu of the second ship of the class, Mutsu, on 12 June 1917, well before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> laid down.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{contemporaneous}} {{or nearly}} contemporaneous sources made mention of any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó. Zsuzsa Teke writes {{that they were}} born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless. Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the Illuminated Chronicle, which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that {{she gave birth to}} Charles's two daughters, because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles's two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents' death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth, the wife of BoleslausII of Troppau, was also Charles's daughter. If <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> Charles's daughter, she must have been born in about 1330, according to Kristó.|$|E

5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> receiving messages from God.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come to a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E

25|$|In 1623 she {{was arrested}} in Huamanga, Peru, because of a dispute. To prevent her {{execution}} she begged for mercy to Bishop Agustin de Carvajal, and confessed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> {{a woman who had}} been in a convent. Following a review by a group of matrons, they determined it was true that she was a woman and a virgin, the bishop protected her and she was sent to Spain.|$|E
25|$|Jane Doe B-10, {{discovered}} on March 21, 1984, is currently unidentified. Ridgway claimed {{that she was}} a white female in her early twenties and possibly had brown hair. Examination of the remains suggested that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> between twelve and eighteen, most likely around fifteen. Analysis of the victim's skeleton indicated she was probably left-handed, and had at one point in her life suffered a healed skull fracture to the left temple.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversy}} of high {{testosterone levels}} in women Olympic athletes {{became a major}} issue when Caster Semenya, a woman from South Africa, won the 800 meter run in the 2009 Field and Track Championships with a time that was faster than the men’s winner in the same event.

25|$|Pageant {{officials}} {{launched an}} investigation after rumors began to surface about her background and past. Gage lied to reporters or {{declined to comment}} when they questioned her, but a day later, she confessed the truth: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> 18, not 21, had been married twice, and was {{a mother of two}} young children. Her mother and mother- in-law confirmed to reporters that the rumors were true. As being a wife and mother were clear violations of the contest rules, Gage was immediately disqualified and stripped of her Miss USA crown.|$|E
25|$|Volage {{was built}} by Richard Chapman, of Bideford, who {{launched}} her on 23 March 1807. She sailed to the Mediterranean in October 1807, soon after commissioning in May 1807 under Captain Philip Rosenhagen. On 6 November she was off Galita Island when she captured the French cutter Succès, of ten guns and 59 men, {{under the command of}} lieutenant de vaisseau Bourdé Villehuet. According to her captain, Succès had sailed from Toulon three days earlier on a cruise; Rosenhagen suspected that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> carrying despatches that Villehuet had had time to destroy. Rosenhagen also thought that Succès may have been in British service as the Sussex.|$|E

25|$|During {{everyday}} {{interactions with}} other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, {{and when she did}} talk it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.|$|E

Sirtis and Denise Crosby initially tried out for each other's eventual roles on The Next Generation. Sirtis' character {{was going to be}} named Lt. Macha Hernandez, the Security Chief. Gene Roddenberry decided to switch them, and Macha Hernandez became Tasha Yar. Sirtis recalls that on the day she received the call offering her the role of Troi, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> packing to return to Britain, because her six-month visa had expired.|$|E

Though she is recognized as the second First Lady of the Philippines, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> the first spouse of a Philippine president to be called as such, the honorific being unknown during the presidency of Emilio Aguinaldo, and thus not applied {{at that time to}} his wife Hilaria.
