Saying, [...] "What happened to the Ralph Bakshis of the world? We're all <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> talking family entertainment. Does animation have to be family entertainment? Audiences want something new; they just can't articulate what." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Baird had {{graduated}} {{within a matter}} of hours from anonymity to dubious icon. [...] One employment agency head who only hired legal household workers said, [...] "You have no idea, the frustration, <b>sitting</b> <b>here,</b> knocking your head against the wall, trying to do what's right. And then you have a Zoë Baird who exposes the fact that everybody else is breaking the law." [...] The phrase [...] "to have a Zoë Baird problem" [...] became rooted in the vocabulary of the American professional and political classes.|$|E
500|$|In April 1959, Simpson {{left for}} France with £100 savings and two Carlton bikes, one road and one track, given in {{appreciation}} of his help promoting the company. His last words {{to his mother}} before the move were, [...] "I don't want to be <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> in twenty years' time, wondering {{what would have happened}} if I hadn't gone to France". The next day, his National Service papers were delivered; although willing to serve before his move, he feared the call-up would put his potential career at risk. His mother returned them, with the hope they would understand this.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] is an {{evisceration}} of a no-good adolescent male, and {{is directed}} towards an ex-boyfriend. About the song's theme, Sean Dooley of About.com commented, [...] "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest {{to make a}} former flame feel her wrath for doing her wrong." [...] In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged {{the fact that her}} former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: [...] "There's no time for tears / I'm just <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." [...] For the refrains, she speaks of igniting fire on photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, [...] "As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn". Critics have found the song to a symbol of feminism.|$|E
500|$|When the {{situation}} in Czechoslovakia was discussed with the Politburo, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest {{for the use of}} military force. Brezhnev was aware of the dire situation he was in, and if he had abstained or voted against Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia he may have been faced with growing turmoil— domestically and in the Eastern Bloc. Archival evidence suggests that Brezhnev {{was one of the few}} who was looking for a temporary compromise with the reform-friendly Czechoslovak government when their relationship was at the brink. Significant voices in the Soviet leadership demanded the re-installation of a so-called 'revolutionary government'. After the military intervention in 1968, Brezhnev met with Czechoslovak reformer Bohumil Simon, then a member of the Politburo of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and said, [...] "If I had not voted for Soviet armed assistance to Czechoslovakia you would not be <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> today, but quite possibly I wouldn't either." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin Singer, an {{attorney}} representing Cosby, {{made a statement}} in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up {{and you have to be}} able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E

500|$|On 10 August, Patton {{entered the}} {{receiving}} tent of the hospital, {{speaking to the}} injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
500|$|About the {{re-recording}} {{of the old}} songs, Westfall said [...] "We've made a lot {{of changes}} to these songs that we play live [...] and now we're getting a chance to record it, so the people that don't get to see us live can hear it and appreciate it for what it is." [...] On the new tracks, producer Andrew Wade said [...] "I think this new stuff that we're recording is really gonna blow a lot of kids away. [...] just sound amazing, they all sound like completely different songs, and the new song is serious." [...] About the new song, [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", the band wanted to do a fast-paced song. McKinnon admitted the band [...] "kinda just winged it. But we had some little ideas from being on tour and messing around." [...] Woodard said about inspiration for the tempo of the song: [...] "We've all been listening to a lot of faster stuff like Comeback Kid and stuff like that and I don't know and just <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> one day 'let's write a fast song'." [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had appeared on the band's Myspace account, on September 21, 2007, as free for download. [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had overdubs added to it especially for the release on the For Those Who Have Heart reissue.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there just to give me a little more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Fowler {{were friends}} of Brierly, and, like him, avowed spiritists, {{but they both}} lent their best efforts to make the tests {{complete}} and convincing. After trying <b>sittings</b> <b>here</b> and there, we finally settled upon a series of afternoon sessions in Fowler's own house. This was the twenty-sixth sitting of the series, and Cameron's Amateur Psychical Society was practically a memory. I was now going ahead pretty much on my own lines, but {{with an eye to}} catching Miller and the Camerons at a successful séance before concluding my search.|$|R

2500|$|In February 2009, D'Arcy {{interviewed the}} British game show host Chris Tarrant of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? through a phoneline, in an {{incident}} which later gained media attention. Overhearing the show's team criticising the England national rugby union team beforehand, Tarrant opened the interview by saying: [...] "There's something very depressing about <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> {{listening to you}} talk about how rubbish the English team is." ...|$|E
2500|$|After being {{informed}} by intercom that a hijacking was in progress, Captain Uri Bar Lev {{decided not to}} accede to their demands:"I decided {{that we were not}} going to be hijacked. The security guy was <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> ready to jump. I told him that I was going to put the plane into negative-G mode. Everyone would fall. When you put the plane into negative, it's like being in a falling elevator. Instead of the plane flying this way, it dives and everyone who is standing falls down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{appreciate}} your position, {{but in order}} to avoid criticism, to make the tests perfect, {{it will be necessary to}} hold the <b>sittings</b> either <b>here</b> or at Weissmann's, and to exclude every one connected with Miss Lambert. In no other way can we convince ourselves or the public." ...|$|R
6000|$|Both men felt rebuked and {{the group}} again settled into silence. Suddenly, Kate began to laugh, [...] "Isn't it childish? Really, Morton, if our friends could see us <b>sitting</b> around <b>here</b> in the dark, as we are now, they would roar. Why should it all be so silly, Mr. Clarke?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear," [...] wept Mrs. Cranch, [...] "and we've been at {{the expense}} of travelling, and that poor lad <b>sitting</b> idle <b>here</b> so long!

2500|$|President Obama was {{reportedly}} unhappy with U.S. intelligence agencies following {{their failure to}} foresee the 2010–2011 Tunisian uprising and the downfall of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali {{as well as the}} Egyptian protests. Responding to criticism that the State Department had failed to see the developments in Egypt coming, Clinton defended the U.S. in an interview on Al-Arabiya, saying [...] "I don't think anybody could have predicted we'd be <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> talking {{about the end of the}} Mubarak presidency at the time that this all started." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
2500|$|In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman {{described}} his motivations for writing the book: [...] "My concern is about America.... Demand for clean energy, clean fuel and energy efficiency is clearly going to explode; it’s {{going to be}} the next great global industry.

2500|$|In early June 2014, Hermansson was {{announced}} {{as one of}} the [...] "Summer Talkers" [...] (Swedish:Sommarpratarna) for the popular Sveriges Radio P1 show Sommar i P1. Hermansson criticised the lack of diversity in Sveriges Radio's selection of hosts for the show, saying [...] "It makes me terribly angry to see how very white we are <b>sitting</b> <b>here.</b> We do not represent Sweden," [...] referring to those attending the press conference for the show. Hermansson also said that she was shocked at how [...] "Swedish" [...] the whole event was. Journalist Mustafa Can criticised Hermansson's comments {{in an article in the}} Aftonbladet newspaper.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in June 2007, potential candidate Fred Thompson criticized Reagan's immigration policy of 1986, saying: [...] "Twelve million illegal immigrants later, we are now living in a nation that is beset {{by people who are}} suicidal maniacs and want to kill countless innocent men, women and children around the world. We're <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> now with essentially open borders." [...] McCain responded,"I travel around the country extensively and that's certainly not the impression I have. I have not detected a nation full of suicidal maniacs." [...] A Thompson spokesman said he was not calling immigrants [...] "suicidal maniacs" [...] but rather saying that terrorists could infiltrate the borders.|$|E
2500|$|After three {{consecutive}} losing seasons, the Giants named Brian Sabean as their new {{general manager for}} 1997, replacing Bob Quinn. (Sabean may have been acting as GM even before the announcement, rumored as he was to have engineered the deal to get southpaw starter Kirk Rueter from the Montreal Expos.) His tenure began with great controversy. In his first official trade as GM, he shocked Giant fans by trading Matt Williams to Cleveland for what newspapers {{referred to as a}} 'bunch of spare parts', with a negative reaction great enough for him to explain publicly, [...] "I didn't get to this point by being an idiot... I'm <b>sitting</b> <b>here</b> telling you there is a plan." ...|$|E
