In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually categorized according to the part of the body where the bulk of the longest hair terminates: chin level, <b>shoulder</b> <b>length,</b> lower shoulderblade/mid-back level, waist length, hip-length, classic length (extends to almost buttock-length, i.e. upper thigh-length, where the legs meet the buttocks), thigh-length, knee-length and ankle/floor length hair.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{alternate}} video {{features a}} similar synopsis, where Houston begins singing the song {{on a large}} stone altar {{in the middle of}} an auditorium. As she finishes her verse, Carey is seen walking up the ramp in the background, joining Houston for her verse. They continue singing the song together, standing side by side and holding hands. After completing the song, both singers exit the auditorium together as in the first video, simulating two friends enjoying time with each other. Both videos are very similar, only the alternate version does not feature an audience, choir or images, only the duo singing together atop the stone altar. In this version of the video, Houston wears a long brown strapless gown, and features a <b>shoulder</b> <b>length</b> bob haircut. Carey on the otherhand, features long cascading curls and dons an olive green gown.|$|E

Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used, asking about complaints of back, neck, and/or <b>shoulders.</b> <b>Length</b> and weight of the children were determined.

5000|$|One of the corollaries of the conical {{action is}} that collets may draw the work axially a slight amount as they close. Collet chuck systems that make no {{provision}} {{to prevent this}} draw-in are often called draw-in collet chucks, in contrast to systems which circumvent this movement, usually by pushing the tapered closing ring toward the collet rather than pulling the collet into the ring. Such non-draw-in types are often called [...] "dead-length" [...] or [...] "non-draw-in" [...] collet chucks. Draw-in {{is not always a}} problem, but avoiding it can be helpful on some work where failing to account for it might result in inaccuracy on part overall <b>length,</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>lengths,</b> etc.|$|R

He was rather below the middle stature, but the breadth of his <b>shoulders,</b> <b>length</b> and brawniness of his arms, and the muscular appearance of the whole man, argued a most unusual share of strength, and a frame kept in vigour by constant exercise. His legs were somewhat bent, {{but not in a}} manner which could be said to approach to deformity, on the contrary, which seemed to correspond to the strength of his frame, though it injured in some degree its symmetry.|$|R

500|$|... 1972, it was {{estimated}} that 24% of American women wore <b>shoulder</b> <b>length</b> hair or longer (44% of women in ages 14 to 44), meaning slightly more than 12% of men and women altogether. Similar frequency was found in 2001, when it {{was estimated}} that about 13% of the US adult population, male as well as females, has hair shoulder-length or longer, about 2.4% have hair reaching {{to the bottom of the}} shoulder blades or longer, about 0.3% have hair waist length or longer, and only about 0.017% have hair buttocks-length or longer. By extrapolating the above data and the number of hair length records, the number of people with shoulder-length hair or longer in the USA is estimated to be 27 million, [...] those with waist-length hair roughly 900,000, those with buttocks-length hair to be 40,000, with knee length hair to 2,000 and with ankle length hair to 70.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, the {{popularity}} of Jamaica's reggae music and musician Bob Marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally. The anti-establishment philosophy of Rastafari, echoed {{in much of the}} reggae of the time, resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among African Americans and other Blacks, but among counterculture whites as well. Eastern Christians are encouraged [...] to wear long hair with long beard. In the 1980s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or counter-cultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as Rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged then-contemporary views of tradition. In the 2000s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts; for example, musicians in Metal bands and their fans often wear long hair. Long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization, such as Locks of Love, for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise, such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate. Today long hair has gained even more popularity. Even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back. This could in part be due to the [...] "man bun" [...] trend where men pull their <b>shoulder</b> <b>length</b> or longer hair back into a topknot Bun (hairstyle).|$|E

50|$|The {{community}} {{that grew up}} beside the dam flourished though, having a running water, electricity and every amenity they could possibly want, including stores to shop in, by comparison, the people in Sandy Bay, when they made use of these amenities, were forced {{to do it at}} <b>shoulders</b> <b>length.</b> That is, they had to be invited, and when the people shopped at the same store, they were forced to stand in line, and hand a list to the clerks through a portal, then the clerks would fill the lists for them. This was life from the building of that community to the 1970s for everyone in Sandy Bay, until the new mayor, a priest, had a hand in building the road that gave the people in Sandy Bay access to Creighton, Flin Flon and Prince Albert, where they could travel to (sometimes 200 or more miles) to shop.|$|R

2500|$|The {{length of}} ladies' evening gloves are {{referred}} to in terms of [...] "buttons", whether they in fact have buttons or not. The word is derived from French, and the exact measure is actually a bit longer than one inch. Wrist length gloves are usually eight-button, those at the elbow are 16, mid-biceps are 22 and full <b>shoulder</b> <b>length</b> are 30. Opera gloves are between 16 and 22inches long, though some gloves can be as long as 29 or 30inches. To fit oneself for gloves, measure all around the hand at the widest part of the palm where the knuckles are, but excluding the thumb. The measurement in inches is the glove size, but if one's arms are large, it may be practical to go up a size. Generally, an evening glove {{is considered to be}} a true [...] "opera-length" [...] glove if it reaches to mid-biceps or higher on the wearer's arm, notwithstanding its actual length in inches or buttons; therefore, a petite woman might find a glove with a measurement of 16 or 17inches adequate for the purpose, while a tall woman might need a glove longer than 22inches. A glove shorter than elbow-length should not be referred to as an [...] "opera-length glove" [...] or [...] "opera glove" [...] under any circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Background: Increased {{complaints}} {{by school}} students about back and shoulder pain and discomfort have raised concerns among parents, education professionals, and orthopedists and these discomforts {{may be because}} of schoolbag carriage.

Conclusion: Weight of the backpack appears to be strongly related to the occurrence of shoulder, neck, back, and extremities complaints in students. Although musculoskeletal discomforts are believed to be multifactorial in origin, the carriage and manipulating of heavy backpack is signally a suspected factor and may represent an overlooked daily physical stress for secondary students...|$|R
