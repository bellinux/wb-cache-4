Moose and roe deer are known to browse extensively whereas red deer and fallow deer are mixed feeders, but fallow deer are known to fall closer to the grazer end of the spectrum (Hofmann 1989). In general, these ungulate species tend to overlap in their use of resources (Latham 1999; Mysterud 2000). During our study period (winter), with an abundance of snow, the animals only available food was browse and <b>supplementary</b> <b>fodder</b> provided by the landowners. In our cafeteria test, we mimicked stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European aspen (Populus tremula) and goat willow (Salix caprea) to test the foraging preferences of these forest ungulates.

40|$|Supplementary feeding is a {{widespread}} practice in Sweden. In most cases, this is done {{in order to increase}} ungulate densities for hunting purposes. Forest regimes can also provide a high amount of natural food which influences densities. But high densities are not unproblematic and can cause several problems, e. g. increases in traffic accidents or browsing damages. In order to offset some of the problems while maintaining a high population, diversionary feeding has been proposed. In this study, I test the hypothesis that the type of supplementary feed influences the animals choices and degree of utilization, assuming that concentrate selectors (moose (Alces alces) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)) utilize willow {{to a greater extent than}} the intermediate feeders (red- and fallow deer (Cervus elaphus and Dama dama, respectively)) and wild boar (Sus scrofa), which mostly utilize the silage. A second focus of this study is to provide more information on when and where animals in the study <b>area</b> feed on <b>supplementary</b> <b>fodder</b> and why they choose a certain location over another. Öster Malma, the study area, has populations of five different ungulate species. The hypotheses here are that the habitat type surrounding a feeding site influences its attractiveness and the amount of natural browse in the vicinity plays a role. Based on my findings in this study, willow is not an applicable feed item for diversionary feeding. Silage was utilized much more – especially by fallow deer. Furthermore, a difference in diurnal activity was found between roe deer and the other species: roe deer was less nocturnal than the other four ungulate species. I also found some evidence that moose prefer feeding sites with forest cover. I hypothesize that competition for the resources between the species occurs and that fallow deer is a strong competitor...|$|R
30|$|There {{are strong}} biases towards {{different}} taxa dependent on region, however, all species {{are present in}} each region. The maintenance of several livestock species {{may be seen as}} a means of spreading risk in pastoral economies (Fernandez-Gimenez 1999; Pratt 1984). The specific regional climatic, topographical and ecological conditions would have influenced decisions as to which proportions of each animal were herded according to their particular biological and behavioural characteristics. Knowledge of these variables may therefore help in the interpretation of past pastoral economies, and in exploring the possible environmental and cultural factors affecting them. In terms of species proportions at sites in a particular region (Figures 2 and 3), for example, how do we explain sites which clearly plot as outliers from their group? Could these represent sites where particular interventions were practiced, such as the provision of shelter, additional feed, or the following of nomadic movements? Could these be sites at which animals were herded against environmental odds because of the status awarded to them (e.g. Pratt 1984)? Interventions by humans - provision of shelter and fodder - increases the survivability of domestic animals through winters (Ferret 2009; Kerven 2004). The use of mobile pastoral strategies also allows the use of seasonally available, geographically-discrete, resources (Kerven 2004; Sneath 1999). Before the 19 th century AD Russian settlement and colonisation, Kazakhs did not provide <b>supplementary</b> <b>fodder</b> for their animals, but rather moved between ecological zones to seasonal pastures (Kerven et al. 1996). In contemporary and historic pastoral movement systems, distances and patterns of seasonal movements vary considerably across Central Asia, ranging from a few kilometres to over one thousand (Ferret 2009; Sneath 1999; Shnirelman et al. 1996; Vainshtein 1980). It is the modern environmental conditions of the Eurasian steppe that have been outlined above and future work should in particular focus on defining the conditions across the study area in later prehistory, so that potential relationships between species use and climate and vegetation mosaics can be assessed in detail.|$|R

40|$|Sugarcane {{cultivation}} in {{the tropics}} and subtropics has {{been a matter of}} record for as long as written and pictorial records have survived the ravages of time, and it is undoubtedly true that the crop was cultivated by primitive humans long before. It is also undoubtedly true that cultivated sugarcane {{has been part of the}} diet of domesticated animals for a similar period of time and, to this day, crop residues from cultivated sugarcane are an important source of forage or <b>supplementary</b> <b>fodder</b> {{in the tropics}} and subtropics (Peacock 1996, Aregheore 2005). In contrast, commercial sugarcane production now occurs in more than 100 countries in an area of more than 26 million hectares (FAOSTAT 2014), and its cultivation generates the highest annual tonnage of biomass of any crop, approximately 1. 84 billion tons (FAOSTAT 2014). With an increasing global demand for meat, milk, dairy, and other products derived from domesticated animals, there is an increasing demand for animal feed and an increasing need to integrate existing crop residues and processing products into animal feed. Given the prominence of sugarcane in global plant biomass production, it is clear that sugarcane has a significant role to play in increasing global animal production. Furthermore, modeling of integrated sugarcane and animal production shows that the approach can have substantial economic advantages (Gradiz et al. 2007). Sugarcane has significant advantages as a forage crop in the tropics and subtropics including - (i) adaptation to tropical and subtropical conditions; - (ii) reduced sensitivity to poor soil fertility, heat and humidity, and insect and disease pressures compared with other crops; - (iii) existing technology for production and processing at industrial scale; - (iv) high biomass yields can be achieved, and; - (v) the unusual ability to maintain consistent quality as a standing crop in the field (Pate et al. 2002). Indeed, there are examples of sugarcane cultivars that have been specifically bred to provide animal feed and thrive under region-specific environmental conditions (Suzuki et al. 2014). This chapter provides an overview of how sugarcane crop residues, the products of sugarcane processing, and the products of raw sugar production are being used to support animal production and describes technologies available to enhance them for this purpose...|$|R

A stage structured stochastic model was developed to asses the long term effects of grazing and mowing practices on ground nesting birds on contrasted landscapes. A simplified version of the meta-population model made it possible to asses the importance of the mowing/grazing ratio on bird dynamics in a grassland landscape. Stocking rate per hectare of main <b>fodder</b> <b>area</b> proved itself to be a good indicator of farm management intensity and four farm types were identified.

The latter are left roaming freely in the area, while the smallstock are kept in the settlement and driven every day to grasslands located within c. 10 -km distance (Biagetti 2014 b). The Kel Tadrart are well aware of the best grazing areas of the Tadrart Acacus, and it has been demonstrated that the settlements are generally located close to those areas where the regeneration of pastures after the rains is likely to occur faster and better (Biagetti 2014 c). Water points play a role too, but whilst the water can be transported by donkey or car from wells or gueltas (Arabic: rock pools where rainwater collects), daily intake of fodder cannot be regularly gathered.

Additionally, the sale document did not mention three of the 80 acre sections, nor the large section of rough country. When Gawler was replaced by George Grey in May 1841, the colony's finances were in considerable debt. As a fundraising measure, the newly established farm was offered for public sale. However, realising that their title to the land was dubious, the government cancelled the sale. Ironically, the government's questionable title to the land ensured it remained in public ownership.|$|R
5000|$|... 1942-43 {{was another}} lean year for {{agriculture}} in France. Many fertile regions {{such as the}} Vexin, the Beauce, and the Brie suffered seriously from drought. The wheatheads were light, straw was short and hay shrivelled in the meadows, causing a lack of animal <b>fodder.</b> In occupied <b>areas,</b> the Germans confiscated 40% of the crop {{as soon as it}} became available; the authorities took 40% for the wider population, leaving the farmer with only 20%. In Normandy, Brittany and along the Channel coast, rain spoilt the potato crop and tomatoes and beans did not mature. In other provinces, e.g., Touraine and Burgundy region, the very dry weather left vegetables and even weeds cooked in the ground so people who bred rabbits for meat had to feed them with tree leaves.|$|R
40|$|Much of {{southern}} Australia has endured widespread vegetation clearance which has, through habitat loss and fragmentation, induced declines in regional avifauna and confined remaining populations to small, isolated patches of remnant vegetation where their numbers continue to fall. Conserving populations of fauna in highly fragmented agricultural landscapes is increasingly reliant on developing systems which can serve production {{as well as}} biodiversity. In recent times, perennial monoculture plantings of native tree and shrub species have been advocated {{as a means to}} increase the amount of woody vegetation in fragmented agricultural landscapes, enhance connectivity and provide supplementary habitat for wildlife. In the South Australian Murray Mallee, plantings of Old Man Saltbush (Atriplex nummularia nummularia) have been established as <b>supplementary</b> <b>fodder</b> for sheep. Preliminary research has recognised these plantings as a potential source of habitat and resources for native birds. The benefits these areas may provide to birds remain largely speculative and in depth investigations are required to fully understand the potential of saltbush plantings to contribute to the longevity of populations in highly fragmented agricultural zones. This thesis represents a detailed ecological analysis of how birds use saltbush plantings. Initially the analysis identifies which species of birds use saltbush plantings before examining White-browed Babblers (Pomatostomus superciliosus), Variegated Fairy-wrens (Malurus lamberti) and Chestnut-crowned Babblers (P. ruficeps) in detail to determine the extent to which saltbush plantings are used, for what purposes, the resources provided by the plantings and the factors driving these patterns. Repeated surveys of saltbush plantings and remnant vegetation showed the bird community found in plantings represented a significantly reduced suite of species compared to that found in remnant vegetation. Plantings did however represent areas of greater value to birds compared with cleared agricultural land. This value was substantially increased when adjacent to remnant vegetation which had the added benefit of encouraging greater numbers of bird species to make use of plantings. This study also identified White-browed Babblers, Variegated Fairy-wrens and Chestnut-crowned Babblers as several of the species most common in these areas, confirming them as focal species for further study. Direct observation of foraging by White-browed Babblers, Variegated Fairy-wrens and Chestnut-crowned Babblers revealed saltbush plantings represented substantial foraging habitat for these species. Babblers displayed highly plastic foraging ecologies, enabling them to exploit the foraging resources afforded by saltbush plantings. Despite this plasticity, babblers remained reliant on remnant vegetation for other elements, particularly those associated with breeding and nesting. Variegated Fairy-wrens remained solely within saltbush where they showed foraging ecology little changed from natural chenopod habitats. The highly plastic and adaptive foraging ecologies of these three species enable them to exploit saltbush plantings and hence they are among the most commonly encountered. Detailed analysis of home range and internal patterns of spatial use exhibited by the focal bird species revealed key elements driving habitat selection. All showed clear selection toward areas with greater cover of dense shrub-level foliage, revealing an inherent dependence on cover presumably to minimise predation risk. The distribution of vegetative cover was found to be a key driver of foraging ecology, habitat use and patterns of spatial use in both saltbush plantings and remnant vegetation. The distribution of foraging resources was examined by assessing the availability of invertebrate prey across the home ranges of the focal bird species. Invertebrate availability did not differ between intensely foraged areas and areas of no use, revealing prey distribution to be evenly distributed in both saltbush plantings and remnant vegetation. Cover dependence was therefore confirmed as the predominant driver of habitat selection patterns among these birds. Saltbush plantings represent vegetation in which foraging resources can be found by a small number of bird species with highly plastic ecologies suited to exploiting a range of habitats. Despite their plasticity, several of these species, along with the majority of bird species in the region, remain reliant on remnant vegetation. In order to better manage saltbush plantings for biodiversity it is necessary to base practices on sound ecological research which demonstrates the importance of cover, heterogeneous vegetation and adjacency to remnant vegetation.

40|$|Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is {{a drought}} -tolerant cereal {{commonly}} grown for grain and <b>fodder</b> in arid <b>areas</b> throughout the world. Senegalese millet fields are infested with Helicotylenchus. The native evergreen woody shrub Pihostigma retic ulatumi s widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. Its coppiced residues {{are used by}} small farmers as mulch in crop fields. The shrub's nematicidal effect on the spiral nematode Hehmohdenchus dihystera was evaluated in a pearl millet pot experiment. The abundance of nematodes decreased by 64 % after application of either leaf powder or a pulverized mixing of leaves and stems, suggesting the use of aboveground materials of P reficulatum as a potential nematicide. The results show promise for use of a local resotu're. by subsistence farmers in the Sahel. Further research is needed on application to fully develop this approach as a biopesticide...|$|R
