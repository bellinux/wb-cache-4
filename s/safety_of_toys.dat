The JRC has been actively involved in the progresses made on the development of standard methods for the characterisation of textile fibres and yarns and for the safety of textile products and toy, which are reviewed in this report. A number of standard methods published or under development are entirely or partly based on the JRC work. The work performed by Working Groups (WGs), of which the JRC is member, is described: CEN/TC 248 /WG 26 (on test methods for analysis of EC restricted substances in textiles); CEN/TC 248 /WG 30 (on quantitative analysis of fibre mixtures); CEN/TC/ 52 /WG 5 (on chemical properties of toys); and ISO/TC/WG 22 (on composition and chemical testing of textiles).

The infrared potential for the two scalars that can be reached from that fixed point is fully predicted and features no free parameters.

The overwhelming majority <b>of</b> the 2007 <b>toy</b> recalls {{were due to}} high levels of lead content and almost all <b>of</b> these <b>toys</b> were manufactured in China. This period of recalls was characterized by substantial media attention to the issue <b>of</b> consumer product <b>safety</b> and eventually led to the passage of the Consumer Product <b>Safety</b> Improvement Act <b>of</b> 2008. This paper examines consumer demand for toys following this wave <b>of</b> dangerous <b>toy</b> recalls. The data reveal four key findings. First, the types <b>of</b> <b>toys</b> that were involved in recalls in 2007 experienced above average losses in Christmas season sales. Second, Christmas sales <b>of</b> infant/preschool <b>toys</b> produced by manufacturers who did not experience any recalls were about 25 percent lower in 2007 as compared to earlier years, suggesting industry-wide spillovers.

40|$|This is s Bachelor Degree Project report {{based on}} the design of a push toy in {{collaboration}} with Playsam. The new design consists of a wooden spacecraft. The toy can be described as a safe toy appropriated for kids within a range of ages between 1 and 3 years old.  The attractive design of the toy will help the children to increase their imagination. It is a dynamic product that, firstly, seems not {{to be more than a}} spacecraft with two wheels that needs another foothold to keep staying up. On the other hand, when the kids take it, they will observe that the product can be displaced by the wheels, and they will find an attractive rotational motion that combines two complementary colours. The requirements stated by the company were achieved: -       Firstly, the toy must move one of its parts being it connected to the wheels. The product has two main parts. One of them will rotate regarding to the other one when the child drags it thanks to a designed gear system. -       Secondly, the toy would be made of wood as well as all the company products. The elected wood was beech wood, getting a similar appearance to the Playsam products aesthetic. -       The last requisite of the company was to make the toy easy to handle and manipulate. The anthropometric study organized by the design team guarantees it.  The mediums of the data were considered to build the toy.   It was considered that children less than 18 months will take it by the holes and not the surface.

Kot sem ugotovila, je otroški trg zelo razvit in oglaševalci skoraj vsak dan razvijajo nove metode, kako pritegniti otrokovo pozornost. Res je, da o nakupih otroških igrač odločajo starši, ki upoštevajo predvsem funkcionalnost igrače, a pri tem veliko vlogo igrajo tudi otroci in njihove želje. Oni so tisti, ki dajo pobudo, izberejo in povedo kaj jim je všeč. Presenetljivo je, da je raziskava pokazala, da starši ne zapravijo več denarja za nakup igrač kadar nakupujejo z otroki. Temu verjetno botruje tudi dejstvo, da imajo danes otroci že tako preveč igrač in se starši bolj zavestno odločijo kdaj in kakšno igračo kupiti. Poleg tega pa pomembno vlogo igra tudi cena, saj se staršem zdijo igrače predrage. Zelo pomembno vlogo pri nakupu igrač imata kakovost in varnost igrač.

The probable cause for this is also the fact, that nowadays children own already too much toys and therefore parents more consciously decide when and what kind <b>of</b> <b>toy</b> to buy.
