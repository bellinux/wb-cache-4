50|$|A {{microwave}} power module consists of a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which drives a vacuum power booster, typically a traveling wave tube. The {{high voltage power supply}} required by the TWT is provided by an electronic power conditioner. In pulsed-mode MPMs, the power conditioner provides a pulsed high voltage that is triggered by a trigger input. MPMs also include a microcontroller, which is responsible for controlling the operation of the module, such as making sure the various power supply voltages come up in the appropriate sequence to prevent damage to the TWT. It also reports the module status, including the various voltages, currents and temperatures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wide band code {{division}} multiple access (WCDMA) signals, transmitted by the base station high <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (HPAs), show high peak to average power ratios (PAPR), which results in nonlinear distortions. In this paper, using computer simulations effect of using a predistorted HPA on the symbol error rate (SER) of multi-user detectors in terms of output back-off (OBO) in the transmit power is analyzed. As well, using polynomials for modeling predistorters to remove nonlinear distortions of traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) and of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (SSPAs), effect of different degrees of polynomials on the SER is investigated. Simulation results show that a polynomial of degree 4 is a sufficient degree polynomial, which fits to the AM/AM characteristic of the predistorter for TWTAs. As well, for <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (SSPAs) with different p values, different approximations are considered and sufficient degree polynomials are found...|$|R

5000|$|By the 1960s and 1970s, {{semiconductor}} transistor-based amplifiers (also called [...] "solid state") {{began to}} become popular. This was {{in large part}} because for a given wattage level and feature level, solid state amplifiers are less expensive, lighter weight, and require less maintenance than tube amplifiers. As well, transistor amplifiers are more reliable and less fragile than tube amps. In some cases, tube and solid state technologies are used together, usually with a tube preamplifier driving a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifier.</b> There are also an increasing range of products that use digital signal processing and digital modeling technology to simulate many different combinations of amp and cabinets.|$|E
5000|$|Hybrid bass {{amplifier}} heads typically pair a tube preamplifier with a solid-state power amplifier. This {{provides the}} {{player with the}} best elements of both amplifier technology. The tube preamp gives the player the ability to obtain tube amplifier tone, which tube enthusiasts state is [...] "warmer" [...] than a solid state (transistor) preamp. As well, tube users state that tube preamps have a more pleasing-sounding, natural tone when the preamp's volume is pushed up so high that the bass signal becomes overdriven; in contrast, a solid state preamp that is pushed {{to the point of}} signal [...] "clipping" [...] can be harsh-sounding. Some hybrid amp heads have a bypass switch, so that the tube preamp can be bypassed, if the tube breaks or develops a technical problem. The tube preamplified signal in a hybrid amplifier head is then sent to a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Compared with tube power amps, solid state power amplifiers are more reliable, require less maintenance, less fragile and lighter in weight. A hybrid tube preamp/solid state power amp thus provides a bass player with the benefits of both technologies' strengths: tube preamp tone and solid state reliability for the power amp.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronics}} of Garcia's Irwin guitars are unique, {{and feature}} an onboard preamp and effects loop. Much like a Stratocaster, the three pickups are selected with a five-way switch. Signal from the pickups {{passes through the}} tone controls, followed by an op-amp based buffer preamp, or Unity Gain Buffer, {{which is designed to}} prevent signal loss due to capacitance when long cables are used. From the preamp, the signal could be routed via a mini-toggle on the guitar's face to pass through a Y-cable to Garcia's effects rack, and then back into the guitar. This onboard effects loop serves to send the full output of Tiger's pickups to the effects while allowing the guitar's volume control to vary the final output. The effects loop could be bypassed by the aforementioned switch, sending the guitar's signal from the preamp to the volume control, and then out to Garcia's preamped (and heavily modified) Fender Twin Reverb into a McIntosh MC2300 <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Tiger started with DiMarzio Dual Sound humbuckers in the middle and bridge positions with a DiMarzio SDs-1 single coil at the neck. The humbuckers were switched to Dimarzio Super II's in 1982. Each of the humbuckers is equipped with a coil cut switch. In summary, there is one 5 way pickup selector, one master volume control, one tone control which affects the neck and bridge pickups, and one which affects the middle pickup as well as three mini toggles, two for the coil-cut of the bridge and middle pickups respectively and one for the on-board effects loop on/off.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that those}} {{termination}} resistors {{are usually not}} used in CMOS, but the losses due to these are small in typical applications. In <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> often multiple discrete transistors are used for power reasons anyway. If all transistors are driven in a synchronized fashion a very high gate drive power is needed. For frequencies at which small and efficient coils are available distributed amplifiers are more efficient.|$|R
