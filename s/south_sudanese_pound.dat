50|$|The dinar {{replaced}} the first <b>Sudanese</b> <b>pound</b> (SDP) on June 8, 1992, {{at a rate}} of 1 dinar = 10 pounds.

50|$|Once South Sudan became independent, the Bank of Southern Sudan rebranded to the Central Bank of South Sudan, {{the central}} bank {{in the country and}} the {{national}} banking regulator. Nine days following independence day, the Central Bank of South Sudan released new currency notes of the <b>South</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Pound,</b> to be exchanged at par with the Sudanese Pound for a period of approximately sixty days.

50|$|In June 2015 the Famine Early Warning Systems Network {{observed}} {{a spike in}} food prices {{and an increase in}} the number of households likely to face catastrophic famine. These were attributable in part to economic considerations including increasing transport costs, a decrease in the parallel exchange rate of the <b>South</b> <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Pound</b> from 6.1 to 11.5 per United States Dollar, and the loss of government credit allowing import of food at the official exchange rate of 2.9 SSP per USD.

Unfortunately, however, the wrong coat of arms for South Sudan appeared on the 2.5 SSP stamp, with the eagle looking to the right instead of the left, while it carries two spears instead of one spear and one spade, therefore, it was decided not to issue this stamp, but only the ones of 1 SSP and 3.5 SSP.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{after the}} Southern Sudanese Community Association {{and due to}} the {{difficulty}} of <b>South</b> <b>Sudanese</b> Americans to study in universities, a <b>South</b> <b>Sudanese</b> immigrant, Valentino, created the Valentino Achak Deng Foundation, which aims to help provide scholarships to aid the educational pursuits of <b>South</b> <b>Sudanese</b> Americans, support educational institutions and community organizations that work with <b>South</b> <b>Sudanese</b> immigrants.

50|$|Agricultural {{production}} remains important, {{because it}} employs 80% {{of the work}} force and contributes a third of GDP. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years despite rapid rises in average per capita income. In January 2007, the government introduced a new currency, the <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Pound,</b> at an initial exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 <b>Sudanese</b> <b>Pounds.</b>|$|R
