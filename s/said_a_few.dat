5|$|President Mobutu invited 18 African leaders, Savimbi, and dos Santos to his {{palace in}} Gbadolite in June 1989 for negotiations. Savimbi and dos Santos {{met for the}} first time and agreed to the Gbadolite Declaration, a ceasefire, on 22 June, paving the way for a future peace agreement. President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days after the {{declaration}} that Savimbi had agreed to leave Angola and go into exile, a claim Mobutu, Savimbi, and the U.S. government disputed. Dos Santos agreed with Kaunda's interpretation of the negotiations, saying Savimbi had agreed to temporarily leave the country.|$|E

The state {{retirement}} funds had withdrawn only $200 {{million from the}} bank. Shanker also admitted the fund withdrawals {{had been going on}} since mid-1984, and {{had nothing to do with}} the strike at Phelps Dodge.|$|E

He produced and released even more types of tennis gear for RS-Tennis throughout the year. He also stepped down as the tournament director of the Stockholm Open to Simon Aspelin.|$|E

25|$|Some {{relatives}} of the victims in the case were {{taken aback by the}} announcement of a Crown appeal, especially because Attorney-General Wally Oppal had <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days earlier that the prosecution would likely not appeal. Although Pickton had been acquitted on the first-degree murder charges, he was convicted of second-degree murder and received the same sentence as he would have on first-degree murder convictions. The {{relatives of}} the victims expressed concern that the convictions would be jeopardized if the Crown argued that the trial judge had made errors. Opposition critic Leonard Krog criticized the Attorney-General for not having briefed the victims’ families in advance.|$|E
25|$|At 7:30 pm on Monday evening, October 28, 1907, {{a band of}} Seattle Socialists braved the {{pouring rain}} {{and headed for the}} city's new Pike Street Market, bustling with 1500 shoppers. SPW State Chairman John Downie went first, {{ascending}} a wooden box in an unused part of the marketplace. A cheer erupted from the crowd which encircled the speaker, and more came running, expecting fireworks. Downie told the crowd of a planned march to the City Council Chamber later that evening — and was promptly arrested. Next came James Lund of Redondo, Washington, who got no further before he, too, was arrested and taken away. Elmer Allison of Local Bangor, A.G. Ball of Portland, Oregon, and Harry Ault and Hulet Wells of Seattle each ascended the box in turn, <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> choice words, and were escorted away by police.|$|E
500|$|For his efforts, Gravel {{attracted}} some attention: famed writer Norman Mailer {{would say}} he [...] "provided considerable excitement" [...] and was [...] "good-looking enough to have played leads in B-films", while Rolling Stone correspondent Hunter S. Thompson said Gravel [...] "probably <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> things {{that might have been}} worth hearing, under different circumstances ..." [...] Yet, the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the Democrats. The time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vice-presidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed McGovern's speech until 3:30a.m. The haste with which Eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed; he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention, to be replaced by Sargent Shriver.|$|E

500|$|The miniseries' {{story was}} {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, showrunner Adam Muto, head writer Kent Osborne, and staff writer Jack Pendarvis. The eight episodes were storyboarded by Ako Castuera, Jesse Moynihan, Muto, Hanna K. Nyström, Herpich, Steve Wolfhard, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, Emily Partridge, and Luke Pearson. Andres Salaff, Elizabeth Ito, and Muto handled supervising direction, and Sandra Lee served as art director. Former Adventure Time storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar returned briefly to the show to voice Marceline's mother, and to contribute a song, entitled [...] "Everything Stays". Stakes was a ratings success, and was met with mostly positive reviews, with Sugar's song in particular being met with critical applause. With that being <b>said,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. For {{his work on the}} Stakes finale, Herpich won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation at the 68th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in 2016. Stakes was released on DVD on January 19, 2016.|$|E
500|$|Produced by David Foster, [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] is a four minute-25 second pop and R power ballad. The song's theme {{alludes to}} a [...] "blistering heartbreak" [...] in which Braxton begs a former lover {{to return and}} undo the pain he has caused. According to sheet music {{published}} by Realsongs at Musicnotes.com, the verses of [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] are composed in the key of B minor, and the piece modulates to D minor for the chorus and G-sharp minor for the bridge; the song {{is set in a}} time signature of common time with a moderately slow tempo of 55 beats per minute. Braxton's vocal range spans from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of D5 [...] David Willoughby, author of The World of Music (2009), <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> phrases such as [...] "Don't leave me in all this pain" [...] are sufficient to reveal the [...] "sadness and the longing" [...] in the song.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five." ...|$|E

500|$|When Citi Bike first launched, {{some local}} bike shops in tourist areas {{reported}} {{a decline in}} their bike rental business, and some complained that Citi Bike's advertising was misleading tourists. At least one bike shop owner {{said that he was}} forced to close down his business in 2014 due to the popularity of Citi Bike. Dorothy Rabinowitz of the Wall Street Journal <b>said,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days after the system opened, that under the [...] "autocratic" [...] mayoralty of Bill de Blasio, [...] "we now look at a city whose best cities are absolutely begrimed by these blazing blue Citibank bikes." [...] Some people disliked the bright blue color and branding of the bicycles, while others pointed out that the stations blocked fire hydrants on the street. The concrete wheel stops {{at the end of each}} kiosk also poses a hazard, as these barriers act as a sudden, sharp speed bump. Another complaint was that bike stations take up car parking space for each eight bikes, a sentiment repeated in future stall installations.|$|E
500|$|Roper {{said that}} {{there were a couple of}} puzzles [...] "that seemed a little rough around the edges and whose {{otherwise}} straightforward solution suffered a bit from imperfect implementation." [...] He also criticized the difficulty of unlocking some of the bonus content, as some requirements are [...] "punishingly hard for most everyone." [...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the cliffhanger ending and <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the bonus challenges [...] "aren't all that great." [...] GameTrailers criticized the invisible walls, stating that [...] "There are places you should be able to go that you simply can't." [...] They also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation. Leone said his [...] "only real" [...] disappointment is that he did not feel the game was evolving the series.|$|E
500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, he was nervous and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] he told himself. Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E

2500|$|The {{programme}} {{is thought}} to be important and influential to the field of politics in Ireland: Former President of Ireland Mary McAleese was a frequent contributor to the programme and, according to Noel Whelan of The Irish Times, [...] "more often than not the first question asked of the Taoiseach raises something which was reported or <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours previously on Morning Ireland". Government ministers use the show to explain their views.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to {{opposition}} {{criticism of}} his wife's fund-raising activities voiced in the House of Assembly, he bristled, [...] "Mr. Speaker, I have never had plans to cross this aisle, but in recent weeks that Honourable Member has <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> things that would encourage me to do so. [...] I say to that Honourable Member that I would like to stay {{on this side of}} the House and not have come to the other side because it wouldn't be in order to vote for the UBP." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the DFV project, Hayes told Henry Ford II that he thought the DFV engine was [...] "fairly likely" [...] to win a World Championship. In 1997 a group of people {{gathered}} at Donington Park to commemorate the DFV's 30th anniversary. Jackie Stewart <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words, making comments on an engine which had made him as well as Graham Hill, Jochen Rindt, Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Mario Andretti, Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg. It had also brought championships to teams: Lotus, Matra, Tyrrell, McLaren and Williams; and won races for Hesketh, March, Penske, Shadow and Wolf.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{told the}} Irish Ambassador to London in 1946, [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words in {{parliament}} {{the other day}} about your country because I still hope for a united Ireland. You must get those fellows in the north in, though; you can't do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country." [...] He later said [...] "You know I have had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don't {{want to go there}} at all, I would much rather go to southern Ireland. Maybe I'll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just two laps later, {{immediately}} after Ralf Schumacher had spun and stalled his Williams in Turn 6, the crowd {{on the front}} straight groaned as Montoya moved over to the pit wall and rolled to a stop. [...] "It (the Williams) was really good," [...] Montoya <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes later, {{at the back of}} his garage. [...] "The car was really competitive. I wanted to really go for the win here, and it's a big disappointment we couldn't finish the race. I think the engine was running really strong. I don't know, I think it was a hydraulic (problem) because I lost all the gears and everything. When I stopped, the engine was still running." ...|$|E
