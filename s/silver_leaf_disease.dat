5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi, {{which cause}} disease in insects, {{include at least}} 14 species that attack aphids. Beauveria bassiana is mass-produced and used to manage {{a wide variety of}} insect pests {{including}} whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing <b>silver</b> <b>leaf,</b> a <b>disease</b> of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.|$|R

40|$|Because {{the corn}} vein and noise {{influence}} the contour extraction of the maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease,</b> we {{put forward a}} new recognition algorithm based on Curvelet and Shape Context (SC). This method can improve the speed and accuracy of maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease</b> recognition. Firstly, we use Seeded Regional Growing (SRG) algorithm to segment the maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease</b> image. Secondly, Curvelet Modulus Correlation (CMC) method is put forward to extract the effective contour of maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease.</b> Thirdly, we combine CMC with the SC algorithm to obtain the histogram features and then use these features we obtain to calculate {{the similarities between the}} template image and the target image. Finally, we adopt n-fold cross-validation algorithm to recognize <b>diseases</b> on maize <b>leaf</b> <b>disease</b> database. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can recognize 6 kinds of maize <b>leaf</b> <b>diseases</b> accurately and achieve the accuracy of 94. 446 %.
