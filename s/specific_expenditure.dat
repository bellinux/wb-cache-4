The results of models 6 and 8 in Table  5 indicate that, as expected, coal dependence has a detrimental effect on both education expenditures and social security and healthcare expenditures. Among other control variables, the coefficients of transfer dependency are significant, suggesting that fiscal transfers can incentivize local governments to provide more public goods services. The coefficients {{of the number of}} students in primary and middle school and the number of beds in hospital institutions are positive and statistically significant at the 10  % level, indicating that local governments with larger demands of education and healthcare do spend more on these affairs.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the efficient scale of prefectural government; thus, our paper adopts the latter type of analysis. According to Martinez-Vazquez and Qiao (2011), prefectural government mainly provides services related to public security, social security, {{and health care}} within the current five-layer government system in China. As for the prefectural government’s expenditure shares, the top four items are capital investment, education, government administration, and public security. We cannot obtain each prefecture’s detailed fiscal expenditures. This is another reason why we cannot apply the former type of studies to some specific public services. In this paper, we assume that total prefectural expenditures also have U-shaped cost structures as do <b>specific</b> <b>expenditures,</b> e.g., public security, education or government administration.|$|R

At high levels of disaggregation to <b>specific</b> <b>expenditure</b> categories, it is found that the aggregate and intermediate evidence of deepness asymmetry is driven by {{a relatively small number of}} expenditures, with almost no evidence of deepness asymmetry in non-durable categories of expenditure. Prominent among the durable and semi-durable good expenditure categories exhibiting significant positive deepness asymmetry are expenditures relating to housing fittings and communication, consistent with a degree of 'lumpiness' in expenditure which may be associated with the impact of credit rationing or threshold effects. ...|$|E

30|$|What are the {{transmission}} channels of the resource-curse hypothesis? Employing a dataset of Shanxi’s county-level governments and using cross-sectional regressions, we studied {{the transmission}} channels through which natural-resource abundance affects governmental fiscal behaviors. We {{found that in}} coal-abundant areas, the fiscal revenues of local governments rely more on resource rents. Based on the hypotheses proposed by the explanations of political shortsightedness and state centralism, we explored how rich coal resources affect governments’ provision of public goods. We found that due to their higher state autonomy and lower responsiveness to social demands, coal-rich county-level governments spend significantly less on social expenditures, {{as well as the}} <b>specific</b> <b>expenditures</b> of education, environmental protection, and social security and healthcare. At the same time, coal-rich governments tend to have a higher share of administrative expenditures in total expenditures. Through these analyses, this paper sheds new light on the causal mechanisms of the resource-curse hypothesis in China’s context.|$|R

Thus, a main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of the sociodemographic and festival experience-related variables of visitors on the volumes and patterns of their expenditure. Rather than using an OLS (ordinary least squares) regression model, which requires the continuity assumption when several zero expenditures exist in a dependent variable, this study uses a tobit model. The results of the tobit analyses indicate that certain variables seem to be more important than others, and reveal variations in the effects of determinants on the estimates of expenditures. In particular, "overnight versus no overnight stay" was found to be a significant predictor for all six categories of expenditure. It was also found that the role of sociodemographic variables such as age, marital status, occupation, and place of residence was minimal, except in the case of <b>specific</b> <b>expenditure</b> categories.

Households that will be most vulnerable to CO 2 reduction policies will be identified. The project will develop a household emissions dataset by combining data from the Living Cost and Food Survey with energy prices and emission factors for <b>specific</b> <b>expenditure</b> items. This database will then be used to estimate the distribution of CO 2 emissions across UK households, comparing different categories of emissions (home energy, transport, indirect and total household emissions). The project will also analyse the impact of different socio-demographic factors on household CO 2 emissions. In particular, we will compare the importance of different factors for low and high income households, enabling us to identify potentially vulnerable households in low income groups...|$|E

In late calendar year 2001, while NSWG- 1 was working out the initial financial ramifications of its new organization, the Global War on Terror (GWOT) began. With the GWOT came extraordinarily large supplemental appropriations. These appropriations helped subsidize some of NSWG- 1 's new funding needs. Thus, NSWG- 1 recognized it might face a future funding deficit if, and when, supplemental appropriations are discontinued.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{compilation}} of lessons learned about decentralization, Roy Bahl (1999) highlighted three channels through which central interventions often undermine {{the discipline of}} a hard budget constraint for local governments. These are “deficit grants ” to cover year-end deficits on local government budgets, direct central government coverage of shortfalls on specific items of expenditure, and bailouts on delinquent debt. All three channels involve direct or indirect fiscal assistance {{at the end of}} the year from central authorities. Repeated over time, such assistance can potentially create a regime of soft budgets, effectively undermining the fiscal resolve of sub-national governments and the efficiency gains expected from moving government closer to communities. In the case of South Africa, all three of the channels [...] deficit grants, coverage of <b>specific</b> <b>expenditure</b> shortfalls, and bailouts [...] have been utilized by the central government to provide assistance to sub-national governments in both the apartheid and the present democratic eras.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{distributional}} {{effects of the}} GST in New Zealand, and {{the case for the}} introduction of reduced rates to address distributional concerns. The analysis is based on a consumption tax micro-simulation model constructed using expenditure micro-data from the Household Economic Survey for 2012 / 13. The distributional effects of excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol and petrol are also considered. The paper finds that the lifetime distributional impact of the GST is either proportional or at worst slightly regressive. Excise taxes are also found to be roughly proportional or slightly regressive, though they are of far smaller magnitude than GST burdens. Simulation results show that the introduction of a European-style multi-rate GST system would have a progressive impact on overall GST burdens, but that such a reform would benefit richer households significantly more than poorer households in dollar terms. Given it is the overall progressivity of the tax system that matters, New Zealand’s current approach of providing targeted support to poorer households via the Working for Families tax credit package {{can be seen as a}} far more cost effective way of supporting poorer households than the introduction of reduced GST rates for <b>specific</b> <b>expenditure</b> items...|$|E

The main aim {{of this paper is}} to find out if urban sprawl influences local public spending. Data for the economic analysis came from the local balance sheets of the 145 municipalities for the year 2007. In particular, the costs of the main public services sustained by the municipalities such as public transport, road and street maintenance, waste management, and water and sewer services were analyzed. This paper estimates the impact of urban sprawl, measured, for example, as total urban density or urban fragmentation, on a variety of current expenditures using the method of instrumental variables (IV); and, specifically, two-stage least squares (2 SLS) analysis. The results show that discontinuous and fragmented development patterns, calculated as the number of urbanized polygons in each municipality, are, in general, more expensive.
