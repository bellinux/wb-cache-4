The child of poor actors, she made her first appearance when she was three months old, being brought on in a hamper as a New Year's gift to a selfish old gentleman who would not forgive his daughter for having married for love. As, however, {{she began to cry}} long before the hamper was opened, the comedy became a farce, to the immense amusement of the public. She next appeared in a mediaeval melodrama, being then three years of age, and was so terrified at the machinations of the villain that she ran away at the most critical moment. However, her stage-fright seems to have disappeared, and we find her playing Silvio Pellico's Francesco, da Rimini at fifteen, and at eighteen making her debut as Marie Stuart. At this time the naturalism of the French method was gradually displacing the artificial elocution and academic poses of the Italian school of acting. Madame Ristori seems to have tried to combine simplicity with style, and the passion of nature with the self-restraint of the artist. 'J'ai voulu fondre les deux manieres,' she tells us, 'car je sentais que toutes choses etant <b>susceptibles</b> de progres, l'art dramatique aussi etait appele a subir des transformations.' The natural development, however, of the Italian drama was almost arrested by the ridiculous censorship of plays then existing in each town under Austrian or Papal rule. The slightest allusion to the sentiment of nationality or the spirit of freedom was prohibited. Even the word patria was regarded as treasonable, and Madame Ristori tells us an amusing story of the indignation of a censor who was asked to license a play, in which a dumb man returns home after an absence of many years, and on his entrance upon the stage makes gestures expressive of his joy in seeing his native land once more. 'Gestures of this kind,' said the censor, 'are obviously of a very revolutionary tendency, and cannot possibly be allowed.

6000|$|However, I am digressing, as a {{man with}} a {{grievance}} always does. And after all, the main thing in determining the artistic quality of a book is not the opinions it propagates, {{but the fact that the}} writer has opinions. The old lady from Colchester was right to sun her simple soul in the energetic radiance of Bradlaugh's genuine beliefs and disbeliefs rather than in the chill of such mere painting of light and heat as elocution and convention can achieve. My contempt for belles lettres, and for amateurs who become the heroes of the fanciers of literary virtuosity, is not founded on any illusion of mind as to the permanence of those forms of thought (call them opinions) by which I strive to communicate my bent to my fellows. To younger men they are already outmoded; for though they have no more lost their logic than an eighteenth century pastel has lost its drawing or its color, yet, like the pastel, they grow indefinably shabby, and will grow shabbier until they cease to count at all, when my books will either perish, or, if the world is still poor enough to want them, will have to stand, with Bunyan's, by quite amorphous qualities of temper and energy. With this conviction I cannot be a bellettrist. No doubt I must recognize, as even the Ancient Mariner did, that I must tell my story entertainingly if I am to hold the wedding guest spellbound in spite of the siren sounds of the loud bassoon. But [...] "for art's sake" [...] alone I would not face the toil of writing a single sentence. I know that there are men who, having nothing to say and nothing to write, are nevertheless so in love with oratory and with literature that they keep desperately repeating as much as they can understand of what others have said or written aforetime. I know that the leisurely tricks which their want of conviction leaves them free to play with the diluted and misapprehended message supply them with a pleasant parlor game which they call style. I can pity their dotage and even sympathize with their fancy. But a true original style is never achieved for its own sake: a man may pay from a shilling to a guinea, according to his means, to see, hear, or read another man's act of genius; but he will not pay with his whole life and soul to become a mere virtuoso in literature, exhibiting an accomplishment which will not even make money for him, like fiddle playing. Effectiveness of assertion is the Alpha and Omega of style. He who has nothing to assert has no style and can have none: he who has something to assert will go as far in power of style as its momentousness and his conviction will carry him. Disprove his assertion after it is made, yet its style remains. Darwin has no more destroyed the style of Job nor of Handel than Martin Luther destroyed the style of Giotto. All the assertions get disproved sooner or later; and so we find the world full of a magnificent debris of artistic fossils, with the matter-of-fact credibility gone clean out of them, but the form still splendid. And that is why the old masters play the deuce with our mere <b>susceptibles.</b> Your Royal Academician thinks he can get the style of Giotto without Giotto's beliefs, and correct his perspective into the bargain. Your man of letters thinks he can get Bunyan's or Shakespear's style without Bunyan's conviction or Shakespear's apprehension, especially if he takes care not to split his infinitives. And so with your Doctors of Music, who, with their collections of discords duly prepared and resolved or retarded or anticipated in the manner of the great composers, think they can learn the art of Palestrina from Cherubim's treatise. All this academic art is far worse than the trade in sham antique furniture; for the man who sells me an oaken chest which he swears was made in the XIII century, though as a matter of fact he made it himself only yesterday, at least does not pretend that there are any modern ideas in it, whereas your academic copier of fossils offers them to you as the latest outpouring of the human spirit, and, worst of all, kidnaps young people as pupils and persuades them that his limitations are rules, his observances dexterities, his timidities good taste, and his emptinesses purities. And when he declares that art should not be didactic, all the people who have nothing to teach and all the people who don't want to learn agree with him emphatically.|$|E

The importance of this dynamic aspect is most obvious in an endemic disease with a short infectious period, such as measles in the UK prior {{to the introduction of}} a vaccine in 1968. Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of <b>susceptibles</b> (S(t)) over time.

5000|$|C. Scott Littleton has {{suggested}} that ranking by patrilineal ultimogeniture could have prevailed in Proto-Indo-European society. He wrote the following in [...] "The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of George Dumezil":"Gerschel published, in 1956, a most interesting, albeit exploratory, paper. Entitled [...] "Sur un schème trifonctionnel dans une famille de légendes germaniques", the paper {{is concerned with the}} possible existence of a tripartite scheme in a series of German and Swiss legends wherein {{a man or a woman}} performs some service for the [...] "little people" [...] (fairies, elves, etc.) and, in return, receives three gifts (e.g., a ring, a sword, and a loaf of bread) which are to be passed on to the three sons. So long as these three items are preserved, the three branches of the family will prosper. These gifts, of course, are seen by Gerschel as symbolic of the three functions, and the prosperity of the three sons so endowed varies accordingly: the eldest son receives a gift symbolizing the third function (e.g., a loaf of bread; cf. the third function identification of Lipoxaïs, eldest son of the Scythian Targitaos) and becomes a successful farmer and the father of many children; the second son receives a gift symbolic of the second function (e.g., a sword) and becomes a successful warrior; the youngest son receives a gift symbolic of the first function (e.g., a ring or a cup) and becomes a priest, an abbot, or the governor of a province. Should these objects be lost or destroyed, then the three branches of the family will cease to prosper in their respective ways. Often the first and second sons lose their talismans, while the youngest, who holds the gift symbolizing sovereignty, is able to preserve his by sequestering it in an abbey and thus continues to prosper. Gerschel concludes that these modern (fifteenth-to eighteenth century) South German and Swiss legends, many of which are tied to existing families in the area and are used to explain the differing fortunes of various branches thereof, [...] "sont <b>susceptibles</b> de récéler une matière d' origine indo-européenne: la légende est ici héritière du mythe" [...] (1956, p. 92). This interpretation, if correct, is, in my opinion, of the highest significance; it implies that the tripartite ideology has persisted far beyond the phase in which epics were composed, that it trascended the era of classical historical interpretation, and that, despite well over a thousand years of Christianity, it still forms a part of the European world view (at least in Bavaria and some Swiss cantons). As I see it, even if these legends are but isolated examples, Gerschel's work, coupled with that of Dumézil, opens up some most interesting avenues of research, ones that have perhaps some important theoretical implications as far as the relationships among language, society, and ideology are concerned. Another matter that this article brings into focus is the extent to which Proto I-E society was characterized by ultimogeniture. I have alluded above to Lipoxaïs, who, as the eldest son, received the lowest rank; conversely, his youngest brother Kolaxaïs became sovereign. In these German and Swiss legends, the same thing happens. Elsewhere the evidence is not clear-cut, but hints of ultimogeniture can be found throughout ancient I-E literature. One such example can be seen in the kinship in heaven theme mentioned previously in my discussion of Wikander's work; here again, the youngest son inherits the sovereign position (cf. the positions of Zeus, Feridun, Tesub, etc., relative to their respective siblings). That this was indeed the Proto I-E pattern is still an open question, but I feel that a good case for it can be made on the basis of the evidence presented above".|$|E

40|$|The susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 476 strains) and untypeable Haemophilus influenzae (1, 676 strains) {{to various}} oral β-lactam, macrolide-azalide, and {{fluoroquinolone}} antimicrobial agents {{were determined by}} broth microdilution. Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States. MIC data were interpreted according to pharmacodynamically derived breakpoints applicable to the oral agents tested. Among H. influenzae strains, 41. 6 % were β-lactamase positive. Virtually all H. influenzae strains were <b>susceptible</b> to amoxicillin-clavulanate (98 %), cefixime (100 %), and ciprofloxacin (100 %), while 78 % were <b>susceptible</b> to cefuroxime, 57 % were <b>susceptible</b> to amoxicillin, 14 % were <b>susceptible</b> to cefprozil, 9 % were <b>susceptible</b> to loracarbef, 2 % were <b>susceptible</b> to cefaclor, and 0 % were <b>susceptible</b> to azithromycin and clarithromycin. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 49. 6 % were penicillin <b>susceptible,</b> 17. 9 % were intermediate, and 32. 5 % were penicillin resistant, with penicillin MICs for 50 and 90 % of the isolates tested of 0. 12 and 4 μg/ml, respectively. Overall, 94 % of S. pneumoniae isolates were <b>susceptible</b> to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, 69 % were <b>susceptible</b> to azithromycin and clarithromycin, 63 % were <b>susceptible</b> to cefprozil and cefuroxime, 52 % were <b>susceptible</b> to cefixime, 22 % were <b>susceptible</b> to cefaclor, and 11 % were <b>susceptible</b> to loracarbef. Although ciprofloxacin has marginal activity against S. pneumoniae, no high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were found. Significant cross-resistance was found between penicillin and macrolides-azalides among S. pneumoniae isolates, with 5 % of the penicillin-susceptible strains being macrolide-azalide resistant, compared with 37 % of the intermediate isolates and 66 % of the resistant isolates. Resistance was highest in S. pneumoniae isolates from patients younger than 10 years of age, middle ear and paranasal sinus specimens, and the southern half of the United States. With the continuing rise in resistance, judicious use of oral antimicrobial agents is necessary in all age groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} of different sunflower genotypes against some insect pests {{was investigated in}} the field. Fourteen sunflower genotypes were screened against Aphis gossypii Glover (Aphids), Nezara viridula (L.) (Green stink bug) and Thrips tabaci Lind. (Thrips). In case of Aphids, the sunflower genotype 9705 was partially resistant whereas JH 2 99 S, JH 1 99 S, Hysun- 777, T- 562 and PSF- 025 were found partially <b>susceptible</b> genotypes. The germplasms XF- 263 and 1435 were taken as intermediately <b>susceptible.</b> The <b>susceptible</b> genotypes were PNSF- 1 and 9706 when compared with standard germplasm. Parsun- 1 and Award were found highly <b>susceptible</b> to Aphids population. In case of Nezara viridula, conclusion was made that the sunflower germplasms 9705, JH 2 99 S and JH 1 99 S were partially resistant against this pest as compare to Hysun- 33 whereas Hysun- 777 was found partially <b>susceptible.</b> PSF- 025, T- 562 and 1435 were declared as intermediately <b>susceptible.</b> PNSF- 1 was <b>susceptible.</b> The sunflower germplasms XF- 263, Parsun- 1, 9706, 9707 and Award were taken as highly <b>susceptible</b> having highest number of pest as compare to Hysun- 33. Results of Thrips tabaci concluded that 9706 and JH 2 99 S were partially resistant whereas XF- 263 and Award were found highly <b>susceptible</b> to pest as compare to Hysun- 33. The genotypes 9707, JH 1 99 S and Parsun- 1 were partially <b>susceptible</b> to pest population. Hysun- 777, T- 562, PSF- 025 and 1435 were taken as intermediately <b>susceptible</b> against thrips whereas PNSF- 1 and 9706 were found <b>susceptible.</b> A negative correlation was also found between pest population and the yield of sunflower genotypes...|$|R
