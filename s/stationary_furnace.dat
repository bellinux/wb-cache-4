40|$|The {{increased}} {{consumption of}} meat (including poultry) observed {{over the last}} decade has led to the intensification of its production. With the production increase, the amount of generated waste also increases. Appropriate disposal of waste from the meat industry will significantly reduce the amount of such waste and its negative impact on the environment. The paper presents a method for the thermal neutralisation of feathers, poultry litter and meat and bone meal (MBM). Waste incineration was carried out in a <b>stationary</b> electric <b>furnace,</b> at a temperature varying in the range of 600 – 900 °C. The resulting ashes were characterised by a high percentage of phosphorus (30 – 170 g/kg ash), calcium (20 – 360 g/kg ash) and other valuable macro- and micronutrients like copper, iron, manganese and zinc. The ashes produced during the thermal treatment are safe in terms of sanitary and can be used as additives enriching the fertilisers and soil improvers. Web of Science 4934533...|$|R

The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. A [...] <b>stationary</b> blast <b>furnace</b> and four [...] rolling open hearth furnaces were also built. A boiler plate mill, sheet metal mill, and wire mill were in operation by 1870. Another [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace was erected in 1872. By the end of 1872, the combined Newburgh plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. A second open hearth furnace was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878. Cleveland Rolling Mill built a [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace at the leased site a year later, by which time Cleveland Rolling Mill occupied [...] of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood.|$|R

Deriving biofuels from fish waste and use on-site {{can have a}} number of advantages in areas of substantial fish processing such as Newfoundland and Labrador. Currently, the waste is sent to landfill and/or discharged to the ocean. Depending on the fish species, between 3 - 25 % of the waste is oil. However, composition, stability, degree of processing required, and end use will determine feasibility of use. Fish processing plants in Atlantic Canada are remotely located, making recovery of the oil for export for fuel use unattractive economically or environmentally. On-site use is likely the most sustainable option for reducing the impacts of waste discharge and, reducing emissions and costs for petroleum fuels use and transport. [...] The study is conducted to determine the feasibility and impacts of using fish waste derived biofuel as a blend for use on-site, in the community, or in marine vessels. Waste from three fish processing plants was characterized for chemical composition, stability, and partitioning. A process to separate and purify the oil from the waste was developed by modifying the fishmeal process. Recovered oil was analyzed for physical properties such as; density, viscosity, melting properties and specific heat capacity, and chemical composition was analyzed for sulphur content, lipid classes, and fatty acids. Using energy consumption and oil recoverability data for the proposed process, an overall life cycle analysis is conducted for estimating reductions in gaseous and GHG emissions, and solid/liquid waste discharge to the ocean.

40|$|The mineral {{processing}} {{sector of industry}} is very fuel-intensive. For instance, aluminium making {{is one of the}} nine processes which together account for about 50 % of the industrial energy used in the United States (Warshawsky, 1976). In aluminium production, the first stage is alumina manufacture. In alumina processing, i e. bauxite refining, the final step is calcination. Calcination was defined and the evolution in the development of today's alumina calcination plants was reviewed. The whole processes (unit configuration and operation, equipment capabilities, energy consumption and efficiency, product quality, etc [...] ,) were described. Operational difficulties and successive improvements were also analysed. In these units, the major component of the equipment is the furnace (rotary kiln or <b>stationary</b> <b>furnace)</b> wherein the water of constitution of precalcined alumina crystals is expelled at high temperature (900 to 1200 °C). Overall aluminium trihydrate dehydroxylation is expressed by the following theoretical chemical reaction: Al 2 O 3, 3 H 2 O → AI 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 O(v) Special attention was given to five commercial stationary calciner furnaces which were detained and compared. However, the scope of this work was focused on the study of the Mark III Alcoa flash furnace : a cylindrical vertical vessel composed of three sections -the bottom and top section of smaller dimensions than the central main body- in which fuel oil or gas are introduced and burnt directly into the suspension of alumina particles. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations [...] -the best technique available to obtain a description of the flow of solid in the furnace since adequately reliable physical modelling experiment does not exist for two phases situations [...] -were carried out to ascertain the media behaviour in the chamber. A description of the numerical tool, together with the various models used in the computations were given. Numerical models of the above existing furnace were built: Isothermal single (gaseous flow) and two phase flows, combustion reaction. Swirling flow field was tested in a partial model of equivalent dimension. Heat and mass transfer between the two phases have not been implemented. Predictive results were validated against physical tests and plant operating data. The models allowed the cause of the current operational inefficiencies to be addressed. Design changes were suggested and actually introduced in the new generations of calciner furnaces which combine an increased combustion efficiency and a better processing of particles...|$|E
