5|$|A {{total of}} 273 {{disputes}} were {{brought before the}} Constitutional Court, the last of which were decided on 21 June. Of these cases, 38 decisions affected the final allocation of seats in the People's Representative Council and provincial and regental legislatures. The Democratic Party lost two seats, one to the National Mandate Party and Prosperous Peace Party each. The Pioneers' Party gained one seat from the United Democratic Nationhood Party. Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National Party by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform <b>Star</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yudhoyono's {{popularity}} skyrocketed {{after his}} falling out with Megawati {{as he was}} seen by the people as the underdog. However this popularity did not translate to {{a victory for the}} Democratic Party at the 2004 legislative elections. The party won 7.5% of the votes, which was still enough to nominate Yudhoyono as a presidential candidate. Yudhoyono accepted the nomination and picked Golkar's Jusuf Kalla as his running mate. Aside from the Democratic Party, their presidential and vice-presidential candidacy was supported by the Crescent <b>Star</b> <b>Party</b> (PBB), the Reform <b>Star</b> <b>Party</b> (PBR) and the Indonesian Justice and Unity Party (PKPI).|$|E
25|$|The six largest parties {{which passed}} the electoral {{threshold}} of 2% were the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan), the reformed Golkar Party, the United Development Party (Partai Persatuan Pembangunan), the National Awakening Party (Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa), the National Mandate Party (Partai Amanat Nasional), and the Crescent <b>Star</b> <b>Party</b> (Partai Bulan Bintang).|$|E

25|$|By late April 2009, Golkar was {{in talks}} with smaller parties to gain the votes it lacked {{to be able to}} {{nominate}} Kalla as a presidential candidate. A ten-party coalition was formed on 1 May, consisting of Golkar, PDI–P, the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), the People's Conscience Party (Hanura), the Prosperous Peace Party (PDS), the Reform <b>Star</b> <b>Party</b> (PBR), the Ulema National Awakening Party (PKNU), the National People's Concern Party (PPRN), the Labor Party and the Indonesian Nahdlatul Community Party (PPNUI). Two parties who had been considering joining the coalition, the National Mandate Party (PAN) and the United Development Party (PPP), in the end decided not to join. Shortly after the ten-party coalition was announced, incumbent Vice President Kalla announced a joint ticket with former Indonesian military leader Wiranto.|$|E
25|$|The KP3T {{consisted}} {{mainly of}} political {{figures from the}} previous regime, including former prosecutor general Djoko Sugianto. The resulting report, released in early June 2000, found {{that there had been}} no systematic massacre in the incident. This was not well received by the general public. On 23 June 2000, approximately 300 members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) attacked the headquarters of Komnas HAM while dressed in white Islamic clothing and green scarves. They broke windows with stones and rattan sticks, outnumbering and overwhelming the security forces. The FPI was upset at the commission's report on the massacre and perceived collusion with the military, arguing that it had ignored actions by the military; it insisted that the commission be abolished. Meanwhile, Minister of Law and Human Rights Yusril Ihza Mahendra wrote that Komnas HAM had seemingly applied double standards when investigating the issue; he said that they seemed more reluctant to investigate the Tanjung Priok incident then they had been in investigating the 1999 East Timorese crisis. Crescent <b>Star</b> <b>Party</b> leader Ahmad Sumargono called the verdict a disappointment to Muslims everywhere.|$|E
500|$|While {{a typical}} clear night might have 50to 100observers, {{each year the}} park hosts two major star parties which both attract several hundred astronomers for several nights.
