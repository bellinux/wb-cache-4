40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this article {{consists}} in relations between arbitration agreement and <b>set-offs.</b> Due to the controversies surrounding both institutions, the issue in question raises many doubts which are of theoretical and practical importance. The article adopts position that <b>set-offs</b> must be perceived both as the off-court vehicle for mutual settlement of reciprocal claims and liabilities governed mainly by the substantive civil law and a defense in the judicial proceedings before state courts subject to the law on the civil procedure. Therefore the analysis of interconnections between <b>set-offs</b> and arbitration agreement involves the insight {{from the perspective of}} this two – highly distinctive {{but at the same time}} closely intertwined - branches of law. The article focuses on the legal consequences of entering a valid arbitration agreement and the party’s capacity to settle one’s debt unrelated to this arbitration agreement by setting it off against its reciprocal claim covered by the arbitration agreement. The author performs a critical analysis of the current state of law including the examination of the jurisprudence stances in this regard developed by some scholars and judicial decisions of the Polish Supreme Court concerning relevant legal matters. The author proposes his final conclusions regarding the issue in question, based on theoretical assumptions adopted, explained and justified in this article. Finally, the article touches upon the possibility and purposefulness of adopting alternative regulations on the issue at hand...|$|R

2500|$|The law {{relating}} to insolvency, bankruptcy and liquidation is {{regulated by the}} Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005 in the British Virgin Islands. [...] The act is broadly based upon the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United Kingdom (without the changes brought into effect by the UK's Enterprise Act 2002), but modified in certain specific regards {{in relation to the}} jurisdiction's role as an offshore centre. [...] The Insolvency Act is [...] "predicated heavily towards the protection of secured creditors' rights". [...] The legislation includes the ISDA model netting laws to facilitate <b>set-off</b> upon a credit event in derivatives transactions. [...] It also contains specific [...] "safe harbour" [...] provisions {{relating to}} vulnerable transactions (principally undervalue transactions, unfair preferences and voidable floating charges) on an insolvency, to protect structured finance transactions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{priority}} {{system is}} reinforced by a line of case law, whose principle {{is to ensure that}} creditors cannot contract out of the statutory regime. [...] This is sometimes referred to as the [...] "anti-deprivation rule". The general principle, according to the Mellish LJ in Re Jeavons, ex parte Mackay is that [...] "a person cannot make it a part of his contract that, in the event of bankruptcy, he is then to get some additional advantage which prevents the property being distributed under the bankruptcy laws." [...] So in that case, Jeavons made a contract to give Brown & Co an armour plates patent, and in return Jeavons would get royalties. Jeavons also got a loan from Brown & Co. They agreed half the royalties would pay off the loan, but if Jeavons went insolvent, Brown & Co would not have to pay any royalties. The Court of Appeal held half the royalties would still need to be paid, because this was a special right for Brown & Co that only arose upon insolvency. In a case where a creditor is owed money by an insolvent company, but also the creditor itself owes a sum to the company, Forster v Wilson held that the creditor may <b>set-off</b> the debt, and only needs to pay the difference. The creditor does not have to pay all its debts to the company, and then wait with other unsecured creditors for an unlikely repayment. However, this depends on the sums for <b>set-off</b> actually being in the creditors' possession. In British Eagle International Air Lines Ltd v Compaigne Nationale Air France, a group of airlines, through the International Air Transport Association had a netting system to deal with all the expenses they incurred to one another efficiently. All paid into a common fund, and then {{at the end of each}} month, the sums were settled at once. British Eagle went insolvent and was a debtor overall to the scheme, but Air France owed it money. Air France claimed it should not have to pay British Eagle, was bound to pay into the netting scheme, and have the sums cleared there. The House of Lords said this would have the effect of evading the insolvency regime. It did not matter that the dominant purpose of the IATA scheme was for good business reasons. It was nevertheless void. Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc observed that the general principle consists of two subrules [...] the anti-deprivation rule (formerly known as [...] "fraud upon the bankruptcy law") and the pari passu rule, which are addressed to different mischiefs [...] and held that, in borderline cases, a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the first rule. All these anti-avoidance rules are, however, subject to the very large exception that creditors remain able to jump up the priority queue, through the creation of a security interest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{divergent}} tendencies {{regarding the}} nature and purpose of the mandate are visible already in the discussions concerning the name for this new entity. According to the Minutes of the Ninth Session of the League of Nations' Permanent Mandate Commission:Colonel Symes explained {{that the country was}} described as [...] "Palestine" [...] by Europeans and as [...] "Falestin" [...] by the Arabs. The Hebrew name for the country was the designation [...] "Land of Israel", and the Government, to meet Jewish wishes, had agreed that the word [...] "Palestine" [...] in Hebrew characters should be followed in all official documents by the initials which stood for that designation. As a <b>set-off</b> to this, certain of the Arab politicians suggested that the country should be called [...] "Southern Syria" [...] in order to emphasise its close relation with another Arab State.During the British Mandate period the area experienced the ascent of two major nationalist movements, one among the Jews and the other among the Arabs. The competing national interests of the Arab and Jewish populations of Palestine against each other and against the governing British authorities matured into the Arab Revolt of 1936–1939 and the Jewish insurgency in Palestine before culminating in the Civil War of 1947–1948. The aftermath of the Civil War and the consequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War led to the establishment of the 1949 cease-fire agreement, with partition of the former Mandatory Palestine between the newborn state of Israel with a Jewish majority, the Arab West Bank annexed by the Jordanian Kingdom and the Arab All-Palestine Government in the Gaza Strip under the protectorate of Egypt.|$|E
60|$|I {{will now}} ask your Lordships, whether any man but Mr. Hastings would claim a merit {{with his own}} country for having broken the treaty of Poorunder?

60|$|The {{parliament}} was now dissolved (July 1) {{to decide}} a great question. The {{repeal of the}} corn law, the ultimate equalisation of the sugar duties, {{the repeal of the}} navigation laws, had been the three great free trade measures of the last half-dozen years, and the issue before the electors in 1852 was whether this policy was sound or unsound. Lord Derby might have faced it boldly by announcing a moderate protection for corn and for colonial sugar. Or he might have openly told the country that he had changed his mind, as Peel had changed his mind about the catholic question and about free trade, and as Mr. Disraeli was to change his mind upon franchise in 1867, and Mr. Gladstone upon the Irish church in 1868. Instead of this, all was equivocation. The Derbyite, as was well said, was protectionist in a county, neutral in a small town, free trader in a large one. He was for Maynooth in Ireland, and against it in Scotland. Mr. Disraeli did his best to mystify the agricultural elector by phrases about <b>set-offs</b> and compensations and relief of burdens, 'seeming to loom in the future.' He rang the changes on mysterious new principles of taxation, but what they were to be, he did not disclose. The great change since 1846 was that the working-class had become strenuous free traders. They had in earlier times never been really convinced when Cobden and Bright assured them that no fall in wages would follow the promised fall in the price of food. It was the experience of six years that convinced them. England alone had gone unhurt and unsinged through the fiery furnace of 1848, and nobody doubted that the stability of her institutions and the unity of her people were due to the repeal of bad laws, believed to raise the price of bread to the toilers in order to raise rents for territorial idlers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Au revoir, mademoiselle," [...] said I, and I escaped. I saw the directress's {{stock of}} words was yet far from exhausted. She looked after me, she would fain have {{detained}} me longer. Her manner towards me had been altered ever since I {{had begun to}} treat her with hardness and indifference: she almost cringed to me on every occasion; she consulted my countenance incessantly, and beset me with innumerable little officious attentions. Servility creates despotism. This slavish homage, instead of softening my heart, only pampered whatever was stern and exacting in its mood. The very circumstance of her hovering round me like a fascinated bird, seemed to transform me into a rigid pillar of stone; her flatteries irritated my scorn, her blandishments confirmed my reserve. At times I wondered what she meant by giving herself such trouble to win me, when the more profitable Pelet was already in her nets, and when, too, she was aware that I possessed her secret, for I had not scrupled to tell her as much: {{but the fact is}} that as it was her nature to doubt the reality and under-value the worth of modesty, affection, disinterestedness--to regard these qualities as foibles of character--so it was equally her tendency to consider pride, hardness, selfishness, as proofs of strength. She would trample on the neck of humility, she would kneel at the feet of disdain; she would meet tenderness with secret contempt, indifference she would woo with ceaseless assiduities. Benevolence, devotedness, enthusiasm, were her antipathies; for dissimulation and self-interest she had a preference--they were real wisdom in her eyes; moral and physical degradation, mental and bodily inferiority, she regarded with indulgence; they were foils capable of being turned to good account as <b>set-offs</b> for her own endowments. To violence, injustice, tyranny, she succumbed--they were her natural masters; she had no propensity to hate, no impulse to resist them; the indignation their behests awake in some hearts was unknown in hers. From all this it resulted that the false and selfish called her wise, the vulgar and debased termed her charitable, the insolent and unjust dubbed her amiable, the conscientious and benevolent generally at first accepted as valid her claim to be considered one of themselves; but ere long the plating of pretension wore off, the real material appeared below, and they laid her aside as a deception.|$|R
2500|$|D Company {{departed}} Nui Dat at 11:00 on 18 August. Led by Smith {{and accompanied}} by a three-man New Zealand forward observer party under Captain Maurice Stanley, the 108-man company <b>set-off</b> quickly. Already behind schedule and with B Company having been out for longer than expected, Smith wanted to relieve Ford before more time elapsed and then follow the Viet Cong tracks to continue the pursuit that afternoon. Opting for speed, he adopted single file, with 12 Platoon under Second Lieutenant David Sabben in the lead. Despite the heat the company moved at a fast pace, traversing the low scrub, swamp and paddy fields as they closed in on B Company's position. Meanwhile, {{the rock and roll}} acts Little Pattie and Col Joye and the Joy Boys had flown into Nui Dat and were setting up for the afternoon concert. Many of the Australians were disappointed at the prospect of missing the entertainment, and as they patrolled east they occasionally heard the music through the trees. At 13:00 they married up with B Company {{on the edge of the}} Long Tan rubber plantation, approximately [...] from Nui Dat. D Company moved into all-round defence and sentries were posted. While the soldiers had lunch, Smith and Ford inspected the area with a small protection party. The position appeared to have been used by the Viet Cong as a staging area prior to the bombardment two nights before, while signs of casualties having been evacuated by cart were located. Blood stains were also uncovered, as was a quantity of equipment and sandals. The mortar and RCL firing locations were also examined. After briefing Smith, Ford and the remainder of B Company turned for Nui Dat. D Company subsequently took over the pursuit.|$|E
2500|$|Businesses, and {{the banks}} who had {{previously}} enjoyed uncompromised priority for their security, increasingly looked for ways to circumvent {{the effect of the}} insolvency legislation's scheme of priorities. A floating charge, in order for its value to be ascertained, must have [...] "crystallised" [...] into a fixed charge on some particular date, usually set by agreement. Before the date of crystallisation (given the charge merely [...] "floats" [...] over no particular property) there is the possibility that a company could both charge out property to creditors with priority, or that other creditors could <b>set-off</b> claims against property subject to the (uncrystallised) floating charge. Furthermore, other security interests (such as a contractual lien) will take priority to a crystallised floating charge if it arises before in time. But after crystallisation, assets received by the company can be caught by the charge. One way for companies to gain priority with floating charges originally was to stipulate in the charge agreement that the charge would convert from [...] "floating" [...] to [...] "fixed" [...] automatically on some event before the date of insolvency. According to the default rules at common law, floating charges impliedly crystallise when a receiver is appointed, if a business ceases or is sold, if a company is would up, or if {{under the terms of the}} debenture provision is made for crystallisation on reasonable notice from the charge holder. However an automatic crystallisation clause would mean that at the time of insolvency - when preferential creditors' claims are determined - there would be no floating charge above which preferential creditors could be elevated. The courts held that it was legitimate for security agreements to have this effect. In Re Brightlife Ltd Brightlife Ltd had contracted with its bank, Norandex, to allow a floating charge to be converted to a fixed charge on notice, and this was done one week before a voluntary winding up resolution. Against the argument that public policy should restrict the events allowing for crystallisation, Hoffmann J held that in his view it was not [...] "open to the courts to restrict the contractual freedom of parties to a floating charge on such grounds." [...] Parliament, however, intervened to state in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251 that if a charge was created as a floating charge, it would deem to remain a floating charge at the point of insolvency, regardless of whether it had crystallised.|$|E

60|$|To-day, again, {{they have}} Professor Butcher, and I hear {{he has a}} prodigious deal of Greek; and they have Professor Chrystal, who is a man filled with the mathematics. And doubtless these are <b>set-offs.</b> But they cannot {{change the fact that}} Professor Blackie has retired, and that Professor Kelland is dead. No man's {{education}} is complete or truly liberal who knew not Kelland. There were unutterable lessons in the mere sight of that frail old clerical gentleman, lively as a boy, kind like a fairy godfather, and keeping perfect order in his class by the spell of that very kindness. I have heard him drift into reminiscences in class time, though not for long, and give us glimpses of old-world life in out-of-the-way English parishes when he was young; thus playing the same part as Lindsay--the part of the surviving memory, signalling out of the dark backward and abysm of time the images of perished things. But it was a part that scarce became him; he somehow lacked the means: for all his silver hair and worn face, he was not truly old; and he had too much of the unrest and petulant fire of youth, and too much invincible innocence of mind, to play the veteran well. The time to measure him best, to taste (in the old phrase) his gracious nature, was when he received his class at home. What a pretty simplicity would he then show, trying to amuse us like children with toys; and what an engaging nervousness of manner, as fearing that his efforts might not succeed! Truly, he made us all feel like children, and like children embarrassed, {{but at the same time}} filled with sympathy for the conscientious, troubled elder-boy who was working so hard to entertain us. A theorist has held the view that there is no feature in man so tell-tale as his spectacles; that the mouth may be compressed and the brow smoothed artificially, but the sheen of the barnacles is diagnostic. And truly it must have been thus with Kelland; for as I still fancy I behold him frisking actively about the platform, pointer in hand, that which I seem to see most clearly is the way his glasses glittered with affection. I never knew but one other man who had (if you will permit the phrase) so kind a spectacle, and that was Dr. Appleton.[5] But the light in his case was tempered and passive; in Kelland's it danced, and changed, and flashed vivaciously among the students, like a perpetual challenge to goodwill.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine ways to overcome Shariah objections to derivatives in Islamic finance, through comparative analysis with conventional law. In Islamic finance, derivatives are still at the stage of infancy, where {{there is a lot of}} resistance from scholars against its usage. This research uncovered that these Shariah objections are very similar to earlier legal objections in conventional finance that attempted to ban or render illegal derivatives because they were considered to be, inter alia, instruments of gambling. Various laws, rules and regulations were enacted in conventional finance which eventually led to the legalisation of derivatives. This research attempts to focus on the laws that were enacted in the UK and US, to overcome or reduce the objections therein, and explore whether these laws can overcome similar objections in Islamic finance. This research followed the qualitative inquiry paradigm where two methods were used to collect data – the historical and the case study methodologies. Under the first stage the historical method was used to review laws in the UK and US from the 17 th century to the 20 th century. From the laws that were reviewed, only relevant provisions that may overcome the objections in Shariah against derivatives were selected, analysed and discussed. The second stage followed the case study methodology. Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants who had expertise in Islamic finance and conventional finance and/or law. The participants were asked on the need for derivatives in Islamic finance, the applicability of conventional laws in Islamic finance, and other recommendations on risk management solutions in Islamic finance. The transcribed interviews were analysed and interpreted using the qualitative software tool NVivo version 8. The findings of this research unveiled that the underlying objection in conventional finance against derivative usage was the prohibition of gambling, whereas in Shariah it is gharar. Gambling and gharar are not different types of objections, they are actually related. Analysis of the relationship between gambling and gharar led to the unearthing of the fact that maisir or gambling falls within the definition of gharar; in other words, gambling is a subset of gharar. Thus Islamic finance may learn from the legal history of derivative development in conventional law in relation to objections which relate to excessive speculation and gambling. Further, from the responses of the participants it was gathered that Islamic finance can turn towards conventional finance to use the laws therein as long as it complies with Shariah principles. Results also unveiled that derivative instruments such as futures and options, that have hedging properties, are needed in the Islamic financial industry today. Participants believed that futures and options are more useful than harmful to the economy. However, the participants opined that futures and options as they exist in their present form are not acceptable in Islamic finance. At the same time when the participants were queried whether, if all the objections towards derivatives could be overcome they would be accepted in Islamic finance, the participants answered that this was possible. The laws that have been enacted in conventional finance deal with issues of speculation, gambling and other abuses in the futures and options exchange such as dishonest behaviour, cornering and <b>set-offs.</b> These laws that were enacted in conventional finance may be used in Islamic finance to address similar issues...|$|R
