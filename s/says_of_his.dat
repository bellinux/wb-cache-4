Disney, which {{has a reputation for}} aggressively protecting its intellectual property, has been tolerant of visitors uploading videos of their visits to YouTube and elsewhere since most of those user-created videos project a positive image of the parks. But Moore did not expect to get permission from Disney to shoot there given his negative, surrealistic portrayal of the park.|$|E

He works {{primarily}} on figurative sculpture in clay within the neoclassical tradition.

500|$|Originally 11 Melbury Road, {{the house}} was renumbered as 31 Melbury Road in 1967. It was the second of two houses in Melbury Road {{designed}} by Shaw, the first, 8 Melbury Road, was designed for another painter Marcus Stone. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Of the construction of Woodland House Fildes wrote in November 1876 that [...] "The house is getting on famously and looks stunning... It {{is a long way}} the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, though of course he wouldn't have that by what I hear he <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>his,</b> but my opinion is the universal one." [...] Fildes moved into the house in October 1877 and it remained his home until his death there in February 1927. Fildes was survived by his wife and six children. [...] In 1959 the London County Council commemorated Fildes at Woodland House with a blue plaque.|$|E

500|$|Extant {{biographies of}} Epaminondas universally {{describe}} {{him as one of}} the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Mantinean campaign: [...] "Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone." [...] Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [...] "For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, [...] Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".|$|E
500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going to answer it honestly with a wink and a smile. As clich√© as it might be, I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

Oakey <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early 1980s style: [...] "I deliberately wore clothes that either men or women could wear. But I don't think I ever really looked like a woman.
