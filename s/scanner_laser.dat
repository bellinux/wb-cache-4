40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for the threedimensional {{reconstruction}} of environments, using a mobile platform that has onboard a <b>scanner</b> <b>laser</b> for the acquisition of the geometry of the scene, and a webcam for the registration of {{the texture of the}} environment. The used algorithm is based on the localization of the planes that conform the scene, the assignment of the 3 D points to the planes for subsequently to apply a triangulation and this way to obtain the surfaces and contours of the model. In the texture the images are assigned to the plane surfaces and by means of a stitching algorithm (image mosaics), the complete scene is compose, in “Vrml” format. To diminish the loss of information of the free forms, and the distortion generated well because the points are considered discarded or because they can not be approximate to planes, we propose a variant in the treatment of the data that consists on projecting the images of the scene and the 3 D points on a sphere After to obtain the corresponding planes in angular coordinates (teta, phi), the assignment of texture would be realized on the triangular surfaces obtained of the model points.

40|$|A {{scanning}} probe microscope is combined with a laser induced breakdown spectrometer to provide spatially resolved chemical analysis of the surface correlated with the surface topography. Topographical analysis is achieved by scanning a sharp probe across the sample at constant distance from the surface. Chemical analysis is achieved by the means of laser induced breakdown spectroscopy by delivering pulsed laser radiation to the sample surface through the same sharp probe, and consequent collection and analysis of emission spectra from plasma generated on the sample by the laser radiation. The method comprises performing microtopographical analysis of the sample with a {{scanning probe}}, selecting a scanned topological site on the sample, generating a plasma plume at the selected scanned topological site, and measuring a spectrum of optical emission from the plasma at the selected scanned topological site. The apparatus comprises a scanning probe, a pulsed laser optically coupled to the probe, an optical spectrometer, and a controller coupled to the <b>scanner,</b> <b>laser</b> and spectrometer for controlling {{the operation of the}} <b>scanner,</b> <b>laser</b> and spectrometer. The probe and scanner are used for topographical profiling the sample. The probe is also used for laser radiation delivery to the sample for generating a plasma plume from the sample.

40|$|Abstract: Modern lasers {{can produce}} a {{high-quality}} beam. This allows {{the use of a}} small focal point even smaller than 0. 3 mm in diameter. Welding with a small spot can provide excellent productivity but it has limitations; for example, a very narrow weld that is not suitable for all types of joints. The problem in the laser welding of tube-to-tube joints is the positioning of the tubes and roundness error of the tube ends. One possible solution is studied in the present work: the use of a self-steering joint and welding with an oscillating mirror. A self-steering joint might help due to a zero gap in every case. With <b>scanner</b> <b>laser</b> welding, it is possible to achieve wider welds with sufficient weld quality. The scanner allows more precise control of the process and gives more options for laser welding. The welding process can be more accu-rately controlled due {{to a wide range of}} parameters...|$|E

A method for tuning the fractional order PID is presented for a closed-loop dynamic system.

Common excitation functions are used to assess the performance of the active stabilization system, along with some common vibration disturbances acquired by a field experiment with a tractor-implement set. The results show that the active stabilization system presents better performance, mitigating vibration displacements and accelerations through a closed-loop system with a fractional PID controller. Additionally, numerical results confirm the superior capacity of the fractional controller based system for attenuating the vibration disturbance compared to the classical PID system for different machinery operational conditions such as forward speed and load. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

In this approach, the similar aperture profile along the fluid flow direction is mapped in to a network space. The modeled permeability using the LBM shows good correlation with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, the two main characters of the obtained networks, i. e., characteristic length and number of edges show the same evolutionary trend with the modeled permeability values. Analysis of motifs through the obtained networks showed the most transient sub-graphs are much more frequent in residual stages.

40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>scanners</b> are {{essential}} for scientific research, manufacturing, defense, and medical practice. Unfortunately, often times the speed of conventional <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> (e. g., galvanometric mirrors and acousto-optic deflectors) falls short for many applications, resulting in motion blur and failure to capture fast transient information. Here, we present a novel type of <b>laser</b> <b>scanner</b> that offers roughly three orders of magnitude higher scan rates than conventional methods. Our <b>laser</b> <b>scanner,</b> which we {{refer to as the}} hybrid dispersion <b>laser</b> <b>scanner,</b> performs inertia-free <b>laser</b> scanning by dispersing a train of broadband pulses both temporally and spatially. More specifically, each broadband pulse is temporally processed by time stretch dispersive Fourier transform and further dispersed into space by one or more diffractive elements such as prisms and gratings. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we perform 1 D line scans at a record high scan rate of 91 MHz and 2 D raster scans and 3 D volumetric scans at an unprecedented scan rate of 105 kHz. The method holds promise for a broad range of scientific, industrial, and biomedical applications. To show the utility of our method, we demonstrate imaging, nanometer-resolved surface vibrometry, and high-precision flow cytometry with real-time throughput that conventional <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> cannot offer due to their low scan rates. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
