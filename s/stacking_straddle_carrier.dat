In this paper, we compare, by means of a simulation study, the performance of manned <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> and automated <b>stacking</b> cranes. As main performance measure, we use the total travel time required to handle storage and retrieval requests from both the sea- and landside of the terminal. It can be concluded that automated <b>stacking</b> cranes outperform <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> in a <b>stack</b> with a span width smaller than nine containers. From that point on <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> reach a comparable performance. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{motivation}} {{of this study}} is the recent advancement of the <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (S/C). Previously <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (S/C) system was used focusing on container lift on/off due to its lower driving speed than that of (Y/T). Shuttle Carrier is evaluated as an upgraded <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier.</b> Recently, however, the driving speed of (S/C) has been improved to the level of Yard Tractor and Trailer systems (Y/T), which is 30 Km per hour which makes (S/C) qualified as terminal in-yard transportation equipment. This paper, therefore, aims to evaluate three types of terminal in-yard transportation equipments such as (Y/T), (AGV) and the advanced (S/C) from economic perspective. The results revealed that by observing the total costs of equipment, (S/C) is a cheaper option than (Y/T) over 20 years, and than (AGV) over 6 years...|$|R

Because a <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> is open at both front and rear, it can transport lumber much longer than the carrier itself, over 30 m in length.|$|R

These machines {{have the ability to}} stack containers up to 4 high. These are capable of relatively low speeds (up to 30 km/h) with a laden container. The workers that use this machinery sit at the very top seated facing the middle as they can see behind them and in front of them. <b>Straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> can lift up to 60 t which equals up to 2 full containers.|$|R
40|$|The Transport {{division}} {{is responsible for}} the internal transports on Sandvik Material Technology AB. At the moment there is no clear picture of how the <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> are moving at the division Primary Products and if it is working in a satisfying way. It is important to see the whole picture of the transportation flow so improvements can be made. The purpose of this essay is to survey and analyse the truck flow in a Lean Production perspective. The essay is delimited to only include <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> transportation ways in the Primary Products division. To survey the truck flow we have used a method called Walkthrough. This means that we have walked thorough the whole production flow and interviewed some of the employed on the way to get the necessary information. We have also made an extensive literature study to gather all the necessary theories that is relevant for this essay. Since 2003 Sandvik Material Technology is running a project called “ledtidsprojektet”, the purpose of this project is to create a more efficient production. This project is based on the Japanese philosophy Lean Production but is audited to be suitable to Sandviks organisation. Today most of the producing divisions within SMT are working according to ”ledtidsprogrammet”, unfortunately it is not introduced on the Transport division yet. The result we got by studying the use of the <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> showed that 40 % where with cargo, 35 % without and 25 % where remaining times were breaks are included. The basis of the study is from a GPS-transmitter which is placed on one of the <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier.</b> We have also made our own study where we followed on the <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> and measured the time for the different activities. To get a more statistical secured investigation it is necessary to make a more extensive study, when these study where made during a limited time. On the basis of the truck flows survey some suggestions for improvements have been identified. It has showed that today’s key measurements have to be overlooked to give a fair picture of the situation. They also have to improve the way they are planning the transports. This can be made by better communication with the producing divisions. For the <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> to be more Lean first the producing divisions have to work according to the Lean philosophy. It is up to them to try to reduce the stock level and get a more evenly production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{problem of}} {{analysing}} operational policies for transhipping containers in a port container terminal is studied using an agent-based simulation approach. The decision makers involved in transhipment operations, i. e., the terminal manager, the port captain, the stevedores {{and the ship}} captains, {{as well as some}} of the operators of the physical resources, such as cranes and <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers,</b> are modelled as agents. A simulator, called SimPort, has been developed to illustrate the viability of this approach, To exemplify its usage, it has been configured based on real data from container terminals and used for comparing eight operational policies in several scenarios. The policies concern the sequencing of ships, berth allocation, and stacking rule. The policies are evaluated with respect to a number of aspects, such as, turn-around time for ships and travelled distance of <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R
