40|$|Focusing on {{contemporary}} shellfish exploitation among several atoll communities in Kiribati, Micronesia, this paper examines {{the relationship between}} human foragers and their invertebrate prey via the prey choice or diet breadth model derived from optimal foraging theory. Shellfish, like many other reef organisms, are relatively sedentary and predictable, but these characteristics make them susceptible to over-harvesting. The research reveals that <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> are foraging {{in a manner that}} matches the predictions of optimal foraging theory. The work adds to our understanding of optimal foraging decisions in atoll settings by critically evaluating the depiction of atoll dwellers as conservationists...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] The aims of {{this study}} are to {{determine}} prevalence and co-occurrence of musculoskeletal pain (MSP) among <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> and its consequences for the use of medicine, health care, and sickness leave and to investigate predictive factors (sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidity) of MSP in five anatomical areas (neck/shoulder/higher back, lower back, elbow/wrist/hand, hip/knee, and leg/ankle/foot). Nine hundred twenty-nine <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> (94 % women) voluntarily took part in a physiotherapy workshop. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess MSP and its consequences. Regression models were performed to determine the factors predicting the presence of MSP. The two most frequently self-reported forms of MSP were neck pain (70. 9 %) and lower back pain (65. 5 %). Sixty-four percent of respondents reported contact with their family doctor during the last 12 months due to MSP, and most subjects (88. 1 %) reported MSP in two or more locations. Hip/knee pain was associated with leg/ankle/foot pain (crude odds ratio[*]=[*] 3. 14). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female and young is associated with lumbar pain, and being older is associated with pain in all areas of the lower limbs. The number of pain sites a person reported significantly predicted the presence of pain in all the anatomical areas studied. Prevalence of MSP and musculoskeletal comorbidity were high. The study shows that the presence of pain reported in one body area is highly dependent on the total number of painful areas. These findings are consistent with those of similar studies...|$|R
40|$|The prey choice model, {{previously}} applied among <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> in Kiribati, Micronesia, {{has shown}} that they are foraging {{in a manner that}} matches the predictions of optimal foraging theory by maximizing their net energy return rates. Similar conclusions can be drawn subsequent to testing the patch choice model, including patch switching; patch sampling; and the analysis of risk. In light of these results, it is argued that natural selection probably never encouraged the persistence of conservation because individuals have nearly always benefited from short-term goals to ensure greater fitness. However, the possibility remains {{that as a result of}} changed circumstances brought about by increasing human population, more efficient extractive technologies, and expanding market opportunities, genuine, as opposed to epiphenomenal conservation, may become established in heavily impacted environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{mangrove}} is {{a highly}} productive ecosystem that carries out important ecological functions and that historically {{it has been used}} for the subsistence and income of countless craft fishing communities. In the mangroves of Todos os Santos Bay, including those of the District of Acupe (Santo Amaro – Bahia State), the bivalve mollusks (shellfish) are among the most important resources, and their gathering is known as “mariscagem”. This work aims to characterize the knowledge of the local female <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> regarding the biology and ecology of bivalve shellfish. Semi-structured interviews were used with local shellfish women (N= 54) involving ethnotaxonomy, trophic ecology, hydrodynamics, fenology and ethnocronology. Etic-emic analisys of the data was chosen in order to compare the information obtained in the field to that from the academic literature. The results demonstrated that the shellfish women of Acupe have a significant knowledge of bivalve shellfish, in addition to aspects related to the dynamics of local mangroves, that is sometimes compatible with academic knowledge...|$|R

In Garapuá village, the shellfish Lucina pectinata is the main resource exploited in mangroves. This study tests whether if in less explored areas (far from the village) L. pectinata individuals have higher densities and greater lengths, {{and if there was}} a decrease in cpue's over the last years. Samples were taken monthly in two habitats (mangrove channels and mangrove roots) in six mangrove areas by random squares. The results indicated that closer areas showed significantly lower densities than areas far from the village. Densities were significantly higher in mangrove roots (quizangas) than at channels. There was a significant increase in monthly L. pectinata cpue, from 18. 2 dz. /shellfish gatherers/day in 2001 to 19. 3 in 2007, showing that this stock {{does not seem to be}} overexploited. However, (i) a long-term monitoring of Garapuá <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> to evaluate if the stock will support an increasing pressure and (ii) several manipulative experiments to better understand ecological processes are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Multiple stress {{mechanisms}} {{have caused}} a worldwide decrease in seagrasses, which are vulnerable to environmental and/or anthropogenic pressure. The loss of seagrass meadows of Halodule wrightii is reported for the littoral of Itamaracá Island (Northeastern Brazil). The present study identified the main anthropogenic factors that negatively influenced over the abundance and distribution of seagrass meadows between July and September 2007 at the Jaguaribe and Pilar Beaches, Eastern littoral of Itamaracá. Anthropogenic impact included the discharge of untreated sewage through fluvial channels, urban and commercial development along the coast, the anchoring of motorized and non-motorized boats, diverse fishing techniques and the dumping of solid waste. The data indicates that the Pilar is an environment with a higher impact index (71. 43 %) {{when compared with the}} Jaguaribe (57. 14 %), standing out the number of boats with a central motor, the total number of boats, the presence of <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> and coastal urban development. The present study reinforces the need for defining management and conservation measures for this ecosystem, which has high ecological and economic value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] Functional {{disability}} due to lumbar pain {{should be}} considered from the biopsychosocial model. There is inconclusive evidence {{as to whether the}} key determining factors in this form of disability are psychosocial or physical. Our aim is to identify variables that cause functional disability due to lumbar pain amongst <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> in Galicia by means of a cross-sectional survey. Participants (N = 929) completed a self-administered, paper-based questionnaire including sociodemographic and lifestyle issues, as well as the nature of the lumbar pain, the presence of musculoskeletal pain in other regions of the body, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and SF- 36. Univariate examination, ROC curve and logistic regression analyses were performed. Most of these workers are women (98. 7 %), {{with a mean age of}} 50. 6 years. The point-prevalence of lumbar pain stands at 65. 5 %. The RMDQ mean was 4. 9 (SD = 4. 7). In the logistic regression analysis, the variables associated with disability (RMDQ > median) were age (OR = 1. 04), physical exercise (OR = 0. 57), pain intensity (OR = 1. 16), the number of regions of musculoskeletal pain (OR = 1. 24) and mental health (SF- 36) (OR = − 0. 95). Functional disability is determined by the physical nature of the pain and mental health attributes, although the former has a greater impact. In decreasing order of importance, functional disability is attributable to the presence of lower back pain, the number of regions of musculoskeletal pain, the intensity of that pain and age. Regular physical exercise and better mental health have a protective effect on disability...|$|R
40|$|A 1998 study {{estimated}} {{the stocks of}} oysters in Strangford Lough to be 100, 000. In 2002 the estimated population was 1 million. Stock's peaked in 2003 at 1. 2 million. By 2004 {{there had been a}} decline of> 300, 000 oysters. This decline left an estimated 600, 000 in 2005. The decline appears to be the result ofunregulated harvesting. <b>Shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> were regularly observed in the present study area. Natural mortality can be disregarded as a cause of decrease since no empty oyster valves were evident. In investigating recruitment potential spatfall surveys were undertaken from June to September 2003 and 2004. The research into spatfall patterns and spatial expansion has identified locations suitable for broodstock sanctuaries and where spat settlement is possible. The findings for 2003 - 2004 did not detect any shift in the timing ofspatfall since the 1998 survey. Both surveys identified July and August as the months with the highest densities of spat. The highest densities ofoysters (> 2 m 2) were recorded on littoral mixed shell (LMX). Sites in the southern basin were coded as (LMX) such locations may be important areas of possible settlement in the future. Investigations into the epibiota on the shell of 0. edulis showed increases in biodiversity are possible during O. edulis restoration. Surfaces ofthe oyster shell showed an increase in species richness and diversity when compared with other hard substrata. Increases in size and age are proportional to increases in species diversity. This work shows that hydrographical conditions the availability ofcultch and the spawning potential ofan un-fragmented stock can augment and rejuvenate the current population. It has collated sufficient base line data to initiate and monitor future restoration programmes. Careful management and policing is ess~ntial for any success. A reclamation and costing plan for any future rejuvenation programmes has also been detailed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|During a 1995 aerial video {{survey of}} the {{coastline}} of Johnstone Strait, an unusual shoreline feature was noted and termed “clam terraces” (inset) because of the terrace-type morphology and the apparent association with high clam productivity on the sandflats. Typical alongshore lengths of the terrace ridges are 20 - 50 m, and across-shore widths are typically 20 - 40 m. An area with an especially high density of clam terraces was noted in the Broughton Archipelago, between Broughton and Gilford Islands of southeastern Queen Charlotte Strait. Clam terraces in this area were inventoried from the aerial video imagery to quantify their distribution. The terraces accounted for over 14 km of shoreline and 365 clam terraces were documented. A three-day field survey by a coastal geomorphologist, archeologist and marine biologist was conducted to document the features and determine their origin. Nine clam terraces were surveyed. The field observations confirmed that: the ridges are comprised of boulder/cobblesized material, ridge crests are typically {{in the range of}} 1 - 1. 5 m above chart datum, sandflats are comprised almost entirely of shell fragments (barnacles and clams) and sandflats have very high shellfish production. There are an abundance of shell middens in the area (over 175) suggesting that the shellfish associated with the terraces were an important food source of aboriginal peoples. The origin of the ridges is unknown; they appear to be a relict feature in that they are not actively being modified by present-day processes. The ridges may be a relict sea-ice feature, although the mechanics of ridge formation is uncertain. Sand accumulates behind the ridge because the supply rate of the shell fragments exceeds the dispersal rate in these low energy environments. The high density areas of clam terraces correspond to high density areas of shell middens, and it is probable that the clam terraces were subjected to some degree of modification by aboriginal <b>shellfish</b> <b>gatherers</b> over the thousands of years of occupation in the region.
