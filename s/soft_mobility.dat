40|$|The paper {{examines}} some European cases {{referred to}} promotion of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> {{as a new}} lifestyle oriented to improve benefits on environment and urban livability. <b>Soft</b> <b>mobility</b> refers to human powered displacement (HPM) and represents a particular component of passenger traffic, it is particularly associated with pedestrian traffic, hiking, cycling as well as getting around on vehicle-type devices (such as inline skates, kick scooters, etc.). Promoting this kind of sustainable transport needs interventions both on physical and functional system. On one hand cities have to provide specific attractive, safe and integrated facilities whose realization could be an opportunity of urban requalification; {{on the other hand}} they have to dispose political actions to improve <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> use. European context is characterized by high disparity among countries in the use of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> applied to urban displacement in spite of a prolific production of laws and roles referred to the emergency of adopting new ways of moving to minimize negatives impacts generated by car dependence also in urban short distance. The use of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> for short displacement especially referred to leisure and tourism activities could represent an occasion both to promote special measures to create better condition in urban life and to improve integration between territorial transformation and mobility management achieving higher level of urban quality life. The cases shown in this paper underline that promotion of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> affect both territorial and urban level giving a chance toward new ways of enjoying urban and territorial resources...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} some European cases {{referred to}} promotion of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> {{as a new}} lifestyle aimed to improve benefits on environment and urban livability. <b>Soft</b> <b>mobility</b> includes any non-motorized transport (human powered mobility). According to this, <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> refers to pedestrian, bicycle, roller skate and skateboard transfers. It could be indented as “zeroimpact” mobility too. As a matter of fact, the words to define this way of moving have not been codified yet, therefore mobilitè douce, <b>soft</b> <b>mobility,</b> slow traffic are synonymous in referring mainly to pedestrians and cyclists to indicate alternative to car use. <b>Soft</b> <b>mobility,</b> indeed, {{can be defined as}} a special form of sustainable mobility able to optimize urban livability, by keeping the individual right to move. At present, cities are engaged in defining policies, procedures and interventions to further “slow traffic”, both to relieve the traffic congestion, and to work for regeneration and environmental improvements. This asks for an in-depth cooperation between different political and administrative levels to achieve common objectives of development more attentive to environmental concerns. Despite this increasing attention, the idea of a “network” for <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> has not been yet achieved and the supply of integrated facilities and services {{as an alternative to the}} car use seems to be still difficult of accomplishment. High disparity characterizes European countries in promoting soft mobility: despite a prolific production of laws and roles referred to emergency of adopting alternative ways of moving to minimize negatives impacts (especially air and noise pollution as very threat to health) due to car dependence for urban short distance too. And yet, <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> could represent a real occasion of urban and territorial regeneration aimed to rehabilitate some disused paths and routes (greenways). Some successful European cases show how it is possible to capitalize territorial resources by promoting alternative way to visit them. Tourist and leisure activities, in fact, are probably the most suitable to improve a car-free lifestyle. Some pilot projects carried out in alpine regions, for instance, propose to integrate public transport supply with tourist demand of visiting different destinations. “Soft mobility” should be a different way of thinking about mobility and its impact on environment. This is what this article try to underline giving an overview of some European cases of public policies aimed at supporting <b>soft</b> <b>mobility...</b>|$|E

Robert Scaer suggested that deep relaxation of Watsu balances the autonomic nervous system (ANS), decreasing sympathetic response and increasing parasympathetic response, with far-reaching benefits. Compressive forces of hydrostatic pressure combine with deep relaxation to enhance functioning of the lymphatic system and reduce swelling in cases of edema. For orthopedic impairments, combined effects of relaxation, warm water, and gentle movement decreases muscle spasm, provides pain relief, improves <b>soft</b> tissue <b>mobility,</b> and increases range of motion.

In Portugal, car is the most used mode of transport for daily commuting and the rate of cycling for everyday travel is 1 %, while the average in Europe is 8 %. This research aimed to investigate the role of innovation and its contribution to the raise of bicycle commuting in Portugal. Methods comprise research mixed methods, both quantitative and qualitative, based on secondary data research and the elaboration of an online survey. The analysis of Portuguese public policies, bicycle industry innovations and bike commuting related initiatives over the past 10 years illustrates how much has been done. However, that is not enough to enhance bike commuting to the European average levels. It was, therefore, crucial to understand the commuters’ motives and barriers that undermine the use of bicycles as a means of transport, as well as innovations that contributed to bike commuting. Innovative knowledge and innovative technologies applied to the level of bicycle commuting could lead to disruptive innovation at different levels, such as legislation, promotion of safety and surveillance, bicycle and accessories, mobile applications and websites, infrastructures, intermodal transport or initiatives to promote bike as a mode of transport. The coordination of these innovations and measures, between public and private sectors, are crucial to make the shift to <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> aligned with European policy orientations...|$|E

40|$|As mass {{analyzer}} {{technology has}} continued to improve over the last fifty years, the prospect of field-portable mass spectrometers has garnered interest from many research groups and organizations. Designing a field portable instrument entails more than the scaling down of current commercial systems. Additional considerations such as power consumption, vacuum requirements and ruggedization also play key roles. In this research, two avenues were pursued in the initial development of a portable system. First, micrometer-scale mass analyzers and other electrostatic components were fabricated using silicon on insulator-deep reactive ion etching, and tested. Second, the dimensions of an ion trap were scaled to the millimeter level and fabricated from common metals and commercially available vacuum plastics. This instrument was tested for use in ion isolation and collision induced dissociation for secondary mass spectrometry and confirmatory analyses of unknowns. In addition to portable instrumentation, miniature mass spectrometers show potential for usage in process and reaction monitoring. To this end, a commercial residual gas analyzer was used to monitor plasma deposition and cleaning inside of a chamber designed for laser ablation and <b>soft</b> landing-ion <b>mobility</b> to generate metal-main group clusters. This chamber was also equipped for multiple types of spectral analysis {{in order to identify}} and characterize the clusters. Finally, a portion of this research was dedicated to method development in sample collection and analysis for forensic study.

40|$|After {{studying}} scholarly literature, {{we provide}} in this graduation thesis a detailed {{insight into the}} anatomy of the orofacial area and possible specifics among children with mental disorders, especially those with chromosomal malformations, such as Prader-Willi syndrome or Down syndrome. We also presented {{the role of a}} speech therapist in treatment of children with mental disorders who have a specific anatomy of the orofacial area, and describe a series of speech therapeutic exercises that can be carried out during the orofacial treatment and articulation therapy. Our research included a medium-sized sample of 54 children aged from 6 to 15 years. The children come from different educational institutions – Roje Primary School in Domžale, dr. Slavko Grum Primary School in Zagorje ob Savi, Special Education Centre Janez Levec (primary school unit located on Levstikov trg in Ljubljana). The children were categorised into groups of mild, moderate, severe and profound mental disorders. In addition, 10 children with Down syndrome were included. Data was collected through our own questionnaire containing questions about the child’s specifics which was handed to the parents along with a letter and an agreement. An orofacial examination was performed using methods specified in scholarly literature. After all the agreements were signed, orofacial area and articulation examinations were executed. The results based on our sample of children with mental disorders showed prevalence of at least one or more anatomical and functional specifics in the orofacial area in 36 cases. We established that the most common anatomical and functional specifics in the examined children were the following: limited <b>soft</b> palate <b>mobility,</b> mouth openness, limited nasal passage, velopharyngeal insufficiency, abnormally highly arched palate, incisal edge, and a too short sublingual bond. The observation of anatomical and functional specifics of the orofacial area did not indicate any correlations with the level of mental retardation. The empirical part of the thesis contains observations of anatomical and functional specifics of the orofacial area in children with mental disorders, observations of the occurrence of those specifics, and findings about the rate of mental development and its connection to orofacial specifics. The most frequent characteristic is limited <b>soft</b> palate <b>mobility,</b> which was present in 21 cases. Our study clearly shows that all children with Down syndrome have {{at least one of the}} anatomical or functional specifics of the orofacial area – these are not as common among children without Down syndrome. However, we did not confirm a statistically important difference in nasal resonance between the two groups. Moreover, we did not confirm the connection between mouth breathing and limited nasal passage, mouth openness and hyponasality. Articulation disorders were more frequent among children with Down syndrome. The research showed that 44 of the children involved attended speech therapies. As for speech therapies, there was no significant difference between children with or without Down syndrome, which indicates that speech therapy is equally available to all categories of mental disorders. We also found out that articulation difficulties occur more often to children with sucking, chewing and swallowing problems. Our research could not determine that the development of sucking, chewing and swallowing varies according to the level of mental retardation. The results showed that there are statistically important differences in motor skills of the articulation apparatus with regard to mental retardation; by means of these outcomes we assume that more severe the mental retardation, the weaker the skills of the articulation apparatus. The thesis includes a comparison of anamnestic data obtained through the questionnaire for parents, the attributes observed during orofacial examinations, and articulation disorders among different groups of mental disorders...|$|R

40|$|Therapeutic heat can {{increase}} circulation, accelerate healing, control pain, and increase soft tissue extensibility. • Therapeutic heat benefits patients with healing tissues, pain, {{and those with}} restrictions in joint or <b>soft</b> tissue <b>mobility.</b> • Diathermy {{is the only way}} to heat large deep areas. • The ReBound technology, using sleeves containing inductive coils, provides the most evenly distributed deep heat. What is therapeutic heating? Therapeutic heating is the heating of a person or body part to achieve a therapeutic benefit. Therapeutic heating is also known as therapeutic warming and as thermotherapy. Therapeutic heating raises tissue temperature to above 104 ºF (38 ºC) but below 113 ºF (45 ºC) to safely optimize physiologic benefits. What are the physiological benefits of therapeutic heating? Therapeutic heating influences hemodynamic, metabolic and neuromuscular processes and increases the extensibility of soft tissues. Therapeutic heating causes vasodilation in the heated tissue, thus increasing the rate of blood flow to increase the delivery of oxygen and nutrient and the removal of waste products. Therapeutic heating causes vasodilation by stimulating thermoreceptors that directly cause vascular smooth muscle relaxation and indirectly activate local spinal cord reflexes. In addition, therapeutic heating promotes vasodilation by increasing the release of chemical mediators of inflammation and the release of nitrous oxide. (Kellog, 1999; Minson, 2001) In addition to the effects of heat on vasodilation therapeutic heating increases the rate of enzymatic biological reactions, which increases the rate of cellular biochemical reactions. Heat also increases the dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin in the blood increasing the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. These metabolic effects may both supplement the impact of vasodilation on accelerating tissue healing. Therapeutic heating increases nerve conduction velocity, which may contribute to the reduced pain perception that occurs in response to increasing tissue temperature. In P a g e |...|$|R

[1 - 3, 19 - 32] However, similar information is lacking for those with upper limb amputation. This team is once again taking a leading role by sharing a retrospective study focusing on the implant survival, adverse events, implant stability, and bone remodelling for 18 individuals with transhumeral amputation over a 5 -year post-operative period. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the safety of the procedure is accessible for the first time. In essence, the results showed an implant survival rate of 83 % and 80 % at 2 and 5 year follow ups, respectively. The most frequent adverse events were superficial skin infections that occurred for 28 % (5) participants while the least frequent was deep bone infection that happened only once. More importantly, 38 % of complications due to infections were effectively managed with nonoperative treatments (e. g., revision of skin penetration site, local cleaning, antibiotics, restriction of <b>soft</b> tissue <b>mobility).</b> Implant stability and bone remodelling were satisfactory. Clearly, this study provided better understanding of the safety of the OPRA surgical and rehabilitation procedure for individuals with upper limb amputation while establishing standards and benchmark data for future studies. However, strong evidences of the benefits are yet to be demonstrated. However, increase in health related quality of life and functional outcomes (e. g., range of movement) are likely.

40|$|The {{potential}} of substituting the physical transfer by using telecommunication was suggested {{already at the}} end of the 19 th century. Replacing the physical transfer with a telematics flow, moving the bits and not the atoms (Mitchell, 1995), can be considered a form of “sustainable mobility” that does not produce strong impacts on the urban physical system. The cybermobility can be therefore considered as a form of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility</b> which allows a virtual transfer in order to reach an urban activity for a specific service (administrative, training, business, tourist, information one etc.). Unfortunately the several studies on this subject do not confirm the replacing effect. This paper suggests the overturn of the thought by using an approach which chiefly considers the city activities (functions) and their power of acftracting the flows of mobility inside the urban system. In particular, it should be considered the possibility that those functions could undergo a process of “virtualization” thanks to the spreading of new technologies in the way through which citizens use the city. The possibility of working out procedures capable of quantifying the modifications produced and calculating the (real and/or potential) values of transformation on the territory offers new opportunities of governing also the “invisible” transformations generated by the spreading of net-society...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{growth of}} European cities in recent decades, mainly {{characterized}} by a decreasing density and a functional segregation, has tendentially increased mobility, soil consumption, urban sprawl, social disparities and infrastructural costs. Hence, most European countries have decided to aim for an urban sprawl limitation, in particular by increasing the density of built urban areas. To achieve this goal, new operations on unused urban areas are not sufficient, urban projects on existing neighbourhoods are also required. In a sustainability perspective, urban renewal goes beyond the issue of density. It has to integrate socio-cultural, economic and environmental aspects simultaneously. Based on a case study analysing the neighbourhood of "Fleurettes", in Lausanne, Switzerland, this paper shows how the diagnosis of the sustainability of an existing neighbourhood and a multi-criteria assessment of different scenarios, based {{on the use of}} the "SméO " methodology, can be an effective decision support tool for choosing an operational strategy. The results show that sustainability tends to increase with the level of intervention, especially in the field of energy consumption, but also by improving the quality of life, by promoting <b>soft</b> <b>mobility,</b> by offering green public spaces and by providing return on investments. Consequently, the research confirms the interest of the different protagonists (public administrations, private owners, investors, designers and users) to jointly explore possible synergies for the sustainable development of existing neighbourhoods...|$|E

40|$|A {{new family}} of {{crosslinked}} polyurethanes was synthesized and characterized as shape-memory polymers. Three-arm network junctions {{are provided by}} 1, 1, 1 -trimethylol propane with an isocyanate group on each arm. Three diisocyanates are used: 4, 4 ′-methylene bis(phenyl isocyanate), toluene diisocyanate, and 4, 4 ′-dibenzyl diisocyanate. They are linked together by macrodiol soft segments formed from either polytetrahydrofuran with molar mass of 650, 1000 or 2000 g mol- 1 or polycaprolactone glycol with molar mass of 830 or 1250 g mol- 1. Thermorheological response of each polymer was characterized by tensile creep tests through the glass transition of the soft segments, to obtain the linear viscoelastic retardation spectrum, limiting compliances and time-temperature shift factor. These were used to predict significant features of shape-memory performance. With a decrease in soft segment chain length, the temperature of maximum shape recovery rate increased and {{the width of the}} recovery window decreased, consistent with loss of <b>soft</b> segment chain <b>mobility</b> remote from the crosslinks. Tensile modulus in the switched condition (above Tg) was 8 - 16 MPa, increasing with crosslink density and hard-segment rigidity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{extent of}} {{softening}} during biomass pyrolysis is of high importance for fundamentals and reactors design {{but was not}} yet quantified in situ. We provide the first in situ rheology and H- 1 NMR analysis during the pyrolysis of biomass (Miscanthus), microgranular cellulose, ethanol organosolv lignin, and xylan. In situ rheology reveals the viscoelastic behavior of the materials. The softening, resolidification (char formation), swelling, and shrinking behaviors are quantified during pyrolysis in real-time. These phenomena are discussed. The H- 1 NMR analysis gives the mobility of protons developed during pyrolysis. A viscous and mobile material is formed during cellulose and xylan pyrolysis, even at a slow heating rate (5 K min(- 1)), by products at liquid phase under reaction temperatures. For lignin, a <b>soft</b> material and <b>mobility</b> are first formed by glass transition phase, then overlapped with covalent bond scission, leading to a completely mobile material. The comparison between H- 1 NMR and rheology results shows that mobile liquid-like products are trapped inside elastic solid-like cavities. Strong interactions between polymers in the native biomass network are evidenced. Cellulose tends to impose its visco-elastic behaviors to the polymers network during biomass pyrolysis. Rheological signatures are also of practical interest to design feeders and reactors for polymers biosourcing, biomass gasification, or combustion...|$|R

Spatial dispersal strategies in adults of this species, analyzed in the laboratory, revealed three patterns: 1) <b>mobility</b> on <b>soft</b> sediments; 2) <b>mobility</b> on hard substrata; and 3) the ability to lift from the bottom to the surface, to again sink down.

The hypothesis of metapopulation dynamics (source– sink) was analyzed. Two stations with high and constant numbers of individuals were grouped and tested as possible ‘sources’. The number of specimens in the remaining stations was highly variable, even with the complete disappearance and posterior highly dense re-occurrence of the mollusk, whereby these were tested as possible ‘sinks’.

The integration of user-centered design, social innovation, portable devices, and sensors may {{have a role in}} influencing people's choices and consumption patterns. The paper presents two ongoing works that investigate, design and develop tools for valuing people's positive behaviors and rewarding choices in the domain of mobility and energy. The objective of such tools is both to raise people's awareness and to engage it into a collaborative environment, in order to meet a common set of targets. The strategy adopted in both the cases is based on linking “bottom-up” with “top-down” approach, i. e. by making people to behave and to make choices coordinately with decision maker's (i. e. the Public Administration or the Administrator of the system) objectives. The first regards Opti-LOG, a project co-funded by Regione Lombardia under the Smart Cities and Communities program, which concerns last-mile delivery with low emission and zero emission vehicles. The second case regards Sharing Cities, a H 2020 project that includes a pilot project in the Municipality of Milano, where the focus is on citizen engagement and behaviors in the domains of personal mobility and energy. The system, by enabling mechanisms of collaboration, sharing and human capital generation, tackles the objectives of lowering energy consumption and promoting sustainable mobility and contributes to the weaving of a more cohesive social tissue...|$|E
40|$|By {{referring}} to the wider strategies set up, starting {{from the middle of}} the Nineties, by the European cities to promote a sustainable urban mobility and to the more recent concept of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility,</b> which generally includes pedestrian and cycling mobility, this contribution focuses on pedestrian mobility in urban areas, outlining criteria and methods for planning and designing networks of urban public open spaces, such as roads and squares, devoted to an exclusive or prevailing pedestrian use. First of all, the paper analyzes the multiple roles played by roads and squares within the cities: “axes” supporting different mobility flows, including the pedestrian ones, and in the meanwhile urban places in which different activities (commercial activities, meeting, and so on) take place. Grounding on that, the main reasons driving toward an organization of such spaces as urban networks have been outlined. Then, some guidelines and methodological elements, both for planning pedestrian networks and designing their elements taking into account the correspondence between foreseen uses and spatial features of each element, have been provided. Furthermore, the links between the pedestrian networks and the main junctions of other urban mobility networks, as well as between the first ones and the urban contexts have been stressed. Suggested guidelines and methodological elements have been applied and tested both on historical and suburban areas of the city of Naples; nevertheless they represent only a first step towards the setting up of a method for pedestrian networks planning and design in urban areas...|$|E
40|$|University of Molise, Italy Protected {{areas are}} {{becoming}} a new land connotation not only linked to the conservation of biodiversity {{and the protection of}} the environment but also to their ability to ensure sustainable local development, in compliance with various local identities of the surrounding territories. In this context, the development of slow mobility inside the protected areas can be an opportunity for progress and growth because it could be able to intercept the increasing requests for green tourism. Slow mobility, declined within protected areas, can contribute not only to safeguarding the environment and the health of populations, favouring one type of careful use, but also offers the opportunity of to recover old paths that can be restored as greenways to favour slow mobility, and historical artefacts found along their path to fruition by sustainable tourism. The case study presented in this paper is the protected area “Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica, Valle dell’Anapo e Torrente Cava Grande ” as an example of an area where there are various types of <b>soft</b> <b>mobility.</b> In particular, the sign of the path {{of one of the most}} important historical sites in the valley – the old railroad Syracuse–Vizzini – is analyzed. In light of the presence of multiple valuable elements, the Region of Sicily has developed an instrument known as a “landscape integrated route”, in order to draw up a “matrix of development ” of this area...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the {{development}} of a non-linear anisotropic model for the human periodontal ligament (PDL). A thorough knowledge of the behaviour of the PDL is vital in understanding the mechanics of orthodontic tooth <b>mobility,</b> <b>soft</b> tissue response and proposed treatment plans. There is considerable evidence that the deformation of the PDL is the key factor determining the orthodontic tooth movement. The paper focuses on the biomechanical aspect of the behaviour of the PDL. In terms of continuous mechanics, the PDL may be treated as an anisotropic poro-visco-hyperelastic fibre-reinforced compressible material which is subject to large deformations and has an essentially non-linear behaviour. Furthermore, there are issues related to the non-linear tooth and PDL geometry. A new constitutive model for the PDL is proposed. The macroscopic continuum approach is used. The model is based on the non-linear large deformation theory, involving the Lagrangian description. The material is assumed to be compressible, visco-hyperelastic and transversely isotropic. A free-energy function is suggested that incorporates the properties. It also takes into account that the PDL behaves differently in tension and compression. The free-energy function and the associated constitutive equations involve several material parameters, which are to be evaluated from experimental strain-stress data available from the literature and the tooth movement experiments conducted by our team using novel optical motion analysis techniques...|$|R
40|$|Craniofacial {{assessment}} for diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome has traditionally relied on imaging techniques {{that provide a}} static image of the facial structure. Objective measures of facial movement are however becoming increasingly important for clinical interventions where surgical repositioning of facial structures can influence <b>soft</b> tissue <b>mobility.</b> These applications include the management of patients with cleft lip, facial nerve palsy and orthognathic surgery. Although technological advances in medical imaging have now enabled three-dimensional (3 D) motion scanners to become commercially available their clinical application to date has been limited. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to determine normal and abnormal lip shapes during movement for use as a clinical outcome measure using such a scanner. Lip movements were captured from an average population using a 3 D motion scanner. Consideration was given to the type of facial movement captured (i. e. verbal or non-verbal) and also the method of feature extraction (i. e. manual or semi-automatic landmarking). Statistical models of appearance (Active Shape Models) were used to convert the video motion sequences into linear data and identify reproducible facial movements via pattern recognition. Average templates of lip movement were created based on the most reproducible lip movements using Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) incorporating Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally lip movement data from a patient group undergoing orthognathic surgery was incorporated into the model and Discriminant Analysis (DA) employed in an attempt to statistically distinguish abnormal lip movement. The results showed that manual landmarking was the preferred method of feature extraction. Verbal facial gestures (i. e. words) were significantly more reproducible/repeatable over time when compared to non-verbal gestures (i. e. facial expressions). It was possible to create average templates of lip movement from the control group, which acted as an outcome measure, and from which abnormalities in movement could be discriminated pre-surgery. These abnormalities were found to normalise post-surgery. The concepts of this study form the basis of analysing facial movement in the clinical context. The methods are transferrable to other patient groups. Specifically, patients undergoing orthognathic surgery have differences in lip shape/movement when compared to an average population. Correcting the position of the basal bones in this group of patients appears to normalise lip mobility...|$|R
40|$|Silk-inspired {{segmented}} polyurethanes containing flexible, hydrophilic segments with crystalline {{and liquid}} crystalline moieties {{were developed to}} mimic the hierarchical morphology of the continuous domain in and the superior mechanical properties of native spider silk. A series of polyurethane elastomers were designed with varying poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) -containing soft segment lengths and hard segment contents. The incorporation of a hydrophobic poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) block and longer soft segment lengths (1900 g/mol) induced {{a higher degree of}} micro-phase segregation compared to PEO (1000 g/mol) soft segment polyurethanes of similar hard segment content. Segmented polyurethanes with longer PEO soft segment lengths (4600 g/mol) exhibited a lamellar morphology, which was driven by the high level of crystallinity in both the hard and soft domains. As the hard segment content (26 - 47 wt%) was increased, the crystallinity of the hard domains was enhanced, yielding a shift in the morphology of the continuous domain from soft segment continuous to hard segment continuous or an interconnected microstructure. The mechanical behavior of these systems was affected by the continuous domain morphology. Hysteresis and initial moduli increased, and extensibility decreased as the hard segment size was varied from 26 to 47 wt% in the PEO-PPO-PEO-containing polyurethanes. The pure PEO (1000 g/mol) soft segment polyurethane exhibited enhanced extensibility, tensile strength, and toughness compared to the PEO-PPO-PEO segmented polyurethanes, which was attributed to the presence of load-bearing crystallites. (cont.) Shearing of the highly ordered and hydrogen-bonded hard domains resulted in orientation of the hard blocks at a preferential angle (± 70 ⁰) to the stretch direction during tensile deformation. Strong alignment and strain-induced birefringence of the soft segment chains was identified in the pure PEO 1000 soft segment polyurethane, which supported the observed mechanical behavior. An ordered mesophase was observed in the PEO-PPO-PEO soft segment polyurethane in which the soft block formed the continuous domain. The hard segments aligned ± 30 Ì to the elongation direction within the hard domain {{as a result of the}} hydrogen-bonded network structure. Dramatic reductions ([approx. ] 16 -fold decrease in toughness and [approx] 6 -fold decrease in extensibility) in mechanical properties were found in PEO-PPO-PEO soft segment polyurethane/Laponite nanocomposites. The <b>soft</b> segment <b>mobility</b> was restricted in these nanocomposites, diminishing the ability for strain-induced ordering and hindering slippage of the soft segment chains during deformation. Regions of exfoliated Laponite alternated with intercalated-and-flocculated clay regions. These findings were rationalized in terms of preferential attraction of the hydrophilic, PEO-based soft block to the hydrophilic Laponite discs, leading to the intercalated-and-flocculated structures. However, the Laponite particles also interact with the polar hard domains, which has been assigned to the observed exfoliation. Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) -PEO-PBLG copolymers were developed using custom-synthesized, diamine-terminated PEO 1000. (cont.) These copolymers exhibited both alpha-helix and beta-sheet conformations, depending on the PBLG block length. Only low molecular weight segmented polyurethanes were obtained using these liquid crystalline copolymers due to the possible low reactivity of the amine end-groups and cyclization within the PBLG block. by LaShanda Teresa James-Korley.
