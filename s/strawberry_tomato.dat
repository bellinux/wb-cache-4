40|$|Phytophthora cactorum (Lebert et Cohn) Schroeter is an {{important}} plant pathogen that can cause serious damage in agricultural and ornamental crops {{as well as in}} a wide range of forest species. The identification of this pathogen, based on morphological and physiological characters, is time consuming, labour-intensive and requires specialised staff to be correctly performed. Recently, PCR-based methods have partially resolved these problems, but the primers used cross react with Phytophthora idaei. To prevent any such reaction the use of a new pair of primers (PC 1 /PC 2) with improved specificity, derived from a specific Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) generated fragment, is proposed. The PC 1 /PC 2 primers, used in a simple PCR protocol, gave a single amplification product of approximately 450 bp; a good degree of specificity, with absence of cross reactions with Phytophthora pseudotsugae and R idaei; sensitivity down to 6 pg of R cactorum DNA extracted from pure mycelium; no reactions with the DNA of the host plants tested (downy oak, pear and walnut trees, potato, <b>strawberry,</b> <b>tomato</b> and pea plants). The detection of R cactorum in infected tissues of pear and walnut trees, potato, <b>strawberry,</b> <b>tomato</b> and pea plants was also confirmed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the trend for Penman-Monteith {{reference}} evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and irrigation water requirements (IWRs) of some horticultural species during {{the first decade of}} the 21 st century in Southern Romania. The species studied here were: <b>strawberry,</b> <b>tomato</b> and table grapes. These indices were calculated for three weather stations in various relief regions of southern Romania: Pitesti, Bucharest-Baneasa and Constanta. Monthly distribution of ETo for the three locations studied showed that for the first half of the year, the monthly values were higher for {{the first decade of the}} 21 st century versus the means of the 20 th century. In the first decade of century XXI versus century XX, ETc specifically increased in May, June and July, while in August the increase was negligible, and in September ETc decreased. Remarkable high ETc values were especially met for tomato. IWRs have not shown a clear pattern with regard to the trend in the first decade of the XX century versus century XX. IWRs increased in May versus century XX. The following months: July and August had practically the same IWRs values, whereas September was the month where irrigation application decreased by about 60 - 80 % versus last century. Because this study only refers to one decade from a new century, and this decade showed high dynamics in global warming versus century XX, these changes could also have either a cyclic or a long term character, and this finding should be confirmed by further studies...|$|E

The validation parameters used were precision and accuracy. Recovery of insect fragment was considered satisfactory in mango, tomato, guava pulps, and the average recovery ranged from 87 to 96 %. For strawberry pulp, the recovery rate ranged from 68 to 80 %. For rodent hairs, the best recovery rate was observed in mango pulp ranging from 73 to 81 %, followed by guava pulp ranging from 65 to 76 %, tomato pulp ranging from 50 to 67 %, and strawberry pulp ranging from 33 to 35 %.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} study evaluates the biofumigant effect of different organic materials {{with the aim}} of developing non-chemical alternatives for the management of Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White) Chitwood populations. Sources of organic material from the production system were selected {{with the aim of}} reducing agricultural residue accumulation problems as well as decreasing the costs due to the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The selected materials were residues from pepper, <b>strawberry,</b> <b>tomato</b> and cucumber crops, orange juice industry residues, commercial manure and sheep manure, applied at different dosages. Two biofumigation assays were performed under laboratory conditions, using alkaline soils from the Torreblanca area (Murcia, Spain) and acidic soils from the Villa del Prado area (Madrid, Spain). The assays evaluated the effect of the treatments on M. incognita juveniles and other soil organisms, the nematode galling index on tomato roots (susceptible cv. Marmande) grown in the biofumigated soil and soil fertility parameters. The results showed that all biofumigant materials significantly decreased M. incognita populations and galling indices in tomato cv. Marmande. A greater effect was observed on galling indices when applying crop residues together with manure than with the residues alone. Biofumigation had a general beneficial effect on soil fertility, generally increasing nitrogen, organic carbon, pH and potassium levels, and also calcium levels when crop residues of pepper and strawberry were applied. There were no important variations in the number of saprophagous nematodes, dorylaimids and enchytraeids.
