METHODS: The friction coefficients of two newly developed E-beam produced surface topographies were in vitro compared with sandblasted E-beam and titanium plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>controls.</b> Bone ingrowth (direct bone-implant contact) was determined by implanting the samples in the femoral condyles of 6 goats {{for a period of}} 6 weeks. RESULTS: Friction coefficients of the new structures were comparable to the titanium plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>control.</b> The direct bone-implant contact was 23. 9 and 24. 5 % for the new surface structures. Bone-implant contact of the sandblasted and titanium plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>control</b> was 18. 2 and 25. 5 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frictional and bone ingrowth properties of the E-beam produced surface structures are similar to the plasma-sprayed control. However, since the maximal bone ingrowth had not been reached for the E-beam structures during the relatively short-term period, longer-term follow-up studies are needed to assess whether the E-beam structures lead to a better long-term performance than surfaces currently in use, such as titanium plasma spray coating...|$|R

40|$|This reserch was to {{investigate}} the effects on salt <b>spray</b> <b>control</b> and wind protection for different structures, including net, wall and Venetian-blinds. Simulating the wind field of boundry layer and salt spray distribution with the wind tunnel, we analyzed the relationships between various windbreaks and control effects. The effects are estimated from PIS(50 %) for salinity and PI(50 %) for velocity. The results were concluded as follows: 1. The boundry layer of earth surface was simulated by the conditions of 8. 1 m/s wind velocity and the injecting sea water rate of 1 cm^ 3 /sec in wind tunnel. 2. It exists a quadratic relationship between the effect of the salt <b>spray</b> <b>control</b> and the density of windbreak net. 3. The logarithm of effect on windbreak is direct proportion to the effect of salt <b>spray</b> <b>control.</b> 4. In Venetian-blinds windbreak,the effect of salt <b>spray</b> <b>control</b> decreased with the increase of blade angle in the constant partition between two blades. 5. In general, the best wind protect is the net at the 70 % density and the salt effect is the Venetian-blinds at the angle 45,partition 1 cm. 本研究係於風洞內模擬大氣邊界層內流場及近地大氣中鹽分分佈情形，探 討各種密度之防風網、不同型式之百葉防風柵及防風牆等構造物的防風、 防鹽效果，並分析防風與防鹽兩者間相互關係，以祈未來在現地提供最佳 防風、防鹽構造物設計之參考。文中防風、防鹽效果分別採相對風速 50 % 、相對鹽分 50 %下所涵蓋之面積，作為評估之依據。試驗結果分述如下： 一、風洞試驗於 1 cm^ 3 /sec注入海水時，以風速 8. 1 m/s模擬現地風場及鹽 分分佈，其結果 最為接近。 二、防風網之密度與其防鹽效果，具有二次函數之關係。 三、防風構造物之防風效果的對數值與防鹽效果成正比。 四、葉片間距相同之百葉防風柵，其防鹽效果隨著葉片角度的增加而減小 。 五、防風效果以密度 70 %防風網最佳；防鹽效果以葉片間 距 1. 0 cm、葉片角度 45 °之百葉 防風柵最佳...|$|E

The study indicated that, over a long period of time, the secondary stage of the infestation has a greater impact and is of more concern than the direct annoyance and nuisance of the primary stage of the insect outbreak. The greatest direct change attributable to the tussock moth was the visual appearance in the landscape of dead and dying trees. Comments about new roads, logging, and changes in the game populations and habitat were more noticeable and mentioned more often than those of the Douglas-fir tussock moth.
