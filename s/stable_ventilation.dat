40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} is {{used for}} patients {{with a variety of}} lung diseases. Traditionally, ventilators have been designed to monotonously deliver equal sized breaths. While it may seem intuitive that lungs may benefit from unvarying and <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation</b> pressure strategy, recently {{it has been reported that}} variable lung ventilation is advantageous. In this study, we analyze the mean tidal volume in response to different `variable ventilation pressure' strategies. We found that uniformly distributed variability in pressure gives the best tidal volume as compared to that of normal, scale- free, log normal and linear distributions.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{existence}} of two <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation</b> solutions in a two-opening building was identified, questions have been asked whether multiple solutions of natural ventilation exist in complex buildings {{and what are the}} physical mechanisms that can lead to {{the existence of}} multiple solutions in complex buildings. We examined a simple one-zone building with four openings using the simple macroscopic method of thermofluid modelling by assuming that the air temperature in the building was uniform. A conventional network modelling computer program was used to simulate the four-opening building ventilated by combined buoyancy and wind forces. The ventilation flow rate in the simple four-opening building was found to be a linear superimposition of that in two corresponding two-opening buildings with opposing and assisting winds respectively. We have shown that when the ventilation flow in the two-opening building with opposing wind is sufficiently strong, two stable solutions and one unstable solution can exist in the corresponding four-opening building. There is a good agreement between the ventilation flow rates predicted by the network modelling method and our simple analytical solutions. The findings suggest the possible existence of multiple solutions in complex building configurations. © 2005 Sage Publications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to select a better air intake system for a new fire laboratory, designed for experiments with a maximum fire heat release rate of 7 MW. Two different air intake systems are considered: a louver system around the lower perimeter of the building or a chimney system that employs vertical ducts to bring fresh air down from the roof to {{the lower part of}} the building. The two systems are investigated with different fire sizes and wind speeds. The results show that the chimney system gives a more stable smoke and temperature stratification inside the building and a higher hot smoke layer above the floor. The louver system, on the other hand, gives rise to unsymmetrical air movements inside the building when the wind speed outside is high. The louver system also yields a lower hot smoke layer that can spill smoke through the louvers to the outside of the building, especially for small fires with low exhaust flow rates. The results, therefore, suggest that an evenly distributed chimney system would provide a more <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation</b> environment for conducting fire experiments and would prevent smoke leakage to the outside of the building.

40|$|Short {{sediment}} cores {{from the}} eastern Gotland Basin were investigated using a multi-proxy approach in order to reconstruct the environmental conditions of the area during the past 1000 years. Sediment data and facies were discussed in relation to hydrographic features (salinity, oxygen) and climate change. During the medieval warm period (MWP), from about 900 to 1250 AD, the hydrographic and environmental conditions {{were similar to those}} of the present time (modern warm period, since about 1850) : a temporally stable halocline, caused by regular saline water inflows from the North Sea, prevents vertical mixing and leads to bottom water anoxia and the deposition of laminated, organic-rich sapropels. During the period from about 1250 to 1850, referred to as the cold phase (including the Little Ice Age), the environmental conditions of the central Baltic Sea were distinctly different: the lower salinity, resulting from reduced North Sea water inflows, allowed vertical convection of the water column and long-term <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation</b> of the sea bed (oxic stage). Both the productivity of the planktonic ecosystem as well as the preservation of organic matter in the sediments improved during the warm periods. The anthropogenic impact can be identified within the recent laminated sequence by a temporal reconstruction of pollutant deposition. Our findings imply a climate-change driven shift in the environmental conditions and the ecosystem of the Baltic from the north to the south and back to the north...|$|E
40|$|We {{addressed}} {{the question of}} whether the assumption of unidirectional flow found in previous studies has led to the existence of two <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation</b> solutions in a two-opening building. The findings of multiple solutions in building ventilation raise {{the question of whether}} the macroscopic flow analysis and/or computational fluid dynamics simulations can provide sufficient accuracy to predict airflow patterns for guiding practical design of natural and hybrid ventilation. We extended previous analyses of a building with two unidirectional flow openings to one with two bi-directional flow openings. We considered natural ventilation driven by combined thermal buoyancy and opposing wind forces. A Newton-Rapson method was used to solve the non-linear governing equations for air-flows and a Runge-Kutta method was used for heat balance in the building. The airflow and heat balance calculations are fully coupled. We found that two stable solutions existed under a certain combination of identical natural driving forces and a certain combination of large openings with bi-directional flows. The existence of the two stable solutions diminished when the vertical distance between the two openings was equal to or less than the opening height. This observation reveals that the assumption of unidirectional flow has indeed led to the existence of two stable solutions under these conditions for the simple building considered. These results provide more evidence of the existence of multiple solutions for building ventilation in general building configurations and also suggest the need for careful examination of the underlying physical assumptions in the solution multiplicity analyses. © 2005 Sage Publications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Maintaining <b>stable</b> hemodynamics and <b>ventilation</b> parameters are important issues in neuroanesthesia.

40|$|The resting {{length of}} {{respiratory}} muscles must be altered during changes in posture {{in order to}} maintain <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Prior studies showed that although the vestibular system contributes to these adjustments in respiratory muscle activity, the medullary respiratory groups receive little vestibular input. Additionally, previous transneuronal tracing studies and physiological experiments demonstrated that propriospinal interneurons in the C 1 -C 2 spinal cord send projections to the diaphragm motor pool. The present study tested the hypothesis that C 1 -C 2 interneurons mediate vestibular influences on diaphragm activity. Recordings were made from 145 C 1 -C 2 neurons that could be antidromically activated from the C 5 -C 6 ventral horn, 60 of which had spontaneous activity, during stimulation of vestibular receptors using electric current pulses or whole-body rotations in vertical planes. The firing of 19 of 31 spontaneously active neurons was modulated by vertical vestibular stimulation; the response vector orientations of most of these cells were closer to the pitch plane than the roll plane, and their response gains remained relatively constant across stimulus frequencies. Virtually all spontaneously active neurons responded robustly to electrical vestibular stimulation, and their response latencies were typically shorter than those for diaphragm motoneurons. Nonetheless, respiratory muscle responses to vestibular stimulation were still present after inactivation of the C 1 -C 2 cord using large injections of either muscimol or ibotenic acid. These data suggest that C 1 -C 2 propriospinal interneurons contribute to producing posturally-related responses of respiratory muscles, although additional pathways are also involved in generating these responses...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mechanical {{ventilation}} (MV) of mice {{is increasingly}} required in experimental studies, but {{the conditions that}} allow <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation</b> of mice over several hours {{have not yet been}} fully defined. In addition, most previous studies documented vital parameters and lung mechanics only incompletely. The aim {{of the present study was}} to establish experimental conditions that keep these parameters within their physiological range over a period of 6 h. For this purpose, we also examined the effects of frequent short recruitment manoeuvres (RM) in healthy mice. METHODS: Mice were ventilated at low tidal volume V(T)  =  8 mL/kg or high tidal volume V(T)  =  16 mL/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 or 6 cm H(2) O. RM were performed every 5 min, 60 min or not at all. Lung mechanics were followed by the forced oscillation technique. Blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), heart frequency (HF), oxygen saturation and body temperature were monitored. Blood gases, neutrophil-recruitment, microvascular permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood serum as well as histopathology of the lung were examined. RESULTS: MV with repetitive RM every 5 min resulted in stable respiratory mechanics. Ventilation without RM worsened lung mechanics due to alveolar collapse, leading to impaired gas exchange. HF and BP were affected by anaesthesia, but not by ventilation. Microvascular permeability was highest in atelectatic lungs, whereas neutrophil-recruitment and structural changes were strongest in lungs ventilated with high tidal volume. The cytokines IL- 6 and KC, but neither TNF nor IP- 10, were elevated in the BAL and serum of all ventilated mice and were reduced by recurrent RM. Lung mechanics, oxygenation and pulmonary inflammation were improved by increased PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent RM maintain lung mechanics in their physiological range during low tidal volume ventilation of healthy mice by preventing atelectasis and reduce the development of pulmonary inflammation...|$|E

We developed a CO 2 rebreathing method for FRC measurement that simply requires data from a volumetric capnometer (partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO 2) and volume of CO 2 eliminated (VCO 2) for the measurement. This study was designed to assess the accuracy, precision and repeatability of the proposed FRC measurement system during <b>stable</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Methods: Accuracy and precision of measurements were assessed by comparing the CO 2 rebreathing FRC values to the gold standard, body plethysmography, in nine spontaneously breathing volunteers. Repeatability was assessed by comparing subsequent measurements in nine intensive care patients whose lungs were under mechanical ventilation. The accuracy and precision of the CO 2 FRC measurement during mechanical ventilation were then compared to the reference method, modified multiple breath nitrogen washout, in the same ICU patients. Results: Compared to body plethysmography, the accuracy (mean bias) of the CO 2 method was - 0. 085 L and precision (1 standard deviation) was 0. 033 L (- 2. 3 ± 9. 2 % of body plethysmography). The accuracy in the mechanically ventilated patients was - 0. 055 L and precision was 0. 336 L (- 2. 6 % ± 17. 5 % of nitrogen washout). The difference between repeated FRC measurements in the ICU patients was 0. 020 ± 0. 42 L (mean ± standard deviation) (1. 1 ± 23. 4 %). Conclusions: The CO 2 rebreathing method for FRC measurement provides acceptable accuracy and repeatability compared to existing methods during ventilation with mechanical ventilation.

The impact of the changing use of assisted ventilation in acute exacerbations on outcomes has not been fully elucidated and we aimed to describe these changes in the Danish population and describe their consequences for mortality. A register-based study was conducted of a cohort of 12, 847 patients admitted for acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) from 2004 through 2011, treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or NIV for the first time. Age, sex, in-hospital mortality rates, time to death or readmission for AECOPD were established and changes over time tracked. The number of admissions for AECOPD where assisted ventilation was used was 1, 130 in 2004 and had increased by 145 % in 2011. First time ventilations increased by 88 %. This was mainly due to an increase in use of NIV accounting for 36 % {{of the total number of}} assisted ventilations in 2004 and 67 % in 2011. The number of IMV with or without NIV treatments remained constant. The mean age of NIV patients increased from 71. 5 to 73. 6 years, but remained constant at 70. 0 years in IMV patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{data suggest}} that during {{mechanical}} ventilation the lateral-horizontal patient position (in which the endotracheal tube is horizontal) decreases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, compared to the recommended semi-recumbent position (in which the en-dotracheal tube slopes downward into the trachea). We tested the feasibility of the lateral-horizon-tal patient position, measured the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents, and watched for any adverse effects related to the lateral-horizontal position. METHODS: Ten adult intensive care unit patients were ventilated for 64 hours in the standard semi-recumbent position, and ten for 12 – 24 hours in the lateral-horizontal position. Tracheal secretions were collected every 8 hours and every 4 hours, respectively, and tested for pepsin, which is a marker of gastric contents. We also recorded clinical, physiologic, and outcome variables. RESULTS: The patients remained <b>stable</b> during <b>ventilation</b> in the lateral-horizontal position, and no adverse events occurred. Pepsin was detected in the trachea of 7 semi-recumbent patients and {{in five of the}} lateral-horizontal patients (P. 32). The number of ventilator-free days was 8 days (range 0 – 21 days) in the semi-recumbent patients, versus 24 days (range 12 – 25 days) in the lateral-horizontal patients (P. 04). CONCLU-SIONS: Implementing the lateral-horizontal position for 12 – 24 hours in adult intubated intensive care unit patients is feasible, and our patients had no adverse events.

Patients and methodsForty patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis due to acute exacerbation of COPD after failure of conventional medical treatment including oxygen therapy were recruited into the study. Patients were categorized into two groups, Group I ventilated with S/T mode and Group II ventilated with iVAPS mode. Patients were fitted with an oronasal mask (Ultramirage, ResMed) connected to VPAP ST(ResMed). ResultsBoth groups were comparable on admission. The successful outcome was achieved in 15 patients (75 %) in the PS group vs 16 patients (80 %) in the iVAPS group.

40|$|Over years,great strides {{have been}} made in {{theories}} and practices of mechanical ventilation. The indications of non-invasive ventilation have been increasing,while invasive ventilation has been playing a vital role in patients who are critically ill with inadequate drainage of sputum and fail to benefit from non-invasive ventilation. Chronic diseases,including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD),one of the most common chronic diseases,and bronchial asthma,the incidence of which is ascending recent years,are main causes for respiratory failure. Accordingly,we focus in the present paper on discussion and elaboration of respiratory failure as a result of COPD and bronchial asthma.

Severe acute bronchial asthma complicated with respiratory failure is an emergency. In this situation,primary goal of mechanical ventilation is to make an efficient oxygenation and ventilation of patients,and to avoid hyperinflation to the utmost.

This {{syndrome is}} characterized by a bone dysplasia with varied abnormalities: thoracic, pancreatic, cardiac, hepatic, renal and retinal. Patients’ age when the clinical condition is experienced correlates with the disease severity. These patients experience polychondrodystrophy with large, short, horizontal ribs and irregular costochondral junctions resulting in a rigid and reduced thoracic cage with varied respiratory injury level. Case ReportMale patient, 4 months-old, 7 kg, suffering with Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy, intubated and presented with reduced thoracic cage. Echocardiogram: mild pulmonary hypertension. Chest tomography: pulmonary hypoplasia. Patient submitted to bilateral thoracoplasty and thoracotomy with general anesthesia. Anesthesia maintenance: sufentanil e sevoflurane continuous infusion. Ventilation parameters: pressurecycled mechanical ventilation. Thorax opening provided improvement of the ventilation parameters, but after thoracic prosthesis placement, ventilation was limited. Reduction of the thoracic prosthesis was considered with consequent improvement of ventilation. ConclusionsDiagnosis of all present abnormalities is essential for the correct anesthetic management.

40|$|Background : Minimal access mediastinal surgery (MAMS) {{is usually}} {{performed}} under general anaesthesia with double lumen tubes (DLT). The {{aim of this}} study is to evaluate two lung ventilation through single lumen tubes (SLT) during thoracoscopic sympathectomy for hyperhidrosis and thoracoscopic thymectomy for myasthenia gravis. Methods : In this prospective non-randomized study, MAMS was performed in 58 patients with hyperhidrosis and 42 patients with myasthenia gravis, from January 2002 to December 2008. Patients were intubated with a DLT or SLT, 50 patients in each group. In the DLT group, endobronchial tubes were placed using the traditional blind approach and one lung ventilation was confirmed clinically. In the SLT group, the hemithorax was insufflated with CO 2 in conjunction with two-lung anaesthesia. All the patients were evaluated for haemodynamic stability, oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (Spo 2), end-tidal Pco 2 (ETPco 2), times required for intubation and surgery, satisfaction of surgeon with regard to exposure and postoperative complications. Results : In the SLT group, all the patients had <b>stable</b> haemodynamic and <b>ventilation</b> parameters. In the DLT group, haemodynamic instability occurred in two, decrease in Spo 2 in four and increase in ETPco 2 in three patients. One patient in the DLT group developed vocal cord granuloma two months later. Time required for surgery and the surgeon&#x 2032;s opinion with regard to exposure were similar for both groups. Conclusion : Thoracoscopic surgery when used in cases where a well-collapsed lung may not be essential, since surgery is not performed on the lung itself, does not require DLT. SLT is safe in MAMS. It provides good surgical exposure and decreases the cost, time and undesirable complications of DLT...|$|R
40|$|Background: While the {{decrease}} in blood carbon dioxide (CO 2) secondary to hyperventilation is generally accepted {{to play a major}} role in {{the decrease}} of cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO 2), it remains unclear if the associated systemic hemodynamic changes are also accountable. Methods: Twenty-six patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II) undergoing nonneurosurgical procedures were anesthetized with either propofol-remifentanil (n = 13) or sevoflurane (n = 13). During a <b>stable</b> intraoperative period, <b>ventilation</b> was adjusted stepwise from hypoventilation to hyperventilation to achieve a progressive change in end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2) from 55 to 25 mmHg. Minute ventilation, SctO 2, ETCO 2, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cardiac output (CO) were recorded. Results: Hyperventilation led to a SctO 2 decrease from 78 ± 4 % to 69 ± 5 % (D =- 9 ± 4 %, P < 0. 001) in the propofolremifentanil group and from 81 ± 5 % to 71 ± 7 % (D =- 10 ± 3 %, P < 0. 001) in the sevoflurane group. The decreases in SctO 2 were not statistically different between these two groups (P = 0. 5). SctO 2 correlated significantly with ETCO 2 in both groups (P < 0. 001). SctO 2 also correlated significantly with MAP (P < 0. 001) and CO (P < 0. 001) during propofol-remifentanil, but not sevoflurane (P = 0. 4 and 0. 5), anesthesia. Conclusion: The main mechanism responsible for the hyperventilation-induced decrease in SctO 2 is hypocapnia during both propofol-remifentanil and sevoflurane anesthesia. Hyperventilation-associated increase in MAP and decrease in CO during propofol-remifentanil, but not sevoflurane, anesthesia may also contribute to {{the decrease in}} SctO 2 but to a much smaller degree. © 2013 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

To prevent the lung from further injury use of lung protective ventilation including a recruitment maneuver (RM) and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration are parts of the treatment. Children differ from adults not only in size but also in physiology. Studies in pediatric size animals should precede clinical studies. Methods: 52 pediatric size piglets, weighing about 10 kg were surfactant depleted using a lung injury model with saline lavage. In the first two of four studies tidal elimination of CO 2 (VTCO 2) was evaluated as a marker of optimal recruitment and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was evaluated as a marker of incipient collapse during a RM and downward PEEP titration respectively. In all four studies the titrated PEEP was used during different follow-up-ventilation periods. Aeration, airway pressures including driving pressure (DP), Cdyn and oxygenation were recorded. Iterated CT scans were taken at every change of ventilation for measurement of aeration {{during the first two}} studies and during the follow-up-ventilation in three studies. The effect of a RM and PEEP titration for a prolonged (3 h) follow-up-ventilation was compared with a group with elevated PEEP (PEEP 10 -group) but without a foregoing RM. Ventilation after a RM was also compared with a control group ventilated with standard ventilation without a prior RM. In a final study continuous cardiac output (CO) was measured during the RM and PEEP titration for detailed information of central hemodynamics in eight piglets. Results: During the different follow-up-ventilation periods; 5, 15, 60 and 180 min, ventilation performed with the titrated PEEP resulted in improved aeration as assessed by repetitive CT scans, higher Cdyn, lower DP and better oxygenation compared with ventilation before the RM. VTCO 2 peaked or levelled off during the recruitment and corresponding CT scans showed a recruited lung. In addition minimally improved aeration was found when airway pressure was increased above the VTCO 2 peak/plateau. The first decline of Cdyn during PEEP titration corresponded to an increasing amount of lung collapse according to CT scans. CO and blood pressure decreased at the highest airway pressure during the RM. CO remained at a lower level but blood pressure recovered entirely. PEEP elevation in the PEEP 10 -group resulted in improved aeration, higher Cdyn and oxygenation and lower DP {{but not as much as}} in the RM-group. The control group did not improve in aeration, Cdyn or oxygenation but was <b>stable.</b> Conclusion: <b>Ventilation</b> after a RM and PEEP titration results in improved aeration, improved lung mechanics and lower airway pressures compared with baseline and compared with control groups ventilated without a foregoing lung recruitment. VTCO 2 peak/plateau indicates a recruited lung and Cdyn is a good indicator of increasing derecruitment during the PEEP titration. CO was persistingly and blood pressure temporarily decreased during the RM...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To theoretic ally {{assess the}} {{viability}} of an automatic procedure to support the anesthesiologist in properly setting mechanical ventilators when the operating conditions are switched from volume controlled to pressure controlled ventilation whilst maintaining the preset tidal volume. The procedure {{is based on a}} simple linear model of the ventilator breathing system with constant parameters and utilizes the signals gathered by the ventilator without the need to add further equipment. After a short period of <b>stable</b> volume controlled <b>ventilation</b> with the desired tidal volume, the herewith described algorithm allows the calculation of the value of pressure limit to set in pressure controlled mode which assures the previously settled tidal volume with the same breathing frequency and inspiratory-expiratory time ratio. Methods. The algorithm allows the online identification of the four parameters necessary for the mathematical model that are obtained by means of a direct comparison between the pressure, flow and volume waveforms generated by the model and the analog signals provided by the ventilator. The theoretical approach was validated by two different ventilators, various settings, two breathing circuits, endotracheal tubes of various sizes and two mechanical simulators of the respiratory system operating in various conditions. Results. Errors usually less than 5 % (p < 0. 05) on the target tidal volume were obtained for various settings typically used for adult ventilation in less than 10 s. The theoretical approach shows its limitations (errors of 10 ± 5 %, p < 0. 05) at high breathing frequencies (30 - 40 bpm) and low tidal volumes (200 - 300 ml). Conclusions. The proposed theoretical approach shows the viability, for adult settings, of one of the simplest mathematical model for mechanical ventilation in order to quickly and safely switch from volume controlled to pressure controlled ventilation. The algorithm could easily be in perspective implemented in the software of the ventilator providing the anesthesiologist with an indication on the value of pressure limit to set in order to safely switch ventilation mode. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{dairy cattle}} are {{selected}} for maximal milk production traits for {{over the last}} few decades. With a declining world market price for dairy products and a disappearance of annual production rights in 2015 maximization of production and increasing size of farms are an obvious trend that can be seen. The result of this up growth is that many dairy farms proceed to expansion, renovation or new construction of the dairy barn. The emphasis on genetic predisposition for maximum production has led to the growing and deepening of the modern dairy cows. Therefore, the feed intake and production increased. But the animals by the shifting of the thermoneutral zone also become more sensitive to higher temperatures. This because the animals produce more metabolic heat and this heat can be less well be disposed to the direct environment. These changes have implications for the demands of the modern housing for dairy cattle. One of the companies who are responding to this new demands is IDagro with the concept of the "Greenhouse Stable”. The light steel arch construction that is finished with transparent film and shade cloth is a spacious light <b>stable</b> concept. For <b>ventilation</b> this “Greenhouse stable” relies entirely on cross ventilation. Previous research has shown that for optimum production a threshold light intensity of 200 lx must be met. In addition, the day length is of major importance. In greenhouse barns on overcast days this threshold is not met. Besides light air is also of great importance. In this study there was a marked inhibition on the velocity of the air from outside to inside in the stable. The relative humidity and temperature showed only at the individual farm level abnormalities. The main conclusion is that the “Greenhouse Stabel” proved a useful concept in the winter of 2008. But that for definitive conclusions further research is needed into the ventilation pattern and the direct environment of the animals at high temperatures. This because under dutch climatic conditions there is a high risk for heat stress...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Baroreflex allows {{to reduce}} sudden rises or falls of {{arterial}} pressure through parallel RR interval fluctuations induced by autonomic nervous system. During spontaneous breathing, {{the application of}} positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may affect the autonomic nervous system, as suggested by changes in baroreflex efficiency and RR variability. During mechanical ventilation, some patients have stable cardiorespiratory phase difference and high-frequency amplitude of RR variability (HF-RR amplitude) over time and others do not. Our first hypothesis was that a steady pattern could be associated with reduced baroreflex sensitivity and HF-RR amplitude, reflecting a blunted autonomic nervous function. Our second hypothesis was that PEEP, widely used in critical care patients, could affect their autonomic function, promoting both steady pattern and reduced baroreflex sensitivity. Methods We tested the effect of increasing PEEP from 5 to 10 cm H 2 O on the breathing variability of arterial pressure and RR intervals, and on the baroreflex. Invasive arterial pressure, ECG and ventilatory flow were recorded in 23 mechanically ventilated patients during 15 minutes for both PEEP levels. HF amplitude of RR and systolic blood pressure (SBP) time series and HF phase differences between RR, SBP and ventilatory signals were continuously computed by complex demodulation. Cross-spectral {{analysis was used to}} assess the coherence and gain functions between RR and SBP, yielding baroreflex-sensitivity indices. Results At PEEP 10, the 12 patients with a stable pattern had lower baroreflex gain and HF-RR amplitude of variability than the 11 other patients. Increasing PEEP was generally associated with a decreased baroreflex gain and a greater stability of HF-RR amplitude and cardiorespiratory phase difference. Four patients who exhibited a variable pattern at PEEP 5 became stable at PEEP 10. At PEEP 10, a stable pattern was associated with higher organ failure score and catecholamine dosage. Conclusions During mechanical <b>ventilation,</b> <b>stable</b> HF-RR amplitude and cardiorespiratory phase difference over time reflect a blunted autonomic nervous function which might worsen as PEEP increases. </p...|$|R
