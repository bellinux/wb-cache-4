40|$|In {{spite of}} the high {{standard}} of the machines, the heat contact sealing technique for the sealing of pouches in packaging machines still offers possibilities for optimization, even when alternative sealing techniques are considered. Each <b>sealing</b> <b>jaw</b> has a typical temperature profile on its working surface which is determined by its construction, {{the position of the}} heating bars and temperature sensors, the number of heating bars as well as their heat conductivity. The profile changes qualitatively little when packaging materials of different production conditions. Quantitatively the length of the pouches affects the difference in temperature along the sealing zone. Tests showed temperature variations along the sealing area of 50 % and more. This is also seen in the strength distribution along the seams of the pouches which showed poor seal-strength and leakage at the critical locations. Variations because of controlling the actual sealing temperature and variations because of heat exch ange during machine motion have little effect on the seal quality. For length sealing tools a compromise has to be found between the length of the number of the regulated heating bars and temperature sensors...|$|E

40|$|Using ten <b>sealing</b> <b>jaws</b> with {{differently}} shaped surfaces, side-sealed {{bags and}} tubular bags with overlapped resp. fin seal seams were produced out of fourteen commercial packaging materials. The {{effect of the}} different jaw profiles on the heat sealed seams was determined by evaluating their strength and tightness. Laboratory tests were made as well as tests under practical production conditions on a vertical form-fill-seal-machine of the Transwrap 125 H type. The result was {{that the effect of}} such jaws in practical operation decisively depends on the type of the packaging material used, especially on the thickness of its heat-sealable layer and the heat conductivity of its components. In addition to this the pouch type also plays a decisive role as well as the question of priority of seam tightness or seam strength or if both properties are of equal importance for the evaluation of the seam quality in each individual case...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was the {{development}} of a process combination thermal spraying/nitriding. Two processes have been tested: 1. Nitriding of the substrate through hard coatings in order to obtain a supporting effect and to increase the nitriding depth. 2. Nitriding of the coating with or without effect on the substrate. The aim was to improve the abrasion, corrosion, torsion behaviour and the bonding of the coating. By means of process parameters adjustment (spraying, nitriding) it was possible to nitride the iron-base substrate through the ceramic coating. A supporting effect and a hardness gradient were yield. Moreover {{it has been shown that}} for some metal coatings by means of the development of corresponding technologies gas nitriding leads to an increase of the hardness and the abrasive wear resistance depending from the material. With the tubular <b>seal</b> <b>jaw</b> which is used for packaging it was possible to yield good results. A soft coating has been sprayed which was afterwards easy to machine and which obtained its good properties by means of the post-nitriding. (orig.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the effect of various weld and machine parameters on ultrasonic weld strength. Specifically, welds with six different triple-layer coextruded polyethylene and metallized polypropylene films were examined. These materials were welded in separate experimental studies using a bench top weld system and a high production volume packaging machine. The first study investigated the effect of a range of weld forces, energies, and amplitudes in a lap joint geometry using a bench top ultrasonic plunge welding system. Weld strength was determined by measuring resistance to tearing and peel and shear strength. It was observed that low energy and low weld force had a significant effect on shear strength welds for all materials. High peel strength was observed at relatively high weld forces and energies, and high tear resistance was observed at relatively high forces, high amplitudes, and mid-range energy levels. The second study determined the suitability for the same materials to be sealed as bags for packaging applications in a vertical 2 ̆ 2 form fill seal 2 ̆ 2 machine. This machine was equipped with an ultrasonic end <b>seal</b> <b>jaw.</b> The machine factors tested in this study include energy, amplitude, and production rate (the rate at which bags are created/welded) to determine the effect on peel strength. It was observed that low energy and amplitude correlated with high strength for the top weld (top of bag) of one material and low production rate resulted in high strength for the top weld of two materials as well as the bottom weld for two materials. Data for the sixth material was inconclusive...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{packaging}} is {{a growing}} successful market {{and the majority of}} flexible package applications are for the food industry. The demand for process optimization and reduced production costs, has led to an increase in flexible packaging. However, fast production lines can result in contamination in the seal area. For flexible food packaging, contamination is considered any food particle or substance trapped in the seal area. Current quality control processes can detect contamination in the seal area, but it is not determined if seal contamination affects seal quality. Oil-based and sodium based snack foods are two common categories that can be packaged on a horizontal form fill and seal (HFFS) flow-wrap machine. The study uses vegetable oil and a salt water solution to simulate the effect of liquid contamination along the T-point of flexible pouches made on an HFFS. The T-point refers to where the fin seal meets the end seal and requires the <b>seal</b> <b>jaw</b> to <b>seal</b> through four layers of film, which is the most difficult point to seal. The study tests a combination of different sealing temperatures and dwell time to determine the optimal sealing condition for a hermetic seal. A quality hermetic seal provides an enclosed seal with no leaks due to successful polymer chain entanglement between the two sealant layers. The different test categories of the study are non-contaminated (control), salt water solution for salt based foods, and vegetable oil for oil-based foods. Given the test parameters of the study, 140 ⁰C sealing temperature and 0. 3 seconds dwell time are considered to be the optimal sealing condition for all three test categories. For Phase 1 of the study, salt water had a lower Hermeticity pass rate compared to vegetable oil and non-contaminated seals. In addition, the effect of refrigerated storage temperature and ambient storage temperature did not show to be significant for any of the test categories. However, refrigerated conditions showed a higher Hermeticity pass rate, but it was not statistically different. The findings for seal strength indicated no test category had higher or lower seal strength over the 14 day test period. Overall, the study shows there is no effect of liquid contaminant on Hermeticity and seal strength for flexible film with LLDPE sealant layer...|$|R
50|$|After {{securing}} a third-place {{finish in the}} league and qualification for the Champions League {{for the first time in}} the post-Heysel era, the Reds enjoyed one of their finest months ever by completing a unique treble of the League Cup (won in late February), FA Cup and UEFA Cup. The FA Cup was <b>sealed</b> from the <b>jaws</b> of defeat when two late goals from Michael Owen overturned Arsenal's 1-0 lead in the final minutes of the game. The treble was completed four days when a thrilling match against Alavés of Spain gave them a 5-4 victory in the UEFA Cup final.|$|R
2500|$|Wakefield had {{purchased}} the land during a frantic week-long campaign the previous September, with payment {{made in the}} form of iron pots, soap, guns, ammunition, axes, fish hooks, clothing—including red nightcaps—slates, pencils, umbrellas, <b>sealing</b> wax and <b>jaw</b> harps. Signatures had been gained from local chiefs after an explanation, given by Wakefield and interpreted by Barrett, that the land would no longer be theirs once payment was made. However evidence later provided to the Spain Land Commission—set up by the Colonial Office to investigate New Zealand Company land claims—revealed three major flaws: that chiefs representing pā of Te Aro, Pipitea and Kumutoto, where the settlement of Thorndon was to be sited, were neither consulted nor paid; that Te Wharepouri, an aggressive and boastful young chief eager to prove his importance, had sold land he did not control; and that Barrett's explanation and interpretation of the terms of the sale was woefully inadequate. Barrett told the Spain Commission hearing in February 1843: [...] "I said that when they signed their names the gentlemen in England who had sent out the trade might know who were the chiefs." [...] Historian Angela Caughey also claimed it was extremely unlikely that Wakefield and Barrett could have visited all the villages at Whanganui-a-Tara in one day to explain the company's intentions and seek approval.|$|R
