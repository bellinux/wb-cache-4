50|$|Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, {{sold under}} the brandname Fansidar, is a {{combination}} medication used to treat malaria. It contains <b>sulfadoxine</b> (a sulfonamide) and pyrimethamine (an antiprotozoal). For the treatment of malaria it is typically used along with other antimalarial medication such as artesunate.|$|E
50|$|As {{the first}} line strategy, the troops were given {{synthetic}} drugs. Drug combinations using pyrimethamine and dapsone, pyrimethamine and <b>sulfadoxine,</b> and <b>sulfadoxine</b> and piperaquine phosphate were tested in the battlefield. But these drug had serious adverse effects. Therefore, the primary focus was to examine traditional Chinese medicines and look for new compounds. The first drug of interest was changshan, which was depicted in the earliest materia medica, the Canon of the Divine Husbandman’s Materia Medica. It is an extract from {{the roots of the}} plant Dichroa febrifuga. Among one of the earliest examined plants was huanghuahao (sweet wormwood, or scientifically, Artemisia annua). These two plants became a huge success in modern pharmacology.|$|E
50|$|Plasmodium have {{developed}} resistance against antifolate combination drugs, {{the most commonly}} used being <b>sulfadoxine</b> and pyrimethamine. Two gene mutations are thought to be responsible, allowing synergistic blockages of two enzymes involved in folate synthesis.

50|$|<b>Sulfadoxine</b> is a sulfonamide {{antibiotic}} that {{competes with}} p-aminobenzoic acid in the biosynthesis of folate. Pyrimethamine {{serves as a}} selective inhibitor of protozoal dihydrofolate reductase, hence preventing the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate — the active form of folate. A great degree of synergy occurs between the two drugs due to their inhibition of two different steps in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate.|$|E
50|$|Pyrimethamine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of uncomplicated malaria. It is particularly useful in cases of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains when combined with <b>sulfadoxine.</b> It acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase in the parasite thus preventing the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, thereby halting the processes of DNA replication, cell division and reproduction. It acts primarily on the schizonts during the erythrocytic phase, and nowadays is only used in concert with a sulfonamide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfadoxine</b> and {{sulfamethoxypyridazine}} {{are specific}} inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway of malaria parasites. They are structural analogs of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and compete with PABA to block its conversion to dihydrofolic acid. Sulfonamides {{act on the}} schizont stages of the erythrocytic (asexual) cycle. When administered alone sulfonamides are not efficacious in treating malaria but co-administration with the antifolate pyrimethamine, most commonly as fixed-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar), produces synergistic effects sufficient to cure sensitive strains of malaria.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{reported}} {{project with}} an MDA component which succeeded in permanently interrupting malaria transmission {{took place on}} the island of Aneityum, Vanuatu. Starting in September 1991, three malaria-control activities were employed [...] - [...] permethrin-impregnated bednets, larvivorous fish and the administration of three antimalarials. This MDA comprised 300 mg chloroquine base and 45 mg pyrimethamine weekly for nine weeks. An additional 300 mg chloroquine and 75 mg pyrimethamine plus 1500 mg <b>sulfadoxine</b> was added to this regimen in the first, fifth, and ninth week. Children received an adjusted equivalent of the adult dose. Follow-up consisted of yearly parasite surveillance. During the seven surveillance years following the MDA, no P.falciparum infections were detected.|$|E

Following the MDA, 1388 children ≤10 years of age living in nine control villages and in nine matched villages which had been allocated active treatment were kept under surveillance for clinical malaria throughout the transmission season. Initially, during July and August, the mean malaria incidence rate in treated villages was significantly lower than in the control villages. In subsequent months, the incidence was slightly higher in the MDA villages. The {{difference between the two}} groups was not statistically significant. Overall no benefit of the mass drug administration was detected over the course of the malaria transmission season.|$|E

[...] Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many patients will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets): Other drugs, such as Fansidar (<b>sulfadoxine</b> with pyrimethamine) or Malarone (proguanil with atovaquone), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of an}} {{academic}} extension activity, a group of year 11 students attempted to prepare the medication pyrimethamine (sold as Daraprim) in 2016. Pyrimethamine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system, for both adults and children. [...] It is used to treat toxoplasmosis, cystoisosporiasis, and malaria (in combination with <b>sulfadoxine).</b> [...] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.

[...] Partly {{in an effort to}} illustrate the absurdity of this price increase, a group of year 11 students from Grammar, supported by the University of Sydney and the Open Source Malaria consortium, have prepared pyrimethamine. [...] The students started with 17 g of (4-chlorophenyl)acetonitrile (which is available from Sigma-Aldrich for $36.50 per 100 g) and prepared 3.7 g of pyrimethamine, which is about US$110,000 at Turing's prices.|$|E

The committee was chaired by Myron M. Levine who has been funded and is currently funded by the BMGF. The committee concluded [...] "… that an intervention with results of this magnitude is worthy of further investment as part of a public health strategy to decrease morbidity from malaria infections in infants." [...] The WHO technical expert group responded to the IOM report [...] "WHO is committed to review the available information each year." [...] Dr. Kochi was ultimately replaced by {{one of the members of}} the IPTi consortium, Dr. Robert Newman. In March 2010, i.e. after Dr. Kochi had been replaced, the WHO recommended the co-administration of the antimalarial drug <b>sulfadoxine</b> pyrimethamine with routine childhood vaccinations (DTP2, DTP3 and measles immunization) in sub-Saharan Africa. The recommendation applies only for areas with high malaria transmission and low resistance against SP, both measures are not free of controversy and only available for few spots in Africa. With the recent drop of malaria transmission in wide stretches of Africa and a steady increase in SP resistance few malaria control programs will hurry to implement this intervention.|$|E
50|$|MDA is {{included}} in the malaria-control policy of the People’s Republic of China. Following the first malaria-control phase from 1955 to 1962, which was mostly focused on malaria surveys, mass administrations were added to vector control measures and improved case management in 10 of China’s 33 provinces. The drugs used in the administrations, mostly chloroquine and piperaquine, were provided free of charge by the central government. The economic reforms instituted by Deng Xiaoping, which ultimately {{put an end to the}} provision of free health care through the central government and the emergence of resistance against the most widely used antimalarials modified the use of mass drug administrations after 1980. MDAs are now targeted at high-risk populations, specifically non-immune migratory workers who receive repeated courses during the high transmission season. According to government guidelines, piperaquine, chloroquine, or <b>sulfadoxine</b> combined with primaquine can be used for mass administrations. The artemisinin derivatives are not used in mass drug administrations and are reserved for treatment failures. Malaria burden and control measures are shown in Table 1. Between 1990 and 2000 the malaria prevalence dropped from 10.6 to 1.9 / 100,000, the number of reported malaria cases dropped from 117,359 to 24,088 while the number of reported deaths attributable to malaria remained stable. These data, reported to the national government, depend on reporting from health care providers and like all data depending on passive surveillance tend to underestimate the true disease burden. However, there is no reason to think that the level of underreporting has changed over the last decade. Therefore, the proportional reduction in malaria disease burden is likely to be true. Malaria-control measures, including MDA, as well as major ecologic changes during the second half of the last century are likely to have been responsible for the more than 100-fold reduction in malaria burden in China since the initial surveys in 1955. The widespread use of antimalarials has been followed by the emergence of drug resistance especially in regions with high drug use. By 1995 more than 95% of P.falciparum strains isolated in the South of Yunnan province were found to be resistant to chloroquine, and piperaquine while in the remainder of Yunnan and Hainan province the resistance rates were 85%and 38% respectively.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sulfadoxine</b> is {{predominantly}} used {{in combination with}} pyrimethamine, commonly known as Fansidar, {{for the treatment of}} Plasmodium falciparum. This combination is usually less effective against Plasmodium vivax, probably due to the innate refractoriness of parasites to the <b>sulfadoxine</b> component. To investigate this mechanism of resistance by P. vivax to <b>sulfadoxine,</b> we cloned and sequenced the P. vivax dhps (pvdhps) gene. The protein sequence was determined, and three-dimensional homology models of dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) from P. vivax as well as P. falciparum were created. The docking of <b>sulfadoxine</b> to the two DHPS models allowed us to compare contact residues in the putative sulfadoxine-binding site in both species. The predicted sulfadoxine-binding sites between the species differ by one residue, V 585 in P. vivax, equivalent to A 613 in P. falciparum. V 585 in P. vivax is predicted by energy minimization to cause a reduction in binding of <b>sulfadoxine</b> to DHPS in P. vivax compared to P. falciparum. Sequencing dhps genes from a limited set of geographically different P. vivax isolates revealed that V 585 was present in all of the samples, suggesting that V 585 may be responsible for innate resistance of P. vivax to <b>sulfadoxine.</b> Additionally, amino acid mutations were observed in some P. vivax isolates in positions known to cause resistance in P. falciparum, suggesting that, as in P. falciparum, these mutations are responsible for acquired increases in resistance of P. vivax to <b>sulfadoxine...</b>|$|E

The effect of age on the AUC of <b>sulfadoxine</b> and pyrimethamine reflected higher clearance rates and larger apparent volumes of distribution in children aged 2 to 5 years when compared with adults (median clearance, 64. 5 mL x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) [IQR, 46. 2 - 132. 6 mL x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) ] versus 32. 7 mL x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) [IQR, 22. 3 - 52. 2 mL x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) ] for <b>sulfadoxine</b> [P =. 0001] and 1. 77 L x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) [IQR, 1. 0 - 3. 0 L x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) ] versus 0. 85 L x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) [IQR, 0. 62 - 1. 21 L x kg(- 1) x d(- 1) ] for pyrimethamine [P =. 0001]; median volume of distribution, 413 mL/kg [IQR, 299 - 711 mL/kg] versus 372 mL/kg [IQR, 267 - 488 mL/kg] for <b>sulfadoxine</b> [P =. 0021] and 6. 28 L/kg [IQR, 3. 83 - 11. 24 L/kg] versus 3. 83 L/kg [IQR, 2. 73 - 5. 11 L/kg] for pyrimethamine [P =. 0001]). Day 7 concentrations of both <b>sulfadoxine</b> and pyrimethamine provided good surrogate measures (R(2) >or= 0. 72) of their respective AUCs. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic factors may contribute to the increased risk of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine antimalarial treatment failure in young children. The current dose recommendations need revision. We predict that children aged 2 to 5 years should be treated with 1 g sulfadoxine/ 50 mg pyrimethamine to achieve drug concentrations equivalent to those in adults...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three {{recently}} isolated Thai {{strains of}} Plasmodium falciparum {{were tested in}} vitro for their response to pyrimethamine, <b>sulfadoxine,</b> and both compounds in combination. One isolate, FCK, was moderately tolerant to pyrimethamine whereas FCM 3 and FCM 5 were not affected by this compound at serum level, being 100 times less responsive than a sensitive strain from the Gambia when tested similarly. This low degree of response is evidently due to drug resistance. Sensitivity to <b>sulfadoxine</b> was low in the Thai isolates, but was also lower than expected in the Gambian strain. Possible causes of the poor response are discussed. Pyrimethamine in combination with <b>sulfadoxine</b> showed a synergistic effect; the effective doses were reduced by ten and three times, respectively. FansidarÂ ® (Roche) is an antimalarial which consists of 25 mg pyrimethamine and 500 mg sul fadoxine per tablet. It functions as a blood schiz ontocide as well as causal prophylactic agent. The combination of its two components results in a long-acting antimalarial, and the dose required i...|$|E
40|$|Dihydrofolate reductase was {{partially}} purified from a pyrimethamine-sensitive Plasmodium chabaudi clone and a pyrimethamine-resistant clone derived {{from it and}} used {{in a study of}} the inhibitory effect of pyrimethamine and <b>sulfadoxine,</b> both alone and in combination. Kinetic analysis of the inhibitory effect of <b>sulfadoxine</b> against the enzyme from pyrimethamine-sensitive and -resistant parasites revealed that the drug inhibited the former enzyme competitively, with an inhibition constant (Kis) of 0. 7 +/- 0. 4 mM, but inhibited the latter enzyme noncompetitively, with Kis and Kii of 8. 9 +/- 1. 2 and 4. 1 +/- 1. 2 mM, respectively. Previous studies also showed competitive inhibition by pyrimethamine on the former enzyme and noncompetitive inhibition on the latter enzyme, with some 200 -fold-lower affinity. <b>Sulfadoxine</b> and pyrimethamine exhibited a mutually potentiating effect on the enzyme activity, as revealed by the concave isoboles and the fractional inhibitions of less than unity. A potentiating effect was observed for the enzymes from both sources and was not dependent on the degree of the purification of the enzyme. Our results can be explained by assuming simultaneous binding of two inhibitors on the enzyme...|$|E
