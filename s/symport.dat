2500|$|Yeast {{transport}} {{amino acids}} and small peptides (less than 5 amino acid residues) {{into the cell}} via an active transport process that utilizes specialized membrane proteins and {{the difference in the}} pH gradient of the acidic wine solution (pH between 3-4) and the near neutral pH of cytoplasm inside the yeast cells. The proton <b>symport</b> proteins in the membrane take in the amino acid coupled with a hydrogen ion that later gets expelled by the cell via a hydrogen ion pump. This is an energy dependent process that becomes more energetically unfavorable for the yeast cell as fermentation progressed and ethanol levels increase, creating [...] "passive leakage" [...] of excess hydrogen ions into the cell. The cell's hydrogen ion pumps have to work even harder to maintain its internal pH so it sends a signal to the <b>symport</b> proteins to stop bringing other ions.

[...] The production and removal of lactate from the cell also ejects a proton consumed in the LDH reaction- the removal of excess protons produced in the wake of this fermentation reaction serves to act as a buffer system for muscle acidosis.

There, it may join with another bicarbonate (...) that dissociated from its [...] in the lumen of the urinary space only after exiting the proximal convoluted kidney cells/glomerulus as carbonic acid (H2CO3) because bicarbonate (...) itself can not diffuse across the cell membrane in its polar state. This will replenish carbonic acid (H2CO3) so that it then may be reabsorbed into the cell as itself or CO2 and H2O (produced via a luminal carbonic anhydrase). As a result of this whole process, there is a greater net balance of [...] in the urinary lumen than bicarbonate (...) , and so this space is more acidic than physiologic pH.

(Neural and hormonal mechanisms that regulate normal mucosal ion transport are not discussed.) The manner in which Vibrio cholerae, several pathotypes of Escherichia coli, several Salmonella serotypes, rotavirus, Campylobacter species, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia species and Clostridium difficile perturb these mechanisms and cause diarrhea, is discussed. Throughout the article, the main emphasis is on experimental studies designed to elucidate biological mechanisms and (where relevant) the microbial determinants responsible for diarrheal disease. Allusions are also made to the involvement of host responses such as the inflammatory response, the production and release of potent cytokines and accelerated homeostatic responses (such as increased rates of crypt cell division seen in some infections), and the role that they play in pathophysiological fluid secretion...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that relative movement between respiratory epithelium and surrounding fluid modulates both ciliary activity and mucosal secretion-absorption properties was tested. Fresh human (HM) and bovine sinusal mucosae (BM) were mounted in transparent chambers perfused with defined media at 36 degrees C. The fluid advanced along the ciliated surface at 15 - 30 microns/s. Transepithelial transport of electrolytes was studied by using voltage-clamp technique. Ciliary beating frequency (CBF) was recorded by using laser reflectometry. Average transmucosal potential difference (apical side negative) and short-circuit current (Isc) were - 0. 5 mV and 17 microA. cm- 2 for HM and - 1. 4 mV and 28 microA. cm- 2 for BM. Average CBF was 900 beats/min. Ionic pathways included basolateral Na,K-ATPase, K+ channels and <b>symports</b> for Na-Cl and Na-glucose, and apical channels for Na+ (absorption) and for Cl- and K+ (secretion). Increase of fluid velocity up to 300 microns/s induced significant increase of both Isc (63 %) and CBF (29 %). Such adaptations of transepithelial fluid transport and ciliary activity to hydrodynamic conditions might reflect a mechanism of coordination between the secretion of mucus electrolytes and mucociliary clearance...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{studied the}} effect of {{temperature}} on the carbo-hydrate status of parenchyma cells during winter {{in relation to the}} efflux and influx of sugars between parenchyma cells and xylem vessels in 1 -year-old twigs of walnut (Juglans regia L.). The mechanism of sugar transfer between contact cells and vessels was also investigated. We obtained new insights into the possible osmotic role of sugars, particularly sucrose, in stem pressure formation and winter embolism repair. Accumu-lation of sucrose in the xylem sap during winter was mainly in-fluenced by: (1) abundant conversion of starch to sucrose in the symplast at low temperatures; (2) sucrose efflux into the apoplast at low temperatures (1 °C); and (3) inefficient sugar uptake at low temperatures, although efficient sugar uptake oc-curred at 15 °C. We hypothesize that a diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) -sensitive protein mediates facilitated diffusion of su-crose from parenchyma cells to xylem vessels (efflux) in wal-nut.

40|$|Silicate uptake by Nitzschia alba {{cells is}} higher in medium {{containing}} Na+ than in media lacking Na+ but containing K+, Rb+, NH 4 +, Li+, or choline+. The initial rate is inhibited by monensin and gramicidin but not by valinomycin or nigericin and is less sensitive to inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In isolated membrane vesicles, silicate is taken up when a Na+ gradient is imposed across the membrane or is generated by cytoplasmic Na+,K+-ATPase. H+ or K+ gradients in either direction do not stimulate uptake. Na+-gradient-dependent uptake is inhibited by monensin but not by CCCP, valinomycin, or vanadate, which inhibits the cytoplasmic Na+,K+-ATPase. Uptake increases if an internally negative potential is imposed across the membrane. The vesicular uptake shows saturation kinetics with a Km of 62 μM and a Vmax of 4. 1 nmol/mg of protein per min. In intact cells, the initial rate of silicate uptake increases with pH up to 9. 5.

A unique K+ ATPase in GCAM generates three gradients across this barrier. A greater than 180 mV electrical gradient (lumen positive) drives amino acid uptake through voltage-dependent K+ <b>symports.</b> A greater than 1000 -fold [H+] gradient (lumen alkaline) and a greater than 10 -fold [K+] gradient (lumen concentrated) are adaptations to the high tannin and high K+ content, respectively, in dietary plant material.

Insect sensory epithelia and mammalian stria vascularis maintain similar PD and K+ gradients but would not be exposed to ingested anti-apical membrane insecticides.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Active efflux from procaryotic {{as well as}} {{eucaryotic}} cells strongly modulates {{the activity}} {{of a large number}} of antibiotics. Effective antibiotic transport has now been observed for many classes of drug efflux pumps. Thus, within the group of primary active transporters, predominant in eucaryotes, six families belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, and including the P-glycoprotein in the MDR (Multi Drug Resistance) group and the MRP (Multidrug Resistance Protein), have been recognized as being responsible for antibiotic efflux. Within the class of secondary active transporters (antiports, <b>symports,</b> and uniports), ten families of antibiotic efflux pumps have been described, distributed in five superfamilies [SMR (Small Multidrug Resistance), MET (Multidrug Endosomal Transporter), MAR (Multi Antimicrobial Resistance), RND (Resistance Nodulation Division), and MFS (Major Facilitator Superfamily) ]. Nowadays antibiotic efflux pumps are believed to contribute significantly to acquired bacterial resistance because of the very broad variety of substrates they recognize, their expression in important pathogens, and their cooperation with other mechanisms of resistance. Their presence also explains high-level intrinsic resistances found in specific organisms. Stable mutations in regulatory genes can produce phenotypes of irreversible multidrug resistance. In eucaryotes, antibiotic efflux pumps modulate the accumulation of antimicrobials in phagocytic cells and play major roles in their transepithelial transport.

40|$|Debaryomyces hansenii is a yeast {{species that}} {{is known for its}} halotolerance. This {{organism}} has seldom been mentioned as a pentose consumer. In the present work, a strain of this species was investigated with respect to the utilization of pentoses and hexoses in mixtures and as single carbon sources. Growth parameters were calculated for batch aerobic cultures containing pentoses, hexoses, and mixtures of both types of sugars. Growth on pentoses was slower than growth on hexoses, but the values obtained for biomass yields were very similar with the two types of sugars. Furthermore, when mixtures of two sugars were used, a preference for one carbon source did not inhibit consumption of the other. Glucose and xylose were transported by cells grown on glucose via a specific low-affinity facilitated diffusion system. Cells derepressed by growth on xylose had two distinct high-affinity transport systems for glucose and xylose. The sensitivity of labeled glucose and xylose transport to dissipation of the transmembrane proton gradient by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone allowed us to consider these transport systems as proton <b>symports,</b> although the cells displayed sugar-associated proton uptake exclusively in the presence of NaCl or KCl.

An inwards directed sodium gradient had no (stimulatory) effect on proton motive force-driven L-glutamate uptake. The transporter is specific for L-glutamate and L-aspartate. L-Glutamate transport is inhibited by beta-hydroxyaspartate and cysteic acid but not by alpha-methyl-glutamate. The gene encoding the L-glutamate transport protein of B. subtilis (gltP(Bsu)) was cloned by complementation of Escherichia coli JC 5412 for growth on glutamate as the sole source of carbon, energy, and nitrogen, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Putative promoter, terminator, and ribosome binding site sequences were found in the flanking regions. UUG is most likely the start codon, gltP(Bsu) encodes a polypeptide of 414 amino acid residues and is homologous to several proteins that transport glutamate and/or structurally related compounds such as aspartate, fumarate, malate, and succinate.
