5|$|<b>Samson</b> {{has been}} the subject of both rabbinic and Christian commentary, with some Christians viewing him as a type of Jesus, based on {{similarities}} between their lives. Notable depictions of <b>Samson</b> include John Milton's closet drama <b>Samson</b> Agonistes and Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 Hollywood film <b>Samson</b> and Delilah. <b>Samson</b> also plays a major role in Western art and traditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, George Frideric Handel {{wrote the}} opera <b>Samson,</b> with a {{libretto}} by Newburgh Hamilton, based on <b>Samson</b> Agonistes. The opera {{is almost entirely}} set inside Samson's prison and Delilah only briefly appears in Act II. In 1877, Camille Saint-Saëns composed the opera <b>Samson</b> and Delilah with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of <b>Samson</b> and Delilah is retold. In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive femme fatale, but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samson</b> then {{traveled}} to Ashkelon (a distance of roughly 30 miles) where he slew thirty Philistines for their garments; he then returned and gave those garments to his thirty groomsmen. In a rage, <b>Samson</b> {{returned to his}} father's house. The family of his would-have-been bride instead gave her {{to one of the}} groomsmen as wife. Some time later, <b>Samson</b> returned to Timnah to visit his wife, unaware that she was now married to one of his former groomsmen. But her father refused to allow <b>Samson</b> to see her, offering to give <b>Samson</b> a younger sister instead.|$|E
5|$|According to tradition, {{the mosque}} {{stands on the}} site of the Philistine temple {{dedicated}} to Dagon—the god of fertility—which <b>Samson</b> toppled in the Book of Judges. Later, a temple dedicated to Marnas—god of rain and grain—was erected. Local legend today claims that <b>Samson</b> is buried under the present mosque.|$|E
5|$|After the stage, three cyclists were punished: Aucouturier and <b>Samson</b> {{received}} fines of 500 and 250 francs, Aucouturier {{for having}} a cyclist not in the race following him, <b>Samson</b> for riding in the slipstream of a car. Chevallier, who had finished third, was disqualified for resting in a car for 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered <b>Samson</b> into their hands. They summon <b>Samson</b> so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. <b>Samson</b> is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samson</b> {{has been}} {{especially}} honored in Russian artwork because the Russians defeated the Swedes in the Battle of Poltava on the feast day of St. Sampson, whose name is homophonous with Samson's. The lion slain by <b>Samson</b> was interpreted to represent Sweden, {{as a result of}} the lion's placement on the Swedish coat of arms. In 1735, C. B. Rastrelli's bronze statue of <b>Samson</b> slaying the lion was placed in the center of the great cascade of the fountain at Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samson</b> was {{betrayed by}} his lover Delilah, who ordered a servant {{to cut his}} hair while he was {{sleeping}} and turned him over to his Philistine enemies, who gouged out his eyes and forced him to grind grain in a mill at Gaza. When the Philistines took <b>Samson</b> into their temple of Dagon, <b>Samson</b> asked to rest {{against one of the}} support pillars; after being granted permission, he prayed to God and miraculously recovered his strength, allowing him to grasp hold of the columns and tear them down, killing himself and all the Philistines with him. In some Jewish traditions, <b>Samson</b> {{is believed to have been}} buried in Tel Tzora in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley.|$|E
5|$|<b>Samson</b> went out, {{gathered}} 300 foxes, {{and tied}} {{them together in}} pairs by their tails. He then attached a burning torch to each pair of foxes' tails and turned them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learned why <b>Samson</b> burned their crops and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of <b>Samson</b> et Dalila the operas have been sparsely represented on disc. A recording of Henry VIII was issued on CD and DVD in 1992. Hélène was released on CD in 2008. There are several recordings of <b>Samson</b> et Dalilah, under conductors including Sir Colin Davis, Georges Prêtre, Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung.|$|E

5|$|<b>Samson,</b> {{in earlier}} drafts also called Edgar Leiber or Edgar Leonhardt, is the dwarf {{co-manager}} of the Carnivàle. His original biography gave his {{background as a}} dwarf strongman who started his career in 1904. Eight years later, he started working on traveling carnivals, including the Hyde&Teller Company. Samson's wit elevated him from performer to general manager until another character, Management, purchased the carnival (to be renamed Carnivàle) and briefly gave Samson's job to Lodz, a blind mentalist. The beginning of the series shows <b>Samson</b> delegating Management's orders to the carnies. <b>Samson</b> temporarily loses his position to Lodz {{for a second time}} {{near the end of the}} first season but retains Management's trust. The death of Management in season 2 leads to Samson's secret deal with Ben to make the boy the new commander of the carnival.|$|E

5|$|Although Carnivàle {{is set in}} the mid-1930s, Ben and Brother Justin have {{visions and}} dreams {{suggesting}} the story began much earlier. <b>Samson</b> summarizes the backstory in a monologue at the beginning of season 2, without mentioning names. The Pitch Document, which served as the source for the character biographies on the HBO website, provides context for all clues.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes towards suicide slowly {{began to}} shift during the Renaissance.

5|$|In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a {{more solid}} operatic success, with <b>Samson</b> et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep {{a place in the}} {{international}} repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892.|$|E

5|$|In the 5th century, {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Roman legions, Saint Illtud came to the Hodnant valley from Brittany and founded the monastery of Illtud on the Ogney Brook, and a college, close to the current St Illtyd's Church, about a mile from the sea. The exact date of its founding is unknown, but some sources indicate around the year 500; the blue plaque on the church today also gives this date. Because of its monastery and teaching centre it became a major centre for education and Celtic Church evangelism, attracting scholars from across Wales, Devon, Cornwall and Brittany and the wider world. The college of Llantwit, known as the College or Seminary of Theodosius (Cor Tewdws in Welsh) or College of St. Illtyd, at its peak reputedly had seven halls, over 400 houses and over 2000 students, including seven sons of British princes, and scholars such as St. Patrick, St. Paul Aurelian, the bard Taliesin, Gildas the historian, <b>Samson</b> of Dol, Paulinus, Bishop of Leon; St. David is believed to have spent some time there. <b>Samson</b> was known to have been summoned by Dyfrig to join the monastery in 521 and he was briefly elected abbot before leaving for Cornwall.

5|$|Lucius Belyakov is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a Russian soldier. He is also {{revealed}} to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, {{he is also the}} carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through <b>Samson.</b> He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to have a conversation with Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he will know the identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter.
