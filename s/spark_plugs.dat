5|$|The most {{important}} iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes {{for the production of}} chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, {{mostly because of}} electronics-related {{applications}} that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium crucibles are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cycle-resolved {{measurements}} of the fuel concentration near a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> in both a commercial spark-ignition piston engine and a commercial rotary engine were performed. An in situ laser infrared (IR) absorption method was developed using a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and a 3. 392 -μm He–Ne laser as the light source. This wavelength coincided with the absorption line of hydrocarbons. The newly developed IR <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor had a higher signal-to-noise ratio than its previous version due to the optimization of its quartz lens and two optical fibers. The new sensor provided quantitative cycle-resolved fuel concentration measurements around the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> with a high temporal resolution. At lean preset air/fuel (A/F) ratios, fuel was mixed with the surrounding air gradually near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> Strong mixture inhomogeneities were measured during the compression stroke; the magnitude of these inhomogeneities decreased throughout the compression stroke. There was {{a strong correlation between}} the fuel concentration measured with the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and the combustion characteristics during the initial combustion period, which occurred faster when conditions were slightly richer than stoichiometric near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> The indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) was slightly related to the A/F ratio near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> It was possible to measure the cycle-resolved A/F ratio near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> and investigate its cycle-to-cycle fluctuations t...|$|R

5|$|The largest use of {{palladium}} {{today is}} in catalytic converters.

Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E

Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E

His final version was completed in 1912 and his patent issued on June 20.|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} the spark plu electrode gap distance on power, torque, and fuel consumption (sfc) of Honda GX- 160 engine at 3600 rpm rotation with load variations. The aim of this study to determine the maximum performance of the distance to the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> loose power and torque with fuel gas. Testing is done by using a brake dynamometer in a laboratory type of energy conversion engineering faculty at the Bengkulu University. Variations <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode gap distance of 0. 5 mm was started, 0. 6 mm, 0. 7 mm, 0. 8 um; 0. 9 mm, and 1 mm. The results showed the highest torque value indicated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode gap of 0. 8 mm round 10. 58 N-m at 1600 rpm for given load and the lowest torque value indicated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode gap of 1 mm is equal to 7. 27 N-m at 1600 rpm. The highest power shown by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode gap of 0. 8 mm by 2. 63 hp at the given load round 1900 rpm, and the lowest value seen in the variation of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode gap of 1 mm is equal to 1. 78 hp. The best value of specific fuel consumption (sfc) is generated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode distance of 0. 7 mm for 0. 304 l/hp-h, and the least in the sequence is generated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode distance of 1 mm for 0. 345 l/hp-h. In this case due to the characteristics of the fuel will be good if the value of fuel consumption (sfc) of the fuel is getting low.

The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E

25|$|Traditional <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> {{need to be}} {{indented}} {{into the}} walls of the combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|E
