25|$|Co-ownership co-ops are {{generally}} older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one voting {{share in the}} corporation that owns the building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their <b>share</b> <b>certificate.</b> Most {{of these types of}} co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by private sale or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with home equity who could buy the unit outright, as it was difficult to get a mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario credit unions are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units affordable housing options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.|$|E
2500|$|US equities, {{corporate}} and municipal bonds can be issued in certificated form, though this practice {{has been largely}} replaced due to the costs and inefficiencies of keeping them. Rather holdings are kept as [...] "immobilized" [...] or [...] "street name", with the beneficial owners keeping them in accounts at broker-dealers and banks, {{just as they do}} for currencies. DTCC uses a nominee firm, Cede & Co., in whose name a <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> is held in the DTCC vaults. Each day DTCC reconciles with the relevant transfer agent the number of shares held in its accounts for its member banks and broker-dealers. In turn, other banks and broker-dealers hold accounts with DTCC member firms, creating a chain of ownership down to the beneficial owner.|$|E

50|$|Margit Osterloh published, {{together}} with Bruno S. Frey, a much-noticed {{article in the}} Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In analogy to the cooperative model, they propose that refugees acquire a <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> {{of the state in}} order to enter the country. In return they get permission to work in the labor market. If a refugee is recognized as a political asylum seeker, the fee paid for the <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> will be reimbursed. The currently inhumane and life-threatening defense against refugees and the exploitation by criminal traffickers is thereby reduced. Refugees receive a calculable perspective and incentives for integration. The proposal offers advantages for the countries of destination and origin, as well as for migrants.|$|E
50|$|In {{corporate}} law, a {{stock certificate}} (also known as certificate of stock or <b>share</b> <b>certificate)</b> {{is a legal}} document that certifies ownership of a specific number of shares or stock in a corporation. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to dividends, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect {{the transfer of the}} shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations, and to facilitate and streamline trading on a stock exchange. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> as proof of entitlement and the certificate is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue of paper stock certificates may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a holding statement in lieu of a <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> for each parcel of shares owned.|$|E
