40|$|We {{partition}} {{the fast}} <b>escaping</b> <b>set</b> of a transcendental entire function into two subsets, the maximally fast <b>escaping</b> <b>set</b> and the non-maximally fast <b>escaping</b> <b>set.</b> These sets are {{shown to have}} strong dynamical properties. We show that {{the intersection of the}} Julia set with the non-maximally fast <b>escaping</b> <b>set</b> is never empty. The proof uses a new covering result for annuli, which is of wider interest. It was shown by Rippon and Stallard that the fast <b>escaping</b> <b>set</b> has no bounded components. In contrast, by studying a function considered by Hardy, we give an example of a transcendental entire function for which the maximally and non-maximally fast <b>escaping</b> <b>sets</b> each have uncountably many singleton components...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the fast <b>escaping</b> <b>set</b> $A(f) $ of a {{transcendental}} entire function $f$ has a structure known as a spider's web whenever the maximum modulus of $f$ grows below a certain rate.

40|$|For a {{transcendental}} {{entire function}} f of finite {{order in the}} Eremenko-Lyubich class B, we give conditions under which the Lebesgue measure of the <b>escaping</b> <b>set</b> I(f) of f is zero. This is inspired by the recent work of Aspenberg and Bergweiler, in which they give conditions on entire functions {{in the same class}} with <b>escaping</b> <b>sets</b> of positive Lebesgue measure. We will construct an entire function in the Eremenko-Lyubich class to show that the condition given by Aspenberg and Bergweiler is essentially sharp. Furthermore, we adapt our idea of proof to the case of infinite order entire functions.
