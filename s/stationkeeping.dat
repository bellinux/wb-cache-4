5|$|The first {{turnover}} of Squadron One cutters occurred on 16 May with {{the transfer of}} Point League and Point Garnet to the South Vietnamese Navy under the Vietnamization plan. An elaborate ceremony {{was held at the}} RVN Base in Saigon with dignitaries from many area naval activities witnessing the {{turnover of}} the two cutters. On 5 June, Division 11 was disestablished and its cutters were transferred to Division 13. The need for Squadron One cutters had been supplanted by the shallower draft PCFs and PBRs that were being concentrated in the Delta region for use in Operation Sealords. With better foul weather <b>stationkeeping</b> abilities than the U.S. Navy craft, the Point-class cutters of the Squadron were shifted for use during the northeast monsoon season in the northern half of the country.|$|E
25|$|For {{maneuvering}} at ports {{as well as}} <b>stationkeeping</b> capability in Sea State 5 and {{currents of}} up to 3 knots in open water, she will also be fitted with two 1,900kW bow thrusters.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February 2016 three GLONASS {{satellites}} {{experienced a}} technical failure: the batteries of GLONASS-738 exploded, the batteries of GLONASS-737 were depleted, and GLONASS-736 experienced a <b>stationkeeping</b> failure due to human error during maneuvering. GLONASS-737 and GLONASS-736 {{are expected to}} be operational again after maintenance, and one new satellite (GLONASS-751) to replace GLONASS-738 is expected to complete commissioning in early March. The full capacity of the satellite group is expected to be restored in the middle of March.|$|E
25|$|All current {{spacecraft}} use chemical rockets (bipropellant or solid-fuel) for launch, {{though some}} (such as the Pegasus rocket and SpaceShipOne) have used air-breathing engines {{on their first}} stage. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south <b>stationkeeping</b> and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen tetroxide {{is used as}} an {{oxidizer}} in one of {{the more}} important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature. In early 1944 research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by German scientists, although the Nazis only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for S-Stoff (fuming nitric acid). It became the storable oxidizer of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. It is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel. One of the earliest uses of this combination was on the Titan family of rockets used originally as ICBMs and then as launch vehicles for many spacecraft. Used on the U.S. Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and also on the Space Shuttle, it continues to be used as <b>stationkeeping</b> propellant on most geo-stationary satellites, and many deep-space probes.|$|E
500|$|Two Zeiss [...] {{rangefinders}} were fitted on the conning {{towers and}} there was also a [...] Barr & Stroud instrument, possibly for precise <b>stationkeeping</b> on the master ship when concentrating fire. Two Krylov stadimeters were situated in the lower level of the forward conning tower. These would provide data for the central artillery post to calculate with its imported Pollen Argo Mark V Clock, a mechanical fire-control computer, and then transmit the gun commands via the Geisler transmission system for the gun crew to follow. During the winter of 1915–16 the Zeiss rangefinders were transferred to armored hoods on the rear of the fore and aft turrets and, at some point, [...] Barr & Stroud rangefinders were added to the roofs of the middle turrets. [...] received a [...] Pollen rangefinder in the spring of 1916.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity is {{produced}} by four 9-cylinder Wärtsilä 9L20 4-stroke medium-speed diesel generating sets with a combined output of [...] The generators provide power for all shipboard consumers, including two 2,700kW Z-drive thrusters with 3.1-metre (...) four-bladed propellers and a 500kW bow thruster. The diesel-electric azimuth thrusters, manufactured by Rolls-Royce, give the vessel excellent maneuverability at low speeds, <b>stationkeeping</b> and dynamic positioning capability, and a towing capacity of [...]|$|E
2500|$|As {{advanced}} Model 376 spacecraft, the MEASAT-1 and -2 satellites {{have three}} enhancements over the standard model. They {{were the first}} in the 376 series to be fitted with gallium arsenide solar cells, which deliver 40 percent more payload power as compared to their silicon predecessors. They were also the first Model 376s to use lightweight, high-gain shaped antenna. The satellites also used a more efficient bipropellant system for <b>stationkeeping</b> and attitude control maneuvers.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most modern}} icebreakers, Kronprins Haakon has a {{diesel-electric}} propulsion system. Her power plant {{consists of two}} 5,000kW and two 3,500kW main engines which produce power for two 5.5MW azimuth thrusters and two 1.1MW bow thrusters. The propulsion system also gives her Dynamic Positioning (DP) Class 1 <b>stationkeeping</b> capability. In open water, she has a maximum cruising range of [...] and endurance of 65 days at cruising speed. The bollard pull of the vessel is 158 tonnes.|$|E
2500|$|Artificial {{satellites}} must {{be launched}} into orbit and once there {{they must be}} placed in their nominal orbit. Once in the desired orbit, they often need some form of attitude control {{so that they are}} correctly pointed with respect to Earth, the Sun, and possibly some astronomical object of interest. They are also subject to drag from the thin atmosphere, [...] so that to stay in orbit {{for a long period of}} time some form of propulsion is occasionally necessary to make small corrections (orbital <b>stationkeeping).</b> Many satellites need to be moved from one orbit to another from time to time, and this also requires propulsion. A satellite's useful life is usually over once it has exhausted its ability to adjust its orbit.|$|E
2500|$|In all species, the fins are spineless {{and fairly}} small; in Dolichopteryx however, the {{pectoral}} fins are greatly elongated and wing-like, extending {{about half the}} body's length, and are apparently used for <b>stationkeeping</b> in the water column. The pectoral fins are inserted low on the body, and in some species, the pelvic fins are inserted ventrolaterally rather than strictly ventrally. Several species also possess either a ventral or dorsal adipose fin, and the caudal fin is forked to emarginated. The anal fin is either present or greatly reduced, {{and may not be}} externally visible; it is strongly retrorse in Opisthoproctus. A single dorsal fin originates slightly before or directly over the anal fin. A perceptible hump in the back begins just behind the head. The gas bladder is absent in most species, and the lateral line is uninterrupted. The branchiostegal rays (bony rays supporting the gill membranes behind the lower jaw) number two to four. The javelin spookfish (Bathylychnops exilis) is by far the largest species at [...] standard length; most other species are under [...]|$|E
5000|$|Both L1 and L2 require active <b>stationkeeping</b> since {{neither is}} fully stable (they are saddle {{points on the}} energy landscape). Colonies at the [...] and [...] {{positions}} would {{have the advantage of}} being stable without any need for <b>stationkeeping,</b> and {{could be used as a}} waypoint for travel to and from cislunar space.|$|E
5000|$|PLTs are {{studied for}} {{maneuvering}} spacecraft in near earth orbit, propellantless operation, thrust and power beaming for [...] "perpetual" [...] <b>stationkeeping,</b> and ultra-precision spacecraft formation flying, {{with or without}} tethers.|$|E
50|$|For {{maneuvering}} at ports {{as well as}} <b>stationkeeping</b> capability in Sea State 5 and {{currents of}} up to 3 knots in open water, she will also be fitted with two 1,900kW bow thrusters.|$|E
50|$|Docking of Soyuz TMA-07M to the Space Station {{occurred}} at 14:09 UTC {{while the two}} were flying over northern Kazakhstan. Docking was three minutes early due to the spacecraft <b>stationkeeping</b> for less time than had been planned.|$|E
50|$|After {{a series}} or orbital {{maneuvers}} and <b>stationkeeping</b> at different hold points, the CRS-9 Dragon {{was captured by}} the ISS's Canadarm2 on 20 July 2016 at 10:56 UTC. After robotic operations, it was berthed some three hours later at 14:03 UTC.|$|E
50|$|For {{spacecraft}} in a {{halo orbit}} around a Lagrangian point <b>stationkeeping</b> {{is even more}} fundamental as such an orbit is unstable; without an active control with thruster burns the smallest deviation in position/velocity {{would result in the}} spacecraft leaving the orbit completely.|$|E
50|$|Delta-v is also {{required}} to keep satellites in orbit and is expended in propulsive orbital <b>stationkeeping</b> maneuvers. Since the propellant load on most satellites cannot be replenished, the amount of propellant initially loaded on a satellite may well determine its useful lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Lead styphnate {{is mainly}} used in small arm {{ammunition}} for military and commercial applications. It {{serves as a}} primary explosive with gunpowder, which will not ignite upon a simple impact. Lead styphnate is also used as primer in microthrusters for small satellite <b>stationkeeping.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gemini 12 was {{designed}} to perform rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle, to conduct three extra-vehicular activity (EVA) operations, to conduct a tethered <b>stationkeeping</b> exercise, to perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, and demonstrate an automatic reentry.|$|E
50|$|Telstar 18 was {{launched}} in June 2004 by Sea Launch. The upper stage of the rocket underperformed, but the satellite used its significant <b>stationkeeping</b> fuel margin to achieve its operational geostationary orbit. It has enough on-board fuel remaining {{to allow it to}} exceed its specified 13-year design life.|$|E
50|$|Propulsion systems {{based on}} electrodeless plasma {{thrusters}} seem ideally suited for orbit raising for large geostationary satellites, and {{would also be}} able to perform orbital <b>stationkeeping,</b> hence enabling important propellant mass savings. The ability of this technology to provide large thrust density also allows faster missions to the outer planets.|$|E
5000|$|With the Flyaround completed, a {{short period}} of <b>Stationkeeping</b> was {{initiated}} at a range of 190 meters. The opportunity gave the flight controllers a chance to check the Soyuz systems and the alignment with the docking port. The crew was given a [...] "GO" [...] and the final approach commenced at 4:40 GMT.|$|E
5000|$|Hall {{thrusters}} {{have been}} flying in space since December 1971 when the Soviets launched an SPT-50 on a Meteor satellite. [...] Over 240 thrusters have flown in space {{since that time}} with a 100% success rate. Hall thrusters are now routinely flown on commercial GEO communications satellites where they are used for orbital insertion and <b>stationkeeping.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{the sails}} were only used in {{conjunction}} with the engines, the fact that the Thistle had returned to sail as a means of propulsion distinguishes her from a number of other Royal Navy warships which resumed the use of staysails to improve their seakeeping and <b>stationkeeping</b> ability (a practice which was not fully abandoned until HMS Reclaim paid off in 1979).|$|E
50|$|Devastated by solar winds, {{artificial}} satellites {{return to}} Earth {{in the form}} of shooting stars. Some of their pieces make it to the ground and start some fires. These satellites have been spiralling to Earth for the last 30 years but now, with the batteries dead and any <b>stationkeeping</b> fuel expended, atmospheric drag causes them to plummet to the ground.|$|E
50|$|On 29 June 2004, {{during the}} launch of Apstar 5, the upper stage shut down 54 seconds early due to a wiring fault, leaving the {{satellite}} in a lower than planned orbit. The spacecraft raised itself to the correct orbit by means of its onboard manoeuvring engines, {{at the expense of}} fuel intended for <b>stationkeeping</b> once in the correct orbit.|$|E
5000|$|HRL began {{research}} on ion propulsion in 1960. [...] This research {{led to the}} Hughes developed xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS. XIPS {{was used as the}} primary propulsion system on NASA's Deep Space 1 (launched in 1998). It is a standard option for primary <b>stationkeeping</b> on the Hughes/Boeing 601HP (first use: PAS-5, 1997) and the 702 (first use: Galaxy-XI, 1999) geostationary satellite families.|$|E
50|$|Built by Boeing, USA-195 {{is based}} on the BSS-702 {{satellite}} bus. It had a mass at launch of 5987 kg, and was expected to operate for fourteen years. The spacecraft is equipped with two solar arrays to generate power for its communications payload, which consists of cross-band X and Ka band transponders. Propulsion is provided by an R-4D-15 apogee motor, with four XIPS-25 ion engines for <b>stationkeeping.</b>|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the Battle of Tunisia, the Twelfth Air Force units {{had moved}} east and the Allied use of the {{airfield}} was reduced to a skeleton <b>stationkeeping</b> unit, being used as an emergency landing field for Air Transport Command units flying between Tunis and Algiers. It was abandoned by the American forces after {{the end of the}} European War during the summer of 1945.|$|E
50|$|Its {{propulsion}} system {{was composed of}} an R-4D-11-300 LAE with a thrust of 490 N. It also used had 12 22 N bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. For North-South <b>stationkeeping,</b> its primary method was an electric {{propulsion system}} with four XIPS 13, with four of the chemical thrusters acting as backup. It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 15 years of operation.|$|E
50|$|USA-233 can {{transmit}} data with approximately 3.6 {{gigabits per second}} bandwidth. It can point 19 individual beams at different points on the Earth, operating at x band and ka band frequencies. Built by Boeing around the BSS-702 bus, the 5987 kg satellite is expected to operate for 14 years. Propulsion is provided by an R-4D apogee motor, and four XIPS-25 ion thrusters for <b>stationkeeping.</b>|$|E
50|$|Built by Boeing, WGS-2 {{is based}} on the BSS-702 {{satellite}} bus. It had a mass at launch of 5987 kg, and was expected to operate for at least fourteen years. The spacecraft is equipped with two solar arrays to generate power for its communications payload, which consists of cross-band X and Ka band transponders. Propulsion is provided by an R-4D-15 apogee motor, with four XIPS-25 ion engines for <b>stationkeeping.</b>|$|E
50|$|On {{the second}} day of the mission, they again {{approached}} the ATDA, this time from above. Once they were <b>stationkeeping</b> alongside, they were given permission for their EVA, but they were tired and Stafford did not want to waste fuel keeping himself near the ATDA during the EVA when there was little they could do with it. It was decided to postpone the EVA until the third day.|$|E
50|$|Because {{spacecraft}} only {{contain a}} finite amount {{of fuel and}} there is little chance to refill them, some alternative reaction control systems have been developed so that fuel can be conserved. For <b>stationkeeping,</b> some spacecraft (particularly those in geosynchronous orbit) use high-specific-impulse engines such as arcjets, ion thrusters, or Hall effect thrusters. To control orientation, a few spacecraft, including the ISS, use momentum wheels which spin to control rotational rates on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|After {{several more}} burns, the two {{spacecraft}} were only 130 feet (40 meters) apart. The burns had only used 112 lbs. (51 kilograms) of fuel on Gemini 6A, giving plenty of fuel for some fly-arounds. During the next 270 minutes, the crews moved {{as close as}} one foot (30 centimeters), talking over the radio. At one stage the spacecraft were <b>stationkeeping</b> so well that neither crew had to make any burns for 20 minutes.|$|E
