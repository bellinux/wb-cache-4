The <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive fog.

5|$|As a {{circular}} highway, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> at the mile0 marker {{placed in front}} of the Mackinac Island State Park Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these signs are erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard state highway reassurance markers along this roadway. M-185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-154 on Harsens Island. No part of M-185 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year.|$|E

5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in {{particular}} with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E
5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, it is the case that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E

25|$|Systematic {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} interval sampling) relies on arranging {{the study population}} according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list.

25|$|The {{direct ascent}} of Sgairneach Mhòr {{is not a}} {{difficult}} walk as the <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> at {{the summit of the}} Drumochter Pass on the A9 road and has a starting altitude of 462 metres. The walk crosses the railway and ascends Coire Dhomhain on a good track on the north bank of the Allt Coire Dhomhain. After approximately two km the track is left and the burn is crossed (no bridge) to its southern bank. It is then a walk south through pathless heather to reach the eastern ridge which is followed to the summit. If the burn is in spate then an alternative is to walk higher up into Coire Dhomhain and then ascend by the steeper northern ridge.|$|E
25|$|As Prof. Okishio himself acknowledged, his {{argument}} {{is based on}} a comparative static analysis. His <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> an equilibrium growth path of an economy with a given technique. In a given branch of industry, a technical improvement is introduced (in a way similar to what Marx described) and then the new equilibrium growth path is established under the assumption that the new technique is generally adopted by the capitalists of that branch. The result is that even under Marx's assumptions about technical progress, the new equilibrium growth path goes along with a higher rate of profit. However, if one drops the assumption that a capitalist economy moves from one equilibrium to another, this result no longer holds. There is no real evidence that capitalist development spontaneously tends to equilibrium, since there are continuously market fluctuations, mismatches of supply and demand, and periodic economic crises. In addition perfect competition does not exist, and corporations may actively try to block competitors in their markets (e.g. European Union Microsoft competition case).|$|E
