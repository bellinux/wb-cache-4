2500|$|The term on {{the barber}} pole is pilot jargon {{that refers to}} flying an {{aircraft}} at the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>velocity.</b> The airspeed Indicator on aircraft capable of flying at altitude features a red/white striped needle resembling a barber pole. This needle displays the VMO (Maximum Operating Velocity) or—at altitude—the MMO (Mach Limit Maximum Operating Speed) of the aircraft. This needle also indicates the maximum operating Mach number above the VMO/MMO changeover level. As the aircraft increases in altitude and the air decreases in density and temperature, {{the speed of sound}} also decreases. Close to the speed of sound, an aircraft becomes susceptible to buffeting caused by shock waves produced by flying at transonic speeds. Thus, as the speed of sound decreases, so the maximum safe operating speed of the aircraft is reduced. The [...] "barber pole" [...] needle moves to indicate this speed. Flying [...] "on the barber pole" [...] therefore means to be flying the aircraft as fast as is safe {{to do so in the}} current conditions.|$|E

40|$|The AVHS {{architecture}} of the California PATH program or-ganizes traffic into platoons of closely spaced vehicles. Pla-toons are formed and broken up by two longitudinal control maneuvers, merge and split. A third longitudinal maneu-ver, decelerate to change lanes, allows a platoon switching from one lane to another to enter its new lane at a safe spacing and speed. This paper presents a robust control strategy for these maneuvers. Safety is assured by forcing the velocity of the trail platoon to remain under a maximum <b>safe</b> <b>velocity</b> boundary. When safety is not threatened, the vehicles ’ jerk and acceleration remain within comfort limits. Because no timed nominal trajectories are used, completion of the maneuvers {{does not depend on}} vehicles meeting pre-scribed acceleration capabilities. 1...|$|E

This {{is not to say}} that they are entirely <b>safe,</b> as <b>velocities</b> are around 500 feet per second (160 meters per second). This exceeds the velocities of paintballs, and serious damage could be done to sensitive areas, so suitable precautions should be taken when using them.|$|R
40|$|Enabling robots {{to safely}} {{interact}} with humans {{is an essential}} goal of robotics research. The developments achieved over recent years in mechanical design and control {{made it possible to}} have active cooperation between humans and robots in rather complex situations. For this, safe robot behavior even under worst-case situations is crucial and forms also a basis for higher-level decisional aspects. For quantifying what safe behavior really means, the definition of injury, as well as understanding its general dynamics, are essential. This insight can then be applied to design and control robots such that injury due to robot–human impacts is explicitly taken into account. In this paper we approach the problem from a medical injury analysis point of view in order to formulate the relation between robot mass, velocity, impact geometry and resulting injury qualified in medical terms. We transform these insights into processable representations and propose a motion supervisor that utilizes injury knowledge for generating safe robot motions. The algorithm takes into account the reflected inertia, velocity, and geometry at possible impact locations. The proposed framework forms a basis for generating truly <b>safe</b> <b>velocity</b> bounds that explicitly consider the dynamic properties of the manipulator and human injury...|$|E
40|$|Ensuring {{safety is}} a primary goal in {{physical}} human-robot interaction. In various collision experiments {{it was found that}} the robot's effective mass, velocity, and geometry are the key parameters which influence the human injury severity during an impact. Recently, a velocity controller was proposed that limits the robot speed to a biomechanically safe value, taking into account the mass and the curvature in the direction of movement for a given point of interest. The mass and the geometry depend on the mechanical design, however, the effective mass also depends on the robot configuration. In this paper, we exploit the redundant degree(s) of freedom of a joint torque controlled seven- and eight-DOF robot to minimize the effective mass without affecting the desired Cartesian end-effector trajectory and with the goal to improve the performance of the <b>safe</b> <b>velocity</b> controller at the same time. Given recent results in robotics injury analysis, we analyze when such a redundancy resolution scheme actually improves safety. For the considered robots, we find reflected mass extrema that can be obtained by null space motions, and propose a real-time, torque-based redundancy resolution scheme, which is finally verified in experiments...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 For {{autonomous}} {{vehicles to}} navigate the world as efficiently and effectively as biological species, improvements are needed in terms of control strategies and estimation algorithms. Reactive collision avoidance is one specific area where biological systems outperform engineered algorithms. To better understand the discrepancy between engineered and biological systems, a collision avoidance algorithm was applied to frames of trajectory data from three biological species (Myotis velifer, Hirundo rustica, and Danio aequipinnatus). The algorithm uses {{information that can be}} sensed through visual cues (relative position and velocity) to define collision cones which are used to determine if agents are on a collision course and if so, to find a <b>safe</b> <b>velocity</b> that requires minimal deviation from the original velocity for each individual agent. Two- and three-dimensional versions of the algorithm with constant speed and maximum speed velocity requirements were considered. The obstacles provided to the algorithm were determined by the sensing range in terms of either metric or topological distance. The calculated velocities showed good correlation with observed velocities over the range of sensing parameters, indicating that the algorithm is a good basis for comparison and could potentially be improved with further study...|$|E

Usually, the block {{is combined with}} a sash stop to limit {{the height of the}} sash opening, ensuring a <b>safe</b> face <b>velocity</b> during normal operation while lowering the hood’s air volume. By reducing the air volume, the RAV hood can operate with a smaller blower, which is another cost-saving advantage.|$|R

30|$|Differential braking {{and active}} {{steering}} {{have already been}} integrated to overcome their shortcomings. However, existing research mainly focuses on two-axle vehicles and controllers are mostly designed to use one control method to improve the other. Moreover, many experiments are needed to improve the robustness; therefore, these control methods are underutilized. This paper proposes an integrated control system specially designed for multi-axle vehicles, in which the desired lateral force and yaw moment of vehicles {{are determined by the}} sliding mode control algorithm. The output of the sliding mode control is distributed to the suitable wheels based on the abilities and potentials of the two control methods. Moreover, in this method, fewer experiments are needed, and the robustness and simultaneity are both guaranteed. To simplify the optimization system and to improve the computation speed, seven simple optimization subsystems are designed for the determination of control outputs on each wheel. The simulation results show that the proposed controller obviously enhances the stability of multi-axle trucks. The system improves 68 % of the <b>safe</b> <b>velocity,</b> and its performance is much better than both differential braking and active steering. This research proposes an integrated control system that can simultaneously invoke differential braking and active steering of multi-axle vehicles to fully utilize the abilities and potentials of the two control methods.|$|E
40|$|An often-ignored {{aspect of}} {{unmanned}} cross-country vehicles is the dynamic {{response of the}} vehicle on dffer-ent terrain. We discuss techniques to predict the dynamic vehicle response to various natural obstacles. This method can then be used to adjust the vehicle dynamics to optimize pegormanee (e. g. speed) while ensuring that the vehicle is not damaged. This capability opens up a new area of obstacle negotiation for UGVs, where the vehicle moves over certain obstacles, rather than avoid-ing them, thereby resulting in more effective achievement of objectives. Robust obstacle negotiation and vehicle dynamics prediction requires several key technologies that {{will be discussed in}} this paper. We detect and seg-ment (label) obstacles using a novel 30 obstacle algo-rithm. The material of each labelled obstacle (rock, vege-tation, etc.) is then determined using a texture or color classification scheme. Terrain load-bearing surface mod-els are then constructed using vertical springs to model the compressibility and traversability of each obstacle in front of the vehicle. The terrain model is then combined with the vehicle suspension model to yield an estimate of the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>velocity,</b> and predict the vehicle dy-namics as the vehicle follows a path. This end-to-end obstacle negotiation system is envisioned to be usejsrl in optimized path planning and vehicle navigation in ter-rain conditions cluttered with vegetation, bushes, rocks, etc. Results on natural terrain with various natural mate-rials are presente...|$|E
40|$|Bilateral {{teleoperation}} of a humanoid robot’s arm’s {{can allow}} a human operator ata safe location {{to reach a}} disaster scene that has rough terrain and perform workwhile having the sensation of touch. However {{the actions of the}} arms {{have an effect on the}} stability of the humanoidrobot, thus actions such as stepping, jumping and limiting the operators commandsare required. Conventional works on this topic consider arm force constraints separately from thetrajectory planning of the center of mass and the feet. This can lead to stabilityproblems and reduce the maximum force that can be applied to the environment. Furthermore, only linear trajectory planning is considered for reactive stepping. Also, conventionally wrist torque constraints and permitting impulsive forces(largeforce for a short time) are not considered. The originality of this work is as follows. Firstly a linear model predictive controlleris presented which simultaneously plans the robot’s center of mass trajectory, footsteppositions(reactive stepping) and time varying arm forces and torque constraints. Secondly, for the situation where it is undesirable to step reactively due to poor terrainconditions, velocity constraints of the arms are used as they allow for impulsivearm forces. Thus velocity constrained methods can allow larger forces to be appliedto the environment than force constrained methods, but only for a short time andstability is ensured via an energy equilibrium instead of a force equilibrium. Themaximum <b>safe</b> <b>velocity</b> is derived by generalizing the capture point concept and avelocity constrained bilateral controller is developed. Experimentally verification isperformed with MARI- 3. Thirdly, as part of an effort towards realizing nonlinear problems in realtime suchas jumping to recover from large disturbances, a novel particle swarm optimizer forgraphics hardware is developed and integrated into a model predictive framework. This framework is demonstrated to perform real-time trajectory planning of anAcrobot(underactuated double inverted pendulum) by allowing it to swing up tothe upright pose and the “upleft” pose(first link straight up, second link straightdown) ...|$|E

This paper investigates the ultimate limits for improvement due to various strategies of active control. Five strategies are proposed and investigated numerically using a~validated model of a real, passive landing gear as a reference. Potential for improvement is estimated statistically {{in terms of the}} mean and median (significant) peak strut forces as well as in terms of the extended <b>safe</b> sinking <b>velocity</b> range.

40|$|With the {{increased}} use of small unmanned systems, and even automated ﬂight, safety is becoming an issue. For helicopters speciﬁcally, engine failure typically results in a crash. For manned helicopters, autorotation is a manoeuvre used to reduce the downward speed and land at <b>safe</b> <b>velocities.</b> In this thesis, we examine a technique of modelling and control for such a small unmanned helicopter. Port-Hamiltonian (PH) modelling is a technique to construct a passive system, that can be controlled with Passivity-Based Control (PBC) in order to guarantee stability in the controlled system. This thesis used these techniques to control a helicopter model composed of a basic physical model and an accurate model of the rotor airﬂow and thrust generation, with the ultimate aim to provide control during total engine failure. An Interconnection and Damping Assignment (IDA) controller was constructed for both the vertical and lognitudinal models, with a relatively novel damping method based on exponential damping functions. Use of this controller allowed fast and smooth control of velocities for the vertical and longitudinal models. Finally, the controller succeeds in following the textbook manoeuvres for an autorotative landing: ﬁrst generating forward speed to slow down the descent, and ending in a ﬂare manoeuvre to land with as little speed as possible. The ﬁnal landing could still be considered rough, but the actions of the controller provide a larger chance that the airframe survives touchdown. This thesis is a preliminary step in developing a full PH helicopter model. Recommendations are made to extend and augment the model to implement a more detailed representation of helicopter mechanics. As for the controller, a control strategy for an automated autorotative landing is examined and discussed. It is shown that the suggested controller guides the helicopter model through the autorotation strategy, reducing the downward speed up to landing at the cost of energy stored in the main rotor. A limitation of the controller {{is that it does not}} yet implement actuator limits, resulting in a stronger control action than would normally be possible.

40|$|Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) use {{continues}} to increase, including operating beyond {{line of sight}} in unknown environments where the vehicle must autonomously generate a trajectory to safely navigate. In this article, we develop a trajectory generation algorithm for vehicles in unknown environments with bounded wind disturbances where the vehicle only relies on its on-board distance sensors and communication with other vehicles to navigate. The proposed algorithm generates smooth trajectories and can be used with high-level planners and low-level motion controllers. The algorithm computes a maximum <b>safe</b> cruise <b>velocity</b> for the vehicle in the environment and guarantees that the trajectory does not violate the vehicle's thrust limitation, sensor constraints, or user-defined clearance radius around other vehicles and obstacles. Additionally, the trajectories are guaranteed to reach a stationary goal position in finite time given a finite number of bounded obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm properties through two scenarios: (1) a quadrotor navigating through a moving obstacle field to a goal position, and (2) multiple quadrotors navigating into a building to different goal positions...|$|R

The time required to react is known as the reaction time, and the time for traffic alignment (harmonization) is known as the transition time [1]. The reaction distance is the distance travelled during the reaction time, while the transition distance is the distance covered during the transition time. The sum of the transition and reaction times is known as the safe time headway.

Modular construction has facilitate labour require, energy usage, hence carbon footage has gain approval of efficient product development in recent year. The use of such mobile equipments equally gives advantage to port to reduce port traffic, safety preservation of environment reduction in maintenance and berth allocation. Heavy seaborne traffic in port leads to the requirement of port terminal development or improvement. Port terminal involved problem related to traffic and high cost. The use of mobile floating protection facilities can offset this problem. The study involved design and modeling of a safe loading and unloading facilities to ensure the smooth flow {{of the work and}} reduction in the work delay.

40|$|The {{landing of}} a crewed lunar lander {{on the surface}} of the Moon will be the climax of any Moon mission. At touchdown, the landing {{mechanism}} must absorb the load imparted on the lander due to the vertical component of the lander's touchdown velocity. Also, a large horizontal velocity must be avoided because it could cause the lander to tip over, risking the life of the crew. To be conservative, the worst-case lander's touchdown velocity is always assumed in designing the landing mechanism, making it very heavy. Fuel-optimal guidance algorithms for soft planetary landing have been studied extensively. In most of these studies, the lander is constrained to touchdown with zero velocity. With bounds imposed on the magnitude of the engine thrust, the optimal control solutions typically have a "bang-bang" thrust profile: the thrust magnitude "bangs" instantaneously between its maximum and minimum magnitudes. But the descent engine might not be able to throttle between its extremes instantaneously. There is also a concern about the acceptability of "bang-bang" control to the crew. In our study, the optimal control of a lander is formulated with a cost function that penalizes both the touchdown velocity and the fuel cost of the descent engine. In this formulation, there is not a requirement to achieve a zero touchdown velocity. Only a touchdown velocity that is consistent with the capability of the landing gear design is required. Also, since the nominal throttle level for the terminal descent sub-phase is well below the peak engine thrust, no bound on the engine thrust is used in our formulated problem. Instead of bangbang type solution, the optimal thrust generated is a continuous function of time. With this formulation, we can easily derive analytical expressions for the optimal thrust vector, touchdown velocity components, and other system variables. These expressions provide insights into the "physics" of the optimal landing and terminal descent maneuver. These insights could help engineers to achieve a better "balance" between the conflicting needs of achieving a <b>safe</b> touchdown <b>velocity,</b> a low-weight landing mechanism, low engine fuel cost, and other design goals. In comparing the computed optimal control results with the preflight landing trajectory design of the Apollo- 11 mission, we noted interesting similarities between the two missions...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{control of}} the wellbore pressure not only prevents lost circulation/blowout and fracturing formation by managing {{the density of the}} drilling fluid, but also improves productivity by mitigating reservoir damage. Calculating the geothermal pressure of a geothermal well by constant parameters would easily bring big errors, as the changes of physical, rheological and thermal properties of drilling fluids with temperature are neglected. This paper researched the wellbore pressure coupling by calculating the temperature distribution with the existing model, fitting the rule of density of the drilling fluid with the temperature and establishing mathematical models to simulate the wellbore pressures, which are expressed as the variation of Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) under different conditions. With this method, the temperature and ECDs in the wellbore of the first medium-deep geothermal well, ZK 212 Yangyi Geothermal Field in Tibet, were determined, and the sensitivity analysis was simulated by assumed parameters, i. e., the circulating time, flow rate, geothermal gradient, diameters of the wellbore, rheological models and regimes. The results indicated that the geothermal gradient and flow rate were the most influential parameters on the temperature and ECD distribution, and additives added in the drilling fluid should be added carefully as they change the properties of the drilling fluid and induce the redistribution of temperature. To ensure the <b>safe</b> drilling and <b>velocity</b> of pipes tripping into the hole, the depth and diameter of the wellbore are considered to control the surge pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review the {{clinical}} utility of static weight bearing (SWB) and maximal self-selected ambulatory velocity as objective quantifiable measures in an outpatient lower limb prosthetic clinic. Seventy-three (n= 73) consecutive trans-tibial (TTA) and trans-femoral amputees (TFA) attending an outpatient prosthetic clinic were studied. Prosthetic weight bearing was measured on a bathroom scale (mass in kg), normalised to body mass then expressed as a percentage and labelled static weight bearing (SWB). Maximum <b>safe</b> self-selected ambulatory <b>velocity</b> over a 10 metre level walkway (m/s) was measured with a stopwatch. The SWB mean for the TTA group was 94. 93 % (range 77 - 100 %) and 88. 36 % for the TFA group (range 43 - 100 %). The mean ambulatory velocity was 1. 70 m/s (range 0. 07 - 5. 75) for the TTA group and 0. 78 m/s (range 0. 10 - 1. 54) for the TFA group. A statistically significant relationship (p< 0. 05) was found between SWB and ambulatory velocity in trans-tibial and trans-femoral amputees in this study. A ceiling effect was noted in the trans-tibial group with 42 % achieving 100 % SWB through their prosthetic limb so it was concluded that ambulatory velocity was the more sensitive measure in established trans-tibial prosthetic limb users. SWB may be the more appropriate quantifiable measure for use in established trans-femoral prosthesis users. Prosthetic training programmes would benefit from the objective measurement of SWB. Once optimal SWB was achieved, ambulatory velocity would be the more sensitive measure of prosthetic use...|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} the {{enhancement}} of high-speed flywheel energy storage is to investigate composite materials that are suitable for high-speed, high-energy density for energy storage and/or energy recovery. The main motivation {{of the study is}} to explore the application of the flywheel in the aviation industry for recovering some of the energy that is currently being lost at the wheel brakes of an aircraft due to the high temperature developed in the brake stack as a result of landing, frequent brake applications during taxiing in or out of heavy traffic airports and rejected take-off. Lamina and laminate mechanical properties of materials suitable for flywheel high-speed energy storage were investigated. Design and optimum stress analysis were used to determine the shape factor, maximum stress and energy density for a flywheel with a constant stress disk and a constant thickness rim. Analytical studies along {{with the use of the}} CADEC-online software were used to evaluate the lamina and laminate properties. This study found that the use of hybrid composite material with higher strength (based on first ply failure strength) and lower density and lower elastic moduli for the disk than the rim material will yield high-speed and high-energy density. The materials designed based on the results from this study show outperformance compared to previous published results of standard flywheel material combinations. The <b>safe</b> rotational <b>velocity</b> and energy density were found to be 166, 000 RPM and 2. 73 MJ/kg respectively. Therefore, results from this study will contribute to aiding further development of the flywheel that has recently re-emerged as a promising application for energy storage due to significant improvements in composite materials and technology. Further study on flywheel energy recovery from aircraft brakes revealed that more than half of the energy dissipated at the wheel brake as heat could be recovered and converted to some useful form. In this way, the operating life of the brakes can be prolonged. The total additional weight to the aircraft was found to be less than 0. 2 % of the maximum take-off weight. This additional weight can be offset by reducing the design payload while ensuring that the structural efficiency of the aircraft is not altered. It was also found that applying this method of flywheel energy recovery to active commercial Boeing- 777 aircraft will result in savings equivalent to the annual carbon emission of a 6 MW fossil fuel power plant. This will also contribute to the aviation industry climate change mitigation...|$|R
