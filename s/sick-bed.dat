25|$|Uppermost in {{the minds}} of the Spanish ministers was the need to {{preserve}} their empire intact and put it in hands powerful enough to guarantee that integrity. The preservation of the whole empire for the next generation of Spaniards was the driving motive in the last months of Charles II's life, but the grandees, led by Cardinal Portocarrero, knew that militarily their country was at the mercy of neighbouring France and that Austria, lacking a navy, could not hope to validate its claims. Consequently, Charles II, pressed on his <b>sick-bed</b> by his ministers, signed his final will on 3 October 1700, annulling the renunciations imposed on Maria Theresa and fixing the entire inheritance on the younger grandson of Louis XIV, Philip, Duke of Anjou. As Philip was not immediately in line for the French throne (the Dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy stood between him and the crown), the Spanish government hoped that this arrangement would be acceptable to European states who feared the unification of the French and Spanish thrones under a single monarch. If Philip should die or refuse, the offer was to extend to his younger brother, the Duke of Berry; if they both refused, the undivided inheritance would be offered to Archduke Charles.|$|E

40|$|What {{large scale}} {{interventions}} work? I would {{argue for the}} work of general practitioners, of the longitudinal and continous care of individuals and their families in their community. But what about our public health colleagues? Mass interventions have moved on from childhood immunisa-tions and clean water. Instead GPs are told to enact poorly evidenced interventions, such as cardiovascular risk screenings, and instead of individual consent for interventions like breast screening, women are sent complex information with no checking of understanding or discussion of the pros and cons. There is mass marketing- but no individual care. I will argue that modern public health should be primarily political, because it is here that the biggest inequalities are created and require to be challenged. There is no point in funding us to prescribe more statins to people living in poverty when the bigger problems are of employment, housing, drugs, alcohol, and mental illness. Relying on doctor-delivered preventative strategies may even increase health inequalities through only the already most healthy attending or concording with treatment of risk factors. I want to plead for my colleagues in public health to help us use resources to make society fairer for the <b>sick-</b> and leave the well alone.

40|$|International {{audience}} BACKGROUND: Many factors {{influence the}} return to work of workers with chronic low back pain (CLBP). They have been said to vary according to socio-professional group. This study first aimed to compare prognostic factors influencing {{the return to}} work of CLBP healthcare workers (HCWs) and other workers (non-HCWs) after rehabilitation coupled with an occupational intervention. The second objective was to improve the evolution of indicators such as clinical examination, psychosocial impact and pain impact. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2012, a cohort of 217 CLBP workers (54. 8  %-women; mean age[*]=[*] 41. 3 [*]±[*] 9. 5  years, 118 non-HCWs; 99 HCWs mainly from the public sector) was included in an ambulatory rehabilitation program (standard physiotherapy or intensive network physiotherapy) coupled with an occupational intervention. Workers completed a questionnaire and had a clinical examination at baseline and after 24  months' follow up. Physical, social and occupational data was collected at the same time. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors for return to work and compare the two worker populations. RESULTS: There {{was no difference between}} groups for the rate of OP (occupational physician) intervention or type of physiotherapy. 77. 3  % of workers returned to work after 2  years following inclusion. To be an HCW (OR 0. 1; 95  % CI [0. 03 - 0. 34]), to have less than 112 <b>sick-</b> leave days (OR 1. 00; 95  % CI [0. 93 - 1. 00]), a small fingertip-floor distance (OR 0. 96; 95  % CI [0. 93 - 0. 99]), a low anxiety/depression score (OR 0. 97; 95  % CI [0. 95 - 1. 00]), a low impact of CLBP on daily life (OR 0. 96; 95  % CI [0. 93 - 1. 00]), and on quality of life (OR 0. 98; 95  % CI [0. 95 - 1. 00]) at baseline were statistically associated with return to work after 2  years of follow up. Only the profession (workplace) was statistically associated with return to work after 2  years of follow up using multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study concerning predictive factors of RTW among CLBP workers after 2  years of follow up. Interventions in the work environment did not seem to predict job retention significantly. But only 50  % of the employees in both groups (HCW and non-HCW) had one intervention at their workplace after 2  years. This study underlined the fact that the type of physiotherapy with a well-trained physiotherapist used to take care of CLBP could not impact on the RTW forecast. To develop these initial results, it might be interesting to study the comparison between private and public sectors and to randomize the physiotherapeutic intervention. </p...|$|R
40|$|Individual and {{environmental}} risk factors in hand eczema {{have been investigated}} in a prospective cohort study of 2452 newly employed hospital workers with a follow-up time of 20 months. Current hand eczema was analyzed in 142 wet hospital workers from this cohort {{with respect to the}} etiologic importance of irritants, allergens and contact urticants. The density of the microflora and the effect on the microflora of topical treatment with a potent corticosteroid were studied in 20 patients with hand eczema. ’Wet’ hospital work was found to increase the odds of developing hand eczema only twice compared to 'dry' office work. Nursing children under four years old and the lack of a dish-washing machine significantly increased the risk of contracting hand eczema. Unfavourable combinations of these domestic factors increased the risk as much as wet work. A history of atopic dermatitis approximately tripled the odds both in wet as well as in dry work. Histories of earlier hand eczema (HHE), metal dermatitis (HMD) and of atopy were analyzed as risk factors for hand eczema in 1857 women in wet work. HHE increased the odds by a factor of 12. 9 and created a subdivision of the population into high risk individuals and normal risk individuals. HHE was found in half of the subjects with atopic dermatitis, in one quarter of the subjects with atopic mucosal symptoms and in one fifth of the non-atopics. A HMD increased the odds by a factor of 1. 8. This increase was seen as a high risk level in subjects with HHE and as a normal risk level in subjects with no HHE. A history of atopic disease as a complement to information about HHE and HMD increased the odds by another 1. 3 times. The predicted probability of developing hand eczema ranged from 91 % in subjects with a combination of HHE, HMD and atopy to 24 % in subjects with none of these risk factors. Subjects with AD were found to suffer a more severe form of hand eczema with significantly higher figures for medical consultation, <b>sick-</b> leave, termination due to hand eczema, early debut, permanent symtoms and vesicular lesions. Amongst the patients investigated for current hand eczema high risk individuals were overrepresented. It was claimed in 92. 3 % of the cases that trivial irritant factors had elicited the current episodes of hand eczema. In 35 % of the cases the exposure to the irritant took place largely at home. Although contact sensitivity and contact urticaria were fairly common, they mostly seemed to be of minor importance in the etiology of the current hand eczema. Staphylococcus aureus colonized eczematous lesions of the hands in 18 / 20 patients. The density exceeded 105 colony forming units/cm 2 in 15 / 20 patients. Only three of these patients showed signs of clinical infection. Successful topical treatment with a potent corticosteroid significantly reduced the colonization of S. aureus.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: A {{survey was}} carried out in 2000 by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in a random sample of workers from 15 {{countries}} of the European Union in order to obtain information on occupational exposure, health problems and preventive measures taken at the workplaces. OBJECTIVES: To obtain similar information in workers in the Veneto Region and compare the results with those of the third European Survey on Working Conditions (ESWC). The results of the survey on Veneto Region workers were further analyzed, investigating the distribution by risk factors in each work sector, and the association between risk factors and reported health problems. METHODS: The ESWC questionnaire was adapted to the requirements of a telephone interview and a sample of 5000 workers (size based on the budget) between 15 and 64 years of age was randomly extracted from the regional list of telephone subscribers. The questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers. No statistical tests were used in the comparison between ESWC and Veneto Region results {{due to the lack of}} a priori hypotheses. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated in estimating the association between risk factors and symptoms; and p-value for OR trend across the increasing level of exposure was also obtained. RESULTS: Workers reported to be exposed for more than a quarter of their work time to: vibrations (20 %), noise (19 %), dusts, fumes vapours, chemicals (18 %), repetitive hand/arm movements (50 %), tiring/painful positions (46 %); working at very high speed or tight deadlines (60 %). 54. 4 % of the subjects reported working with computers. Taking as a reference the third ESWC in 2000, among Veneto Region workers in 2005 exposure was lower as regards physical, chemical and ergonomic risk factors, and similar as regards working at very high speed. The more frequently reported work-related health problems were: stress (26. 9 %), backache (17. 8 %), overall fatigue (11. 9 %), muscular pains in upper limbs (6. 8 %), headache (6. 1 %), sight problems (5. 4 %), anxiety (5. 5 %), muscular pain in lower limbs (4. 3 %), irritability (4. 0 %), hearing problems (2. 3 %). Except for stress, all symptoms/health problems were two-three times more frequently reported in the ESWC than in the Veneto Region survey where, conversely, the number of persons with at least one new <b>sick-</b> leave spell was higher. Lastly, there was no difference as regards preventive measures taken at the workplace: information on risks (78. 2 %), wearing personal protective equipment (28. 7 %), training paid by employer (28. 7 %). Among the Veneto Region workers, the most often reported risk factors were exposure to physical and chemical risk factors in industry/agriculture, and shift-work and working at very high speed in the services. The most commonly adopted preventive measures were information on risks and wearing of personal protective equipment in industry, and training in services. Moreover, among the Veneto Region workers, a significant exposure-dependent increase was reported for respiratory problems, allergies, dermatitis, hearing loss, accidents, back pain, pain in the upper and lower limbs, and headache. The risk of stress, anxiety, sleeping problems, stomach pain and headache increased when skills were not adequate to cope with job demand. In contrast, the perception of improved health conditions increased with increasing skill discretion, decision authority, social support (which are dimensions of control of job demand), but not with information on risk, training, or use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the present survey provide useful insights on working and health conditions of workers in the Veneto Region, revealing problems that were subsequently investigated using other sources of information, as reported in the studies published elsewhere in this volume...|$|R
