50|$|Lake Monroe Bridge was {{originally}} built between 1932 and 1933 {{as a replacement}} for a wooden bridge (tolled until 1926) that was manually operated. The bridge was a Warren-Truss Swing bridge, fabricated by Ingall's Iron Works of Birmingham, Alabama, the <b>swing</b> <b>gear</b> was manufactured by Earle Gear and Machine Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was erected by W.W. White of St. Petersburg, Florida. The contracting company for the Florida State Road Department was Kreis Contracting Company of Knoxville, Tennessee.|$|E

5000|$|Memmo {{used the}} years of Donato's reign to {{maneuver}} behind the scenes, <b>swinging</b> into high <b>gear</b> following Donato's death on 16 July 1612. When the election was held on July 24, 1612, Memmo was elected on the first ballot, with 38 of the 41 votes, a shock to the nuove faction that had dominated the position of Doge for centuries. Great festivals were organized to celebrate Memmo's victory, and, like previous Doges, he would use the celebrations that attended great holidays {{as a way to}} curry favor with the population of Venice.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the show}} started, the entire stage {{was covered by}} a large ball. Once the show began, the ball lit up and the {{audience}} {{was able to see}} Yung through the semi-transparent material that the ball was made up of. As Yung sang the first song [...] "凝溶", the ball opened up like an upside-down flower blooming, revealing Yung singing on a metal <b>swing</b> with colorful <b>gears</b> spinning above her. After the first song, yung was lowered under the stage as dancers came out for a short dance interlude. She then sprang up and performed the second song [...] "好事多為" [...] with her dancers. Then Yung Joey chatted with the audience for a while before singing [...] "這分鐘更愛你" [...] and [...] "爭氣".|$|R

5000|$|Proposals {{for the new}} bridge were {{discussed}} for many years, starting no later than 1975. The Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) replaced the third Berkley-Dighton Bridge because it was seriously structurally deficient, its <b>swing</b> span <b>gears</b> often jammed in the open position, forcing travelers {{miles to the north}} or south, and due to the inability for the bridge to handle emergency vehicles. The MHD estimates (2001 data) that 6,200 cars crossed the bridge each day. Bridge upgrade plans were met with opposition for a variety of reasons, including concerns about the impact on local traffic. Commercial trucks were not allowed to use the old bridge. Also, the traffic lights were only triggered by cars stopping on a line in the road. This was very problematic for people not familiar with the bridge.The current bridge is a fixed structure, consisting of four pre-cast arch spans with closed spandrel walls of cast-in-place concrete, with approximately the same footprint as the previous bridge, using pile-supported abutments and piers. The finished bridge was made such that it appears to be constructed of stone masonry rather than concrete. The two end spans are 74 ft and the two center spans are 92 ft for a total bridge length of approximately 350 ft. [...] In Fall 2014, the arches were built from segments trucked in. The arches are ten segment widths wide and were brought in as half-arches.|$|R
60|$|We made {{a race of}} it, and I {{would never}} have {{believed}} that a common boat's crew of a merchantman could keep up so much determined fierceness in the regular swing of their stroke. What our captain had clearly perceived before we left had become plain {{to all of us}} since. The issue of our enterprise hung on a hair above that abyss of waters which will not give up its dead till the Day of Judgment. It was a race of two ship's boats matched against Death for a prize of nine men's lives, and Death had a long start. We saw the crew of the brig from afar working at the pumps--still pumping on that wreck, which already had settled so far down that the gentle, low swell, over which our boats rose and fell easily without a check to their speed, welling up almost level with her head-rails, plucked at the ends of broken <b>gear</b> <b>swinging</b> desolately under her naked bowsprit.|$|R
50|$|Financial {{troubles}} only worsened in Emperor Shun's reign, as {{many public}} works projects were handled {{at the local level}} without the central government's assistance. Yet his court still managed to supervise the major efforts of disaster relief, aided in part by a new invention in 132 CE of a seismometer by the court astronomer Zhang Heng (78-139 CE) who used a complex system of a vibration-sensitive <b>swinging</b> pendulum, mechanical <b>gears,</b> and falling metal balls to determine the direction of earthquakes hundreds of kilometers (miles) away. Shun's greatest patronage of scholarship was repairing the now dilapidated Imperial University in 131 CE, which still operated as a pathway for young gentrymen to enter civil service. Officials protested against the enfeoffment of eunuch Sun Cheng and his associates as marquesses, with further protest in 135 CE when Shun allowed the sons of eunuchs to inherit their fiefs, yet the larger concern was over the rising power of the Liang faction.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} studies (laboratory, archival, and field) that test models of cognitive and emotional decision-making in the context of Internet auctions. We demonstrate {{for the first time a}} behavioral reversal of the classic anchoring effect, finding that lower starting prices can produce higher final sale prices. We show that this effect results from lower starting prices reducing barriers to entry into the auction, thereby increasing interest, traffic, and, in the end, higher final prices. We also show how starting price interacts with a number of different variables, and in doing so, find support for Mandler’s (1975; 1982) congruity model, an affective extension of that model, and a new model of competitive arousal (Ku, Malhotra, & Murnighan, 2003). The discussion focuses on extending our understanding of the effects of anchors from intrapersonal and dyadic to group domains, contextualizing anchors in social processes, and the need to simultaneously consider cognitive and affective influences in decision-making.
