40|$|<b>Spectacles</b> are {{routinely}} prescribed by the ophthalmologist and dispensed by the opticians. We investigated how frequently the <b>spectacles</b> are not dispensed as prescribed {{and whether the}} frequency of inaccurate <b>spectacles</b> would decrease if the patients, {{at the time of}} collecting <b>spectacles,</b> ask the optician to verify that the <b>spectacles</b> have been dispensed accurately. We found inaccurate <b>spectacles</b> in about one-third of our patients and incorrect spherocylinders more frequently with an error in the spherical element and cylinder axis. These inaccuracies decreased significantly when patients while collecting <b>spectacles,</b> asked the optician to verify the accuracy of the <b>spectacles</b> dispensed. It is suggested that while prescribing <b>spectacles,</b> the patients should be made aware of the possibility of dispensing errors. To decrease the frequency of incorrect <b>spectacles,</b> the patients while collecting <b>spectacles,</b> should ask the optician to check whether the <b>spectacles</b> have been dispensed accurately...|$|R

40|$|Uncorrected {{refractive}} error {{is the leading}} cause of visual impairment. The societal costs of this impairment are substantial and the costs of reducing the burden relatively small. Due to their limited resources, developing countries are over-represented in the 153 million people with distance uncorrected {{refractive error}} and over 500 million with near uncorrected refractive error (presbyopia). <b>Spectacles</b> provide a low cost and readily available solution to the problem, but there is no general consensus on how this should be achieved. The aim of this thesis was to develop a model for an effective method of providing <b>spectacles</b> for correction of refractive error in developing countries and regions. Among the hypotheses tested were: that selection of ready-made <b>spectacles</b> can be guided by frame size and wearer&# 146;s PD; that there is a power threshold below which ready-made <b>spectacles</b> can be supplied without the need for expensive quality control; that custom-made <b>spectacles</b> should be the preferred form of correction for powers greater than this threshold; that recycled <b>spectacles</b> are not cost effective; and that achievement of the goals of the WHO/IAPB initiative, Vision 2020 :The Right to Sight, will require the establishment of sustainable local infrastructure, including trained staff who are able to provide refraction and dispensing services and the production of custom-made <b>spectacles</b> for those unsuited to read-made <b>spectacles</b> on an ongoing basis. A model was developed based on the results of tests carried out on ready-made <b>spectacles</b> and analysis of current practice and options for correction. Sustainability was an underlying principle of the model design. It includes protocols for quality control of ready-made and custom-made <b>spectacles,</b> the training of staff capable of producing custom-made <b>spectacles</b> and budgeting for the establishment of optical facilities using a cost minimisation approach...|$|R

When Evadne's pearl chain finally broke and had to be replaced, Patrick Fyffe gave George Logan a silver chain, (which actually came from Dame Hilda's reading <b>spectacles).</b> Logan soon replaced this with a more dainty gold chain.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis involves the absorption in the human head of microwaves in the frequency range 0. 5 to 3 GHz with the excitation positioned {{in front of the}} face. It is hypothesised that metallic <b>spectacles</b> can significantly affect the absorption in the head. The effects of metallic <b>spectacles</b> have been primarily investigated using computer modelling. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) is the most common computational tool used in bioelectromagnetics. For this research an independent, specially written FDTD code has been used. The accuracy of the code was carefully validated against controls. Two anatomically accurate heads were implemented into the FDTD code. Different shapes and sizes of metallic <b>spectacles</b> were modelled. The materials that the <b>spectacles</b> were made of were also investigated. Realistic and geometric <b>spectacles</b> were considered. Vertically and horizontally polarised plane waves as well as vertically and horizontally orientated dipoles are used as sources. A genetic algorithm (GA) was employed as a search technique to optimise the <b>spectacles</b> for the specific absorption rates (SAR) in the eyes and the head. Measurements were also made of a phantom with metallic <b>spectacles.</b> Results showed good agreement with the FDTD code. Results confirmed the hypothesis that metallic <b>spectacles</b> can significantly affect the SAR in the head and particularly in the eyes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the accommodative state {{of young adults}} wearing + 2 D and + 3 D reading <b>spectacles</b> under normal conditions and with the elimination of accommodative cues. Subjects’ refractions were measured with an infrared PowerRefractor. Power of the vertical meridian was recorded for subjects viewing far and near targets in free space and through a Badal lens apparatus with and without reading <b>spectacles.</b> Additionally, refractive measurements were taken after subjects wore + 2 D reading <b>spectacles</b> for 30 min (post-adaptation). In free viewing and viewing through the Badal lens, subjects uniformly over-accommodated relative to the target while wearing reading <b>spectacles</b> (i. e., with the <b>spectacles,</b> they focused at a plane {{in front of the}} target). Subjects in the first post-adaptation test showed no significant difference in accommodation between viewing a near target with and without + 2 D <b>spectacles</b> after having read with them for 30 min, though they had without post-adaptation. Subjects in the second post-adaptation test were not significantly differently accommodated before and after reading when binocularly viewing a near target with + 2 D reading <b>spectacles.</b> The results imply that no adaptation of the subjects’ accommodative postures while viewing visual targets occurred {{as a result of a}} 1 / 2 h near work task with the <b>spectacles.</b> The over-accommodation of subjects using reading <b>spectacles</b> while they are performing visual tasks shows the necessity of measurement if their true accommodative posture is to be determined...|$|R

5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this <b>spectacle</b> situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

40|$|Context: Uncorrected {{refractive}} {{errors are}} {{the leading cause of}} visual impairment. Aims: To assess the prevalence and patterns of <b>spectacles</b> use among those aged ≥ 40 years in the South Indian state of Telangana. Settings and Design: This was a population-based, cross-sectional study, in which 6150 people were enumerated from 123 clusters in the two districts of Telangana state (Adilabad and Mahbubnagar) using a two-stage cluster random sampling methodology. Materials and Methods: Participants were visited in their households and presenting visual acuity (VA) was assessed in all cases followed by pinhole VA if presenting VA was worse than 6 / 12. A questionnaire was used to collect information on the current and previous <b>spectacles</b> use, type of <b>spectacles,</b> and details of the <b>spectacles</b> provider. Statistical Analysis Used: Stata statistical software version 12. Results: Among 5881 participants examined, 53. 7 % were women, and 82 % had no formal education. The prevalence of current <b>spectacles</b> use was 28. 8 % (95 % confidence interval: 27. 6 – 30. 0). On applying multiple logistic regression analysis, <b>spectacles</b> use was significantly associated with older age groups, female gender, higher levels of education, and residing in Adilabad district. Bifocals were the most commonly used type of <b>spectacles</b> (56. 3 %), and private eye clinics (70. 3 %) were the leading service providers. The <b>spectacles</b> coverage was 53. 6 %. Conclusions: We reported on prevalence and patterns of <b>spectacles</b> use using a large representative sample and a high response rate.

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} effects of {{corrective}} <b>spectacles</b> in hyperopic amblyopic children with heterophoria. Methods: Visual acuity, refraction {{and the amount of}} heterophoria on near (33 cm) fixation were measured before and after 3 weeks of spectacle-wearing in 30 hyperopic amblyopic children with heterophoria. The control group consisted of 20 emmetropic children age-matched to the patients. Results: Uncorrected eyes displayed hyperopic amblyopia accompanied by heterophoria. Corrective <b>spectacles</b> not only attenuated the hyperopia and amblyopia, but also changed the heterophoria to orthophoria. The amount of heterophoria before wearing <b>spectacles</b> was significantly different from that in emmetropic children; but after correction with <b>spectacles,</b> it was the same as that in the emmetropic controls. Conclusion: Correction with <b>spectacles</b> is effective for the treatment of heterophoria in hyperopic children with amblyopia...|$|R
40|$|NoPURPOSE. Epidemiologic {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that elderly people who wear multifocal <b>spectacles</b> have an increased risk of tripping, particularly on stairs. Yet no studies have experimentally examined how wearing multifocal <b>spectacles</b> affects stair and step negotiation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of wearing multifocal compared with single-distance vision <b>spectacles</b> on minimum toe clearance and risk of tripping during step negotiation in the elderly. METHODS. Nineteen healthy subjects (mean age, 71. 4 years) performed a single step up to a new level (heights, 7. 5, 15, and 22 cm) while wearing multifocal (bifocals and progressive addition lenses) or single-distance vision <b>spectacles.</b> Minimum horizontal and vertical toe clearance were assessed by analyzing data collected with a five-camera, three-dimensional motion-analysis system. RESULTS. There was no difference in mean minimum toe clearance in subjects when wearing multifocal compared with single-distance vision <b>spectacles.</b> However, there was greater within-subject variability in vertical toe clearance when wearing multifocal <b>spectacles</b> (variance ratio, 1. 53; P = 0. 0004). Subjects were also significantly more likely to trip when wearing multifocal compared with single-vision <b>spectacles</b> (one-sided Fisher's exact test P = 0. 025). CONCLUSIONS. Because of increased within-subject variability in vertical toe clearance when wearing multifocal <b>spectacles,</b> elderly individuals may be at greater risk of falling when negotiating steps and stairs if they do not also consistently increase margins of safety (mean vertical toe clearance). This suggests that some elderly who are at high risk of falling may benefit from wearing single-distance vision rather than multifocal <b>spectacles</b> when walking...|$|R
