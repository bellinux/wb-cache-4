40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{biological}} recovery of human skin allografts is {{the gold standard}} for preservation in <b>Skin</b> <b>Banks.</b> However, there is no worldwide consensus about specific allocation criteria for preserved human skin allografts with living cells. A report is presented on the results of 5 years of experience of using human skin allografts in burned patient in the <b>Skin</b> and Tissue <b>Bank</b> at Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación. Material and methodsThe human skin allografts were obtained from multi-organ donors, processed and preserved at − 80 °C for 12 months. Allocation criteria were performed according to blood type match, clinical history, and burned body surface. ResultsUp to now, the <b>Skin</b> and Tissue <b>Bank</b> at Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación has processed and recovered 125, 000 cm 2 of human skin allografts. It has performed 34 surgical implants on 21 burned patients. The average of burn body surface was 59. 2 %. More than two-thirds (67. 7 %) of recipients of skin allografts were matched of the same to type blood of the donor, and 66. 6 % survived after 126 days hospital stay. ConclusionIt is proposed to consider recipient's blood group as allocation criteria to assign tissue; and use human skin allografts on patiens affected with burns over 30 % of body surface (according the “rule of the 9 ”) ...|$|R

30|$|First {{reported}} in 1872 by Reverdin, split-thickness skin allograft {{did not become}} widely used for covering large burn or wound surfaces until James Barrett Brown published his work in 1942 and 1953 (Hansbrough 1992; Brown and McDowell 1942; Brown et al. 1953). Since that time, split-thickness allograft has become a mainstay for effective temporary wound coverage (Jackson 1954; Macmillan 1962). Although currently <b>skin</b> <b>banks</b> only accept split-thickness skin grafts from cadaveric donors, {{the idea of using}} surgically discarded skin as a potential allograft source was described by Brown et al. (1953). Jackson described using allograft from living donors, and Swartz et al. (1975) described a method for procuring and using split-thickness skin from panniculectomy specimens, although they did not report skin culture results or quality of the grafts obtained (Jackson 1954; Swartz et al. 1975).|$|R

30|$|In {{this small}} study we have {{demonstrated}} that it is technically possible to aseptically obtain skin grafts from abdominoplasty specimens and that the procedure can be performed immediately after specimen excision {{in the operating room}} or the following day in a laboratory. This is contrast to procurement of cadaveric skin grafts which involves personnel being on-call to obtain skin grafts during off hours. Given that abdominoplasty specimens are plentiful, we have demonstrated a method of using this skin to create split-thickness skin grafts which has the potential to supply the need for unfilled requests for skin grafts. From the 2007 AATB survey, tissue banks distributed 314, 832 packages of skin. The total square feet reported was 29, 908, however 2 of the 24 <b>skin</b> <b>banks</b> did not report their distribution in square feet. Nonetheless, 2288 requests and 1358 square feet were unfilled in 2007 (American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) 2007). The increased ease and efficiency of harvesting grafts from life donors undergoing skin reduction surgery may be a way to increase the supply while decreasing cost to the system. In addition, this method could also be used by other countries that are not able to fill requests for skin grafts. For example, a need for tissue <b>bank</b> expansion involving <b>skin</b> grafts has been described in China. Given the skin shortage in China, Wang et al. performed a study to begin to evaluate the possibility of hepatitis B transmission through using skin donors who were hepatitis B positive (Wang et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Background:. In Nepal, burn trauma causes {{more than}} 55, 000 {{injuries}} each year. Burn-related mortality {{is high in}} Nepal, {{in part due to}} lack of allograft, leading to high infection rates. To address this challenge, our collaboration between Kirtipur Hospital, America Nepal Medical Foundation, Stanford University, and ReSurge International established Nepal’s first <b>skin</b> <b>bank.</b> Methods:. We identified 3 major tasks to create a sustainable skin banking program: 1) identify and acquire the equipment and personnel needed to collect, process, store, and graft cadaveric skin for burn injuries; 2) develop safe donation protocols and documentation tools that remain feasible for low-resource settings; and 3) develop a long-term awareness program to educate the Nepali people on skin donation, a previously foreign concept. Results:. Kirtipur Hospital acquired the necessary equipment and materials for the <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> through a combination of local and international fundraising efforts. Existing U. S. skin banking protocols were adapted for the Nepali setting and piloted on potential patients, donors, and physicians. For {{the first time in the}} hospital’s history, patients with > 40 % total body surface area burns were successfully treated with extensive allografts. Conclusions:. It is feasible to create a <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> in a country with no tradition of allograft skin use. Long-term sustainability now depends on spreading awareness and education in the Kathmandu Valley to overcome religious and cultural barriers that have hindered donor recruitment.

40|$|Skin allografts from cadaver {{donors are}} an {{important}} resource for treating extensive burns, slow-healing wounds and chronic ulcers. A high level of cell viability of cryopreserved allografts is often required, especially in burn surgery, in Italy. Thus, we aimed to determine which conditions enable procurement of highly viable skin in our Regional <b>Skin</b> <b>Bank</b> of Siena. For this purpose, we assessed cell viability of cryopreserved skin allografts procured between 2011 and 2013 from 127 consecutive skin donors, before and after freezing (at day 15, 180, and 365). For each skin donor, we collected data concerning clinical history (age, sex, smoking, phototype, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cause of death), donation process (multi-tissue or multi-organ) and timing of skin procurement (assessment of intervals such as death-harvesting, harvesting-banking, death-banking). All these variables were analysed in the whole case study (127 donors) and in different groups (e. g. multi-organ donors, non refrigerated multi-tissue donors, refrigerated multi-tissue donors) for correlations with cell viability. Our results indicated that cryopreserved skin allografts with higher cell viability were obtained from female, non smoker, heartbeating donors died of cerebral haemorrhage, and were harvested within 2  h of aortic clamping and banked within 12 h of harvesting (13 – 14  h from clamping). Age, cause of death and dyslipidaemia or diabetes {{did not appear to}} influence cell viability. To maintain acceptable cell viability, our <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> needs to reduce the time interval between harvesting and banking, especially for refrigerated donors...|$|E
30|$|Limitations of {{this study}} are small sample size, the fact we did not test {{preservation}} methods on these grafts, the majority of specimens were from female subjects, and that the maximum amount of skin grafts were not obtained from every specimen. A more practical concern is that <b>skin</b> <b>banks</b> do not use skin from living donors given concern for transmissible infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from May 20, 1994 states: “For semen donations and, when possible, for tissue donations from living donors, the collection should be placed in frozen quarantine and the donor retested for antibodies to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 after 6  months (Rogers et al. 1994).” The 6  month quarantine is also stated in the Code of Federal Regulations in 2009 for anonymous donors of semen (Code of Federal Regulations 2009). The skin grafts could be potentially kept frozen for 6  months to allow for retesting of the donor before transplantation. Retesting may decrease the number of donors willing to undergo repeat testing, but given the large numbers of potential donors even a smaller fraction would yield a significant amount of tissue. While the skin grafts in this study were not preserved, they were qualitatively not different from cadaveric grafts and would have been preserved in the same manner. With further work to show that preservation maintains specimen quality along with reliable repeat laboratory testing, this method of obtaining skin grafts could potentially supply skin grafts to the vulnerable and critically ill patient population of burn and trauma patients.|$|R

40|$|The main use of {{homologous}} {{skin grafts}} or grafts of related bioproducts {{is in the}} treatment of severe burns. However, various new clinical and experimental sectors, in which this type of skin substitute can be useful, have recently emerged. The main new clinical indications for skin allografts include: skin loss, surgical wounds and bullous diseases. In these fields donor skin can be used for different purposes: as a physiological biological dressing to control pain and protect deep structures such as tendons, bones, cartilage and nerves, and to promote reepithelization with a significant reduction in healing time, and as skin substitute with dermal tissue to guide repair and make it as physiological as possible. In particular, <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> bioproducts are currently used {{in the treatment of}} several conditions such venous and arterial leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, pyoderma gangrenosum, post traumatic lesions, Mohs surgery, reconstructive surgery, wound cover in critical areas, aesthetic surgery, congenital epidermolysis bullosa and Lyell's syndrome. <b>Skin</b> <b>bank</b> bioproducts have also been used for experimental indications, to study in vitro toxicology and in vitro skin biology. Recently the demonstration that de-epidermized dermis (DED) has all the characteristics of an excellent dermal substitute into which various types of cells can be introduced and made to develop, opens exciting new possibilities of research in the field of wound healing and tissue engineering. Our preliminary observations seems to indicate that CD 34 + stem cells from umbilical cord blood can survive in DED and in a few weeks populate collagen bundles. The observation of tubular structures without lumina close to collagen bundles as well as clusters of epithelioid or fibroblast-shaped cells may represent aspects of differentiation of CD 34 + stem cells.

40|$|Wound {{healing in}} fetal skin is {{characterized}} by the absence of scar tissue formation, which is not dependent on the intrauterine environment and amniotic fluid. Fetal cells have the capacity of extraordinary expansion and we describe herein the development of a fetal <b>skin</b> cell <b>bank</b> where from one organ donation (2 - 4 cm 2) it is possible to produce several hundred million fetal skin constructs of 9 x 12 cm 2. Fetal cells grow three to four times more rapidly than older skin cells cultured in the same manner and these banked fetal cells are very resistant against physical and oxidative stress when compared to adult skin cells under the same culture conditions. They are up to three times more resistant to UVA radiation and two times more resistant towards hydrogen peroxide treatment. This mechanism may be of major importance for fetal cells when they are delivered to hostile wound environments. For fetal cell delivery to patients, cells were associated with a collagen matrix to form a three-dimensional construct in order to analyze the capacity of these cells for treating various wounds. We have seen that fetal cells can modify the repair response of skin wounds by accelerating the repair process and reducing scarring in severe bums and wounds of various nature in children.

Results: We cryopreserved human fibroblasts and keratinocytes with different CPAs and compared them to fresh, unfrozen cells. Cells were frozen in the presence and absence of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the latter of which is a commonly used CPA known to exert toxic effects on cells. Cell numbers were counted immediately post-thaw as well as three days after thawing. Cellular structures were analyzed and counted by labeling nuclei, mitochondria, and actin filaments. We found that successful cryopreservation of suspended or adherent keratinocytes can be accomplished with a 10 % HES or a 5 % HES, 5 % DMSO solution. Cell viability of fibroblasts cryopreserved in suspension was maintained with 10 % HES or 5 % HES, 5 % DMSO solutions. Adherent, cryopreserved fibroblasts were successfully maintained with a 5 % HES, 5 % DMSO solution. Conclusion: We conclude that skin tissue cells can be effectively cryopreserved by substituting all or a portion of DMSO with HES. Given that DMSO is the most commonly used CPA and is believed to be more toxic than HES, these findings are of clinical significance for tissue-based replacement therapies. Therapies that require the use of keratinocyte and fibroblast cells, such as those aimed at treating skin wounds or skin burns, may be optimized by substituting a portion or all of DMSO with HES during cryopreservation protocols...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAutologous or implant-based breast {{reconstruction}} after nipple-sparing mastectomy {{is increasingly}} preferred worldwide as {{a breast cancer}} treatment option. However, postoperative nipple-areola complex (NAC) necrosis {{is the most significant}} complication of nipple-sparing mastectomy. The purpose of our study was to identify the risk factors for NAC necrosis, and to describe the use of our skin-banking technique as a solution. MethodsWe reviewed cases of immediate autologous breast reconstruction after nipple-sparing mastectomy at our institution between June 2005 and January 2014. The patients' data were reviewed and the risk of NAC necrosis was analyzed based on correlations between patient variables and NAC necrosis. Moreover, data pertaining to five high-risk patients who underwent the donor skin-banking procedure were included in the analysis. ResultsEighty-five patients underwent immediate autologous breast reconstruction after nipple-sparing mastectomy during the study period. Partial or total NAC necrosis occurred in 36 patients (43. 4 %). Univariate analysis and binary regression modeling found that body mass index, smoking history, radiation therapy, and mastectomy volume were significantly associated with NAC necrosis. Of the 36 cases of NAC necrosis, 31 were resolved with dressing changes, debridement, or skin grafting. The other five high-risk patients underwent our prophylactic skin-banking technique during breast reconstruction surgery. ConclusionsNAC necrosis is common in patients with multiple risk factors. The use of the skin-banking technique in immediate autologous breast reconstruction is an attractive option for high-risk patients. <b>Banked</b> <b>skin</b> can be used in such cases without requiring additional donor tissue, with good results in terms of aesthetic and reconstructive outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} {{fluorescence microscopy}} allows in vivo high-resolution imaging of human skin structure and biochemistry with a penetration depth over 100 mm. The major damage mechanism during two-photon skin imaging {{is associated with}} the formation of cavitation at the epidermal-dermal junction, which results in thermal mechanical damage of the tissue. In this report, we verify that this damage mechanism is of thermal origin and is associated with onephoton absorption of infrared excitation light by melanin granules present in the epidermal-dermal junction. The thermal mechanical damage threshold for selected Caucasian skin specimens from a <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> as a function of laser pulse energy and repetition rate has been determined. The experimentally established thermal mechanical damage threshold is consistent with a simple heat diffusion model for skin under femtosecond pulse laser illumination. Minimizing thermal mechanical damage is vital for the potential use of two-photon imaging in noninvasive optical biopsy of human skin in vivo. We describe a technique to mitigate specimen thermal mechanical damage based on the use of a laser pulse picker that reduces the laser repetition rate by selecting a fraction of pulses from a laser pulse train. Since the laser pulse picker decreases laser average power while maintaining laser pulse peak power, thermal mechanical damage can be minimized while two-photon fluorescence excitation efficiency is maximized. © 2004 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the number of potential cornea, heart valve, bone and skin donors among patients who died in Dutch hospitals, in comparison with the number of actual donors. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Five hospitals {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of patients who died in 1989 were reviewed. Children younger than 4 weeks were excluded from the study. On the basis of criteria used by the Eurotransplant and Bio Implant Services Foundations and those of the <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> of the Dutch Burns Foundation, it was determined if the deceased were medically suitable as cornea, heart valve, bone or skin donor. RESULTS: Data were collected on 2150 of 2369 deceased (90. 8 %), mean age 69. 5 (17. 0) (SD) years. Medical criteria for cornea donation were met in 72 % of the cases, 6. 8 % of these became actual donors. The figures for heart value donors were 4. 3 % and 9. 7 % respectively, and for bone donors 2. 7 % and 0 %. The percentage of potential skin donors could not be determined, because essential data were missing from the medical records. After extrapolation the number of donors among all patients who died in Dutch hospitals in 1989 amounted to 35, 046 potential cornea donors, 2, 093 potential heart valve donors and 1, 314 potential bone donors. CONCLUSION: Only a very small proportion of the potential tissue donors were referred to Eurotransplant and Bio Implant Services. Therefore, waiting lists for tissue transplantation are not necessar...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the absence}} of {{xenograft}} and biosynthetic skin substitutes, deceased donor skin allografts is a feasible option for saving life of patient with extensive burn injury in our country. Aims: The first deceased donor skin allograft bank in India became functional at Lokmanya Tilak Municipal (LTM) medical college and hospital on 24 th April 2000. The response of Indian society to this new concept of skin donation after death and the pattern of utilization of banked allografts from 2000 to 2010 has been presented in this study. Settings and Design: This allograft <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> was established {{by the department of}} surgery. The departments of surgery and microbiology share the responsibility of smooth functioning of the bank. Materials and Methods: The response in terms of number of donations and the profile of donors was analyzed from records. Pattern and outcome of allograft utilization was studied from specially designed forms. Results: During these ten years, 262 deceased donor skin allograft donations were received. The response showed significant improvement after counselling was extended to the community. Majority of the donors were above 70 years of age and procurement was done at home for most. Skin allografts from 249 donors were used for 165 patients in ten years. The outcome was encouraging with seven deaths in 151 recipients with burn injuries. Conclusions: Our experience shows that the Indian society is ready to accept the concept of skin donation after death. Use of skin allografts is life saving for large burns. We need to prepare guidelines for the establishment of more skin banks in the country...|$|E
40|$|Viable donor skin {{is still}} {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} the temporary covering of burns. Since 1985, the Brussels military <b>skin</b> <b>bank</b> supplies cryopreserved viable cadaveric skin for therapeutic use. Unfortunately, viable skin can not be sterilised, which increases the risk of disease transmission. On the other hand, every effort should be made to ensure that the largest possible part of the donated skin is processed into high-performance grafts. Cryopreserved skin allografts that fail bacterial or fungal screening are reworked into ‘sterile’ non-viable glycerolised skin allografts. The transposition of the European Human Cell and Tissue Directives into Belgian Law has prompted us to install a pragmatic microbiological screening and acceptance procedure, which is based on 14  day enrichment broth cultures of finished product samples and treats the complex issues of ‘acceptable bioburden’ and ‘absence of objectionable organisms’. In this paper we evaluate this procedure applied on 148 skin donations. An incubation time of 14  days allowed for the detection of an additional 16. 9 % (25 / 148) of contaminated skin compared to our classic 3  day incubation protocol and consequently increased the share of non-viable glycerolised skin with 8. 4 %. Importantly, 24 % of these slow-growing microorganisms were considered to be potentially pathogenic. In addition, we raise the issue of ‘representative sampling’ of heterogeneously contaminated skin. In summary, we feel that our present microbiological testing and acceptance procedure assures adequate patient safety and skin availability. The question remains, however, whether the supposed increased safety of our skin grafts outweighs the reduced overall clinical performance and the increase in work load and costs...|$|E
