40|$|A {{total of}} 654 beef {{carcasses}} {{were randomly selected}} for inspection in a Venezuelan slaughterhouse for determining the influence of country of origin (COO) and sex class on the frequency of physical defects in anatomical regions, its economic impact and correlation between variables of interest. Cow carcasses were the most frequently contaminated with Undesirable Matter (UM) in the chuck, and as well as bulls, they were frequently affected by bruises in the rounds. Brazilian bulls resulted with higher occurrence of abscesses, mostly located in the neck. Venezuelan cattle despite having shorter transport times had a higher frequency of traumatisms and UM presence. COO and sex class were associated (p< 0. 05) with different defects according to the anatomical region. A total of 360. 9 kg of <b>seized</b> <b>meat</b> represented a loss of US$ 2, 627. 91; the largest quantity (142. 6 kg) occurred in Brazilian carcasses, for a loss of US$ 1, 038. 35. Abscesses (136. 6 kg) {{were responsible for the}} greatest loss of meat and, in consequence, of money. It is concluded that cow carcasses are expected to be the most affected by defects while carcasses of Venezuelan origin, despite having a higher frequency of defects, its economic impact is relatively lower...|$|E

50|$|In an {{alternative}} version, the eagle and the fox are friends {{and decide to}} live near each other. After the eagle betrays their friendship by stealing the fox’s cubs and feeding them to its young, the fox prays for vengeance. This is brought about when the eagle <b>seizes</b> <b>meat</b> from a sacrificial altar to which a glowing charcoal is attached and sets fire to its nest. The roasted chicks tumble {{to the foot of}} the tree, where they are eaten by the fox. This version predates Aesop, since Archilochus (c.650 BCE) relates how the friendship between the two is betrayed and the fox appeals to Zeus. By the time of Aristophanes, however, the story of the bad alliance between the two creatures is attributed to Aesop.|$|R
50|$|The Germans seized about 80 {{percent of}} the French food production, which caused severe {{disruption}} to the household economy of the French people.

60|$|During {{the first}} few days of their stay, the boys acted their parts with much {{internal}} amusement. They pretended to be absolutely ignorant of civilized feeding, <b>seized</b> the <b>meat</b> raw and tore it with their fingers, sat upon the ground in preference to chairs, and in every way behaved as persons altogether ignorant of civilization. Gradually, however, they permitted themselves to be taught, and delighted their entertainers by their docility and willingness. The Spaniards were, indeed, somewhat surprised by the whiteness of their skin, where sheltered from the sun; and by the lightness of their hair and eyes. The boys could hear many comments upon them, and wondering remarks why they should be so much fairer than their countrymen in general. As, however, it was clearly useless to ask them, none of the Spaniards thought of doing so.|$|R
60|$|The hut was ransacked; the flour, {{two bottles}} of spirits, and a skin of wine <b>seized,</b> and the <b>meat</b> cut up and roasted over the fire. After the meal was eaten, the captain called upon Charlie {{to tell his story}} more fully, and this he did, with the aid of the man who spoke Swedish; starting, however, only at the point when he was {{attacked}} in the street, as he felt it better to remain silent as to his connection with the Swedish army.|$|R

When his horse kicked, and ended by {{throwing}} him, he stood by, and caused it to be beaten till the poor creature's back streamed with blood; when his dog bit his hand in trying to <b>seize</b> the <b>meat</b> with which he was teazing it, he insisted on having it killed, and it was worse still when a falcon pecked one of his fingers. It really hurt him a good deal, and, in a furious rage, he caused two nails to be heated red hot in the fire, intending to have them thrust into the poor bird's eyes.|$|R

Some people—including German soldiers—benefited from the black market, where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers especially diverted meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, however, and thus carried out at the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted better survival. The official ration provided starvation level diets of 1300 or fewer calories a day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.|$|R

Some people—including German soldiers who could take advantage of arbitrary exchange rates that favored Germany—benefited from the black market, where food was sold without coupons at very high prices. Farmers diverted meat to the black market, which meant that there was much less for the open market. Counterfeit food coupons were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, and carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. Vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition were prevalent. Advice about eating a healthier diet and home growing produce was distributed. Slogans like 'Digging for Victory' and 'Make Do and Mend' appeared on national posters and became a part of the war effort. The city environment made these efforts nearly negligible. In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted survival. The official ration provided starvation-level diets of 1,300 or fewer calories a day (5400 kJ), supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{objectives were}} to analyze reproduction performance and productivity of swamp buffalofrom different altitudes in Cianjur and {{draw up a}} hierarchy of productivity strategy development usinganalysis of SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threats) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with four criteria: technology, costs, impact, and the response of farmers. Survey was conducted in Cianjurduring January-March 2014 by interview prepared questionnaires and direct observation of 63 buffalo farmers. Secondary data were also obtained from relevant agencies. Primary data were collected usingdirect observation of 139 reproductive female buffaloes then were further analyzed. A total of 58 buffaloesat their productive period were sampled and taken their morphometric data. Whilst 37 buffaloes weremeasured their frame size using Body Condition Score (BCS). The {{results showed that the}} reproductionperformance of buffaloes in the lowlands are not significantly different from those in the highland. The ageat first oestrus, first mating, first calving, gestation period were 25. 6 months, 26. 6 months, 38. 7 months, 11. 8 months, respectively [...] The oestrus period was 5. 3 days, and post-partum mating interval was 54. 6 days. Differences in altitude and sex significantly affected (P < 0. 05) the morphometry assessment. Thebody weight of male buffaloes were found lower than the females both in highlands and lowlands (P< 0. 05). The body conditioning score of buffalo performance at highland was better compared to those in thelowland. Based on the SWOT analysis and AHP: (1) The main strategy is to improve the technology basedon the criteria of internal weakness by increasing scale holdings to <b>seize</b> opportunities buffalo <b>meat</b> selfsufficiency;(2) based on the criteria of cost and impact, the strategy was to cover threats over the professionout of the region by empowering farmers (facilitate increased productivity buffalo); (3) based on the responsecriteria, the primary strategy is {{to improve the quality of}} education of farmers by facilitating productivityimprovement opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency buffalo meat.
