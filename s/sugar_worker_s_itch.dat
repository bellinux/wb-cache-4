50|$|After the massacre, labor {{organizing}} among <b>sugar</b> <b>workers</b> essentially was suspended; plantation workers {{returned to}} work under the owners' terms. White Democrats, who dominated the state legislature, soon passed laws for disenfranchisement of blacks, racial segregation and other Jim Crow rules. There was no more effort to organize <b>sugar</b> <b>workers</b> until the 1940s. It was then initiated {{in the context of}} increased civil rights activism after World War II.|$|R

Idzenga, Baterna, Veloria, and Villorosa founded the organization when they observed the issue of the [...] "inaccessibility of supply of potable water and irrigation experienced by rural upland communities."

50|$|In April 1948 the Guiana Industrial Workers Union (GIWU) was formed, {{with the}} {{intention}} of replacing the MPCA as the major union for field and factory workers; <b>sugar</b> <b>workers</b> had become disillusioned with the MPCA, which offered little resistance to the SPA. During a strike in the same month, the MPCA urged strikers to return to work, claiming their demands would be discussed with the SPA. However, stikers ignored the call, despite the SPA saying they would only deal with the MPCA as the only recognised union. By the end of 1948, the GIWU had the support of the majority of <b>sugar</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Independence {{left the}} two main industries, sugar and oil {{in the hands of}} foreign multi-national {{corporations}} (Tate & Lyle in sugar, Shell, British Petroleum and Texaco in oil). The labour unions interpreted this as evidence that the PNM and DLP leadership had sold out to foreign corporations. George Weekes, an anti-PNM Afro-Trinidadian trade unionist, gained control of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union, while Krishna Gowandan challenged Bhadase Maraj's leadership of the All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers Union. In March 1965 15,000 <b>sugar</b> <b>workers</b> went on strike. Williams responded by declaring a State of Emergency and suspending civil rights. This brought the Afro-Trinidadian-dominated Trade Union Congress into alliance with the (Indo-Trinidadian) <b>sugar</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jagan's term {{had not yet}} {{ended when}} another round of labor unrest rocked the colony. The pro-PPP GIWU, which had become an {{umbrella}} group of all labor organizations, called on <b>sugar</b> <b>workers</b> to strike in January 1964. To dramatize their case, Jagan led a march by <b>sugar</b> <b>workers</b> from the interior to Georgetown. This demonstration ignited outbursts of violence that soon escalated {{beyond the control of}} the authorities. On May 22, the governor finally declared another state of emergency. The situation continued to worsen, and in June the governor assumed full powers, rushed in British troops to restore order, and proclaimed a moratorium on all political activity. By the end of the turmoil, 160 people were dead and more than 1,000 homes had been destroyed.|$|R

At its peak, it controlled 75% of the sugar industry in British Guiana and was so powerful that a common joke was to refer to the country as [...] "Booker's Guiana". In 1952, Jock Campbell took over the chairmanship of the company and his Fabian social politics transformed it dramatically into a benevolent force providing major benefits for <b>sugar</b> <b>workers.</b> Jock Campbell was also instrumental in the setting up of Booker's Author Division, which sponsored the Booker Prize.|$|R
