5|$|A CBC investigation, {{intended}} to test {{access to information}} following Bill 29, discovered that some departments and agencies were refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries. When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the-then Deputy Minister of Justice, Donald Burrage, said that {{the provisions of the}} act which enabled the public to see bonuses offered to public service employees had not been changed. Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary, or a salary range, plus a range of possible bonuses, are now available. However, he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not a change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E
5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and {{felt he had to}} prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E

5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer {{a different point of}} view throughout) technology. David Denby of The New Yorker <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East.|$|E

North Indians left the city by buses, trains and private vehicles.

5|$|The {{son of a}} furrier, Mühe {{was born}} on 20 June 1953 in Grimma, Saxony, in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).

He was relieved of duty after contracting stomach ulcers; a number of commentators have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to stress, and also suggested that it marked {{the beginnings of the}} stomach cancer that would eventually lead to his death.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 season, Sevilla were {{reported}} to be interested in Samaras as a replacement for Júlio Baptista. While Arsenal were also looking at him after they had missed out on signing Baptista, some news organisations had reported that Arsenal had already signed Samaras and that he would join {{at the end of the}} season. However, the player's father, Ioannis Samaras <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> untrue and that his son wanted to stay at the club for another year. Samaras scored on the opening day of the season, on 20 August, when he helped Heerenveen to a 5–4 victory over Roda JC. He picked up a minor leg injury in September, which ruled him out of Heerenveen's UEFA Cup tie against Baník Ostrava. But he returned to action on 23 September, and scored as Heerenveen beat NEC Nijmegen 2–1. On 14 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen came back from behind to beat Levski Sofia 2–1 in the UEFA Cup. On 30 December, Samaras scored twice as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4–2. In January 2006, Arsenal and Manchester City showed interest in signing the striker. Samaras tried to get released from his contract after Heerenveen had rejected a bid from Manchester City. However, the Dutch arbitration commission ruled that he had no grounds to end his contract. Samaras scored 25 goals in 88 appearances for Heerenveen.|$|E

5|$|Edrich {{came on and}} bowled a bouncer, which Bradman {{tried to}} swing to the leg side, but instead the edge went {{in the air and}} landed behind point. On 13, Bradman played a Bedser ball from his legs, {{narrowly}} evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour he was on 14. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Doug Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. At the lunch break, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. Shortly afterwards, in the third over after the resumption of play, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for 38 for the third consecutive time in Tests by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg, just two days after falling the same way in the second innings against Yorkshire. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the first time that Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession. Australia reached 7/258 at the end of day one, before a lower order burst took them to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
