40|$|Abstract Background Post-exercise {{hypotension}} (PEH) following prolonged dynamic exercise {{arises from}} increased total vascular conductance (TVC) via skeletal muscle vasodilation. However, arterial vasodilation of <b>skeletal</b> <b>musculatures</b> does not entirely {{account for the}} rise in TVC. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the contribution of vascular conductance (VC) of the legs, arms, kidneys and viscera to TVC during PEH. Methods Eight subjects performed a single period of cycling at 60 % of heart rate (HR) reserve for 60 minutes. Blood flow in the right renal, superior mesenteric, right brachial and right femoral arteries was measured by Doppler ultrasonography in a supine position before exercise and during recovery. HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured continuously. MAP decreased significantly from approximately 25 minutes after exercise cessation compared with pre-exercise baseline. TVC significantly increased (approximately 23 %; P Conclusion PEH was not induced by decreased cardiac output, but by increased TVC, two-thirds of the rise in which can be attributed to increased VC in active and inactive limbs. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{cellular}} {{anatomy of}} hummingbird's flight musculature {{is very similar}} to other small bird species, all their flight muscles are composed of only fast oxidative glycolytic muscle fibres which allow the sustained high frequency wing beats typically seen in these birds. These muscle fibres are filled with mitochondria (around 50% of volume) enabling high frequency wing beats to be sustained over extended periods using oxidative energy. A very well developed pathway that transports sugars to the muscles for use very efficiently supports these mitochondria: hummingbirds are also thought to be able to oxidise dietary fructose directly without the additional step of converting it to glucose. These factors combine to allow hummingbirds to consume oxygen at the highest known rate (over 5x the rate of dogs). Hummingbirds also have a higher amount of this energy thirsty muscle type elsewhere in their <b>skeletal</b> <b>musculature,</b> this is thought to help them combat loss of heat to the environment due to large surface area/volume ratio.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many cryptobranch dorid nudibranchs contain innumerable {{calcareous}} spicules, yet {{the function}} of these elements is unknown. Two possible roles are defense against pred-ators and structural support. In one dorid, Cadlina luteomarginata, whole-mount and thin-section staining revealed an intricate network of spicule tracts and connective tissue ramifying throughout the body, with muscle fibers associated with this spicule/connective tissue matrix and inserting into it. Spicules were present in high concentrations {{in all areas of}} the body, but highest in exterior mantle tissue. Relative investment increased isometrically with body size for most body regions, in contrast to the positively allometric investment seen in prosobranch shells. Bioassays with artificial food indicated that spicules alone did not deter generalist crabs and anemones, and only weakly increased the deterrence of secondary chemicals to anem-ones. Thus, while nudibranch spicules may serve as a defense against other predators, their primary role may be in body support.

40|$|Venom {{extracted}} from posterior {{regions of the}} venom duct of C. magus Linné was lethal to mice and produced a contracture of isolated <b>skeletal</b> and smooth <b>musculature</b> of the rat {{in the absence of}} electrical stimulation. The effect was sustained and the musculature became paralysed in the contracted state. With electrically stimulated or strongly curarized rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations the contracture elicited by a certain concentration of venom was of similar magnitude and time course to that elicited in unstimulated or non-curarized preparations. For a period, the length of which was related to venom concentration, the diaphragm was capable of responding with a twitch to electrical stimulation. The heights of successive muscle twitches declined progressively and eventually the musculature became refractory to stimulation. Tubocurarine, isotonic KSO, neostigmine or acetylcholine had no observable effect on the sustained contracture elicited by the venom. Posterior duct venom increased the strength of contraction of the musculature of the ventricle of the toad but decreased its rate of contraction. Cardiac musculature was not paralysed by the venom at concentrations tested. The effects produced by the venom in skeletal, smooth or cardiac musculature could be reversed by washing out the venom...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In a rural {{property}} of the Midwestern Minas Gerais, Brazil, three 2. 5 to 3 -year-old female bovines (7 / 8 Holstein x 1 / 8 Gir) weighing approximately 380 kg died after showing brownish colored mucosa of conjunctiva and vaginal vestibule, gray-bluish tongue, dyspnea, sialorrhea, tympany, and progression to sternal decubitus and death. In the macroscopic evaluation {{of one of the}} bovines, dark (chocolate-colored) blood of difficult coagulation, and intensely cherry-red <b>skeletal</b> and cardiac <b>musculature</b> were observed. Beyond that were observed brownish lungs, kidneys, liver, and encephalon, and all the stomach compartments were dilated due to large amounts of gas. In addition, the carcass exhaled a nitrous odor. The diphenylamine test and the nitrate dosage in the forage (Pennisetum purpureum, “elephant grass”, Napier grass cultivar) used in feeding the bovines showed a high concentration of nitrate, allowing the diagnosis of nitrate/nitrite intoxication. The main factors leading to the poisoning were attributed to excessive fertilization of grass with bovine manure, the occurrence of a drought period followed by a rainy season, lack of adaptation of the bovines to a nitrate-rich diet, and a diet composed almost exclusively of elephant grass.

40|$|Cephalic lobes {{are unique}} {{structures}} {{derived from the}} anterior pectoral fins, found in select myliobatid stingrays. Many benthic batoids utilize undulatory locomotion and use their pectoral fins for both locomotion and prey capture. Pelagic myliobatids that possess cephalic lobes utilize oscillatory locomotion, using their pectoral fins to locomote and their cephalic lobes for prey capture. Despite differences in habitat usage and locomotor modes, these batoids feed on very similar benthic organisms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to 1.) compare the morphology of the cephalic lobes and anterior pectoral fins in lobed and lobeless species, looking at <b>skeletal</b> elements, <b>musculature</b> and electrosensory pore distributions; 2.) compare prey capture kinematics in lobed and lobeless species and examine the role of the cephalic lobes in prey capture modulation due to elusive/non-elusive prey; 3.) analyze multiple morphological and behavioral variables to establish any correlations to the presence of cephalic lobes. Radiography, dissections and staining techniques were employed to examine the morphology of the cephalic lobes and anterior pectoral fins in six species of batoids. High speed videography was used to film prey capture behavior in five batoid species, using elusive and non-elusive prey. Continuous morphological and behavioral variables were used to determine any correlations with the presence of the cephalic lobes, taking phylogeny into account. Results indicate that the skeletal components of the pectoral fins of oscillatory species are very different from pectoral fins of undulatory species as well as the cephalic lobes. Second moment of area (I), showed that the cephalic lobes and pectoral fins in undulatory species had greater resistance to bending in multiple directions and were also more flexible. The cephalic lobes had a novel muscle layer compared to the pectoral fin musculature. Electorsensory pores were absent from the anterior pectoral fins in oscillatory batoids, but numerous on the cephalic lobes and anterior pectoral fins in undulatory batoids. The distribution of the electrosensory pores was uniform with the exception of Rhinoptera bonasus, which possessed higher pore numbers along the edges of the cephalic lobes. Overall, the morphology of the cephalic lobes is distinct, but more similar to the pectoral fins of undulators compared to oscillators. Kinematic data showed that species with cephalic lobes localize prey capture to the cephalic region of the body. Lobed species were faster at pouncing and tenting prey, but slower during biting. The cephalic lobes were able to move more in the vertical and horizontal plane compared to the anterior pectoral fins. All species were able to modulate prey capture behavior to some degree. Species lacking lobes spent more time handling elusive prey compared to non-elusive prey. For all species, elusive prey were farther from the mouth during biting but prey escapes were rare. Lobed species were overall faster in prey capture, but did not display more modulation or feeding success than lobeless species. Phylogenetically corrected correlations showed that most morphological variables correlated to the appearance of the cephalic lobes, while kinematics variables did not. There was also a correlation among habitat, locomotion and the cephalic lobes. The cephalic lobes may have played a key role in partitioning prey capture to the head region, maintaining dexterity in the lobes while allowing the pectoral fins to shift to oscillatory locomotion and consequently a pelagic lifestyle...|$|R
