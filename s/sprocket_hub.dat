50|$|The United States would supply: the engine; radiator; fan; piping; silencer; lighting; dynamo; battery; {{propeller}} shaft; transmission, including gearbox; brakes; roller sprockets; {{gear shift}} and brake control; track links and pins; rear track <b>sprockets,</b> <b>hub</b> and shafts; front idler hub and shafts; track roller, track spindles and bushings.|$|R
25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to a}} crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 <b>sprockets,</b> <b>hub</b> gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|R
5000|$|The single {{external}} sprocket {{means that}} the wheel can have a hub with more distance between its flanges and be built with no or much less dish, making it laterally stronger than a similar wheel with narrower flange spacing and more dish to accommodate multiple <b>sprockets.</b> The <b>hub</b> shell of gear hubs is also often of a larger diameter than that of derailleur hubs, meaning the spokes on such wheels may be shorter.|$|R
25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a double or triple {{chainring}} in conjunction with an internally geared hub, extending the gear range without having to fit multiple <b>sprockets</b> to the <b>hub.</b> However, this does require a chain tensioner of some sort, negating some of the advantages of hub gears.|$|R
50|$|Micro {{drive is}} a type of drivetrain, mostly BMX and MTB, that uses smaller than {{standard}} sized cogs. The smallest rear sprocket that fits on a freehub body is an 11-tooth, but {{with the use of a}} cassette hub, sometimes called a micro drive rear <b>hub,</b> <b>sprockets</b> as small as 8 teeth may be used.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sprocket</b> on the <b>hub</b> is {{made for}} standard-pitch derailleur-type bicycle chains 1/2&Prime; Ã— 3/32&Prime; (ISO 082) and is offered with {{different}} numbers of teeth, like 13/15/16/17. The 15-, 16-, and 17-tooth sprockets are reversible, offering double sprocket life once the sprocket is worn out in one direction. The 13-tooth sprocket is non-reversible and has a 4 mm outward offset, changing the chain-line from 54 to 58 mm, this because the smaller sprocket makes the chain run closer to the axle, and the chain would rub the hub shell if the sprocket were not offset.|$|R
50|$|Steel tracks {{revolving}} around pontoons were {{replaced with a}} system that employed two rubber belts with metal cleats, or grousers, attached to the outside perimeter to grip the snow. A series of wheels and guides were used inside the belts. Two drive <b>sprockets</b> on a <b>hub</b> drive the rubber belted track. The most modern version of the Sno-Cat track is the all-rubber Terra Track system. This system uses a wide single rubber belt, constructed with a multi-ply design similar to a modern car tire. The exterior perimeter employs molded rubber treads instead of the steel grousers of prior models.|$|R
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed <b>hubs.</b> [...] The <b>sprocket</b> on a <b>hub</b> without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|R
40|$|The real {{advantage}} of PM is to cost effectively produce large volume, highly tolerance metal components & widely applied to produce mainly automotive parts such as bearings cap, cams, synchronisation <b>hub,</b> <b>sprocket</b> and toothed components. The ongoing debate has always centred on properties, such as strength, size and life of Tool. Tool material selection and material characteristics are being engineered to specific applications and requirements. Flexibility {{and knowledge of}} process variables is the key for both the end-user and the component manufacturer. We, as an industry, see challenging new horizons that only require a little inspiration, ingenuity and persistence. There is little repetitive failure during production of Compaction (Forming) press tool found in manufacturing process. Each failure causes very high Economical cost to manufacturer in terms of production loss due to down {{time as well as}} commitments to the customer. The failure analysis of this compaction press tool was found most interesting. During these work modes of failures of tool was studied to conclude and recommend the solution. Design of compaction press tool was the methodology used to analysis the problem. Reviewed the history of the compaction tool compared the capacity of the pressing various possible design conditions, results and conclusion of the study will be very useful for compaction in future planning process...|$|R
