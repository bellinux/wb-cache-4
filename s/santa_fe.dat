5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Railway (BNSF), successor to the <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe,</b> retired them in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The 31-story Chase Tower {{was opened}} in Amarillo's {{downtown}} in 1971. Completed {{in the same}} year as the Chase Tower, the Amarillo National Bank Plaza One building houses the headquarters of Amarillo National Bank, the city's largest financial institution. The <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Building, completed in 1930, was the regional offices of the Atchison, Topeka and <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Railway, but was vacant for several years until Potter County bought the building for $426,000 in 1995 to gain new office spaces.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> {{encountered}} capacity {{problems on}} the San Francisco Chief, which ran between Chicago and San Francisco. Unlike the El Capitan, the Chief carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> ordered an additional 24 coaches in 19631964; 12 step-down and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance passenger equipment before the coming of Amtrak. Each San Francisco Chief carried four Hi-Level coaches, displacing six single-level coaches.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on Ignacio, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> to La Paz, with the watch upgraded to a warning nine hours later. The warning was extended on both coasts from Bahia Magdalena to San Evaristo the next day. About 48hours before Ignacio made landfall, a hurricane warning was issued from <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> to La Paz, and 21hours later extended to Bahia Magdalena and San Evaristo. The government of Mexico also issued a tropical storm warning for the mainland from Atlana to Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before it}} was named, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch {{in the state of}} Baja California Sur, from <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> on the Pacific coast around the peninsula to Buenavista along the Gulf of California. About 24hours prior to landfall, the watch was replaced with a warning from <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> to San Evaristo, and the tropical storm watch was extended along both sides of the peninsula. Prior to it making landfall, more than 2,500families in susceptible areas left their homes. Officials opened several shelters in the area where the storm struck.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> {{introduced}} the El Capitan in 1938. The train {{ran on the}} Santa Fe's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Unusually for streamliners of the period, the El Capitan carried coaches only, and had no sleeping cars. Passengers flocked to the new train, and the <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> added cars to meet the demand. The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952. Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. The <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> sought a solution to increase {{the capacity of the}} train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB {{introduced the}} first dome car, in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed bilevel rail cars in commuter service in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops once {{daily in}} each {{direction}} at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Station. Ridership on the train is increasing, about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. Increased ridership has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's service in the area. Saint Paul {{is the site of}} the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.|$|E

This numbered them before <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe's</b> GP7 fleet which then started at 2650 and it gave the railroad a large group of unused numbers. In the event EMD switch engines numbered between 2416 and 2438 had to be renumbered 1416 and up in 1974 to accommodate the later CF7s ...|$|R

5|$|One major {{controversy}} {{related to}} the preliminary route of US 50. The through route {{had been assigned to}} the Old <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Trail, while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Trail to the south. As a compromise, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration—U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S—in January. Another problem was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final numbering plan, approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between Ely, Nevada and Thistle, Utah. Finally, rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth, where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged, it was sent over the Lincoln Highway's Pioneer Branch, past the south side of Lake Tahoe, to Sacramento, California.|$|E
50|$|Cameron is {{the site}} of a 1996 {{connection}} track that was built between the former Burlington Northern line and the former <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe's</b> Chilicothe Subdivision, when the two merged to form the BNSF. This track allows both freight trains, along with Amtrak's Southwest Chief to use the Chicago and Mendota subdivisions between Chicago and Galesburg(already used by the California Zephyr), by way of Naperville, Princetonand Mendota. Prior to 1996, the Southwest Chief, and its predecessor, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe's</b> famed Super Chief, traveled to Galesburg on the Chilicothe subdivision by way of Joliet, Streator, and Chillicothe.|$|R
