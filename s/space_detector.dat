40|$|A delay-constrained {{sequence}} detector {{is considered}} for recording channels whose major impediments include intersymbol interference and magnetic transition jitter noise. The jitter noise is data-dependent, and a given noise sample is correlated with neighboring noise samples. A sequence detector with a finite decision delay can be formulated in a finite dimensional vector space. For a correlated noise channel, the decision boundary is generally quadratic. In this paper, {{we present a}} technique for obtaining a minimal set of hyperplanes approximating a quadratic decision boundary with a negligible performance loss. In this process, a distance measure, {{which is consistent with}} the notion of the effective SNR, is defined and used as a design parameter to trade the complexity and performance. As an achievable performance bound, we derive the effective SNR for the maximum likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) for these channels. The performance of the partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) detector commonly adopted for current data storage channels as well as the Viterbi algorithm (VA) based on the traditional Euclidean metric, whichserves as the MLSD for additive white Gaussian noise, are also analyzed and compared with that of the proposed signal <b>space</b> <b>detector...</b>|$|E
40|$|A signal <b>space</b> <b>detector</b> (SSD) {{based on}} a single {{hyperplane}} is proposed which offers nearly the same performance as the fixed delay tree search with decision feedback (FDTS/DF) for the digital versatile disk (DVD) channel. The FDTS/DF detector with a reasonable decision delay performs almost {{as well as the}} optimal maximum likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) due to the EFMplus modulation code that includes the d= 2 minimum runlength constraint. The single-hyperplane approximation of the FDTS/DF detector is made possible by considering only the critical signal points in the three-dimensional signal space. When the jitter noise is significant, the slope of the hyperplane decision boundary can readily be adjusted to improve the performance beyond that of the standard FDTS/DF detector. We also provide analysis and simulation results that verify the performance advantage of the SSD over partial response (PR) based threshold and Viterbi detectors. The distance between the received signal in signal space and the single hyperplane can be interpreted as soft information. The soft SSD can be used along with iterative error correction codes, such as low density parity check codes (LDPC), resulting in large performance gains...|$|E

40|$|In current seismic acquisition, {{the firing}} times between shots is {{sufficiently}} large to avoid temporal overlap between records. To economize on survey time, the current compromise {{is to keep}} the number of shots to an acceptable minimum. The result is a poorly sampled source domain. We propose to abandon the condition of non-overlapping shot records to allow densely sampled, wide-azimuth source distributions (source blending). The rationale is that interpolation is much harder than separation. Blending has significant implications for quality and economics. The blending concept can also be applied in the detector <b>space</b> (<b>detector</b> blending). Then, the recording channels consist of a superposition of detected signals, each signal with its own code. With detector blending, many more detectors can be used for the same number of recording channels. This is particularly beneficial when the number of channels is limited, like in wireless recording or OBS. The concept of double blending is defined as the case where both source blending and detector blending are applied. Double blending allows a significant data compression during acquisition. After a deblending procedure, existing processing schemes can be used. However, the challenge is to design new algorithms that do not require a deblending preprocessing step...|$|E
