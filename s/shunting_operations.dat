25|$|A Drewery rail tractor {{was based}} at Lyttelton in 1936 {{for a trial}} period {{to be used for}} <b>{{shunting}}</b> <b>operations.</b> Members of the shunting staff based at Lyttelton were trained in its use by the locomotive staff, with maintenance carried out by the traffic staff. The tractor was stored in the steam locomotive shed and was used, for the purposes of evaluation, for as much of the shunting work as possible {{to reduce the amount of}} time the steam locomotives were required for the work. Later, diesel locomotives began to make their presence felt at Lyttelton, and in 1969 four Hitachi rail tractors were assigned there. However, steam locomotives were still used for the South Island Limited at Lyttelton until the late 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{use of the}} Gracefield Branch for <b>shunting</b> <b>operations</b> for Hutt Workshops necessitated {{a change}} in working {{practices}} {{on the line in}} 1929. [...] Up to this time, race trains had been operated under Train Staff and Ticket regulations. [...] The new method of train working for the line was to use these regulations from Woburn to the Hutt Workshops, the Line Clear Working method beyond. [...] This required the installation of a telephone at Hutt Park to communicate with Woburn for the purposes of train control. [...] It was proposed to construct a small shelter at Hutt Park for the telephone, but it was also noted that the telephone could be located in one of the workshops buildings along with the ticket apparatus.|$|E
60|$|To-day (Nov. 4, 1907) {{the price}} of the {{ordinary}} South-Eastern stock is 65 and its deferred stock 31; of the London, Chatham and Dover ordinary stock 10-1/2; an eloquent testimony to the disheartened state of the owners who now cling reluctantly to this disappointing monopoly. Spite of this impoverishment of the ordinary shareholder, this railway system has evidently paid too much profit in the past for efficiency; the rolling stock is old and ageing--much of it is by modern standards abominable--the trains are infrequent, and the <b>shunting</b> <b>operations</b> at local stations, with insufficient sidings and insufficient staffs, produce a chronic dislocation and unpunctuality in the traffic that is exaggerated by the defects of direction evident even in the very time-tables. The trains are not well planned, the connections with branch lines are often extremely ill managed. The service is bad to its details. It is {{the exception rather than the}} rule to find a ticket-office in the morning with change for a five-pound note; and, as a little indication of the spirit of the whole machine, I discovered the other day that the conductors upon the South-Eastern trams at Hythe start their morning with absolutely no change at all. Recently the roof of the station at Charing Cross fell in--through sheer decay.... A whole rich county now stagnates hopelessly under the grip of this sample of private enterprise, towns fail to grow, trade flows sluggishly from point to point. No population in the world would stand such a management as it endures at the hands of the South-Eastern Railway from any responsible public body. Out would go the whole board of managers at the next election. Consider what would have happened if the London County Council had owned Charing Cross Station three years ago. But manifestly there is nothing better to be done under private ownership conditions. The common shareholders are scattered and practically powerless, and their collective aim is, at any expense to the public welfare, to keep {{the price of}} the shares from going still lower.|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a syndrome {{characterized by}} gait disturbance, cognitive deterioration and urinary incontinence in elderly individuals. These symptoms {{can be improved}} by <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> in some but not all patients. Therefore, discovering predictive factors for the surgical outcome is of great clinical importance. We used normalized power variance (NPV) of electroencephalography (EEG) waves, a sensitive measure of the instability of cortical electrical activity, and found significantly higher NPV in beta frequency band at the right fronto-temporo-occipital electrodes (Fp 2, T 4 and O 2) in shunt responders compared to non-responders. By utilizing these differences, {{we were able to}} correctly identify responders and non-responders to <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> with a positive predictive value of 80 % and a negative predictive value of 88 %.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} CSF {{dynamics in}} fourty patients of hydrocephalus by simultaneous In-SPECT and metrizamide-CT cisternography. These two methods produced apparently similar results. However, In-SPECT demonstrated more prolonged visualization of CSF flow and more precise three-dimensional CSF dynamics (especially in the convexity CSF flow) than metrizamide-CT. We classified {{the patterns of}} CSF dynamics into five types. In In-SPECT, type I was defined as normal CSF kinetics, type II subnormal CSF kinetics, and type V hydrocephalus. CSF <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> was necessary for type III ~ V and type II with severe clinical symptoms. Type II (except one case, they were classified as type HI by metrizamide-CT) were followed up and in two cases, CSF <b>shunt</b> <b>operation</b> was done because of clinical deterioration. Therefore, type II seemed to need carefull follow up. In-SPECT is useful for the estimation of CSF dynamics and for deciding the need for CSF <b>shunt</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R

When compared with a control group of 14 age matched healthy volunteers, the group of NPH patients was characterised by an enlarged subcortical low-flow region, significantly reduced rCBF and enhanced side-to-side asymmetry of rCBF in the central white matter, and enhanced side-to-side asymmetry in the inferior and mid-temporal cortex. Global CBF was normal. <b>Shunt</b> <b>operation</b> reduced the mean area of the ventricles on CT and of the subcortical low-flow region on SPECT. Global CBF was unchanged. All 14 patients had an abnormal pre-shunt rCBF pattern with enlargement of the subcortical low flow region, focal cortical blood flow deficits, or both. <b>Shunt</b> <b>operation</b> improved the clinical status in 11 patients, and {{the area of the}} subcortical low flow region correctly classified 3 / 3 unimproved and 10 / 11 improved patients. <b>Shunt</b> <b>operation</b> normalised or reduced the area of the subcortical low flow region in nine of 10 patients.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{configuration}} of the railway freight shunting locomotives, improve the efficiency of locomotive operation; a DEA cross evaluating method based on grey incidence analysis is presented in this paper. This method is based on collecting underlying data of factors that influence the <b>shunting</b> <b>operation</b> efficiency in train service depot, which utilizes grey incidence analysis to establish corresponding evaluation indicators system. Furthermore, the method as well adopts DEA and DEA cross efficiency model to analyze, evaluate and estimate the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> locomotives <b>operation</b> in train service depots. A sorting result of the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> locomotives <b>operation</b> in each train service depot has been acquired with help of programming using MATLAB 7. 0.

Eventually, based on a projection analysis of non-DEA's three decision-making units, key factors that influence the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> locomotives <b>operation</b> are identified, which can provide decision support for further improvement of the configuration and operation in train service depots...|$|R
