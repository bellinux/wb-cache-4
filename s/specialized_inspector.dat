Since that time important advances have been made. <b>Specialized</b> <b>inspectors,</b> occupational physicians, {{and other such}} personnel are now trained in Cuba. An Occupational Health Institute, founded in 1976, provides training and specialized technical services, and conducts research. In 1978, a far reaching "Work Safety and Health Law" was enacted which defines the rights and responsibility of government agencies, workplace administrators, unions, and workers. Comprehensive control of toxic substances in workplaces, still at an early stage, {{is likely to increase}} in light of the new law, the growing availability of qualified personnel, and the mounting concern of public health authorities with the increasingly "developed" health profile of the population...|$|R

50|$|The pre-purchase <b>inspector</b> <b>specializes</b> in gathering, evaluating, and {{interpreting}} {{results of a}} detailed automotive examination. The evaluator is usually a specialist in the vehicle type, such as personal automobiles or commercial heavy transports. They have professional training in the vehicle type's optimal safety, structural, and performance features. For commercial transports, evaluators should be qualified inspectors under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Part 396 or state laws. State inspection credentials may be required in some states. For personal non-commercial automobiles, evaluators should have both broad and deep automotive experience plus certified training from both car manufacturers and the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) Master Technician program. In California, evaluators should be certified by California Air Resources Board (CARB) and Bureau of Automotive Repairs (BAR). All evaluators should have detailed knowledge {{of state and federal}} regulations, safety recalls, service campaigns, and technical service bulletins (TSB). Evaluators should not be employees of the seller or in a position to profit from the results of the sale (see ethical considerations in this article).|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth of {{vehicles}} and traffic accidents caused by road pavement defects, road safety has become a pressing concern worldwide. For this reason, Countries and Federal States have started focusing their resources on the analysis of civil infrastructures to assess their safety and serviceability. The analyses are performed by <b>specialized</b> teams of <b>inspectors</b> and structural engineers who manually inspect road infrastructures and provide detailed reports about the detected pavement distresses and their magnitudes. This work aims at providing a new system able to detect the framed distress using solely the computational resources provided by a mobile device To reach this goal, an automatic pavement distress recognition system based on the OpenCV library is developed and embedded in a mobile application, enabling the recognition of three common pavement distresses: Pothole, Longitudinal-Transversal Cracks, and Fatigue Cracks. Our method, tested on several Android mobile platforms, is able recognize the pavement distresses of interest reaching more than 0. 7 of Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F-Measure. This application promises to improve the on-site work of inspectors by decreasing the time required to perform inspections while ensuring, at the same time, a higher level of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} {{strengthened}} food quality control in Vietnam by providing advice, guidance {{and training in}} the management and administration of food quality control and in inspection and laboratory activities, {{both of which are}} essential elements of an effective system. The project pointed out a number of deficiencies which need to be addressed by the Government such as a food control law and the designation of a principal agency {{to take the lead in}} administering a food control programme. The project also pointed out the need for <b>specialized</b> training of <b>inspectors,</b> and the need for new analytical equipment for the laboratories to bring them up to modern standards. Under the FAO project, a slide projector, photocopier and related training equipment were purchased for use in the training programmes. Certain chemical reagents and reference standards were also acquired for two of the regional laboratories. Of the many recommendations in the technical reports, three were considered to be the most important. First, the need for a comprehensive food control law with provisions for action against food not complying with its regulations. Second, the need to designate a single Government agency to administer the law and avoid the inefficiency of a system divided among many departments. Thirdly, the need to take immediate steps to provide specialized training in hygienic food practices and procedures for both inspectors and the food industry to improve the quality of food processed in Vietnam for both domestic consumption and export. Coupled with this training is the need to update the equipment in food laboratories to permit the kind of analyses of food exports which importing countries require as a condition of acceptance...|$|R

Après une revue de littérature faisant le point sur les dernières {{connaissances}} concernant le métier de préventionniste, nous élaborons un cadre théorique {{permettant de}}conceptualiser le travail de ces derniers. Les analyses du sondage permettent de faire état des principales caractéristiques du contexte de travail des préventionnistes. Nous décrivons ensuite leurs différents profils permettant de catégoriser leur travail en fonction de trois dimensions (organisationnelle, humaine et technique) et de deux niveaux d’intervention (stratégique et opérationnel). In this article, the term front-line safety practitioners {{refers to the}} various company members who regularly and directly intervene in the workplace with respect to health and safety within organizations. This definition covers both employer and worker representatives, {{whether or not they}} have undergone training recognized by an occupational health and safety agency. (Work <b>inspectors,</b> <b>specialized</b> consultants and physicians are here excluded from the category of front-line safety practitioners.) Today’s front-line safety practitioners working within companies must be adaptable because they face a constantly evolving work environment and increased complexity in their occupational health and safety work. We observe two concomitant phenomena within companies : {{an increase in the number}} of occupational health and safety interveners (foremen, engineers, managers, employees) and increased expertise in prevention. Although the safety practitioner presumably plays an essential role in this tension between generalization and specialization, little is known about its inherent functions and responsibilities. Based on the literature addressing safety practitioners’ work, their activities and the work sites where they operate, we have identified three major spheres where the activities identified in prevention can be linked. Preventive initiatives can be directed toward the human, technical and organizational dimensions of work. Moreover, the scope of safety practitioners’ activities spans different levels. Sometimes safety practitioners are directly involved in operational activities (e. g., risk inspection, correction of technical failures) whereas at other times they intervene on a much more strategic level (e. g., company policies, occupational health and safety management system). This article presents the results of a survey conducted among safety practitioners representing employers (n =  111) and safety practitioners representing employees (n =  134), with the objective of developing a better understanding of their respective roles and functions within the companies concerned. The analysis of these results provides a means by which to examine the work context of safety practitioners and highlight its main characteristics. The most significant conclusion that may be drawn from our study is that there is no one right way to conduct preventive interventions. On the contrary, a wide range of intervention strategies results from organizational conditions, interpersonal relations and the characteristic traits of safety practitioners themselves. Implementation of prevention measures is thus a complex issue that becomes incorporated into safety practitioners’ relations with the various company members. Based on the responses of employer and worker safety practitioners, we are also able to conclude that intervention priorities are not perceived in the same way. Employer-appointed safety practitioners give priority to the individual and his or her work behaviour and methods. Worker-appointed safety practitioners, however, adopt a more union-oriented view, assigning top priority to having management take action and to administering operational policies in occupational health and safety. The findings also show that work is to an extent divided up between the employers’ representatives, whose initiatives are primarily oriented toward the organizational level, and the employees’ representatives, whose actions are focused on the technical level. Upon closer analysis, we note that nearly one out of two employer-appointed safety practitioners (48. 6 %) regularly intervenes at the organizational level. A trend can be observed whereby the safety practitioner emerges as a member whose role as coach, rather than solely as an agent of prevention, becomes increasingly significant. Among safety practitioners named by workers, the intervention profile that stands out (44. 8 % of cases) is the one termed “technical/operational. ” As safety practitioners who operate in the field, they clearly possess and apply an expertise of their own, which most certainly enables them to conduct prevention interventions at the source of risks. Very few studies address what the work of safety practitioners actually entails. Our research provides a detailed portrait of the intervention practices and the roles of safety practitioners representing the employer and those representing workers. Este artículo presenta los resultados de una encuesta que se administró a prevencionistas representantes de empleadores (n =  111) y prevencionistas representantes de trabajadores (n =  134), con el objetivo de comprender sus respectivas funciones dentro de la empresa.
