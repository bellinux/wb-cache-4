5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller <b>size</b> <b>class</b> had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small <b>size</b> <b>class</b> with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger <b>size</b> <b>class,</b> representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large <b>size</b> <b>class</b> being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger <b>size</b> <b>class</b> preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller <b>size</b> <b>class</b> are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E

Tukey 2 Ì† 7 s HSD was used to determine the nature of the differences between the <b>class</b> <b>sizes.</b> ^ This study indicated that students that were enrolled in the large <b>class</b> <b>size</b> had a significant higher mean score in reading and mathematics than students enrolled in small <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> and a slightly higher mean score than students enrolled in medium <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> The only exception was in 6 th grade reading where there were no significant differences found in reading score means in small, medium or large <b>class</b> <b>sizes.</b> ^ The results also revealed that female students had significantly higher EOG test scores in small classes and only marginal higher scores in medium and large <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> The only exception was in 8 th grade mathematics where male students scored significantly higher in large <b>size</b> <b>classes,</b> but only slightly higher in medium and small <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Disaggregation of {{wild-type}} and Re chemotype lipopolysaccharides (LPS) {{has been}} accomplished by solubilization with triethylamine followed by stabilization with bovine serum albumin {{in order to determine}} the degree of aggregation. Solubilization with 1. 5 % triethylamine was found to be more effective than with lower concentrations, as judged by permeation chromatography. Chromatographic analysis of triethylamine-bovine serum albumin-disaggregated LPS showed a range of particle sizes. Wild-type LPS yielded <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of 1 X 10 (6) to 4 X 10 (6) daltons, 250, 000 daltons, and 20, 000 daltons.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 Flathead sole, Pacific halibut, rock sole, and {{yellowfin sole}} were found co-existing near Kodiak Island as juveniles (< 200 mm) during late summer. Dietary {{differences}} {{were attributed to}} fish species, size, and depth-sediment characteristics of their habitat. Two to three <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> were assigned within each species. Across all habitats, significant differences in dietary composition, stomach fullness, and diet diversity were found between <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of different flatfish species. Within a single depth-sediment habitat, flatfishes of different species and <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> ate similar prey. Seven of nine species <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> had similar prey composition across multiple habitats. Significant differences in dietary composition across habitats were detected only for small Pacific halibut and small rock sole.

40|$|ABSTRACT Savanna-forest {{transition}} under fire-exclusion {{could be}} explained by differential competitive performance of savanna and forest species under shading/fire-exclusion. Aiming to understand strategies related to either habitat affinity, we investigated spatial patterns of a savanna and a forest species in a fire-protected savanna. We predicted that: savanna species would have lower abundance than the forest species due to a restriction in the number of open microsites; segregation of <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> and a trend from clumping to regularity with size for forest species due to absence of microsite limitation and intra-specifc competition; and spatial association and increasing clustering with size for savanna species due to microsite limitation. To test these predictions, we described spatial patterns of plants in two <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> in three plots of 0. 5 ha. We analyzed spatial patterns and associations of <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> using SADIE methodology. Different from what we expected, both species were more abundant among the studied plots and exhibited an increasing aggregation from small to large <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> We also found a positive spatial association between <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of both. These results suggest that both savanna and forest species produce similar spatial patterns independently of habitat affinity. We discuss the possible processes responsible for the observed patterns...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 During eleven cruises {{conducted}} off the Oregon {{continental slope}} from April 1973 to March 1975, approximately 1600 specimens of the majid crab Chionoecetes tanneri Rathbun were collected.

40|$|When polysomes {{isolated}} from wheat (Triticum vulgare L., var.

Under these conditions, {{there is little}} or no reinitiation of polypeptides by ribosomes that have completed the elongation of in vivo initiated chains. The time course of labelling and the large size of the polypeptides synthesized suggest that most of the polypeptides are elongated to completion in the cell-free system. The <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of newly synthesized polypeptides thus reflect the <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of wheat leaf polysomal mRNA populations. In the protein synthesizing system reconstituted with wheat leaf polysomes and S 176 fraction from wheat germ, cydoheximide inhibits the elongation of certain <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of polypeptides.

2500|$|The widely {{variable}} diet of {{the species}} throughout its life stages led authors in the 1950s and 1960s to conclude the species was indiscriminate in its feeding habits, eating whatever was locally available. The diets of the populations in both the southern USA and Ghana also varied quite markedly by season and year, which led the authors of both these studies to agree with these earlier conclusions.
