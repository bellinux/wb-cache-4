30|$|Tropospheric {{scintillation}} intensity {{has been}} proven to increase with high carrier frequency, low elevation angle, and small receiving antenna. In general, <b>signal</b> <b>fade</b> caused by rain attenuation on communication signals is more significant compared to <b>signal</b> <b>fade</b> caused by tropospheric scintillation. However, considerations regarding tropospheric scintillation when designing the link budget become vital for low-fade-margin systems that operate at high frequency and low elevation angle (Mandeep et al. 2006). A satellite communication system that operates at a high frequency (> 10  GHz) and a low elevation angle (< 10 °) may experience more degradation from scintillation than from rain attenuation. Typically, satellite links above 10  GHz may suffer from tropospheric scintillation fluctuations of up to several decibels peak-to-peak with duration of the scintillation events, of a few seconds.|$|R

50|$|By 1935, the {{engineering}} staff of WGY {{began to make}} plans to replace the T top antenna system with a single vertical radiator {{in the form of}} a tower. At the time, the station was plagued with <b>signal</b> <b>fading</b> at a distance of 30-100 miles from the transmitter site due to cancellation by out of phase co-channel signals from the same source. The ideas for this tower were formed from experiments at WJZ in New York. From this, a square, one half wavelength (on 790 kHz), 625 foot tower was constructed in 1938. The one half wavelength design greatly reduced high angle radiation, thus solved the close in fading issues. This tower is still in use today.|$|E
50|$|The {{coherence}} {{time of the}} channel is related to a quantity known as the Doppler spread of the channel. When a user (or reflectors in its environment) is moving, the user's velocity causes {{a shift in the}} frequency of the signal transmitted along each signal path. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler shift. Signals traveling along different paths can have different Doppler shifts, corresponding to different rates of change in phase. The difference in Doppler shifts between different signal components contributing to a <b>signal</b> <b>fading</b> channel tap is known as the Doppler spread. Channels with a large Doppler spread have signal components that are each changing independently in phase over time. Since fading depends on whether signal components add constructively or destructively, such channels have a very short {{coherence time}}.|$|E

50|$|Choke ring antennas are {{notable for}} their ability to reject {{multipath}} <b>signals</b> <b>fading</b> from a source.

50|$|The Swedish Telecom Administration Board and its {{technical}} department, Televerket, {{had begun}} {{plans for an}} upgraded longwave transmitter to serve central Sweden {{as early as the}} 1940s. The original facility, located in central Motala, was both antiquated and poorly situated; the transmitter was inefficient and staff were needed on site to operate it day and night, and <b>signal</b> <b>fading</b> occurred as close as 80 kilometres away. After numerous studies it was determined that a site east of the town of Vadstena would provide a clear signal to the surrounding area. Construction began in 1958; engineer Folke Strandén designed a ring antenna system consisting of a central mast surrounded by five antennas, to be connected to two 300 kW Compagnie Français Thomson Houston (CFTH) transmitters. The station itself was built underground in a windowless concrete bunker with 1.5 metre thick walls designed to survive a Soviet air attack. The bunker would host the power supply, transmitters, transformers, and a V-12 diesel engine {{to be used as a}} backup generator. All cables leading to and from the facility were likewise buried underground.|$|E
50|$|Officially Class 3 radios have a {{range of}} up to 1 m, Class 2, most {{commonly}} found in mobile devices, 10 m, and Class 1, primarily for industrial use cases,100 m. Bluetooth Marketing qualifies that Class 1 range is in most cases 20-30 m, and Class 2 range 5 - 10 m.The effective range varies due to propagation conditions, material coverage, production sample variations, antenna configurations and battery conditions. Most Bluetooth applications are for indoor conditions, where attenuation of walls and <b>signal</b> <b>fading</b> due to signal reflections make the range far lower than specified line-of-sight ranges of the Bluetooth products. Most Bluetooth applications are battery powered Class 2 devices, with little difference in range whether {{the other end of the}} link is a Class 1 or Class 2 device as the lower powered device tends to set the range limit. In some cases the effective range of the data link can be extended when a Class 2 device is connecting to a Class 1 transceiver with both higher sensitivity and transmission power than a typical Class 2 device. Mostly, however, the Class 1 devices have a similar sensitivity to Class 2 devices. Connecting two Class 1 devices with both high sensitivity and high power can allow ranges far in excess of the typical 100m, depending on the throughput required by the application. Some such devices allow open field ranges of up to 1 km and beyond between two similar devices without exceeding legal emission limits.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>signal</b> <b>fading</b> in lithium formate electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) dosimeters used for clinical applications in radiotherapy. A new experimental method for determination of <b>signal</b> <b>fading,</b> designed to resolve small changes in signal from slowly decaying unstable radicals, was used. Possible <b>signal</b> <b>fading</b> in lithium formate due to different storage temperatures was also tested. Air humidity was kept at a constant level of 33 % throughout the experiments. The conclusion drawn from the investigations was that the EPR signal from lithium formate is stable during at least 1 month after irradiation and is not sensitive to variations in storage temperature andlt; 40 degrees C when kept at a relative air humidity of 33 %. This makes lithium formate a suitable dosimeter for transfer dosimetry in clinical audits. Funding Agencies|Swedish Cancer foundation (CF) | 100443 |FORSS| 86231 |</p...|$|E

5000|$|... 900 MHz {{cordless}} phones are still sold today {{and have a}} huge installed base. Features include even shorter antennas, up to 30 auto selecting channels, and higher resistance to interference. Available in several varieties; analog, analog spread spectrum (100 kHz bandwidth), digital, and digital spread spectrum, most being sold today are low-cost analog models, which are still susceptible to eavesdropping. Digital variants can still be scanned, but are received as a digital hiss and therefore are difficult to eavesdrop upon. Digital transmission is immune to static interference but can experience <b>signal</b> <b>fade</b> (brief silence) as the phone goes {{out of range of}} the base. Newer Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS) variants spread their signal over a range of frequencies, providing more resistance to <b>signal</b> <b>fade.</b> This technology enabled the digital information to spread in pieces among several frequencies between the receiver and the base, thereby making it almost impossible to eavesdrop on the cordless conversation. The FCC only allows DSS model phones to transmit at the full power of 1 watt, which allows increased range over older analog and digital models.|$|R
