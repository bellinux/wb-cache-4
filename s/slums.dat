5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's {{vision of a}} grand {{national}} capital had become marred by <b>slums</b> and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing <b>slums,</b> and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, 16 <b>slums</b> were {{identified}} in the town {{and a total of}} 34,029 people resided in the <b>slums.</b> The slum population increased from 42% to 47% during the period of 1991–2001. The high decadal growth of population during the 1961–71 period is attributed to the high level of industrialisation during the period. The density of population increased from 9,646 persons per km2 in 1991 to 10,613 persons per km2 in 2001. The wards along the Virudhunagar, Sattur, Srivilliputhur and Vembakottai corridors have registered increased commercial and residential activity.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the role of <b>slum</b> upgrading, {{political}} culture, power structure and how these factors affect participation in <b>slum</b> upgrading in Makoko, Lagos. It also investigates how community-based institutions participate in identification of <b>slum</b> challenges, design action plans on curbing the challenges, implementation and monitoring of the plans in Lagos state. Factors that affect the successful implementation or hinder the implementation of participatory processes in <b>slum</b> upgrading effort in Lagos state have also been investigated; this was done in order to explore how implementation {{or the lack of}} implementation in the Makoko case relates to existing theories of power structure and political culture factors in participatory <b>slum</b> upgrading. Furthermore, ways of improving participatory approaches to <b>slum</b> upgrading practices have been identified as a way of promoting sustainable practice in subsequent <b>slum</b> upgrade efforts in Lagos. Literature was reviewed with regard to participation in <b>slum</b> upgrading. This was followed by a review of theories of participation, and a discussion of factors that hinder effective participation in <b>slum</b> upgrading process. The single case study research strategy was adopted, in which the researcher interviewed some members of Makoko Community Development Association, community leaders and youths in Makoko community. The data revealed that participation in Makoko <b>slum</b> upgrading took two dimensions. A participatory approach was not adopted in projects initiated by the government. However, there was participation in a project initiated by international organizations. The data also show that power structures, political culture and lack of skills hindered participation. This is consistent with existing theory which argues that political culture, power structure, and skill factors hinder effective participation in <b>slum</b> upgrading. Meanwhile, international organizations’commitments to participatory approach in <b>slum</b> upgrading enhance participation. It was therefore suggested that to improve participatory approaches in future <b>slum</b> upgrading efforts in Lagos, the government must design state laws that will encourage the adoption of participatory approach in <b>slum</b> upgrading by government officials. While international organizations should encourage those who implement participatory approach to <b>slum</b> upgrading...|$|R
