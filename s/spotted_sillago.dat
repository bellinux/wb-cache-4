25|$|The King George whiting, Sillaginodes punctatus (also {{known as}} the spotted whiting or <b>spotted</b> <b>sillago),</b> is a coastal marine fish of the smelt-whitings family Sillaginidae. The King George whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the south coast of the country from Jurien Bay, Western Australia to Botany Bay, New South Wales in the east. The King George whiting is {{the only member of}} the genus Sillaginodes and the largest member of the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae, growing to a length of 72cm and 4.8kg in weight. The species is readily {{distinguishable}} from other Australian whitings by its unique pattern of spots, as well as its highly elongate shape. King George whiting are often found in bays and protected waterways over sand and seagrass beds, also venturing out onto deep continental shelf reefs during adulthood. The species is a benthic carnivore, consuming a variety of crustaceans, polychaete worms, molluscs and fish. The King George whiting forms the basis of one of southern Australia's most important commercial fisheries, reportedly worth over five million Australian dollars per year. The species is also heavily targeted by recreational anglers, who value the whiting for its sporting and eating qualities.|$|E
40|$|Extract] The Queensland Finfish (Stout Whiting) Trawl Fishery (FTF) is a {{demersal}} {{otter trawl}} fishery. The FTF {{is permitted to}} target stout whiting (Sillago robusta) and red <b>spot</b> whiting (<b>Sillago</b> flindersi) and retain other permitted by-product species off southern Queensland, from Sandy Cape south to Caloundra (see Figure 1). Stout whiting also constitute a proportion of the bycatch from the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery (ECOTF) and a proportion of retained catch in the New South Wales Ocean Prawn Trawl Fishery (NSW OPTF). There are a range of legislative and voluntary management arrangements {{in place for the}} fishery, with high levels of licence holder involvement in the management and monitoring processes. This report covers the fishing period from April to December 2006...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to a shift towards directed targeting of whiting, Sillago spp. by some penaeid trawlers in coastal waters off New South Wales, Australia, 3 experiments were done {{to examine the effects}} on the size and species selectivity of trawls associated with (i) a 40 % increase in mesh size used in the body, (ii) altering the configuration of mesh in the codend, and (iii) a separating grid in the extension section. Each experiment involved paired comparisons between conventional and modified gears during normal commercial fishing operations. The results showed that increasing mesh size in the trawl body from 45 to 63 mm had no effect on any catches and, while the grid has the potential to improve species selection by excluding macrofauna, further refinement and testing are required to minimize the escape of commercial sized whiting. Changing the orientation of mesh in the codend from diamond- (40 mm mesh opening) to square-shaped (41 mm mesh, hung on the bar) had a highly significant effect on the size selection of red <b>spot</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> flindersi: reducing the catches of small, unwanted individuals (< 17 cm total length) by up to 99 %, with minimal impact on the retention of larger, commercial sized individuals. We conclude that the use of square-mesh codends (with a bar length approaching 20 mm) by trawlers targeting whiting is an appropriate management tool for minimizing the fishing mortality of juvenile and maturing conspecifics...|$|R
