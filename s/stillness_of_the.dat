40|$|Movement and stillness are broad {{concepts}} that intersect different philosophical ideas, and connections between daily life, art and perception. This practice-led research project investigates movement in dance, movement in <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> sculpture, and <b>the</b> physical and corporeal act of painting {{to question the}} distinction between movement and stillness. Perceptual ambiguity and stillness in painting are explored to reveal <b>the</b> passing <b>of</b> time and movement felt in daily life. Images, conceptual movements and emotion are juxtaposed to create a dynamic spatial intervention, expressing personal aesthetic visions about physical and psychological space and time. This is to propose that <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> contemplation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surroundings constitutes space, and that engaging with space consequently becomes a temporal activity...|$|R
2500|$|Ranney enjoyed duck hunting, {{which is}} {{reflected}} {{in some of his}} paintings on that theme, which are noted for their solidly constructed, almost sculpture-like figures. His most popular and requested work is his 1850 painting On the Wing, which portrays a sportsman with dead game at his feet, about to shoot down his next target. Ranney produced at least four different versions of this print, the most recognized of which was reserved for the Butler Institute of American Art. It was published in the gift book Ornaments of Memory in 1856 and 1857. This version is set in a more windblown environment, noted for the contrast generated with the <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human figures within it. The portrayal of the outdoorsman in On the Wing contributed to the era's nationalistic imagery. Mark Thistelthwaite of the Butler Institute, describes this piece as: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reservoir}} formed behind Black Eagle Dam has {{no official}} name. [...] However, {{due to the}} slow current, <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, and low incline of {{the water from the}} upriver town of Cascade to Black Eagle Falls (a distance of about [...] along the winding Missouri River), this body of water has long been known as the [...] "Long Pool." [...] Thomas P. Roberts, who named Black Eagle Falls, gave this body of water its name in 1872. The United States Army Corps of Engineers referred to it by this name beginning at least as early as 1883, and as recently as 1910. The Montana Legislature has used the name, and the name was in popular use as early as 1891 and as late as 1917. Modern historians have referred to it as such, and it was in use by power industry publications as late as 1949.

2500|$|Kate (1844–1924) was {{the first}} of the Terry {{children}} to make the family name famous on the English stage, beginning her career as a small child. According to the academic Nina Auerbach, Kate may have been the most accomplished actor among her siblings, quickly gaining praise in the plays of Shakespeare, among others. Contemporary critics thought the same: The Manchester Guardian ended its report of her last performance before her retirement: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with the memory of the peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting ... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing the <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." [...] She gave up acting when she married the businessman Arthur James Lewis (1824–1901) in 1867 when she was 23. She made only two later stage appearances, the first in 1898, in a small role supporting her daughter Mabel in a new play in the West End; the second was in 1906 at her sister Ellen's jubilee celebrations at Drury Lane. Of her four children, all daughters, only the youngest, Mabel, followed her into the theatrical profession. The two middle daughters were Janet and Lucy. Kate's eldest daughter, also named Kate, married Frank Gielgud; their four children included Val and John Gielgud.|$|E
