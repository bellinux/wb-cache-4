The result of the study revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} (P> 0. 05) in the yield of the Tofu (17. 5 – 18. 3 %), however alum coagulation gave the highest yield, while Calcium chloride gave the lowest yield. The protein (17. 6 %), fat (6. 2 %), Mn (0. 3), Mg (34. 2), energy (6. 6 cal/g) and in vitro multienzyme protein digestibility (75. 8 - 77. 6 %) of <b>steep</b> <b>water</b> coagulated tofu was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) Fe (1. 6), Ca (23. 5), K (33. 9) and Na (21. 1) than the tofu produced by other coagulants.

40|$|The {{effective}} hydration {{of barley}} {{is essential for}} the production of malt suitable for use in brewing and distilling. Therefore the focus of this study is on the uptake of water during steeping of barley with a view to shortening steeps and reducing water use. As an additional way of reducing water consumption at malting plants, efforts are being made to find appropriate treatments so that <b>steep</b> <b>water</b> can be recycled. The aim of our research is to minimise the volume of water required for steeping, maximise the potential to recycle <b>steep</b> <b>water</b> and also minimise the length of steeping time. Bryce et al. (2010) showed that when barley was steeped in water continuously for either 8 h or 16 h, hydration of endosperm materials was suboptimal and modification of endosperm materials of barley malt was inadequate. The malt produced under these steeping regimes gave poor friability scores and produced a large number of whole grains. When barley was steeped for 24 h on a continuous basis, or when a regimented standard steeping method was used, the malt produced gave higher friability scores and a much lower number of whole grains. This suggests that a very short steep, essentially a washing of barley, followed by a single steep should be able to produce excellent malt...|$|E

Although PCOOH(aq) is a very weak base (pK_(BH+) < − 3), PCOOH(g) is converted to PC(OH) _ 2 ^+ on pH < 4 water via a process that ostensibly retains some of the exoergicity of its gas-phase counterpart, PCOOH + H_ 3 O^+ = PC(OH) _ 2 ^+ + H_ 2 O, ΔG < − 22 kcal mol^(− 1). The large kinetic isotope effects observed on H_ 2 O/D_ 2 O microjets, PC(OH) _ 2 ^+/PC(OH) OD^+ = 88 and PC(OH) OD^+/PC(OD) _ 2 ^+ = 156 at pD = 2, and their inverse dependences on pH indicate that PCOOH(g) hydronation on water (1) involves tunneling, (2) is faster than H-isotope exchange, and (3) is progressively confined to the outermost layers as water becomes more acidic.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the recent {{development of a}} second generation of numerical methods for the modelling of hydrodynamic forces and large motions induced on partly submerged floating bodies by <b>steep</b> <b>water</b> waves. The methods are based om the potential flow hypothesis and include a direct numerical solution of the resulting non-linear boundary value problem in the time domain for the unknown fluid velocity potential. The equation is solved in a fluid domain bounded by the free surface of the fluid in its instantaneous configuration, the instantaneous wetted surface of the floating body, and a bottom. The boundary value problem is solved numerically using boundary element techniques. In the examples presented in the paper both zero order (constant source density) and first order (linearly varying source density) Rankine source boundary elements are applied. The evolution of the free surface is formulated in both Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. The numerical models are applied to simulate two-dimensional propagation of linear and non-linear waves through the control fluid domain, and the interaction of such waves with fixed bodies. The accuracy, stability and convergence of the solutions are throughly investigated, including the satisfaction of mass and energy conservation principles. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Barley is a {{valuable}} cereal with an old tradition in malt, food and feed. With new food applications this cereal can be rediscovered. Addition of a malting step in a food process can change the texture and taste of a product. It is also a process with high potential for improvement of nutrient availability. Extractable cell-wall polysaccharides {{have been linked to}} some positive health effects in humans. In cereals, these polysaccharides are mainly beta-glucan and arabinoxylan. The structure of extractable arabinoxylan and the content of bound ferulic acid dimers were studied in different cereals. For determination of amount and molecular weight of beta-glucan a high performance size-exclusion chromatography system (HPSEC) was set up with detection based on the specific binding of Calcofluor to β-glucan. This system was calibrated using a purified β-glucan fractionated into known narrow molecular weight ranges. A naked and a covered barley steeped and germinated at different temperatures and with different additions in the <b>steeping</b> <b>water</b> were studied. The total content and the average molecular weight of beta-glucan in the treated samples showed small changes after steeping at high temperature (48 °C), while steeping at lower temperature (15 °C) gave a significantly lower content. This was correlated with a strong increase of beta-glucanase activity over the time of germination. Addition of lactic acid to the <b>steeping</b> <b>water</b> at 48 °C decreased the beta-glucanase activity.
