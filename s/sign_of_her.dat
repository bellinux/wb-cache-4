5|$|Five years later, Bian Koen and Roosminah {{live with}} their two {{children}} at the plantation Aij Tjeng used to manage. While Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio are visiting, their granddaughter Elsy (guided by Marsiti's spirit) brings them flowers from a tree Marsiti had planted. The family {{take it as a}} <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> love.|$|E
5|$|Connections with Francia {{went beyond}} {{trade and the}} royal marriages Æthelberht and Eadbald made with Frankish princesses. Eadbald's granddaughter, Eorcengota, became a nun at Faremoutiers, and his great-granddaughter, Mildrith, was a nun at Chelles. When Edwin was killed in about 632, Æthelburg, escorted by Paulinus, fled by sea to Eadbald's court in Kent, but in a further <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family's ties across the channel she sent her {{children}} {{to the court of}} King Dagobert I of the Franks, to keep them safe from the intrigues of Eadbald and Oswald of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, {{with the proviso}} that it be not carried out until she gave her approval. As there was no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> doing so, Burghley, Leicester, {{and a handful of other}} privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E

5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|When Victoria {{ascended the}} throne in 1837, Lehzen enjoyed a {{prominent}} {{position at the}} coronation, and remained at court. Lehzen was installed at Buckingham Palace {{as a sort of}} unofficial private secretary, served as chief liaison for the royal residences, and carried the household keys as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> position; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen's bills, for instance. At this point, it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria's mother both in terms of influence and affection; Lehzen's apartments adjoined the queen's, while the Duchess of Kent was installed in a suite of rooms far removed from Victoria's. For {{the first few years of}} Victoria's reign, especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen's outlook on both politics and personal matters, despite the fact that she did not overtly involve herself in state affairs. Even after the queen's marriage, Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom, a source of displeasure for Albert.|$|E
25|$|In {{one version}} of the myth, Pallas was the {{daughter}} of the sea-god Triton; she and Athena were childhood friends, but Athena accidentally killed her during a friendly sparring match. Distraught over what she had done, Athena took the name Pallas for herself as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grief.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{police investigation}} had explored {{the possibility of}} a contract killing, but since Dando was living with her fiancé and was only rarely visiting her Gowan Avenue house, it was considered unlikely that a professional assassin would have been sufficiently well informed about Dando's movements to have known at what time {{she was going to be}} there. CCTV evidence of Dando's last journey (mainly security video recordings from a shopping centre in Hammersmith, which she visited on her way to Fulham) did not show any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> being followed.|$|E
25|$|She did {{not involve}} herself in English politics, instead she kept up an active {{interest}} in her native country. Anxious to re-establish {{good relations with the}} Pope and perhaps gain recognition for Portuguese independence, she sent Richard Bellings, later her principal secretary, to Rome with letters for the pope and several cardinals. In 1669 she involved herself in the relief of Candia in Crete, which was under siege by the Turks and whose cause Rome was promoting, although she failed to persuade her husband to take any action. In 1670, as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rising favour with the pontiff she requested, and was granted, devotional objects.|$|E
25|$|Many of Muhammad's companions {{asked for}} Fatimah's hand in marriage, {{including}} Abu Bakr and Umar. Muhammad turned them all down, {{saying that he}} was awaiting a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> destiny. Ali, Muhammad's cousin, also had a desire to marry Fatimah. When he went to see Muhammad, he could not vocalise his intention but remained silent. Muhammad understood the reason for his being there and prompted Ali to confirm that he had come to seek Fatimah in marriage. He suggested that Ali had a shield, which if sold, would provide sufficient money to pay the bridal gift (mahr). Muhammad put forward the proposal from Ali to Fatimah, who remained silent and did not reject the proposal like the previous ones. Muhammad took this to be a sign of affirmation and consent.|$|E

25|$|Later in the epic, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh {{the story}} of the Great Flood, which was sent by the god Enlil to annihilate all life on earth because the humans, who were vastly overpopulated, made too much noise and {{prevented}} him from sleeping. Utnapishtim tells how, when the flood came, Ishtar wept and mourned over the destruction of humanity, alongside the Anunnaki. Later, after the flood subsides, Utnapishtim makes an offering to the gods. Ishtar appears to Utnapishtim wearing a lapis lazuli necklace with beads shaped like flies and tells him that Enlil never discussed the flood with any of the other gods. She swears him that she will never allow Enlil to cause another flood and declares her lapis lazuli necklace a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> oath. Ishtar invites all the gods except for Enlil to gather around the offering and enjoy.|$|E
25|$|Blue Mary {{has been}} well {{received}} by gamers, having appeared in several popularity polls from video game journals. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, her character was voted as the fifteenth favorite {{with a total of}} 857 votes. To decide what character should appear in The King of Fighters '97 as part of the Special Team, three video game journals: Gamest, Famitsu and Neo Geo Freak also made popularity polls. Blue Mary was first in the poll from Gamest. For the special endings in The King of Fighters '97, the three journals had to create a team composed of three characters from the game so that they would be featured in an image after completion of the Arcade Mode; the Gamest employees created a team composed of Terry Bogard, Blue Mary and Joe. This special ending only appears in Japanese versions of the game. A <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> popularity was the Blue Mary action figure released by SNK Playmore, depicted in her original outfit.|$|E
500|$|Her {{disappearance}} [...] "touched off {{an intensive}} {{search for a}} kidnapper or murderer" [...] according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. It was called [...] "the largest search in South Jersey." [...] Hundreds of volunteers and police searched the city. On the first night more than 200 civilians did a foot-by-foot search. Eventually well over a thousand people were involved. Her fourth birthday came and went with no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1892, the Munshi's name {{began to}} appear in the Court Circular among the names of {{officials}} accompanying the Queen on her annual March trip to the French Riviera. As usual, Victoria spent Christmas 1892 at Osborne House, where the Munshi, as he had in previous years, participated in tableaux vivants arranged as entertainment. The following year, during Victoria's annual holiday in continental Europe, he was presented to King Umberto I of Italy. In the words of a contemporary newspaper account, [...] "The King did not understand why this magnificent and imposing Hindoo should have been formally presented to him. The popular idea in Italy is that the Munshi is a captive Indian prince, who is taken about by the Queen as an outward and visible <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty's supremacy in the East." ...|$|E
500|$|Black {{traces the}} woman's {{fingerprints}} through a Millennium Group database, finding {{they belong to}} a Tamara Shui Fa Lee, who disappeared at sea near Hong Kong ten years prior—and who Black believes is now dead. Black visits [...] "Lee" [...] at the hospital, where she speaks to him in perfect English, discussing personal events from his life of which she would have no knowledge. As he drives home, he sees her {{on the side of}} the highway and stops to investigate; however, he finds no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and returns home, where he shares an intimate dinner with Catherine and Jordan, later retiring to bed with Catherine—despite their estrangement. Black gradually notices more differences from how his life had been, realizing he has never been a member of the Millennium Group and founded a private investigation firm after leaving the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Returning home again one day, he sees a demon holding Jordan's lifeless body.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of January, zoo keepers noticed that Vilma appeared nervous; she was seen agitatedly scratching at her feedbox, {{and there was no}} further <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cubs. [...] It is believed that she devoured them. [...] When asked for a reason, Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke stated that they could have been ill, a circumstance under which polar bears in the wild often eat their young. [...] The zoo quickly faced harsh criticism throughout Germany and from the worldwide media for appearing to allow the cubs' death. [...] The director of the German Animal Protection Society said the zoo had acted irresponsibly and that [...] "it was the ethical responsibility of the management to give the polar bear cubs a chance of life. Using the argument 'That's Nature' as an excuse for intervening far too late is cynical and inappropriate." [...] Angry visitors gathered in front of the polar bear enclosure and shouted [...] "Rabenmutter" [...] (literally, [...] "raven mother", meaning [...] "evil mother") every time Vilma appeared.|$|E

50|$|His second {{daughter}} Lin Taiyi (林太乙; 1926-2003) {{was also}} known as Anor Lin in her earliest writing, and had the Chinese name Yu-ju 玉如. She was an author and the general editor of Chinese Reader's Digest from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. She also wrote a biography <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father in Chinese (林語堂傳), which shows some <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's literary flair.|$|R

The search for archaeological evidence had been prompted by surviving contemporary documentary accounts of cannibalism during the colony's [...] "starving time" [...] winter of 1609-1610.|$|R
500|$|The {{question}} of Adeline's virtue is similarly complicated. Although she is forgiving {{to the point}} of absurdity, she is often considered more of a dupe than a martyr. Some have compared her to Balzac's title character in Le Père Goriot, who sacrifices himself for his daughters. As Bellos puts it: [...] "Adeline's complicity with Hector certainly makes her more interesting as a literary character, but it undermines her role as the symbol of virtue in the novel." [...] This complicity reaches an apex when she unsuccessfully attempts to sell her affections to Crevel (who has since lost interest) in order to repay her husband's debts. Her flirtation with prostitution is sometimes considered more egregious than Valérie's overt extortion, since Adeline is soiling her own dignity in the service of Baron Hulot's infidelity. For the remainder of the novel, Adeline trembles uncontrollably, a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> weakness. Later, when she visits the singer Josépha (on whom her husband once doted), Adeline is struck by the splendor earned by a life of materialistic seduction. She wonders aloud if she is capable of providing the carnal pleasures Hulot seeks outside of their home.|$|E
2500|$|Images of {{the goddess}} show her enthroned, clad in chiton and mantle. On her left arm she holds a cornucopia, a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{abundant}} generosity and fruitfulness. In her right hand, she holds a bowl, which feeds a serpent coiled around her right arm: a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> healing and regenerative powers. This combination of snake and cornucopia are unique to Bona Dea. The literary record offers at least one variation on this type; Macrobius describes her cult statue as overhung by a [...] "spreading vine", and bearing a sceptre in her left hand.|$|E
