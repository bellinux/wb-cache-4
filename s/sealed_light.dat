When one of these gains a degree of industry acceptance, it begins to bridge a legal gap between what is state of the art from a design standpoint, and what is state of the art from a usage standpoint. This could place a carrier in a vulnerable position in the not too distant future.|$|R

5000|$|In stage <b>lighting,</b> <b>sealed</b> beam lamps {{are often}} used. A common size, {{also used in}} rock concerts, as well as outdoor {{architectural}} lighting, is the parabolic aluminized reflector 64 (PAR64). PAR64 sealed beam lamps are typically available with 250, 500 or 1000 watt power ratings. The fixtures that such <b>sealed</b> beam <b>lights</b> go into are called [...] "PAR cans".

50|$|Attempting {{to control}} the cluster fly by {{controlling}} their earthworm host is not recommended or effective since flies may originate {{from more than a}} mile away from the infestation site. Once Pollenia rudis enters a home, {{it is almost impossible to}} kill enough of the flies to fully eradicate them. In order to prevent cluster flies from entering a house, all exterior cracks and openings should be caulked or sealed. This includes (<b>sealing)</b> <b>light</b> fixtures, electrical outlets, windows, and baseboards. Persistent use of insecticides has also been shown to reduce fly numbers if sprayed on the exterior of a home. However, these methods are not guaranteed for preventing infestations. When cluster flies do invade the home, they are extremely difficult to exterminate. Trying to kill the flies with a fly swatter leads to greasy spots on walls and upholstery as well as a lingering smell of buckwheat honey. Once spring arrives the flies will try to leave on their own in order to lay eggs, but many times they enter other living areas of the home instead. Vacuum cleaners and aerosol insecticides may be used to control visible, sluggish flies, but professional extermination is the most reliable method for eliminating an infestation.|$|R

50|$|Bioglass 8625 has a {{significant}} content of iron, which provides infrared light absorption and allows <b>sealing</b> by a <b>light</b> source, e.g. a Nd:YAG laser or a mercury-vapor lamp. The content of Fe2O3 yields high absorption with maximum at 1100 nm, and gives the glass a green tint. The use of infrared radiation instead of flame or contact heating helps preventing contamination of the device.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 3 Over the years, close {{attention}} has been paid in process facilities to the pumping of light hydrocarbons. Leakage of these products can and do cause environmental and health threatening situations. Since {{attention has been}} paid in the past, and at the present time, legislation has been passed to limit production emissions. Even more stringent regional and national limits are being debated that could have far reaching effects in the refining and petrochemical industries. The problems of viable mechanical <b>seal</b> designs for <b>light</b> hydrocarbons are addressed. Effective types of <b>seals</b> used on <b>light</b> hydrocarbon duties are outlined. The advantages and disadvantages of using single, tandem, and double seal designs on these duties will be discussed. The criteria set up by the Environmental Protection Agency and the South Coast Air Quality Management District can be a researcher?s nightmare, but herein, these guidelines, and how they apply to the mechanical sealing industry, are addressed. How the different types of seals; single, tandem and double do or do not meet EPA and SCAQMD limits are addressed...|$|R

This can affect the camera's resale value. The command dial is also prone to detachment from the electronic part of the dial, and many used EOS 100s are rendered unusable from this manufacturing flaw.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} years of World War II, German U-boats often escaped attack by {{aircraft}} because they spotted the aircraft while it was still far away as a black dot in the sky, no matter what camouflage colors were used. To solve this problem, in 1943 the U.S. Navy, following the Canadian diffused lighting camouflage trials on warships, conducted secret experiments on counter-illumination in the Yehudi <b>lights</b> project. <b>Sealed</b> beam <b>lights</b> were mounted on {{the leading edge of the}} wing of a Grumman TBM-3D Avenger, and around its engine cowling, with the lamps facing forward. The intensity of the lamps was adjusted to match the background sky as seen from an observer in a surface ship. Aircraft with Yehudi lights were not detected until [...] away under conditions where aircraft without the lights were detected [...] away.
