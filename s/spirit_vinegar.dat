The aim of {{the present}} study was to search for a rapid and {{reliable}} method to enumerate viable acetic acid bacteria (AAB) and to identify to genera and species level AAB isolates from vinegars in full acetic fermentation elaborated by the submerged method from cider, wine and spirit ethanol in industrial bioreactors. Results showed that the rapid epifluorescence staining method using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit and direct counts in Neubauer chamber rendered consistent and reliable data for viable cell counts of bacteria in all the studied vinegars. A linear correlation was shown between viable cell counts and fermentation rates. The highest fermentation rates and viable cell counts were found in cider <b>vinegars,</b> whereas <b>spirit</b> <b>vinegars</b> showed the lowest values for both parameters. Eighty-four AAB pure isolates were recovered from 41 different vinegar samples and were submitted to DNA extraction. PCR amplification of the 16 S– 23 S intergenic spacer region of rDNA and subsequent sequencing were carried out to identify isolates to species level. Results showed that Gluconacetobacter europaeus was the predominant cultivable species, appearing in 79 % of the total isolates. This was the unique species found in <b>spirit</b> <b>vinegars,</b> and this is the first time that AAB from <b>spirit</b> <b>vinegars</b> are taxonomically identified. Ga. europaeus was as well the predominant cultivable species in white wine vinegars. Cider vinegars presented the highest variability of species: Ga. europaeus (35. 3 % appearance among cultivable isolates), Ga. xylinus (35. 3 %), Acetobacter pasteurianus (17. 6 %) and Ga. hansenii (11. 8 %). Red wine vinegars showed cultivable isolates of the species Ga. xylinus (71. 4 %) and Ga. europaeus (28. 6 %). Summarising, both described methods for AAB enumeration and taxonomical identification proved to be fast and reliable methods, and results revealed Ga. europaeus as the cultivable major species in vinegars in full fermentation conducted by the submerged method, suggesting that Ga. europaeus strains can constitute excellent starter cultures for the elaboration of vinegars by the submerged method. his work was supported by grant OTEM 070621 by the company Vinagrerías Riojanas S.

40|$|International audienceOutbreaks of the corallivorous crown-of-thorns seastar Acanthaster planci (COTS) {{represent}} one of {{the greatest}} disturbances to coral reef ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific, affecting not only coral reefs but also the coastal communities which rely on their resources. While injection approaches are increasingly used in an attempt to control COTS densities, most of them display severe drawbacks including logistical challenges, high residual environmental impacts or low cost-effectiveness. We tested a new alternative control method based upon acidic injections of cheap, 100 % natural products. We investigated the lethal doses, intra-and inter-specific disease transmission and immune responses of COTS when injected with fresh lime juice (extracted from local Citrus arantifolia) and white <b>spirit</b> <b>vinegar.</b> High COTS mortality was achieved with small volumes: 10 – 20 ml per seastar induced death in 89 %/ 97 % of injected specimens after an average 34. 3 h/ 29. 8 h for lime juice and vinegar respectively. Highest efficiency was reached for both solutions with double shots of (2 × 10 ml) in two different areas on the body: 100 % mortality occurred within 12 – 24 h, which is similar or faster compared with other current injection methods. Multiple immune measures suggested that death was very likely caused by pH stress from the acidic solutions rather than a bacterial infection. Contagion to either conspecifics or a variety of other reef species was not observed, even at COTS densities 15 times higher than the highest naturally reported. 10 to 20 l lime juice/vinegar could kill up to a thousand COTS at a cost of less than 0. 05 USD per specimen; no permits or special handling procedures are required. We conclude that injections of lime juice and vinegar offer great advantages when compared to current best practises and constitute a cheap and natural option for all reefs affected by COTS...|$|E

40|$|The {{story of}} {{microbial}} biotransformation is {{closely associated with}} vinegar production, which dates back to around 2000 years BC. However, among fermented foods, vinegar has been always considered a “poor” component: {{it is not a}} “food”, it doesn’t have high nutritional values, and it is produced by transformation of other more nutritive rich fermented foods. Vinegar is a condiment, but also a preservative and, in some countries, a healthy drink. It can be made by a two step fermentation of yeasts followed by acetic acid bacteria from almost any fermentable carbohydrate source: apples, pears, grapes, honey, syrups, cereals, hydrolysed starches, beer, and wine are all ideal substrates for the production of vinegar. Since vinegars is, with few exceptions, an inexpensive commodity, its production requires a low-cost raw material, such as sub-standard fruits, seasonal agricultural surpluses, various food processing by-products and fruit waste. However there are <b>vinegars,</b> so called <b>spirit</b> <b>vinegars,</b> obtained directly by acetic oxidation of alcohol obtained from distillation of fermented mashes or, in some countries, petrolchemical ethanol. Some western by-products of wood carbonization obtained by distillation of pyroligneous liquor collected during wood pyrolisis, are called “vinegar” and they are used as agricultural material, animal health product, cosmetic ingredients and folk drug in Japan and Est-Asia (Mu et al., 2003; Mu et al., 2006). These distilled solutions have not be considered as vinegar because no fermentative process occurs in their production. Other specialty vinegars are grouped as herbal or fruit vinegars. In this cases the name “X vinegar” doesn’t indicate the raw materials used in vinegar fermentation but the flavours added to obtain specific taste and characteristic sensorial features. Herbal vinegars consist of wine vinegars or white distilled vinegars, which may be seasoned with garlic, basil, tarragon, cinnamon, clove, or nutmeg. Fruit-flavoured vinegars are wine and white vinegars sweetened with fruit or fruit juice to produce a characteristic sweet-sour taste. Traditional vinegars are very expensive vinegar produced from regional foods according to well-established customs: balsamic vinegar of Modena from Italy; Sherry vinegar from Spain; Champagne vinegar from France etc. According to international definition of vinegar, in this book we considered only vinegar derived from a two stage fermentation process. However with many of the vinegars in Africa, Asia and Latin America, knowledge of the processes involved is poor and a comprehensive view of all different kinds of vinegars is impossible. Therefore {{it is likely that the}} worldspread vinegars give a very greater picture. Economy, technology and law about vinegar were described in this chapter...|$|R

The authors have recently worked on converting such biomass into middle heating-value gas via dual fluidized bed gasification (DFBG) integrated with various process intensification technologies. This article is devoted to highlighting those technical ways, including the choice of the superior technical deployment for a DFBG system, the impregnation of Ca onto fuel in fuel drying, the integration of gas cleaning with fuel gasification via two-stage DFBG (T-DFBG), and the decoupling of fuel drying/pyrolysis and char gasification via the decoupled DFBG (D-DFBG). The attained results demonstrated that the superior deployment of bed combination for the DFBG should be a bubbling/turbulent fluidized bed gasifier integrated with a pneumatic riser combustor. In terms of improving efficiency of fuel conversion into combustible gas and suppressing tar generation during gasification, the impregnation of Ca onto fuel exhibited distinctively high upgrading effect, while both the T-DFBG and D-DFBG were also demonstrated to be effective to a certain degree.

The Taiwan indica rice (Taichung-sen 10, TCS 10), japonica rice (Tainan 11, TN 11) and imported Thai rice used as materials for producing moromi vinegar. The rice was steeped for 12 hours, steamed and cooled, subsequently. 1 % Aspergillus awamori was inoculated and mixed to the cooked material and incubated with proper aeration at 30 ℃, 95 %RH for 2 days. The aspergillus koji was mixed with equal rice, 1 % Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast and 1. 7 times water for fermentation. The alcohol concentration achieved 12 - 13 % after 14 days therefore {{proceed to the}} distillation process. The distilled residues was squeezed and filtered to obtain the moromi vinegar. The analytical results show the citric acid and total amino acids contents of the moromi vinegar are similar regardless the different materials. Small scale hedonic evaluation shows the Taiwanese tester preferred the moromi vinegar brewed in this study rather than the Japanese commercial moromi vinegar. The sensory results suggest the potential that use Taiwanese rice TCS 10 and TN 11 to replace Thai rice for brewing moromi vinegar. The future development of acid beverage with nutritional supplementary function {{can be expected to}} participate on the diversely utilization of domestic agriculture of Taiwan. 泡盛是日本琉球所生產的特色米穀蒸餾酒，依古法必須採用泰國米、黑麴菌及酵母發酵以單式蒸餾方式製成。而黑麴醪醋是泡盛釀造過程中的酒醪經過壓榨、過濾的天然副產物，主要成分為檸檬酸及豐富的胺基酸。本研究以進口泰國米、台灣的在來米（台中秈 10 號）與蓬萊米（台南 11 號）為原料。製麴法為將上述原料分別浸漬 12 小時後蒸熟、冷卻、接入 1 ％的Aspergillus awamori；保持環境在濕度 95 ％，溫度 30 ℃下培麴 2 天。將米麴加入等量蒸熟後的米原料、Saccharomyces cerevisiae酒精發酵用酵母及 1. 7 倍的水發酵 14 天後，酒精度可達 12 ％至 13 ％之間。經蒸餾、壓榨、過濾即為黑麴醪醋。 分析結果顯示，使用泰國米、台中秈 10 號及台南 11 號所製成的黑麴醪醋之檸檬酸及胺基酸總含量大約相同。且根據小量品評調查結果顯示，台灣人對於本實驗所釀的黑麴醪醋接受度高於日本市售黑麴醪醋。顯示使用台灣的台中秈 10 號及台南 11 號之稻米取代泰國米製造黑麴醪醋之應用潛力。期待此研究可以開創台灣本土農產品的多元利用，開發具營養補充機能之酸性飲料。第一章、前言……………………. ……………………… 1 1. 1 、黑麴醪醋…………………………………………… 1 1. 1. 1 、黑麴醪醋介紹………………………………… 1 第一章、前言………………………………. ………………… [...] ……… [...] 	 1 1. 1 、黑麴醪醋……………………………………………………………	 1 1. 1. 1 、黑麴醪醋介紹…………… [...] . …… [...] . 	 1 1. 1. 2 、一般食醋介紹………………………………………………	 2 1. 1. 3 、黑麴醪醋與一般食醋之差異 [...] . ……. …… [...] 	 5 1. 1. 4 、黑麴醪醋之保健功能…………………………………… [...] 	 7 1. 2 、稻米………………………………………………………………	 7 1. 2. 1 、稻米的種類……………… [...] . 	 7 1. 2. 2 、稻米的特性…………………………………………………	 11 1. 3 、麴…………………………………………………………………	 11 1. 3. 1 、麴的分類……………… [...] . 	 11 1. 3. 2 、泡盛米麴之製造……………………………………………	 12 1. 3. 3 、製麴與水份的關係…………………………………………	 13 1. 3. 4 、麴菌（Aspergillus awamori）…………………………… [...] 	 14 1. 4 、酵母菌…………………………………………. …………………	 16 1. 4. 1 、酵母菌的形態………… [...] . 	 16 1. 4. 2 、酵母菌的繁殖法……………………………………………	 16 1. 4. 3 、酵母菌的分類… [...] . 	 18 1. 4. 2 、酵母菌的有機酸之貢獻……………………………………	 18 1. 5 、蒸餾………………………………………………………………	 19 1. 5. 1 、蒸餾的方式……………… [...] . 	 19 1. 5. 2 、蒸餾收酒…… [...] . …. ………………………………………	 20 1. 6 、研究目的……………… [...] . …. …………………………………	 20 第二章、材料與方法…………………… [...] ………………………………	 22 2. 1 、實驗材料……… [...] ……………… [...] ……………………………… [...] 	 22 2. 1. 1 、稻米……………… [...] 	 22 2. 1. 2 、實驗菌株…………………………………………………. …	 25 2. 1. 3 、培養基………………… [...] . 	 25 2. 1. 4 、化學藥劑……………………………………………………	 26 2. 2 、儀器設備……… [...] ……………………………………. ……… [...] …. 	 26 2. 3 、電腦套裝軟體… [...] ………… [...] ………………………. ……… [...] …. 	 27 2. 4 、實驗方法……… [...] …………………………………………… [...] …. 	 27 2. 4. 1 、實驗大綱………… [...] . 	 27 2. 4. 2 、實驗方法………… [...] . …. …………………………………	 30 2. 4. 3 、分析方法…………… [...] 	 34 第三章、結果與討論…………………………………………………. …. 	 38 3. 1 、蒸餾前之發酵液酒精濃度………. ……… [...] ……………………. 	 38 3. 2 、pH值及酸度之探討………………… [...] ………………………… [...] 	 40 3. 3 、有機酸含量之探討………………… [...] ………………………… [...] 	 42 3. 4 、胺基酸含量之探討…………… [...] …… [...] 	 45 3. 5 、感官品評……………… [...] ……………………………………… [...] 	 56 3. 6 、儲存顏色變化…………………………… [...] ………………………	 60 第四章、結論與未來展望……………………………… [...] ………………	 62 第五章、參考文獻……………………………………… [...] ………………	 6...|$|R
