5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. <b>Scribe</b> A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This <b>scribe</b> wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. <b>Scribe</b> B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this <b>scribe</b> is in Old Welsh orthography. <b>Scribe</b> B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by <b>Scribe</b> A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E

5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by <b>Scribe</b> B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that <b>Scribe</b> B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in the}} older manuscript. Isaac suggested that <b>Scribe</b> B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{feasibility}} of Ti film coated on glass substrate <b>scribed</b> via a 532 nm picosecond laser is investigated. Laser irradiations from the film side and from the transparent substrate side are performed for comparison. Optical microscopy, SEM, surface stylus and contact resistance measurement reveal that the Ti film can be completely removed with no damage to the glass substrate, using optimized process parameters. The complete removal threshold for the film for front-side <b>scribing</b> is found at 120 mJ/cm 2, while the minimum laser fluence for complete <b>scribing</b> is 70 mJ/cm 2 {{in the case of}} back-side <b>scribing.</b> The lines <b>scribed</b> from the front side exhibit obvious thermal effects such as heat affected zones, burr and micro cracks. Backside <b>scribing</b> exhibits non-thermal behavior, which also can increase the process speed for the <b>scribing</b> of a Ti film on glass to 1000 mm/s. This makes the back-side laser <b>scribing</b> of Ti film a promising technique. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène <b>Scribe.</b> <b>Scribe</b> {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ill-health (or {{possibly}} hypochondria) now {{began to}} restrict Meyerbeer's output and activities. The {{death of his}} beloved mother in 1854 was also a blow. However the success of L'étoile du nord in 1854 demonstrated that he could still pack the theatres. Following this he began on two new projects, an opera by <b>Scribe</b> based on the biblical story of Judith, and an opéra comique, Le pardon de Ploërmel, (also known as Dinorah, the title given to the Italian version performed at London) to a libretto by Jules Barbier. The latter premiered on 4 April 1859 at the Opéra Comique at Paris; the former, like many previous projects, remained only as sketches. The death of <b>Scribe</b> in 1861 was a further disincentive to Meyerbeer to proceed with his operatic work in progress. In 1862, in accordance with his original contract with <b>Scribe,</b> he paid Scribe's widow compensation for not completing Judith.|$|E
5|$|They {{are written}} by a <b>scribe</b> with special ink on {{parchment}} scrolls (klaf). The Hebrew Ashuri script must be used and there are three main styles of lettering used: Beis Yosef – generally used by Ashkenazim; Arizal – generally used by Hasidim; Velish – used by Sefardim. The passages contain 3,188 letters, which take a sofer (<b>scribe)</b> between 10–15 hours to complete. The arm-tefillin has one large compartment, which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip of parchment. The head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll of parchment is placed.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates laser <b>scribing</b> of a-Si:H layers {{from the}} film side with a ns pulsed UV laser for {{thin-film}} solar modules. We compared the contact resistance for several <b>scribing</b> methods and find that a low contact resistance is only achieved for double <b>scribing</b> methods (i. e. <b>scribing</b> the same line twice). Furthermore, we find that for such double <b>scribing</b> methods the alignment between the laser spots {{of the first and}} second sub-scribes is critical for good-quality contacts. In order to analyze these results in more detail, we examined the morphology and chemical composition at the surface of the laser lines using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry. From this analysis, we conclude that a good alignment {{between the first and second}} <b>scribes</b> results in less re-deposition of silicon in the form of SiO 2 on the surface, which explains differences in contact resistance found for the various <b>scribing</b> methods. As a good alignment between the two sub-scribes is difficult to obtain, these double <b>scribing</b> methods are not attractive for industrial application. We developed a new <b>scribing</b> method for which alignment between the two <b>scribes</b> is not critical, and demonstrate that we can obtain high-quality contacts with this method...|$|R

40|$|A new {{pulsed laser}} {{technique}} based on Photonic Crystal Fibres (PCF) {{has been developed}} and tested within the European funded Alpine project for the improvement, in terms of precision and speed, of the existing <b>scribing</b> technology in PV modules through the usage of high quality beam fiber lasers. In this work we report about the first evaluation {{of the quality of}} the <b>scribing</b> process performed by innovative PCF lasers according to the particular patterning steps (P 1, P 2 and P 3) which are applied on CdTe thin film devices realized in superstrate configuration on glass. A comparison with devices prepared with standard <b>scribing</b> technology is presented. The P 1, P 2, P 3 <b>scribing</b> patterning steps have been evaluated separately in this work and devices <b>scribed</b> with the novel laser technology reported clearly either improved characteristics in two cases (P 1 and P 2 <b>scribing)</b> or worsen characteristics in the case of P 3 <b>scribing.</b> In detail devices with P 1 and P 2 patterning <b>scribed</b> with PCF laser reported an evident improvement in Pmax of slightly above 5 % while devices with P 3 <b>scribed</b> with the novel laser technology showed a Pmax value about 3 % lower than the reference one.

5|$|Tischendorf {{believed}} that four separate scribes (whom he named A, B, C and D) copied {{the work and}} that five correctors (whom he designated a, b, c, d and e) amended portions.

It is now agreed, after Milne and Skeat's reinvestigation, that Tischendorf was wrong—scribe C never existed. According to Tischendorf, <b>scribe</b> C wrote the poetic books of the Old Testament. These are written in a different format {{from the rest of the}} manuscript – they appear in two columns (the rest of books is in four columns), written stichometrically. Tischendorf probably interpreted the different formatting as indicating the existence of another <b>scribe.</b> The three remaining scribes are still identified by the letters that Tischendorf gave them: A, B, and D. Correctors were more, at least seven (a, b, c, ca, cb, cc, e).|$|E

5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts.

The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E

5|$|In 1843, the Berlin Opera house burnt down. The {{creation}} of the new building gave a new opportunity to commission a German opera from Meyerbeer. The subject of the opera, Ein Feldlager in Schlesien (A Silesian Encampment), was an episode {{in the life of}} Frederick the Great. As this patriotic opera 'needed' Prussian creators, Meyerbeer arranged that whilst the trusted <b>Scribe</b> would write the libretto, Rellstab would translate it and take the credit (and the royalties). This had the added advantage of winning over the formerly hostile Rellstab. Meyerbeer had hoped to have Jenny Lind (for whom he had written the part) sing the lead role of Vielka, but the opera premiered on 7 December 1844 without her (although she did appear in subsequent performances). The libretto was revised by Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer to a Bohemian background as Vielka for a production in Vienna (1847). (In a further incarnation, the music was later used by Meyerbeer for a revamped libretto by <b>Scribe</b> featuring Peter the Great, and produced as an opéra comique in Paris (L'étoile du nord, 1854)).|$|E
