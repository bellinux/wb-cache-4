5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A <b>serial</b> <b>communications</b> port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 121 - 123) <b>Serial</b> {{data link}} <b>communications</b> are a growing {{part of the}} computer, electronics, and telecommunications industries. A multitude of protocols are available whose purpose is to regulate <b>serial</b> data link <b>communications.</b> A need exists for the systems designer {{to be able to}} select a protocol for use in a particular <b>serial</b> data <b>communications</b> environment. There are two areas which must be evaluated prior to choosing a protocol; the characteristics of the transmission medium, and the system requirements. The necessary features of a protocol to fit the particular requirements can then be selected. These considerations are discussed. Several standard and non-standard protocols are tabulated for reference and as examples of the implementation of various features of protocols. The tools are provided to generate a protocol for a unique application if an available one is inadequate. Two examples of the protocol selection process are presented...|$|R

50|$|<b>Serial</b> data <b>communications</b> {{can also}} embed the clock within the serial data stream. This {{eliminates}} the need for a parallel clock to synchronize the data. There are multiple methods for embedding a clock into a data stream. One method is inserting 2 extra bits into the data stream as a start-bit and stop-bit to guarantee bit transitions at regular intervals to mimic a clock signal. Another method is 8b/10b encoding.|$|R
