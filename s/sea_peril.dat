5000|$|Hunvor, a Swedish princess, {{asks for}} his help against the giant suitor Harek the Ironhead, son of king Kol Humpback and younger brother of Björn Bluetooth, who harasses her. Viking slays the giant in a holmgang (duel) using the magic sword. Viking is unable to marry her because is it disgraceful to marry before 20 and goes in viking. The giant's relatives, who are adept at magic, pursue him and bring him <b>sea</b> <b>perils.</b> On his journey, he meets and befriends Halfdan, son of Ulf. Halfdan is offered foster-brotherhood in return for helping him lift the curse of Harek's older witch-sister Dis. Viking becomes ill, but Halfdan converses with his fosterfather Lit, a dwarf. Lit instructs Halfdan to take the magic horn Dis {{inherited}} from her father Kol. Meanwhile, Ingjald Strout, another son of king Kol, invades Sweden with a warparty, kills the king, Hunvor's father Ring and kidnaps Hunvor and her maid Ingeborg, {{the daughter of the}} jarl of Ulleråker. Jokul Ironback, the berserker husband of Dis goes after Viking and Hunvor. Lit steals Dis horn and uses it to cure Viking. Viking and Halfdan goes to battle with the ships of Jokul Ironback and Dis. The fosterbrothers loses many men, but attempt to board Jokul's ship. Viking cuts Jokul in half. Dis has been paralyzed in bed by Lit and is found as such by Viking and Halfdan. The fosterbrother's then stoned her to death in her bed. When their wounded comrades are healed, the duo sets out for India with 20 ships (carrying 600 warriors).|$|R

"Then, again, did you hide in any secluded neighborhood, {{you would}} surely be found sooner or later, for the news will go {{from end to end}} of Egypt, and it will be everyone's duty to search for and {{denounce}} you.

Lastly, did you surmount all these difficulties and reach some land beyond the sway of Egypt, you would be an exile for life.

5000|$|The use of ship names {{derived from}} {{classical}} mythology is a well-established {{practice of the}} Royal Navy. However, commentator Bill Baley suggests that the choice of Ulysses might have been less than accidental. [...] "Unlike in Joyce's famous book, there are here no specific scenes clearly reminiscent of specific ones in Homer's Odyssey; but overall, it was Homer's Ulysses who gave Western culture the enduring template {{of a long and}} harrowing <b>sea</b> voyage where <b>peril</b> waits at every moment and of which few of the crew would survive to see the end." ...|$|R

This was that which made the apostle run through any thing!--good report, evil report, persecution, affliction, hunger, nakedness, <b>peril</b> by <b>sea,</b> and <b>peril</b> by land, bonds and imprisonments. Also it made others endure to be stoned, sawn asunder, to have their eyes bored out with augers, their bodies broiled on gridirons, their tongues cut out of their mouths, to be boiled in cauldrons, thrown to the wild beasts, burned at the stake, whipped at posts, and a {{thousand}} other fearful torments; [...] "while they looked not at the things which are seen," [...] (as the things of this world,) [...] "but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."

In a few minutes shadowy pines appeared, then a strip of foam-swept beach, at which Andrew glanced anxiously. He could not turn back now; the dark, froth-ridged seas drove him on, but {{in a few more}} minutes the end of the beach slipped past and a narrow strip of water with pines about it opened up. They ran in, the wild lurching ceased, and they paddled through smooth water, until the craft ahead gently took the beach. Andrew now {{realized}} that he had mistaken two islands for one, and was in the sound between them. It was very dark among the trees when he came ashore, but he heard one of the strangers asking for the boss, and answered him.|$|R

60|$|His next {{work was}} the Pilot, {{in which he}} showed how, from the vicissitudes of a life at <b>sea,</b> its <b>perils</b> and escapes, from the beauty and terrors of the great deep, from the working of a vessel on a long voyage, and from the frank, brave, and generous but {{peculiar}} character of the seaman, may be drawn materials of romance by which the minds of men may be as deeply moved as by anything {{in the power of}} romance to present. In this walk, Cooper has had many disciples but no rival. All who have since written romances of the sea have been but travellers in a country of which he was the great discoverer; and none of them all seemed to have loved a ship as Cooper loved it, or have been able so strongly to interest all classes of readers in its fortunes. Among other personages drawn with great strength in the Pilot, is the general favorite, Tom Coffin, the thorough seaman with all the virtues and {{one or two of the}} infirmities of his profession, superstitious, as seamen are apt to be, yet whose superstitions strike us as but an irregular growth of his devout recognition of the Power who holds the ocean in the hollow of his hand; true-hearted, gentle, full of resources, collected in danger, and at last calmly perishing at the post of duty, with the vessel he has long guided, by what I may call a great and magnanimous death. His rougher and coarser companion, Boltrope, is drawn with scarcely less skill, and with a no less vigorous hand.|$|R
6000|$|The raft drew {{beyond the}} middle of the river; the boys pointed her head right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, {{unconscious}} of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, [...] "looking his last" [...] upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing [...] "she" [...] could see him now, abroad on the wild <b>sea,</b> facing <b>peril</b> and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond eyeshot of the village, and so he [...] "looked his last" [...] with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.|$|R
500|$|Shackleton {{refused to}} pack {{supplies}} {{for more than}} four weeks, knowing that if they did not reach South Georgia within that time, the boat and its crew would be lost. The James Caird was launched on 24 April 1916; during the next fifteen days, it sailed through the waters of the southern ocean, {{at the mercy of the}} stormy <b>seas,</b> in constant <b>peril</b> of capsizing. On 8 May, thanks to Worsley's navigational skills, the cliffs of South Georgia came into sight, but hurricane-force winds prevented the possibility of landing. The party was forced to ride out the storm offshore, in constant danger of being dashed against the rocks. They later learned that the same hurricane had sunk a 500-ton steamer bound for South Georgia from Buenos Aires. On the following day, they were able, finally, to land on the unoccupied southern shore. After a period of rest and recuperation, rather than risk putting to sea again to reach the whaling stations on the northern coast, Shackleton decided to attempt a land crossing of the island. Although it is likely that Norwegian whalers had previously crossed at other points on ski, no one had attempted this particular route before. For their journey, the survivors were only equipped with boots they had pushed screws into to act as climbing boots, a carpenter's adze, and 50 feet of rope. Leaving McNish, Vincent and McCarthy at the landing point on South Georgia, Shackleton travelled [...] with Worsley and Crean over extremely dangerous mountainous terrain for 36 hours to reach the whaling station at Stromness on 20 May.|$|R
5000|$|Edmund Magauran's {{value as}} an {{emissary}} from Catholic Europe to the Irish chiefs was recognised by Pope Gregory XIII. who rewarded {{him with a}} bishopric. Magauran was praeconised in the Papal Consistory of 2 September 1581 and on 11 September 1581 he was appointed Bishop of Ardagh, a diocese adjacent to Kilmore. The Consistorial Act states- [...] "Die 11 Sept., 1581, referente Senonen. Providit ecc. Ardachaden, in Hib. vac., per trans. Reverendissimus Pater Dominus Richardi ad ecc. Kilmoren., de persona Edmundi Macsaruraghan, ipsumque etc." [...] Bishop Magauran was neither the first nor last Kilmore priest to hold this bishopric as his immediate predecessor Richard Brady O.F.M., a Franciscan from Cavan, ruled Ardagh from 1576 to 1580 when he {{was transferred to the}} See of Kilmore. Furthermore a namesake of Edmund's, Cormac Mác Shamhradháin, the Prior of Drumlane Abbey, was Bishop of Ardagh from 1444 to 1476, while another namesake James Magauran was parish priest of Oughteragh in Kilmore diocese before he ruled as Bishop of Ardagh from 1815 to 1829. As Edmund Magauran was only aged about 34 {{at the time of his}} appointment, he must have been highly regarded by his superiors. Pope Gregory XIII later proved this by entrusting Bishop Magauran with a special mission to the Ulster Gaelic chiefs, when he was to attempt to obtain their support for the Geraldine war or Desmond Rebellions (1579-83), which was then raging in Munster. It is regarded as the first Counter-Reformation military crusade in Ireland. Following the reduction of Desmond, MacGauran was exiled from Ireland in 1585 by Queen Elizabeth I of England and he went first to Scotland with some trusty servants. In the summer of 1585 Magauran travelled around Scotland and claimed to have confirmed upwards of 10,000 Scottish Catholics. The English government was afraid Magauran was trying to start a joint uprising in both Scotland and Ireland to overthrow the Protestant religion, so at the request of Queen Elizabeth, the Scottish government issued orders for his arrest but he evaded them by boarding a ship bound for France in September 1585. On the way the ship was captured by Sir Francis Drake on 7 September 1585 and taken to London. However Magauran and his companions were concealed in a hideout in the bottom of the ship and escaped detection when it was searched. The bishop then boarded another ship for France which was attacked by pirates. However they escaped and landed in France where they made their way to Paris, arriving shortly before 31 September 1585. Father James Tyrie, a Jesuit priest in Paris, wrote a letter to Fr. Claudio Acquaviva, the Superior-General of the Jesuits in Rome on 31 September, stating- [...] "We have had a visit from an Irish Bishop, who has been some time in Scotland, and with Fathers Hay and Gordon. He was entrusted by them with letters, which he eventually threw into the <b>sea</b> when in <b>peril</b> from enemies. From letters by Robert Bruce and others, I extract these particulars. Fathers Hay and Gordon are in the North of Scotland with the Earl of Huntly; Fathers Holt and Dury are in the West with the Earl of Morton i.e., Lord Maxwell at Dumfries. The number of Catholics increases rapidly every day, and the Irish Bishop assures me that during the short time he remained in Scotland, he administered the sacrament of confirmation to at least ten thousand persons." [...] Corroboration of this event is provided by a later report in the same year which suggested that the same number of souls had been reconciled to Catholicism in the previous six months. Bishop Magauran then left France for Spain. The Lord Deputy, Sir John Perrot writing from Dublin on 12 January 1586 to Sir Francis Walsingham, stated- [...] "Sir Cuconnaught Maguire is at this present with me here, and telleth me that the Pope's bishop of Ardagh, maintained by O'Rourke, went this last summer to Scotland, and thence to France and thence to Spain, did assure him that Spaniards would land this Spring, either in the west or in the north or in both places, but he durst not deliver this matter to any other but to myself. It was that bishop which Brian McGeoghegan told Captain Nicholas Dawtrey of."In 1586 Magauran left Spain for Rome. On entering Italy he first went on a pilgrimage to the Marian Shrine at Loreto, Marche on foot to fulfill a double vow he made when saved from capture at sea. Loreto is a hilltown and comune of the Italian province of Ancona, in the Marche. It is mostly famous as the seat of the Basilica della Santa Casa, a popular Catholic pilgrimage site and it was the foremost Marian Shrine in Europe at that time. The reason Bishop Magauran gave for this pilgrimage to Loreto was that his escape from Drake's search happened on the eve of the birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who had warned one of his companions in a dream. Magauran spent three days at Loreto and left the above account of his adventures in the shrine. He reached Rome before 25 April 1586 as on that date we find him acting as one of the principal co-consecrators of Maol Muire Ó hÚigínn, the new Archbishop of Tuam. Following this visit to Rome he returned to Spain to continue his efforts to extract help with the Counter-Reformation movement in Ireland from King Philip II of Spain. The King selected Magauran to perform the consecration ceremony for the new basilica at El Escorial on 10 August 1586 so he must have been held in high regard. In Spain he associated with the Geraldine exiles from Lisbon such as Maurice Fitzgerald, Edmund Eustace, Charles O'Conor-Faly, and Bishop Cornelius O'Mulrian of Killaloe.|$|R
