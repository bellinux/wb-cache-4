The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory.

In addition to following other suggestions by Venkata Reddy, Rama Rao read the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata and other puranas to understand Krishna's character and present it properly. S. V.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs surviving infancy and attending school has been increasing. Due to their health status, these children {{may be at risk}} of low social-emotional and learning competencies (e. g., Lightfoot, Mukherjee, & Sloper, 2000; Zehnder, Landolt, Prchal, & Vollrath, 2006). Early social problems have been linked to low levels of academic achievement (Ladd, 2005), inappropriate behaviours at school (Shiu, 2001) and strained teacher-child relationships (Blumberg, Carle, O‘Connor, Moore, & Lippmann, 2008). Early learning difficulties have been associated with mental health problems (Maughan, Rowe, Loeber, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 2003), increased behaviour issues (Arnold, 1997), delinquency (Loeber & Dishion, 1983) and later academic failure (Epstein, 2008). Considering the importance of these areas, the limited research on <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs in social-emotional and learning domains is a factor driving this research. The purpose of the current research is to investigate social-emotional and learning competence in the early years for Australian children who have <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs. The data which informed this thesis was from Growing up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. This is a national, longitudinal study being conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The study has a national representative sample, with data collection occurring biennially, in 2004 (Wave 1), 2006 (Wave 2) and 2008 (Wave 3). Growing up in Australia uses a cross-sequential research design involving two cohorts, an Infant Cohort (0 - 1 at recruitment) and a Kindergarten Cohort (4 - 5 at recruitment). This study uses the Kindergarten Cohort, for which there were 4, 983 children at recruitment. Three studies were conducted to address the objectives of this thesis. Study 1 used Wave 1 data to identify and describe Australian children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs. Children who identified as having <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs through the <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs screener were selected. From this, descriptive analyses were run. The results indicate that boys, children with low birth weight and children from families with low levels of maternal education are likely to be in the population of children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs. Further, these children are likely to be using prescription medications, have poor general health and are likely to have specific condition diagnoses. Study 2 used Wave 1 data to examine differences between children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs and their peers in social-emotional competence and learning competence prior to school. Children identified by the <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs screener were chosen for the case group (n = 650). A matched case control group of peers (n = 650), matched on sex, cultural and linguistic diversity, family socioeconomic position and age, were the comparison group. Social-emotional competence was measured through Social/Emotional Domain scores taken from the Growing up in Australia Outcome Index, with learning competence measured through Learning Domain scores. Results suggest statistically significant differences in scores between the two groups. Children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs have lower levels of social-emotional and learning competence prior to school compared to their peers. Study 3 used Wave 1 and Wave 2 data {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs at Wave 1 and social-emotional competence and learning competence at Wave 2, as children started school. The sample for this study consisted of children in the Kindergarten Cohort who had teacher data at Wave 2. Results from multiple regression models indicate that <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs prior to school (Wave 1) significantly predicts social-emotional competence and learning competence in the early years of school (Wave 2). These results indicate that having <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs prior to school is a risk factor for the social-emotional and learning domains in the early years of school. The results from these studies give valuable insight into Australian children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs and their social-emotional and learning competence in the early years. The Australia population of children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs were primarily male children, from families with low maternal education, were likely to be of poor health and taking prescription medications. It was found that children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs were likely to have lower social-emotional competence and learning competence prior to school compared to their peers. Results indicate that <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs prior to school were predictive of lower social-emotional and learning competencies in the early years of school. More research is required into this unique population and their competencies over time. However, the current research provides valuable insight into an under researched 'at risk' population...|$|R
50|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of children with}} special healthcare needs in the population depends on several factors, including gender, age, socioeconomic level and family household education. In the National Survey of Children's Health Data in 2007, gender is the strongest predictor of <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs—about 60% of children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs are boys and 30% are girls. A study by Newacheck et al. found that age is also a strong predictor, as school-age children {{are found to be}} twice as likely as toddlers to require <b>special</b> needs <b>care,</b> and this prevalence continues to increase as children grow older. Families with income below the federal poverty level are 1/3 more likely to have children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs, and families with 12 or fewer years of education have increased {{prevalence of}} a child with SHCN as well.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} racial and ethnic differences in access to and utilization of health services. However, few studies have addressed these issues with respect to children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs. This study examines whether disparities in access and utilization are present among black, white, and Hispanic children identified as having <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs. METHODS: We analyzed data on 57 553 children younger than 18 years old included in the 1994 - 95 National Health Interview Survey on Disability. Of these, 10 169, or 17. 7 % of the sample, were identified as having an existing <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> need. Bivariate and multivariate analyses {{were used to assess}} how race and ethnicity are related to measures of access and utilization, such as usual source of care, missed care, and use of physician and hospital services. RESULTS: Our analyses show that among children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs, minorities were more likely than white children to be without health insurance coverage (13. 2 % vs 10. 3 %; P <. 01), to be without usual source of care (6. 7 % vs 4. 3 %; P <. 01), and to report inability to get needed medical care (3. 9 % vs 2. 8 %; P <. 05). Also, white children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs were more likely than their minority counterparts to have used physician services (88. 6 vs 85. 0; P <. 01); however, minority children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs {{were more likely to have}} been hospitalized during the past year (7. 6 % vs 6. 3 %; P < 0. 5). After adjustments for confounding variables (income, insurance coverage, health status, and other variables), racial and ethnic differences in access and utilization were attenuated but remained significant for several measures (without a usual source of care, receipt of care outside of a doctor's office or HMO, no regular clinician, no doctor contacts in past year, and volume of doctor contacts). Gaps in access were more frequent and generally larger for Hispanic children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that access and utilization disparities remain between white and minority children with <b>special</b> health <b>care</b> needs, with Hispanic children experiencing especially disparate care...|$|R
