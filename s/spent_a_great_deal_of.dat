By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{traveled}} {{again to}} the South of France {{on a number of}} occasions between 1927 and 1929, and based himself at Saint-Paul-de-Vence. He sent paintings back to Reid to be exhibited in Glasgow and London, but he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> time sketching and his output of finished oil paintings was low. One exhibition in London had to be postponed due to a lack of paintings. The France trips culminated in 1929 with a critically acclaimed exhibition at the Ferargil Galleries in New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{affair with}} Sejanus {{and the final}} years of treason trials {{permanently}} damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became paranoid, and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from Dacia and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.|$|E

Elected abbot in 794, he rebuilt the monastery and endowed {{it with a}} library of 200 volumes. It was not {{uncommon}} for the Merovingian, Carolingian, or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries; the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation. Angilbert, in contrast, <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> rebuilding Saint-Riquier; when he completed it, Charlemagne spent Easter of the year 800 there. In keeping with Carolingian policies, Angilbert established a school at Saint-Riquier to educate the local boys.|$|R

5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> time {{away from each other}} and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E
50|$|During the Second Barons' War, Fotheringhay and Chester Castle {{were taken}} by Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby. He held them from 1264 to 1265. Edward II granted Fotheringhay Castle to John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond. When John died in 1334, his granddaughter {{inherited}} Fotheringhay Castle, Mary de St Pol, the widowed countess of Pembroke. She died in 1377, and Edward III gave her property over to his son, Edmund Langley. In 1385, he was made Duke of York by the king and Fotheringhay Castle became his principal seat. According to John Leland writing in 1540, Langley <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> on Fotheringhay Castle. Langley died in 1402 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward. He died without children of his own in 1415, so his property passed to his nephew Richard.|$|R

Accusations were made that the Foreign Press Association members had been bought off. Zadora's husband, multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis, flew voting members to his casino, the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, which gave the appearance that they voted for Zadora to repay this. Riklis also invited voting members to his house for a lavish lunch and a showing of the film. He also <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> on advertising.

60|$|On the 10th of June, 1714, {{there came}} by Mr. Prior's {{messenger}} from Paris {{a letter from}} my Lord Viscount Castlewood to his mother, {{saying that he had}} been foolish in regard of money matters, that he was ashamed to own he had lost at play, and by other extravagances; and that instead of having great entertainments as he had hoped at Castlewood this year, he must live as quiet as he could, and make every effort to be saving. So far every word of poor Frank's letter was true, nor was there a doubt that he and his tall brothers-in-law had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> more than they ought, and engaged the revenues of the Castlewood property, which the fond mother had husbanded and improved so carefully during the time of her guardianship.|$|R
5|$|The third Playford, Thomas Playford II, {{was born}} at Bethnal Green, London in 1837 to the second wife of Pastor Playford. He was raised on the Mitcham {{property}} in South Australia, was intellectual and bookish, and wished to go the prestigious St Peter's College to study law. He was rebuked by his father and subsequently became a farmer like his predecessors, buying property at Norton Summit and growing vegetables, plums and apples. He {{was elected to the}} local East Torrens Council in 1863 at the age of 27; and then to the State Parliament in 1868 as a 'liberal' (parties had not yet formed), representing the constituency of Onkaparinga. He became known as 'Honest Tom' for his straightforward and blunt ways. He lost his seat in 1871 and regained it in 1875 only to lose it again until he was re-elected in 1887, upon which he became Premier of South Australia. He subsequently lost the premiership in 1889, regained it in 1890, and then <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> his term absent in India. After losing an election, he relocated to London to represent South Australia as Agent General to the United Kingdom.

5000|$|Before Anton became reigning prince in 1790, {{his father}} had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> on music, {{particular}} the opera company.

[...] He retained a small Harmonie (wind band), a few musicians for church music, and also allocated small salaries (400 florins) to retain the services of Haydn and of the first violinist Luigi Tomasini; neither was expected to work on a regular basis. [...] The laid-off musicians, some of whom had worked for the Esterházys for years, were given six weeks' severance pay. Anton was not alone in cutting back his musical establishment; this was a period of general decline in the musical forces sponsored by the empire's aristocracy.|$|R
2500|$|The Brazilian {{organizers}} of the tournament proposed a new format in which the 16 teams were divided into four first round groups (or [...] "pools" [...] as they were then called) of four teams, with the four group winners advancing to a final group stage, playing in round-robin format to determine the winner. The main reason for this choice was money: the organizers had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> on stadium and infrastructure investment. A straight knockout tournament, as {{had been used in}} 1934 and 1938, would feature only sixteen games (including the third-place playoff), while the proposed two rounds of the group format would guarantee thirty games, and thus more ticket revenue. In addition, this format would guarantee each team at least three games, and thus provide more incentive for European teams to make the journey to South America and compete. FIFA originally resisted this proposal, but backed down after Brazil threatened to back out of hosting the tournament if this format was not used.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} of the Ulster Canal worried the Lagan Navigation Company, as almost no trade passed between the two. This was not helped {{by the fact that}} the locks on the Ulster Canal were narrower, and the depth over the cills was less, so that Lagan boats could not work the canal, and goods had to be transshipped. Although the Board of Public Works controlled the Ulster Canal, and had spent £20,000 on it since they took control in 1865, no additional traffic had been generated. Between 1878 and 1880, the Lagan Canal built five boats which could work through both canals. The Lagan Canal was persuaded to take over the Ulster Canal and the Coalisland Canal or Tyrone Navigation in 1888. Although they <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> on improvements, the additional canals remained in a poor state and continued to make a loss. The Lagan itself was maintained well, and traffic rose from 153,000 tons in 1893 to 170,000 tons in 1898.|$|R

Rex pushed Superboy's merchandising {{as far as he}} could, even financing an animated series loosely based on the Kid. The series was not picked up because it was too violent. Rex blew a lot of the money on bad investments, and the Kid <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> buying <b>a</b> ramshakle place in a remote area of Hawaii that he called [...] "the Compound." [...] Unfortunately, this meant that Rex did not have the money to pay back a Mr. Gamboni, whom he owed a large sum, so Mr. Gamboni sent the assassin Copperhead after him. Copperhead decided to spare Rex's life at the expense of his daughter's—but luckily, Superboy was on the scene and managed to save Roxy's life.

But the people around our old house of Barryogue, although they did not like my father for his change of faith, yet stood by him at this moment, and were for exterminating the mutes sent by Mr. Plumer of London with the lamented remains. The monument and vault in the church were then, alas! {{all that remained of}} my vast possessions; for my father had sold every stick of the property to one Notley, an attorney, and we received but a cold welcome in his house--a miserable old tumble-down place it was. [Footnote: In another part of his memoir Mr. Barry will be found to describe this mansion {{as one of the most}} splendid palaces in Europe; but this is a practice not unusual with his nation; and with respect to the Irish principality claimed by him, it is known that Mr. Barry's grandfather was an attorney and maker of his own fortune.] ...|$|R

Critics and writers forecasted overwhelmingly that the Red Sox would win the 2011 World Series easily. The Red Sox <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> to build the team in the off-season, and were about to sell at least two Red Sox as Most Valuable Player candidates by mid season. Following a disastrous first month, the Red Sox climbed in the standings.

On September 28, the Tampa Bay Rays staged a dramatic comeback from 7–0 to win 8–7 over the Yankees in the 12th inning. Only three minutes earlier, Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon blew a 3–2 lead over the Orioles {{in the bottom of the}} 9th inning, handing a 4–3 walk-off victory to the Orioles. The Rays claimed the AL Wild Card and eliminated the Red Sox from the post-season. It marked the first time in baseball history that a 9-game lead had been blown in September, becoming the worst collapse in baseball history. Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe said that [...] "the greatest choke in baseball history...feels like revenge for [...] and [...]" [...] Yankee fans everywhere rejoiced, as it was <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> collapse than the 1978 Red Sox, as well as 2004.|$|R
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the bad reviews of Poems, Hunt {{published}} the essay [...] "Three Young Poets" [...] (Shelley, Keats, and Reynolds) and the sonnet [...] "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer," [...] foreseeing great things to come. He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of The Times, Thomas Barnes; the writer Charles Lamb; the conductor Vincent Novello; and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds, who would become a close friend. He was also regularly meeting William Hazlitt, a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a decisive turning point for Keats, establishing him {{in the public eye}} as a figure in what Hunt termed [...] "a new school of poetry." [...] At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey: [...] "I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth." [...] This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn": Beauty is truth, truth beauty' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey that he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> on his medical training and, despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, had made large loans to friends such as painter Benjamin Haydon.
