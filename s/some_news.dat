5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a ballot initiative {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. <b>Some</b> <b>news</b> commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E
5|$|On Independence Day and Republic Day, {{patriotic}} {{songs in}} regional languages are broadcast {{on television and}} radio channels. They are also played alongside flag hoisting ceremonies. Patriotic films are broadcast. Over the decades, according to The Times of India, {{the number of such}} films broadcast has decreased as channels report that audiences are oversaturated with patriotic films. The population cohort that belong to the Generation Next often combine nationalism with popular culture during the celebrations. This mixture is exemplified by outfits and savouries dyed with the tricolour and designer garments that represent India's various cultural traditions. Retail stores offer Independence Day sales promotions. <b>Some</b> <b>news</b> reports have decried the commercialism. Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders, nationalistic themes and defence-related themes on 15 August.|$|E

Billboard felt that Sony acquiring the estate's stake was the most likely outcome, noting the potential revenue the library could bring in regards to licensing for on-demand music streaming services.|$|E

5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by <b>some</b> <b>news</b> agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 season, Sevilla were {{reported}} to be interested in Samaras as a replacement for Júlio Baptista. While Arsenal were also looking at him after they had missed out on signing Baptista, <b>some</b> <b>news</b> organisations had reported that Arsenal had already signed Samaras and that he would join {{at the end of the}} season. However, the player's father, Ioannis Samaras said that this was untrue and that his son wanted to stay at the club for another year. Samaras scored on the opening day of the season, on 20 August, when he helped Heerenveen to a 5–4 victory over Roda JC. He picked up a minor leg injury in September, which ruled him out of Heerenveen's UEFA Cup tie against Baník Ostrava. But he returned to action on 23 September, and scored as Heerenveen beat NEC Nijmegen 2–1. On 14 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen came back from behind to beat Levski Sofia 2–1 in the UEFA Cup. On 30 December, Samaras scored twice as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4–2. In January 2006, Arsenal and Manchester City showed interest in signing the striker. Samaras tried to get released from his contract after Heerenveen had rejected a bid from Manchester City. However, the Dutch arbitration commission ruled that he had no grounds to end his contract. Samaras scored 25 goals in 88 appearances for Heerenveen.|$|E

On his first, he advanced to within {{three feet of}} Bradbury before being forced back by intense machine-gun and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire. His second try was similarly turned back and {{as the rest of}} his patrol provided covering fire, Monti advanced a third time but was struck by an RPG. <b>Some</b> <b>news</b> reports indicated that the explosion blew off both of his legs, but this is not supported by family accounts or military records. Monti attempted to crawl back towards cover. He is reported by comrades to have made his peace with God and asked Sgt. Cunningham to tell his parents he loved them. Monti died moments later. At about the same time, the artillery and air support for which he had called began hitting the enemy position, killing 22 of the attackers and dispersing the rest.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. <b>Some</b> <b>news</b> agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E
