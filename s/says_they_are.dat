500|$|Magali Cornier Michael criticises {{this reading}} of the text, saying that the novel's {{overwhelming}} reliance on male perspectives on women and feminism prevents the novel from meeting feminist objectives.

He added, though, that Brisingr [...] "reconnects with the core elements that animate Eragon's tale" [...] {{toward the end of}} the book, and Paolini shows growing maturity during some [...] "quiet" [...] moments in Brisingr, although Durham noted these parts could bore younger readers. Durham also found that Paolini's new characters are original, and that Paolini added depth to some characters from the previous novels in the Inheritance Cycle. In contrast, Sheena McFarland of The Salt Lake Tribune said that Paolini [...] "hasn't learned how to create characters that readers can relate to," [...] although she praised him for strong female characters in Brisingr such as Arya and Nasuada.
