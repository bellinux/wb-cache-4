50|$|<b>Dialing</b> <b>scales</b> {{were first}} {{discussed}} by Samuel Foster in 1638. P. Pierre Bobynet, a Jesuit drew a scale {{in his book}} L'horographie ingenieuse contenant des Connoissances, & Curiositez Agréables dans la composition des Cadrans, in 1647. It was however George Serles 1657 book, Dialling Universal, printed by R & W Leybourn that brought them to popular attention. These scales remained virtually unchanged for 250 years. E. C. Middleton, who had been engraving <b>dialling</b> <b>scales</b> from about 1895, supplied <b>dialling</b> <b>scales</b> accompanied by a typewritten instruction book from Birmingham in 1913- these were the scales calculated by Serle. The North American Sundial Society has printed facsimiles of both the Serle and Middleton books.The Middleton dial appeared without explanation in the 1994 Encyclopedia de Diderot et Alembert (French). Further work has done on these rulers by F.W. Cousins, and by Fred W Sawyer from 1997-2009.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{continuous}} measurement of surgical blood loss has been devised {{and has been}} used clinically in some 400 cases. The method combines volumetric measure of the suction loss and gravimetric measure of the sponge loss. The volumetric device automatically deducts the volume of rinse water used and thus measures the amount of blood collected in a metering cylinder. The suction loss scale shows continuously the amount {{of blood in the}} metering cylinder. The gravimetric device requires counting sponges into the weighing pan, and turning a <b>dial</b> <b>scale</b> to deduct the initial weight of the sponges. The volume of blood in the sponges is then read directly on the <b>dial</b> <b>scale.</b> Use of the instrument, which is {{under the supervision of the}} anesthesiologist, adds about two minutes per hour to the time normally required for counting the sponges; and about three minutes per hour is required for tending the volumetric instrument...|$|R

The Royal 1000 had exactly the same frequency coverage as the A/B 600 series tube Trans-Oceanics with the addition of the 13/meter band. The new Royal 1000 also sported an all-metal cabinet design with the front cover opening to the down position. The log chart was located inside the flip-down door. Very early Royal 1000s sported a genuine leather covering marked as such. Another first for [...] radios was the unique <b>dial</b> <b>scale</b> used in the 1000 and later series of Trans-Oceanics.

50|$|Metered bezels: Many chronographs have a bezel, that {{is either}} fixed or can rotate, {{around the outside}} of the dial that is marked to {{specific}} scales to allow rapid calculations. While any wristwatch can have a bezel, the chronograph stop start feature, as well as the rotation of the bezel, allows more complex calculations or repeated measurements for a series of calculations. The most popular meter is for Tachymeter readings: a simple scale that allows rapid calculations of speed. Other bezels feature Telemeter scale, for distance. The watchmaking company Breitling offers a model with a rotating bezel, in conjunction with another, fixed, meter on the <b>dial,</b> <b>scaled</b> for use as a slide rule for more complex calculations.|$|R

40|$|Dynamical Dark Matter (DDM) is an {{alternative}} framework for dark-matter physics in which the dark sector comprises a vast ensemble of particle species whose decay widths are balanced against their cosmological abundances. Previous studies of this framework have focused on a particular class of DDM ensembles [...] - motivated primarily by KK towers in theories with extra dimensions [...] - in which the density of states scales roughly as a polynomial of mass. In this paper, by contrast, we study the properties of a different class of DDM ensembles in which the density of states grows exponentially with mass. Ensembles with this Hagedorn-like property arise naturally as the "hadrons" associated with the confining phase of a strongly-coupled dark sector; they also arise naturally as the gauge-neutral bulk states of Type I string theories. We study the dynamical properties of such ensembles, and demonstrate that an appropriate DDM-like balancing between decay widths and abundances can emerge naturally [...] - even with an exponentially rising density of states. We also study the effective equations of state for such ensembles, and investigate some of the model-independent observational constraints on such ensembles that follow directly from these equations of state. In general, we find that such constraints tend to introduce correlations between various properties of these DDM ensembles such as their associated mass scales, lifetimes, and abundance distributions. For example, we find that these constraints allow DDM ensembles with energy scales ranging from the GeV scale {{all the way to}} the Planck scale, but the total present-day cosmological abundance of the dark sector must be spread across an increasing number of different states in the ensemble as these energy <b>scales</b> are <b>dialed</b> from the Planck scale down to the GeV scale. Numerous other correlations and constraints are also discussed. Comment: 29 pages, LaTeX, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 72) Two {{laboratory experiments}} {{were conducted to}} estimate the strength of effect of eight independent variables, and some two-way interactions, on the speed and accuracy of reading moving-pointer, fixed-scale dials. Additional objectives were {{to determine if the}} black-white relationship of the <b>scale</b> markers and <b>dial</b> background affects dial-reading performance or subject preferences, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} screening designs in meeting the first objective. Eight subjects were assigned to each of two screening designs in each of the two experiments. Each screening design tested 16 out of a possible 256 conditions. Slides of <b>dials</b> with black <b>scales,</b> pointer, and other symbols against a white background were used in Experiment I. White-on-black dials were used in Experiment II. The results were very similar across screening designs and experiments. Scales which progressed in increments of 10 or 20 were read faster and more accurately than scales with progressions of 8 or 16. Also, dials were easier to read if no interpolation was required, but the effect of numerical progression was far stronger. There was a tendency for scales with scale unit lengths twice that of the recommended minimum to be easier to read than those of minimum recommended length. Scale orientation, marker width, pointer design, clutter, and scale number location had weak to trivial effects. Two-way interactions could not be isolated with confidence. It was concluded that the same factors affect the reading of black-on-white and white-on-black dials to about the same extent, and that the factors with the strongest effects (numerical progression, interpolation, scale unit length) should be included in a follow-on experiment. Also, screening designs like the ones used in these experiments can be used to estimate the strength of main effects but may not be as useful for isolating two-way interactions...|$|R

This retrospective, comparative case series study aimed to analyze the rotational deviation, or cyclotorsion, of three corneal marking methods: VERION digital marker (VDM; reference), horizontal slit beam marking (HSBM), and subjective direct visual marking (SDVM) on the table (using a bevel knife tip). Subjects included 81 eyes of 61 patients (mean age: 65. 70 ± 13. 14 years; range: 32 – 91 years) undergoing scheduled cataract surgery. A preoperative reference image was taken of each eye. Subsequently, a slit lamp with the light beam turned to the horizontal meridian was used to align the seated patient’s head, and two reference marks were placed at the 3 - and 9 -o’clock positions of the corneal limbus using a 27 -gauge needle and marking pen (HSBM). Upon transfer to the surgical table, the VDM was used to display a real-time <b>dial</b> <b>scale</b> on the patient’s eye, with {{the entrance of the}} temporal clear corneal incision (CCI) at 0 ° (horizontal meridian). Simultaneously, a bevel knife tip was used to create a marker based on the surgeon’s visual determination of the temporal 0 ° point (SDVM). We used the VDM to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of axis alignment via deviation from the horizontal reference meridian. Compared with the reference meridian, the SDVM (– 3. 46 °± 7. 32 °, range: – 18 ° to 13 °) exhibited greater average relative cyclotorsion versus the HSBM (0. 41 °± 4. 92 °, range: – 10 ° to 10 °). Furthermore, the mean average misalignment was significantly less in the HSBM group versus the SDVM group (t= 4. 179, P< 0. 001). The VDM is likely a reliable marking method, similar to the HSBM. In contrast, the SDVM is not entirely reliable. The VDM usage may prevent inaccurate preoperative manual marking during toric IOL implantation.
