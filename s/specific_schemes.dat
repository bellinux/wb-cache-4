The automatic analysis of these documents, in order to extract relevant information, is a real challenge. However, to evaluate the developed extraction algorithms, a ground truth is absolutely necessary. In this paper, we present some of the challenges {{of the state of the}} art binarization methods as an initial study for the construction of ground truth binarized images of palm leaf manuscripts. We propose and analyze the need for a <b>specific</b> <b>scheme</b> for the construction of the ground truth of binarized images.
