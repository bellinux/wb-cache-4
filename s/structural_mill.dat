Mixture of MoO 3 and Si powders with commercial purity were exposed to high mechanical activation in a planetary ball mill. The ball to powder mass ratio was selected to be constant at 33 : 1 and the rotation speed (cup speed) was 600 rpm during the milling operations.

Further milling resulted in a gradual decrease in MoO 2 peak intensities because of its continuous reduction. Peaks of MoO 2 were also broadened due to refinement of MoO 2 crystallite sizes.

40|$|We report {{systematic}} {{investigations of}} structural, vibrational, resonance and magnetic properties of nanoscale NiO powders prepared by ball milling process under different milling speeds for 30 hours of <b>milling.</b> <b>Structural</b> properties revealed that both pure NiO and as-milled NiO powders exhibit {{face centered cubic}} structure, but average crystallite size decreases to around 11 nm along with significant increase in strain with increasing milling speed. Vibrational properties show the enhancement in the intensity of one-phonon longitudinal optical (LO) band and disappearance of two-magnon band due to size reduction. In addition, two-phonon LO band exhibits red shift due to size-induced phonon confinement effect and surface relaxation. Pure NiO powder exhibit antiferromagnetic nature, which transforms into induced ferromagnetic after size reduction. The average magnetization at room temperature increases with decreasing the crystallite size and a maximum moment of 0. 016 μB/f. u. at 12 kOe applied field and coercivity of 170 Oe were obtained for 30 hours milled NiO powders at 600 rotation per minute milling speed. The change in the magnetic properties is also supported by the vibrational properties. Thermomagnetization measurements at high temperature reveal a well-defined magnetic phase transition at high temperature (TC) around 780 K due to induced ferromagnetic phase. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies reveal a good agreement between the EPR results and magnetic properties. The observed results are described {{on the basis of}} crystallite size variation, defect density, large strain, oxidation/reduction of Ni and interaction between uncompensated surfaces and particle core with lattice expansion.

However, material removal rate and quality in machining may still be limited due to {{issues related to the}} process mechanics which are not considered in CAD/CAM systems. In this study, modeling <b>structural</b> properties of <b>milling</b> system components is presented. These models eliminate the need for stiffness and transfer function measurements, and together with cutting force and stability models, they can be integrated into CAD/CAM systems to predict and compensate surface errors, and determine chatter free machining conditions. Therefore, the process is also simulated in addition to the geometry, which is usually the missing part in virtual manufacturing systems. The goal of this research is to develop a virtual machining system for precision machining of sculptured surfaces in which the part geometric errors contributed by the machine tool errors are predicted and evaluated prior to the real cutting. Cutting forces produce deformations of the tool and these cause dimensional and form errors on the workpiece. Milling forces can be modeled for given cutter geometry, cutting conditions and work material. The force prediction can be used to determine form errors on the finished surface. Chatter vibrations developed due to dynamic interactions between the cutting tool and workpiece. Chatter vibrations cause poor surface finish and inconsistent product quality. Static and dynamic properties of end mill are required to predict the form errors and chatter stability limits without measurement. In this research, generalized equations are presented which can be used for predicting static and dynamic properties of the cutting tool. The static and dynamic characteristics of tool and tool holder can be obtained by using finite element analysis (FEA).

Rice starch granules begin to swell radially, then undergo radial contraction and random tangential expansion to form complex structures in the gelatinization temperature range. At the end of the gelatinization temperature range, starch granules begin to lose their granular structures. At higher temperatures, rice starch granules soften and melt into thin flat disks and then stretch into thin filaments to form a three-dimensional network. During this transition, rapid increases in swelling power and solubility occur. These progressive configurational changes are reflected in the amylograph curves. Susceptibility of the starch granules dispersed in excess water to changes during heating is dependent on gelatinization temperature range during initial swelling and on the ratio of amylose to amylopectin in the latter stage of swelling. Birefringence end-point temperature (BEPT) was affected mainly by the degree of crystallinity (r = 0. 67 [superscript]**);The progressive <b>structural</b> changes of <b>milled</b> rice grains proceed from the periphery {{toward the center of the}} endosperm as water diffuses.
