W. Edwards and J. H. Mansfield among others, this process consists of making shallow, slit-like {{holes in the}} surfaces of material to be treated, so that deeper and more uniform penetration of preventative may be obtained. The term incising or perforating comes from the Latin incidere, a compound of in and caedere (to cut). Incisions made in sawed material usually are parallel with {{the grain of the}} wood. This process is common in North America (since the 1950s), where Douglas-fir products and pole butts of various species are prepared before treatment. It is most useful for woods that are resistant to <b>side</b> <b>penetration,</b> but allow preservative transport along the grain. In the region in which it is produced, it is common practice to incise all sawed Douglas-fir 3 in or more in thickness before treatment.|$|E

The M3 90 mm cannon used as a towed anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun, and later mounted in the M36 tank destroyer and finally the late-war M26 Pershing, could penetrate the Tiger's front plate at a range of 1,000 m using standard ammunition, and from beyond 2,000 m when using HVAP.|$|E

The temporary sealing material was highly combustible, and caught fire. Efforts were made by the workers to extinguish the fire at its origin, but they apparently did not recognize that the fire, {{under the influence of the}} draft through the penetration, was spreading on the reactor building side of the wall. The extent of the fire in the cable spreading room was limited to a few feet from the penetration; however, the presence of the fire on the other side of the wall from the point of ignition was not recognized until significant damage to cables related to the control of Units 1 and 2 had occurred.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA balloon {{array of}} 112 {{electrodes}} {{was used to}} obtain simultaneous recordings of endocardial electrograms during intraoperative mapping studies of ventricular tachycardia. Introduction of the balloon through a left atriotomy and across the mitral valve allowed endocardial activation maps to be obtained in the intact left ventricie. Of 20 patients with coronary artery disease studied in this way, suggestive evidence of endocardial reentry was found in 6. Three separate reentrant mechanisms were observed. In two patients, a single broad wave front of continuous recirculating activation reminiscent of a vortex was initiated by {{the formation of a}} functional arc of block in response to premature stimuli. In five patients, premature stimuli again produced a functional arc of block, which was circumvented by two opposing wave fronts that united on the distal <b>side.</b> Retrograde <b>penetration</b> by a narrow isthmus of slow conduction through the block initiated the tachycardia, whose activation sequence was comblent with figure eight reentry. In one patient, premature stimuli produced a region of delayed potentials. Critical timing of these resulted in microreentry in an adjacent circumscribed site, which formed the site of origin of the ensuing tachycardia. The microreentrant signals were not detected by standard unipolar recordings, but were seen on simultaneously recorded high gain electrograms. In 14 patients, although mapping identified a site of origin, the activation patterns showed either radial spread or incomplete circles. Detection of reentrant mechanisms daring intraoperative mapping required high density electrode arrays and refined high gain recordings. An intact ventricle may facilitate intraoperative initiation of tachycardia...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of formulations are applied to equine skin, yet variable penetration can affect efficacy, or the incidence of adverse effects, or both. To investigate the effects of common methods of skin preparation on transdermal drug penetration in vitro, we clipped, harvested, and froze skin samples from 5 Thoroughbred geldings. Thawed samples were prepared as follows: control (no preparation); cleaned with aqueous chlorhexidine (Aq-C, 0. 1 % w/v); cleaned with alcoholic chlorhexidine (Al-C, 0. 5 % w/v); shaved (Sh); or tape-stripped (Ta) {{with the use of}} adhesive tape. The samples were then placed in diffusion cells, and 2 g of methylsalicylate (MeSa) gel (Dencorub) was applied to the stratum corneum <b>side.</b> The <b>penetration</b> of MeSa and its analyte, salicylate (Sa), through the skin samples was measured over 10 h. Compared with control skin, significantly more MeSa penetrated through skin prepared with Al-C or Sh (P < 0. 01) or with Aq-C or Ta (P < 0. 05), and significantly more Sa was recovered in the receptor phase from skin prepared with Aq-C, Al-C, or Sh (P < 0. 05) or with Ta (P < 0. 01). A significantly higher rate of penetration and shorter lag time were also noted for MeSa with all the prepared skin samples, compared with the control samples. The results show that clinical techniques routinely used to clean or prepare skin can significantly affect the rate and extent of penetration of a topically applied drug. This may result in greater systemic availability of active drug, which could lead to enhanced efficacy and, possibly, a higher incidence of adverse effects...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Mathematical models have been devised expressing the levels of controllable welding factors {{as a function of}} the joint geometry, such that acceptable weld beads are produced. Weld beads were required to be both geometrically acceptable and mechanically sound despite changes in the root face thickness (0. 5 mm - 2. 5 mm) and root gap (0 - 1. 5 mm). The equations are intended to form part of an adaptively controlled robotic arc welding system. Simulation was used to develop the adaptive expressions. The study was applied to the root weld bead of the closing seam of railway bogie side frames fabricated from structural steel. The self shielding flux cored electrode arc welding process was used to weld single J preparations orientated in the horizontal-vertical position. Single <b>sided</b> full <b>penetration</b> welds with underbeads were required. The weld bead geometry was defined in terms of ten responses. Mathematical models derived from factorially designed experiments were used to relate the weld bead geometry, incidence of porosity and the occurrence of electrode stubbing to a function of upto seven factors. A data base of almost 1000 test welds was generated, in which each test was characterised by 76 pieces of information. Analysis of variance was used to determine which factors most influenced each of the responses. Multiple regression enabled an expression for each response to be derived {{as a function of the}} welding factor levels. The weld bead geometry model consisted of ten equations, each a function of upto six factors, whilst the soundness model related the optimum welding voltage to a function of three factors so that porosity and electrode stubbing would not be encountered...|$|R

With the Bz turning north, and AE recovery, an over-shielding electric field penetrates to equatorial latitudes that has opposite polarity to the under-shielding/convection electric field (e.g., Kikuchi et al. 2000), the polarities being opposite on the day and night <b>sides.</b> The <b>penetration</b> efficiency of the PPEF can vary so that the ionospheric electric field can be as much as 5 – 10  % of the IEF (see, for example, Kelley and Retterer 2008; Huang et al. 2010). The intensity and polarity of the penetration electric fields will depend also on large-scale conductivity gradients of the ionosphere so that the daytime eastward electric field extends into post-sunset hours peaking near the time of the PRE, prior to its westward reversal by ~ 21 LT, and the night-side westward electric field peaking in the pre-sunrise hours prior to its eastward reversal by ~ 05 – 07 LT (Richmond et al. 2003; Fejer et al. 2008). The disturbance dynamo electric field (DDEF) arising from the auroral heating that sets off equator-ward thermospheric disturbance winds occurs with a time delay of several hours (from the storm development) (Richmond et al. 2003), and it has the polarity local time dependence {{similar to that of the}} over-shielding electric field. These disturbance electric fields are important sources of large variability in the low latitude ionosphere, which will be briefly discussed below.|$|R
40|$|Water-saturation {{porosity}} and dye-penetration permeability {{measurements of}} Round Top Mountain rhyolite confirm that a ½-inch (13 -mm) crush size would permit efficient acid heap leaching of yttrium and heavy {{rare earth elements}} (YHREEs) hosted in yttrofluorite, a YHREE-substituted variety of fluorite. Laboratory acid leaching has extracted up to 90 % of the YHREEs. The bulk insoluble gangue mineralogy of the rhyolite, 90 % to 95 % quartz and feldspars, assures low acid consumption. Different crush sizes were weighed, soaked in water, and reweighed over time to determine water-penetration estimated porosity. Typical porosities were 1 % to 2 % for gray and 3 % to 8 % for pink varieties of Round Top rhyolite. The same samples were re-tested after soaking in dilute sulfuric to simulate heap leaching effects. Post-leach porosity favorably increased 15 % in pink and 50 % in gray varieties, due to internal mineral dissolution. Next, drops of water-based writing ink were placed on rhyolite slabs up to ~ 10 mm thick, and monitored over time for visual dye breakthrough to the lower <b>side.</b> Ink <b>penetration</b> through 0. 5 to 2. 5 -mm-thick slabs was rapid, with breakthrough in minutes to a few hours. Pink rhyolite breakthrough was faster than gray. Thicker slabs, 4 to 10 mm, took hours to three days for breakthrough. Porosity and permeability of the Round Top rhyolite and acid solubility of the yttrofluorite host should permit liberation of YHREEs from the bulk rock by inexpensive heap leaching at a coarse and inexpensive nominal ½-inch (13 -mm) crush size. The rate-limiting step in heap leach extraction would be diffusion of acid into, and back-diffusion of dissolution products out of, the crushed particles. The exceptional porosity and permeability that we document at Round Top suggest {{that there may be}} other crystalline rock deposits that economically can be exploited by a coarse-crush bulk heap leach approach...|$|R

In order to delimit the factory's spatial influence, the distribution of inorganic phosphate in surface sediments was explored and compared with orthophosphate mean concentrations in surface water. Also in order to draw a chronological history for the plant's functioning, the vertical distribution of inorganic phosphate associated with organic compounds (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) distribution in the different levels of sediment down to 15 cm was studied. The concentrations of inorganic phosphate varied from 597 to 2279 ug. g- 1 in the surface sediments of the stations located out of the main outlets' influence (M 1 to M 6 and M 12 to M 13), while they were extremely high, fluctuating between 8068 and 64256 ug. g- 1 at the stations (M 7 to M 10) located under the direct influence of Selaata factory. A significant positive correlation existed between the inorganic phosphate in sediments and the orthophosphate in sea water. The wole studied area was affected by phosphate emissions and was classified into 2 zones: the first one is indirectly touched by the plant's effluents and located to the south and offshore of the factory, and the second directly influenced by the plant's outputs and located to the west and west-northern <b>side.</b> The <b>penetration</b> in different sediment levels showed that at stations located far from the plant's main outlets, there were difficulties in determining any of plant's history because of the homogeneity of phosphate and organic matter distribution associated to strong hydrodynamism.

Cerumen had a weak but statistically significant impact on IETM. The removal of cerumen obturans resulted in a rise in IET of 0. 20 °C (95 % CI 0. 10 - 0. 28 °C, P = 0. 03). The effects of penetration depth (P = 0. 39), side of measurement (P = 0. 78) and impact of acclimatisation (P = 0. 82) were not significant.; Cerumen has a statistically significant, albeit not clinically meaningful, influence on IETM.

40|$|Abstract. Random number {{generators}} (RNGs) play {{a crucial}} role in many cryptographic schemes and proto-cols, but their security proof usually assumes that their internal state is initialized with truly random seeds and remains secret at all times. However, in many practical situations these are unrealistic assumptions: The seed is often gathered after a reset/reboot from low entropy external events such as the timing of manual key presses, and the state can be compromised at unknown points in time via <b>side</b> channels or <b>penetration</b> attacks. The usual remedy (used by all the major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, iOS, etc.) is to periodically replenish the internal state through an auxiliary input with additional randomness harvested from the environment. However, recovering from such attacks in a provably correct and computationally optimal way had remained an unsolved challenge so far. In this paper we formalize the problem of designing an efficient recovery mechanism from state compromise, by considering it as an online optimization problem. If we knew the timing of the last compromise and the amount of entropy gathered since then, we could stop producing any outputs until the state becomes truly random again. However, our challenge is to recover within a time proportional to this optimal solution even in the hardest (and most realistic) case in which (a) we know nothing about the timing of the last state compromise, and the amount of new entropy injected since then into the state, and (b) any premature production of output...|$|R

This high heat input process was aimed at maximising single <b>sided</b> weld metal <b>penetration</b> in a single pass using simple square edge preparations and minimising time consuming handling operations. The evaluation was undertaken by correlating the local microstructure with the local toughness and microhardness of the cap, middle and root of the weld. It was established that the intermetallic phases / carbides present did not appear to have a significantly adverse effect on either corrosion or toughness. The phases observed and confirmed by the use of SAED were predominantly chi (χ) with some sigma(σ). No identifications were made of M 23 C 6 which was observed in other studies of 316 LN welds. A series of impact tests with variations in the notch positions showed that the thickness of the delta ferrite had an effect on the weld metal toughness. As a result of this work it was established that similar volume fractions of delta ferrite did not necessarily produce similar levels of weld metal toughness, but ferrite thickness did appear to have a contributory effect. Welding of 316 LN stainless steel with a single sided single pass submerged arc welding process was satisfactorily undertaken up to 20 mm plate thickness without preheat or post weld heat treatment.

The effect of earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa Sav.) in the hyphal compartment and of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on plant growth and 32 P transfer between plants was investigated. In addition, the effect of mechanical disruption of the hyphal compartment on mycorrhizal plants was studied. AMF did not affect plant growth, although infection levels were high. Earthworms generally increased shoot and root growth; this effect {{did not appear to}} be related to location of earthworm activity. 32 P transfer from the dying root system of labelled ?donor? plants to unlabelled ?receiver? plants was increased where earthworm activity was evident between pots, whereas mechanical disruption eliminated the effect of AMF on 32 P transfer between mycorrhizal plants. Magnitude of transfer was only related to AMF colonisation levels in the donor plant in the absence of earthworms or mechanical disruption. These results suggest that movement of 32 P into the hyphal compartment via the donor AMF mycelium was more important in influencing transfer magnitude than direct transfer via AMF hyphal interconnections between the two plants. Uptake of 32 P by the receiver AMF hyphae appears to have been increased by earthworm activity in the hyphal compartment; it is proposed that earthworm-mediated mobilisation of 32 P, partly contained within the donor AMF mycelium, led to enhanced 32 P availability in the hyphal compartment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} other properties of Salvia Officinalis, {{such as its}} anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hypoglycaemic and antioxidant potential. It is also implicated {{in the prevention of}} neurodegenerative diseases and has several other beneficial effects (1). Salvia Officinalis contains estrogenic substances, sitosterol, vitamins B 1 and C, organic acids etc., which have a theoretically positive effect in the antiaging process. Additionally, our premise was that the anti-aging effects have a solid specific support: the antiglycation effect of Salvia Officinalis (2). MATERIALS AND METHODS Salvia Officinalis volatile oil has been incorporated into an ointment base in order to obtain a cosmetic cream W/O type. A number of three creams were prepared using three different concentrations of Salvia Officinalis volatile oil (0, 5 and 1, 5 respectively). RESULTS In order to characterize the obtained creams, corneometry was used to measure the skin hydration degree. A number of 15 volunteers, aged between 20 and 50 years underwent customer testing. This test has provided information on the left gloss, smoothness, residue, <b>side</b> effects and <b>penetration</b> ability of the three creams, with different concentration of Salvia Officinalis volatile oil. We observed a significant increase (twice the initial value) in the degree of skin hydration in all subjects who used the cream and especially in those who applied the cream containing 1, 5 concentration of Salvia Officinalis volatile oil. CONCLUSIONS The three creams with different concentrations of Salvia Officinalis volatile oil were well tolerated by patients and showed beneficial effects in preventing dehydration and restoration of skin elasticity.

Generally the exogenous application of phytohormones had a stronger impact on host- than on nonhost interactions. Exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA) increased susceptibility of barley to M. oryzae (host-interaction) in nearly all barley cultivars examined. This increased susceptibility after ABA-treatment in host-interaction correlates with a reduced accumulation of autofluorescent material in cell wall appositions (papillae) at <b>penetration</b> <b>sides.</b> Additionally, increased susceptibility of barley to M. oryzae was observed in pharmacological studies by application of 2 -aminoindan-phosphonic acid (AiP); AiP inhibits L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzyme activity, the core enzyme of phenylpropanoid metabolism. After application of AiP the penetration-defense of barley against M. oryzae was reduced as observed by microscopic investigations, which indicates that compounds deriving from phenylpropanoid metabolism, potentially hordatines, are necessary for defense-reactions in barley. An analysis of transcript- accumulation of different genes involved in hordatine- biosynthesis was performed by RT-qPCR during infection of barley with M. oryzae. A histological approach (staining of guanidine compounds) indicates that guanidine containing substances such as hordatines and their precursors contribute to the formation of papillae. Furthermore a barley mutant altered in its wax composition on leaf surface (emr 1) was investigated for alterations of pre- penetration infection structures of different plant-pathogenic fungi. To train students knowledge and understanding of current scientific research methodology in biology the barley-powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, Bgh) system was selected as an example for a plant-pathogen interaction, which was tested for use in school. Based on the results of the interactions of barley with Bgh and Magnapothe, respectively, exercises were designed for students in secondary school. All exercises were developed as a modular system, which contains a variety of methods to make scientific texts for students accessible, to perform scientific experiments or to practice handling scientific models. Education standards (Kultusministerkonferenz, 2004) were taken into account to ensure high quality for each exercise to enable students to gain experience in the appropriate skills and requirements. Furthermore, one possible combination of exercises to a teaching sequence is given to show possibilities for use in secondary school. Some exercises have already been tested in school and were evaluated by students...|$|R
40|$|The {{employment}} {{of renewable energy}} sources is driving an increase {{of the amount of}} embedded generation that is connected to the medium and low voltage distribution networks. This penetration brings new challenges to improve the grid operation, but also concerns because these parts of the grid were not designed to host generation. These energy sources are usually interfaced by power electronic converters, e. g. inverters, which are flexible in terms of control capability. For instance, they can control output currents or voltages, both in phase and amplitude. So, a proper design of the regulators of inverters can improve distribution efficiency and reliability of the grid. Distributed generation can also increase power quality and provide voltage regulation in the distribution grid. For instance, parts of the electric network can be operated intentionally as autonomous networks, when the connection to the mains is lost. In this way, the reliability of the grid can increase and uninterruptible power supply capabilities can be achieved. However, in autonomous or islanded operation the voltage must be managed by the inverters to correctly feed all the loads, since the main control is missing, and the load power has also to be shared among the distributed energy resources. On the other <b>side,</b> the <b>penetration</b> of distributed generation can also be dangerous in some particular cases, if it is not properly managed. For instance, islanded operation can appear also unintentionally and without being expected, because of the local generation. In this case, islanded operation is a problem for the electric grid because it may damage the electric equipment or create safety hazard for the line workers. The probability of unintentional islanded operation has increased due to the newly introduced standards for generators, which in particular impose wider frequency and voltage ranges and active and reactive power support capabilities using of P/f and Q/V droop characteristics. Anti-islanding protections that each inverter is equipped with, may fail to detect the grid transition and so uncontrolled islanded operation may appear. In this scenario, some contributions of this Thesis are related to the islanded operation of parts of the electric grid. First, the unintentional islanding risk is studied considering the newly introduced standards for distributed energy resources and in particular for photovoltaic sources. A potential increase of such phenomenon will be shown and suggestions will be provided in order to reduce this risk. Then, another part of the Thesis addresses the intentional islanded operation. A local controller for inverter of distributed energy resources is presented to manage a part of the grid during grid-connected and autonomous operating modes and also during the transition: during grid-connected operation, the controller tracks active and reactive power references and, during islanded mode, it exploits the droop control properties to share the load among the distributed energy resources. The peculiarity of this regulator {{is that it does not}} need to identify the particular operation mode and so a smooth transition from grid-connected to islanded mode can be achieved with no communication within the power grid or among the disconnecting switch and distributed energy resources. Another important issue in these complex scenarios is the system stability: the interactions of more and more power electronics-interfaced power systems can indeed worsen the power quality and the stability of distribution networks. These phenomena can be addressed by analyzing the source and load impedances at the section of interaction between two subsystems. Well-established approaches exist for DC and three-phase AC networks to analyze the source-load system. Some papers focused also on single-phase AC systems, whose study is generally more difficult due to their time-varying characteristics. Another contribution of this Thesis is an extension of a method to study the stability of single-phase AC power systems, together with its experimental validation. This approach bases on the dynamic phasor method to determine the 2 -dimensional source and load impedances and it addresses the stability with the Generalized Nyquist stability Criterion, previously used to study balanced three-phase AC system stability. Distribution grid stability can be studied also focusing on the high level interactions of its multitude of devices, such as generators and loads, and this can be done considering approximated and general models that can account different types of device. The last contribution of this work is the system stability and dynamic studies of large distribution grids, with large penetration of distributed generation. Simplified models for the single units are linked together in large small-signal models, with a scalable and automatable approach for the dynamic analysis, that can address the study of a grid with a generic number of node, with no more effort by the user. In particular, this activity was done during a visiting research period done by the Author at the Institute Automation of Complex Power Systems of RWTH Aachen University (Germany). The results of this Thesis are given in terms of analytic and simulation studies, together with experimental validations. Also hardware-in-the-loop and real-time simulation approaches have been used for implementation and validation purposes...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} different types of polyethylene, bone cements and one design of uncemented fixation with porous and ceramic coating using radiostereometry, bone densitometry, conventional radiography and clinical parameters. Materials and methods: Study 1 : 201 patients were extracted from 5 prospective randomised studies to evaluate femoral head penetration at two years with radiostereometry in four basic designs, cemented Lubinus and Reflection cups, uncemented Trilogy and Reflection cups. Studies II and III. 60 patients (61 hips) were randomised to receive either highly cross-linked or conventional all PE cups. 32 patients with bilateral arthrosis received hybrid THA with highly cross-linked PE on one side and conventional on the contra lateral <b>side.</b> Femoral head <b>penetration</b> and the migration of the cups were evaluated with radiostereometry in the supine and standing positions. DEXA and conventional radiography were used to {{evaluate the}} bone mineral density and radiolucencies around the cemented acetabular component. Studies IV and V: 90 patients (97 and 96 hips respectively) were stratified depended on age, gender, diagnosis and preoperative BMD to create 3 main groups of socket fixation. In the first group fluoride containing cement was used, in the second group Palacos cum Gentamicin and in the third hybrid THA with porous coated HA/TCP cup. In the hybrid group the fixation of the femoral component was again randomised to either of the two cements. The results on femoral and acetabular sides are presented separately in studies IV and V, respectively. Results: Study I: Cups with polyethylene sterilized in EtO had almost twice the proximal and 3 D penetration rates compared with gamma-sterilized polyethylene. Regression analysis showed that the type of sterilization, age and weight was the most important factors affecting the penetration rate. Studies II and III: In the cemented study the proximal penetration was lower in the study group independent of position at 3 years, while in the hybrid study the penetration was lower in the study group only in the supine position at 2 years. The migration of the cup did not differ between the plastics in both studies. At 2 years the periprosthetic radiolucency and BMD did not differ significantly between the 2 types of PE used in the cemented study. Study IV: The subsidence of the stem did not differ between the groups, but the periprosthetic BMD decreased more in fluoride cement group at 2 years. Conventional radiography revealed higher progression of radiolucent lines in the Palacos group, but only in one region. Study V: The proximal migration of the cup was almost similar in all three groups. The three dimensional migration was increased in patients with osteoporosis. Postoperative radiolucent lines tended to disappear with use of porous coating covered with HA/TCP. Conclusions: Study I: EtO sterilized polyethylene increased the femoral head penetration. Age and weight were also important predictors of the penetration rate. Studies II and III. The highly cross-linked polyethylene decreased the penetration rate mainly after one year probably reflecting less wear. The different mechanical properties of the two types of PE studied did not affect the early fixation of the cemented cup. Study IV: There were no obvious advantage of addition of fluoride to acrylic bone cement when used to fixate the femoral component. Study V: Use of fluoride containing cement or uncemented fixation did not improve the early stability of the socket compared to Palacos with Gentamicin...|$|R
