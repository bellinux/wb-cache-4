40|$|Multimedia Wireless Local Area Networks (MWLANs) {{supporting}} various applications require {{secure communication}} for both multimedia and data applications. With the increased popularity of network and internet applications, {{the need for}} protecting information has emerged among all levels of users. This security issue is much more emphasized in wireless communication scenarios. To minimize the deterioration of multimedia applications performance, the design of security mechanisms for WLANs must consider the WLAN unique characteristics. In addition, malicious attacks can occur in many more locations in the WLAN environment than in a wired network. Therefore, security support functions need to be designed accordingly. ^ In this dissertation, we employ the Security Broker that uses one or more security mechanisms to support reliable end-to-end secure multimedia applications. The introduced Security Broker includes the following novel security mechanisms: Authentication and Privacy Protocols, Re-Authentication Protocol and Inline Security Layer. ^ The Authentication and Privacy Protocol can be applied within the PCF (Point Coordination Function) of IEEE 802. 11 standard. With the integration of polling based PCF {{and the use of}} the <b>session</b> <b>code,</b> we achieve an effective authentication and privacy mechanism. ^ The goal of Re-Authentication Protocol is to provide continuous security support during a specific session. The proposed Re-Authentication Protocol which includes a key exchange procedure has a low computational complexity. ^ Our new Inline Security Layer, is proposed and implemented to support bulk encryption for MWLANs. Instead of using dedicated cryptography hardware, the proposed security layer considers the WLAN characteristics. The proposed and implemented layer has the following advantages: (1) is less expensive to use and implement than dedicated hardware, and (2) is more flexible for upgrades. ^ We have implemented the Security Broker and pursued extensive experimentation. We set up the test platform with two computers that communicated via WLAN adapters. In cases CPU and memory resources are sufficient, we observed no degradation in the multimedia applications quality of service in terms of throughput and delay. Future generation of computers will provide us with abundance in CPU and memory resources. Therefore, we foresee software encryption as a viable approach for wireless LANs that support multimedia applications and communication. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For {{wireless}} multi-hop networks with unicast <b>sessions,</b> most <b>coding</b> opportunities involve {{only two}} or three <b>sessions</b> as <b>coding</b> across many <b>sessions</b> requires greater transmission power to broadcast the coded symbol to many receivers, which enhances interference. This work shows that with a new flowbased characterization of pairwise intersession network coding (coding across two unicast sessions), an optimal joint coding, scheduling, and rate-control scheme can be devised and implemented using only the binary XOR operation. The new scheduling/rate-control scheme demonstrates provably graceful throughput degradation with imperfect scheduling, which facilitates the design tradeoff between the throughput optimality and computational complexity of different scheduling schemes. Our results show that pairwise intersession network coding improves the throughput of non-coding solutions regardless of whether perfect/imperfect scheduling is used. Both the deterministic and stochastic packet arrivals and departures are considered. This work shows a striking resemblance between pairwise intersession network coding and non-coded solutions, and thus advocates extensions of non-coding wisdoms to their network coding counterpart.

To enhance familiarity, pre-observations took place at all LC sites and each observer was trained to code data related to two main observer’s roles: (1) coding transgressions and (2) coding train times. Two “Transgressions” observers per <b>session</b> <b>coded</b> the personal and crossing characteristics of transgressors. They were positioned close to the pedestrian corridors {{on each side of}} the LC and coded: the gender and the approximate age of transgressors; the adopted crossing trajectory; the number of people crossing in groups; and the number of people waiting for the controls to deactivate (compliant crossing behaviour). One other “Train times” observer per session was in charge of coding the exact time (hh/mm/sec) when a train has reached the LC, stopped or left a station as well as the number and types of trains per closure and their respective direction and platform. Depending on the site, “Train Times” observers were positioned at a station (Figs.  4, 5) or at a nearby car park (Fig.  3). The variables related to Closure characteristics (e.g. the exact hour of each control’s activation) were taken either by observers coding train times (Fig.  3) or by observers coding transgressions—where the controls on the two sides of the middle island activate separately (Figs.  4, 5).|$|R

Metroid {{is one of the first}} games to contain multiple endings, with five in total. In the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus Aran appears without her suit, and for the first time, reveals herself to be a woman. In Japan, the Disk Card media used by the Disk System allowed players to save up to three different games in Metroid, similar to the three save slots in The Legend of Zelda in the West. Use of an internal battery to manage files was not fully realized in time for Metroids international release.

40|$|Abstract Background The inverse care law persists: {{people living}} in poverty have the {{greatest}} needs and face considerable challenges in getting the care they need. Evidence reveals that GPs encounter difficulties in delivering care to poor patients, while many of those patients feel stigmatized by healthcare professionals. Patients living in poverty report negative healthcare experiences and unmet healthcare needs. Indeed, {{there is a growing}} recognition in primary care research of the importance of addressing the capabilities and social conditions of the poor when delivering care. Few studies have looked at the factors contributing to effective and "socially responsive" care for {{people living in}} poverty. Methods/Design Our study adopts a qualitative ethnographic approach in four healthcare organizations in deprived areas of metropolitan Montreal (Québec, Canada), using patient shadowing techniques and interviews. Data will be collected through fieldwork observations and informal interviews with patients before and after consultations. We will observe medical consultations, care organization activities, and waiting areas and reception of patients. We will conduct a total of 36 individual interviews with 12 GPs and 24 patients. The interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed for purposes of analysis. The analysis consists of debriefing <b>sessions,</b> <b>coding</b> and interpretive analysis. Discussion This study aims to investigate how positive healthcare interactions between physicians and patients can improve the management of chronic conditions. We hypothesize that factors related to care organization, to healthcare professionals' experience and to patients may enhance the quality of healthcare interactions, which may have positive impacts for preventing and managing chronic conditions. Our study will provide a unique set of data grounded in the perspectives of healthcare professionals and of patients living in poverty. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: As the Internet {{becomes more}} {{important}} for providing health care information to consumers, decision aid developers are increasingly producing or adapting their tools for the Web. To date, however, {{there has been little}} systematic effort to discover how best to make use of this medium when providing patient decision support. The computer usability literature distinguishes between usability (easy to use, find, navigate, etc.), and usefulness (the right information for a specific decision maker) of online information. We will demonstrate a number of methods and techniques for studying the usability and usefulness of online patient decision support, in the context of decision support tools developed for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: The multimedia presentation will demonstrate a number of qualitative and quantitative techniques, drawn from the computer usability and naturalistic decision making traditions, being used in the Ottawa Patient Decision Support Laboratory. The problems and benefits associated with conducting web-based surveys of decision support users will be discussed, as will the role of expert user evaluations. We will demonstrate how the cognitive walkthrough, a standard usability inspection method used to identify components of a task, can be extended to develop a coding scheme (goals, subgoals, and actions required) against which the performance of individual users can be compared. We will also demonstrate how a portable usability laboratory (or lower-tech, less costly versions thereof) can allow access to a rich variety of data sources, including user session transcripts, experimenter field notes, video of the user, and video screen captures of the user <b>session.</b> <b>Coding</b> this rich variety of information at different levels of fidelity will be discussed and demonstrated.

40|$|AIMS: Temperament and impulsivity are {{powerful}} predictors of addiction treatment outcomes. However, a comprehensive assessment {{of these features}} has not been examined in relation to smoking cessation outcomes. METHODS: Naturalistic prospective study. Treatment-seeking smokers (n = 140) were recruited as they engaged in an occupational health clinic providing smoking cessation treatment between 2009 and 2013. Participants were assessed at baseline with measures of temperament (Temperament and Character Inventory), trait impulsivity (Barratt Impulsivity Scale), and cognitive impulsivity (Go/No Go, Delay Discounting and Iowa Gambling Task). The outcome measure was treatment status, coded as "dropout" versus "relapse" versus "abstinence" at 3, 6, and 12 months endpoints. Participants were telephonically contacted and reminded of follow-up face to face assessments at each endpoint. The participants that failed {{to answer the phone}} calls or self-reported discontinuation of treatment and failed to attend the upcoming follow-up <b>session</b> were <b>coded</b> as dropouts. The participants that self-reported continuing treatment, and successfully attended the upcoming follow-up <b>session</b> were <b>coded</b> as either "relapse" or "abstinence", {{based on the results of}} smoking behavior self-reports cross-validated with co-oximetry hemoglobin levels. Multinomial regression models were conducted to test whether temperament and impulsivity measures predicted dropout and relapse relative to abstinence outcomes. RESULTS: Higher scores on temperament dimensions of novelty seeking and reward dependence predicted poorer retention across endpoints, whereas only higher scores on persistence predicted greater relapse. Higher scores on the trait dimension of non-planning impulsivity but not performance on cognitive impulsivity predicted poorer retention. Higher non-planning impulsivity and poorer performance in the Iowa Gambling Task predicted greater relapse at 3 and 6 months and 6 months respectively. CONCLUSION: Temperament measures, and specifically novelty seeking and reward dependence, predict smoking cessation treatment retention, whereas persistence, non-planning impulsivity and poor decision-making predict smoking relapse...|$|R
40|$|Play is {{a natural}} mode of children’s {{expression}} and constitutes a fundamental aspect of their life. Cognitive, affective, and social aspects can be assessed through play, considered as a “window” to observe a child’s functioning. According to Russ’s model, cognitive and affective components and their reciprocal connections can be assessed through the Affect in Play Scale (APS). The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate children’s representations of the three main models of disability (medical, social, and biopsychosocial) and how these models affected cognitive and affective components of children’s play. Sixty-three children, aged 6 – 10 years, were assessed by means of the APS. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two APS task orders: the standard APS task followed by the modified APS task (including a wheelchair toy), or vice versa. The standard and modified APS <b>sessions</b> were <b>coded</b> according to the APS system. The modified APS <b>sessions</b> were also <b>coded</b> for the model of disability expressed by children.
