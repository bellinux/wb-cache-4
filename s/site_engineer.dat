2500|$|The shells were {{constructed}} by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd, {{who were also}} responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes. The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' <b>site</b> <b>engineer</b> supervised {{the construction of the}} shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed [...] "erection arch" [...] to support the different roofs before completion.

By September 1961 an embankment on the outer {{side of the island}} was finished.

Already at the time, Ada was the largest and the most visited swimming and excursion <b>site.</b> , <b>engineer</b> {{and a member of the}} Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts suggested the dual solution for Ada, as both the source of the drinking water and a sports and recreation center. His plan was conducted by 1967 when Ada was connected to the mainland on both the north and south tips, and the lakes of Sava Lake and Taložnik were created. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the first sporting championships were organized, such as the kayaking championships in 1971, prompting the construction of special facilities. The popularity of Ada was further increased in the 1980s with the music and entertainment show Leto na Adi ("Summer on Ada"), televised live by the Radio Television of Serbia.

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Engineering & Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Building (Project Management in Construction). The issues relating to women in construction exist internationally and, over the years they have been analysed from affirmative action Piper (2002) to cultural beliefs Hopkins & McManus (1998) job satisfaction and development Dabke (2008) and perception and professional acceptance Perreault (1992) & Enshassia (2008). In South Africa, following studies have been analysed, Verway (2005) looked at comparative analysis between SA and USA women entrepreneurs in construction, Mjolo-Mncube (2005) analysed opportunities for women in housing and construction, Mahlobo (2006) looked at challenges faced by women contractors in housing construction. However, not much emphasis has been put around hindrances that shorten the professional working life of female <b>site</b> <b>engineers</b> on construction <b>sites</b> in South Africa. The study adopted qualitative research method. Fifteen female <b>site</b> <b>engineers</b> currently working on construction sites for different construction companies were selected for questionnaires and open ended interview questions. Major findings identified discrimination, construction culture, work-conflict, glass ceiling, under representation of women and impact of cultural beliefs to be the hindrances that shorten the professional working life of female <b>site</b> <b>engineers</b> on construction <b>sites.</b> To retain female <b>site</b> <b>engineers</b> in the construction industry, {{it is recommended that}} employers introduce flexible work schedule; introduce mentorship programs and give them the same opportunities as their male counterparts in order to create more diversity in the sector thus increasing creativity and efficiency.

Unfortunately, in the finishing phase of complex construction projects, project planners, <b>site</b> <b>engineers,</b> and construction engineers struggle to use LASs to effectively organize and allocate limited project resources such as crews and rooms {{on a daily basis}} because (1) the LAS generation process is time-consuming, even {{with the help of the}} existing commercial tools; (2) the LASs created are error-prone when the <b>site</b> <b>engineers</b> and project planners need to consider constraints including precedence constraints, room and crew availabilities, and engineering constraints, such as zone and blocking constraints; (3) there is no way to tell whether the LASs created are the best means by which to achieve specific project goals, such as shortest project duration and minimum project cost, even if accurate LASs can be quickly generated.

40|$|AbstractCombined {{treatment}} {{techniques have}} been adopted by many pavement designers and <b>site</b> <b>engineers</b> to improve the strength and stability of subgrades or foundation soils of expansive sites. In this regard, research was conducted to investigate the effect of curing time on strength development of black cotton soil (BC soil) stabilized with 10 % quarry fines (QF) and varying percentages (0 – 16 %) of cement kiln dust (CKD). Preliminary tests such as Atterberg limits, compaction parameter test together {{with a series of}} unconfined compression tests were conducted on soil mixtures. Specimens for unconfined compression tests were prepared at their respective optimum moistures, compacted using British standard light (BSL) compaction effort and tested at curing times of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Data from the study revealed that the curing duration exerted a significant influence on the stress–strain behavior of soil mixtures together with the strain at failure which decreased by about 30 – 50 % as the curing time increased. Unconfined compressive strength data showed improved strength values ranging from 1. 25 to 5. 25 times higher than the value for specimens tested immediately after preparation. Data developed in this study are expected to be useful to pavement designers and <b>site</b> <b>engineers</b> in the field implementation of the stabilization scheme such as when to open the stabilized layer to construction traffic or when to proceed with further construction works...|$|R
