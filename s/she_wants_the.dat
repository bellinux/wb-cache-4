5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant.

She goes to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for help, without telling him the details, and he calls a fellow former volunteer sheriff's deputy named Trevor (Chris Gethard) for assistance. After Trevor shows his credentials, Angela says <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> target murdered, which Dwight protests is too extreme, so they compromise to breaking the target's kneecaps. Dwight realizes the target is Oscar when Angela angrily crushes a cookie given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela. She kicks him in the shin instead. Upset that they do not understand homosexuality, Dwight and Angela go to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), who is confounded by their outlandish questions over homosexual activity.|$|E

She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be {{involved}} and he wants to say it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it. Martha's so scared of losing Jack <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E

She began taking medication and trained on a limited basis from 2003 to 2005, starting about 100 horses in that period, with 15 wins. However, her condition deteriorated. She started only one horse in 2005 and had no starters from 2006 until 2009. In 2008, {{at the age of}} 39, she was placed on a waiting list for a heart transplant.

500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E

500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E

[...] Critics have pointed out that the first verse, repeated as the last verse, exploits three worn-out-sounding cliches, [...] "a hard day's work", [...] "working like a dog" [...] and [...] "sleeping like a log", only to quicken up the pace with a patter-couplet reassuring the singer's girlfriend that his energy and pleasure level have been renewed by her ministrations.|$|E
