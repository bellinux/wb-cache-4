40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a caracterização da resina proveniente da reciclagem pós-industrial de embalagens <b>stand-up</b> <b>pouch</b> (bolsa que fica em pé), com o objetivo de fornecer informações que auxiliem e fomente a reciclagem mecânica de embalagens plásticas flexíveis multicamadas. Estudou-se a estrutura da embalagem <b>stand-up</b> <b>pouch</b> com a seguinte composição: 11, 2 % de Poli(tereftalato de etileno) (PET); 11, 6 % de poliamida (PA); 69, 5 % de polietileno (PE); e 7, 7 % de tintas e adesivos, utilizada para o acondicionamento de produtos cosméticos. A blenda obtida através da reciclagem mecânica do {{material}} foi caracterizada, através dos ensaios mecânicos de resistência a flexão em três pontos (ASTM D 790), resistência ao impacto Izod (ASTM D 256), resistência à tração (ASTM D 638) e dureza shore D (ASTM D 2240); ensaios térmicos como: temperatura de deflexão sob carga (ASTM D 648) e temperatura de amolecimento vicat (ASTM D 1525); ensaios reológicos, índice de fluidez (ASTM D 1238) e análise dinâmico-mecânica (DMA); e analise de propriedades químicas através das imagens da superfície de fratura das amostras feitas com MEV (microscópio eletrônico de varredura) e analise por energia dispersiva (EDS). Os resultados obtidos nos ensaios descritos acima foram comparados aos valores encontrados nas analises feitas com os materiais separadamente e verificou-se que a blenda proveniente da reciclagem de embalagem <b>stand-up</b> <b>pouch</b> é imiscível, que a presença do PET e da PA modificam algumas propriedades mecânicas do material em relação do polietileno (PE) puro, mas, não influenciam nas propriedades térmicas, que foram analisadas por meio dos ensaios de temperatura de deflexão térmica sob carga (HDT) e temperatura de amolecimento (VICAT). The {{objective of}} this work was to study the characterization of the resin from the post-industrial recycling of the <b>stand-up</b> <b>pouch</b> packaging (a bag that stands upright"), {{with the goal of}} providing information that helps and encourages the mechanical recycling of multilayers flexible plastic packaging. We studied the structure of the <b>stand-up</b> <b>pouch</b> packaging with the following composition: 11. 2 % of Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET); 11. 6 % Polyamide (PA); 69. 5 % of polyethylene (PE); and 7. 7 % of paints and adhesives, used for cosmetics packaging. The obtained blend by mechanical recycling of the material was characterized, through mechanical tests of resistance to bending at three point, (ASTM D 790), Izod impact strength (ASTM D 256), tensile strength (AST M D 638) and shore D hardness (ASTM D 2240). Thermal tests as under load deflection temperature (ASTM D 648) and Vicat softening temperature (ASTM D 1525). rheological measurements, melt index (ASTM D 1238), dynamic-mechanical analysis (DMA), analysis of chemical properties through the images of the samples fracture surface made with SEM (scanning electron microscope), and energy dispersive analysis (EDS. The results obtained in the tests described above were compared to the values found in analyzes made with the materials separately, and {{it was found that the}} blend from the recycling package <b>stand-up</b> <b>pouch</b> is immiscible, that the presence of PET and PA helps to increase the mechanical properties of the material relative to the polyethylene (PE) but do not influence the thermal properties, which were analyzed by means of tests of deflection temperature under load (HDT) and Vicat softening temperature (VICAT) ...|$|E

40|$|It can be {{expected}} that many elderly people have impaired opening capacity of food packaging bearing in mind the changes in functionality and physical strength that occur during ageing. This study determined {{the relation of the}} quantitative force required to open selected food packaging systems with findings derived from qualitative focus group studies to retrieve comprehensive information on the specific needs of seniors. The focus group studies revealed that the assessment of the ease of opening is very subjective and can vary from objective measurements. The quantitative measurement of the force required to open the ‘easy to open’ thermoformed tray resulted in considerably higher peel initiation forces of 22. 50 [*]±[*] 1. 62 [*]N compared to the standard tray (12. 80 [*]±[*] 1. 93 [*]N). However, the packaging type was still felt to be easier to open because of the enlarged tab and peeling corner, which was said to be easy to grip. Conversely, the <b>stand-up</b> <b>pouches</b> with twist-off caps could only be opened with difficulty because of the small caps and the difficulty in breaking seals, despite the substantially lower opening forces of 0. 46 [*]±[*] 0. 06 [*]Nm compared with the other torque closures. The evaluation of a package was found to be only partly dependent on the required opening force but strongly influenced by various design factors and consumer's expectations as well as experiences...|$|R
50|$|In the {{consumer}} market, retort pouches have gained great popularity {{outside of the}} United States, particularly in the Pacific Rim region. However, American consumers have evidently demonstrated reluctance regarding the packaging technology, and its adoption has been slow. As a result, many retort packages sold in the United States are packaged in cartons {{to give them an}} appearance more familiar to consumers. Tasty Bite products are an example of a retort pouch product packaged in a carton. Several American food distributors have begun manufacturing foods in retort pouches without cartons, notably tuna canning companies Chicken of the Sea, and Bumble Bee. In 2012, the Campbell Soup Company introduced its Go line of ready-to-eat soups in <b>stand-up</b> retort <b>pouches</b> to American consumers. The product launch came with a marketing campaign targeted toward Millennials, who have shown reluctance to purchasing other Campbell Soup products in the past.|$|R
