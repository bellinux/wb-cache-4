The aphid has displaced the native species Aphis pomi DeGeer in some regions of the country. Its development, from newborn nymph to adult female takes, in laboratory conditions, 9 – 10 days at 22 – 24 °C or 6 – 7 days at 28 – 30 °C. The average fecundity of one female at both temperatures is 9. 5 – 10. 5 nymphs. Under field conditions, in May and July of 2007 and 2008, the full development lasted 8. 1 – 8. 6 days of average, and the average fecundity of one female was 20. 7 – 21. 2 nymphs. About 67 % of them became adults, but more than 20 % of the females died without having progeny. Theoretically, the species could develop twenty and more generations per the vegetation period of apple.
