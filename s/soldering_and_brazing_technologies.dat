50|$|Nanofoil is {{frequently}} used for <b>soldering</b> <b>and</b> <b>brazing,</b> as a heat source. When sandwiched between the components to be joined, either with a foil of solder on each side, using solder precoated components, or using solder-coated NanoFoil, it uniformly delivers {{significant amount of}} heat energy across the entire area, melting the <b>solder</b> <b>and</b> only locally heating {{the surface of the}} substrates, lowering the heat load on the component in comparison with soldering/brazing in a furnace. An externally applied even pressure during reaction and cooling serves to ensure a good homogeneous joint without voids. This process is known as NanoBond. Significantly dissimilar materials can be bonded without cracking: semiconductors, metals, ceramics, and polymers. The energy is deposited very locally, without significant heating of the bulk of the substrates, which reduces problems with mismatched thermal expansion coefficients between the materials and allows their joining at room temperature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper reviews a new, {{low-temperature}} {{process for}} <b>soldering</b> <b>and</b> <b>brazing</b> ceramics to metals {{that is based}} on the use of reactive multilayer foils as a local heat source. The reactive foils range in thickness from 40 µm to 100 µm and contain many nanoscale layers that alternate between materials with large heats of mixing, such as Al and Ni. By inserting a free-standing foil between two <b>solder</b> (or <b>braze)</b> layers <b>and</b> two components, heat generated by the reaction of the foil melts the <b>solder</b> (or <b>braze)</b> <b>and</b> consequently bonds the components. The use of reactive foils eliminates the need for a furnace, and dramatically reduces the heating of the components being bonded. Thus ceramics and metals can be joined over large areas without the damaging thermal stresses that are typically encountered when cooling in furnace soldering or brazing operations. This paper draws on earlier work to review the bonding process and its application to a variety of ceramic-metal systems. Predictions of thermal profiles during bonding and the resulting residual stresses are described and compared with results for conventional soldering or brazing processes. The microstructure, uniformity, and physical properties of the reactive foil bonds are reviewed as well, using several different ceramic-metal systems as examples...|$|R

It {{was concluded}} that the diverse requirements of future space missions (high temperature and extended thermal cycling) might not be met by one approach, such as parallel-gap resistance welding. The panel suggested that other options such as high temperature <b>solders</b> <b>and</b> <b>brazing</b> be considered for the various mission requirements that were anticipated.

40|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} process used to join materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, together.
