25|$|Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court in this case, in which Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Associate Justices Stanley Forman Reed, Robert H. Jackson, and Harold Hitz Burton joined. Associate Justice Hugo Black wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Justice Harlan {{voted with}} the {{majority}} to reverse the lower court but also wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion.</b> Harlan particularly emphasized the special importance of constitutional rights. He presented that it was well-settled, even undeniable, that a suit for injunction based on a constitutional right had been long recognized in the Federal courts. However, a suit for damages should be as or more acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{issued its}} {{decision}} on April 26, 1978, with a 5-to-4 majority {{vote in favor}} of the First National Bank of Boston. Justice Powell delivered the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Stewart, Blackmun, and Stevens, with Burger writing a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion.</b> Justice White was joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall in his dissent, with Justice Rehnquist issuing a separate dissent. The Supreme Court ruled that corporations have First Amendment speech protections extending beyond material commercial interests, reversing the decision made by the Massachusetts Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|Black {{was joined}} in the {{plurality}} opinion by Warren, Douglas and Brennan. Frankfurter and Harlan wrote <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions.</b> Only Justices Clark and Harold H. Burton dissented. The Supreme Court ruled that: ...|$|R
50|$|Resnick, Pfeifer, and Douglas each wrote <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions.</b> For the minority, Moyer's dissent {{acknowledged}} {{problems with}} school funding but questioned whether they actually violated {{the state constitution}} and argued that they were matters for the legislature to handle.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{decided the}} case {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the publisher. Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by all members of the Court except Justice Scalia, who wrote an <b>opinion</b> <b>concurring</b> in the judgment. <b>Separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions</b> were written by Justices White, Blackmun and Kennedy.|$|R
25|$|In United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, {{the court}} held that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to {{regulate}} non-commercial activities. In these cases, Thomas wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause. Subsequently, in Gonzales v. Raich, the court interpreted the Interstate Commerce Clause combined with the Necessary and Proper Clause to empower the federal government to arrest, prosecute, and imprison patients who used marijuana grown at home for medicinal purposes, even where the activity is legal in that particular state. Thomas dissented in Raich, again arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause.|$|E
500|$|District {{court judge}} James M. Burns, sitting by designation, wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> {{in which he}} criticized the [...] "recalcitrance of Washington State officials" [...] in their {{management}} of the state's fisheries. Judge Burns argued that Washington's recalcitrance forced Judge Boldt to act as [...] "perpetual fishmaster" [...] and noted that he [...] "deplore" [...] situations in which district court judges are forced to act as [...] "enduring managers of the fisheries, forests, and highways". In his concluding remarks, Judge Burns argued that Washington's responsibility to manage its natural resources [...] "should neither escape notice nor be forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court held {{that even if}} the trial court {{committed}} error, the error was harmless and that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that Ayala's sentence should be reversed because the exclusion of Ayala's counsel from the hearings [...] "substantially influenced the outcome" [...] of the case. Additionally, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> in which he questioned the propriety of Ayala's placement in solitary confinement. In response, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a one-paragraph concurring opinion in which he stated that Ayala's accommodations were [...] "far sight more spacious than those in which his victims ... now rest".|$|E
50|$|The Court {{held that}} there were no {{violations}} of the Charter. L'Heureux-Dube J. wrote the majority, with La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, and Major JJ. concurring. Both Cory J. and Mclachlin J. wrote <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions.</b> Lamer C.J. and Iaccobucci J. each had separate dissenting opinions.|$|R
2500|$|On June 26, 1997, the Supreme Court issued six {{different}} opinions in a unanimous (9-0) decision. The majority opinion was authored by Chief Justice Rehnquist, and {{was joined by}} Justices O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas. Justice O'Connor wrote a <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion,</b> joined in part by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer filed <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Justice Hugo Black's {{majority}} decision was, however, qualified by the <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions</b> of {{five other}} members of the Court, making it difficult to determine the details and limits of the President's power to seize private property in emergencies. [...] While a concurrence, Justice Robert H. Jackson's opinion is used by most legal scholars and members of Congress to assess executive power.|$|R
500|$|Justice Harlan, {{who agreed}} with the {{decision}} to reverse the Texas court's judgment {{but not with the}} majority's reasoning, wrote a short <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion.</b> He repeated his position that the Due Process Clause did not incorporate the Bill of Rights to the states; rather, the Bill of Rights was a [...] "rational continuum, which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints". He isolated the Texas law's distinction between the co-defendant testifying for the state while being barred from testifying for the defendant as having [...] "no justification". Thus, he rejected holding the trial unconstitutional on Compulsory Process Clause grounds; he argued instead that the State's [...] "arbitrary bar" [...] against a criminal defendant's calling a co-defendant as a witness for his side, while allowing the co-defendant to testify for the prosecution, violated the Due Process Clause.|$|E
500|$|Justice Samuel Alito wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{in which}} he was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. He agreed that {{content-based}} regulations present the same dangers as viewpoint-based regulations because content-based regulations [...] "may interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth". He also agreed that the town's ordinance was [...] "replete with content-based distinctions" [...] that were subject to strict scrutiny. However, Justice Alito wrote separately to emphasize that the Court's opinion would not [...] "prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic objectives". To support his argument, Justice Alito provided a list of examples of content-neutral sign regulations, including: regulations that target the size of signs, regulations that target the locations at which signs may be placed, regulations distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs, regulations that distinguish between the placement of signs on public and private property, rules that restrict the total number of signs [...] "per mile of roadway", and rules that distinguish between freestanding signs and signs that are attached to buildings.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he noted}} that {{his support for the}} majority's opinion was [...] "unqualified", Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> in which he {{questioned}} the propriety of solitary confinement. Justice Kennedy observed that since 1989, Ayala had spent more than twenty five years in solitary confinement. Although the conditions of Ayala's confinement were not established in the record, Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "it is likely [...] has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone". Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood, and questioned, by writers and commentators" [...] and that solitary confinement [...] "bears a further terror and peculiar mark of infamy". Justice Kennedy conceded that [...] "in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates", but that courts should ultimately determine [...] "whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them".|$|E
5000|$|The vote {{to uphold}} the California {{decision}} was unanimous, although four justices disagreed with part of the reasoning in Justice William Rehnquist's opinion for the majority. Justices Thurgood Marshall, Byron White, and Lewis Powell filed <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions.</b> Justice Harry Blackmun filed a brief [...] "statement" [...] indicating that he was joining in all of Justice Rehnquist's opinion except for one sentence.|$|R
50|$|Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court case which {{ruled that}} a Texas statute criminalizing public {{intoxication}} did not violate the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment. It was a 5-4 decision, and the majority opinion was by Justice Thurgood Marshall. Justice Hugo Black and Byron White each wrote <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions,</b> while Justice Abe Fortas dissented.|$|R
5000|$|Stevens and Scalia both wrote <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions.</b> The former felt that, {{under the}} case-by-case {{approach}} Blackmun had advocated in his O'Connor dissent, Quon {{in this case}} knew or should have known all his communications could have come under public scrutiny. Scalia's opinion of the [...] "operational realities" [...] test remained unchanged. He called it [...] "standardless and unsupported" [...] and said the Quon majority [...] "underscores the unworkability of that standard".|$|R
500|$|In his 1910 book, The Constitutional Law of the United States, Westel W. Willoughby {{noted that}} the court's ruling that an {{elective}} office was not property was at odds with previous decisions in which it had assumed jurisdiction in cases between two contestants for an office to determine if due process was granted. By assuming jurisdiction in these cases, Willoughby claimed, the court had given elective offices standing as property. Accordingly, Justice Joseph McKenna issued a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> in which he stated: [...] "I agree fully with those decisions which are referred to , and which hold that as between the State and the office holder there is no contract right either to the term of office or {{to the amount of}} salary, and that the legislature may, if not restrained by constitutional provisions, abolish the office or reduce the salary. But when the office is not disturbed, when the salary is not changed, and when, under the Constitution of the State, neither can be by the legislature, and the question is simply whether one shall be deprived of that office and its salary, and both given to another, a different question is presented, and in such a case to hold that the incumbent has no property in the office, with its accompanying salary, does not commend itself to my judgment." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{her fifth}} year on the court, Sotomayor had become {{especially}} visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity. Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan. In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that [...] "the way to stop {{discrimination on the basis of}} race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race," [...] by stating, [...] "I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis." [...] In the manufacturer liability case of Williamson v. Mazda, which the court decided unanimously, she wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion.</b> Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached. When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, [...] "Neither of them is a shrinking violet". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court stated that: [...] "Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Burger, wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> {{in order}} [...] "to raise some {{questions}} likely to arise {{in this area}} in the future." ...|$|E
50|$|Handed {{down as a}} 6-2 {{decision}} by the Court on June 4, 1951, the judgment and a plurality opinion was delivered by Chief Justice of the United States Fred M. Vinson, who was joined by Justices Stanley Forman Reed, Sherman Minton, and Harold H. Burton. <b>Separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions</b> were delivered by Justices Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson. Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas wrote separate dissenting opinions. Justice Tom C. Clark {{did not participate in}} this case.|$|R
5000|$|Original {{jurisdiction}} {{judgments and}} advisory opinions are delivered {{as a single}} judgment with no dissenting or <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions</b> or judgments allowed and record of the way judges voted in a majority ruling. This ensures that the judges themselves are insulated from excessive political pressure (especially in cases involving multiple member states) by having their individual decisions remain unknown as the judicial decisions are written as though the court is speaking with a single and collective voice.|$|R
5000|$|Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, , was an {{important}} case decided by the United States Supreme Court that laid out a four-part test for determining when restrictions on commercial speech violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Justice Powell wrote {{the opinion of the}} court. Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. had challenged a Public Service Commission regulation that prohibited promotional advertising by electric utilities. Justice Brennan, Justice Blackmun, and Justice Stevens wrote <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions,</b> and the latter two were both joined by Justice Brennan. Justice Rehnquist dissented.|$|R
2500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> {{urging the}} Court to re-evaluate {{the extent to}} which it defers to agency interpretations of statutes. He also wrote, [...] "we should be alarmed that [...] felt {{sufficiently}} emboldened by those precedents to make the bid for deference that it did here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{in which}} she concurred in the Court's judgment, which she {{believed}} {{to be based on}} longstanding precedent, and in the balance of its opinion. [...] However, she wrote separately to express a [...] "large reservation" [...] to the further limitations on standing that the Court had adopted in decisions dating from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, which she believed were not necessary to support the Court's ruling.|$|E
2500|$|Although he [...] "join the majority’s {{opinion in}} full", Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> {{to explain that}} Evans v. United States [...] "may well have been wrongly decided". Justice Breyer wrote that [...] "he present case {{underscores}} {{some of the problems}} that Evans raises", but he ultimately agreed with the majority's conclusion because [...] "we must in this case take Evans as good law". However, Justice Breyer argued that [...] "it is an exceptionally difficult question" [...] whether the Hobbs Act's definition of extortion was equivalent to bribery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{constitution}} is {{interpreted by the}} government and the people. However, the limits of inherent powers were articulated in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)1. This case was a Supreme Court decision limiting the power of the president to seize private property in the absence of either specifically enumerated authority under Article Two of the United States Constitution or statutory authority conferred on him by Congress. However, Justice Black's majority decision was qualified by <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinions</b> of five other members of the Court; this made it difficult to determine the details and limits of the president's power to seize private property in emergencies. Justice Jackson's <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> provided three categories to be considered: ...|$|R

2500|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion signed by seven of his fellow justices. It decided the case purely on the reasonableness of the pager audit, explicitly refusing to consider [...] "far-reaching issues" [...] it raised {{on the grounds that}} modern communications technology and its role in society was still evolving. He nevertheless discussed those issues at some length in explaining why the Court chose not to rule on them, in addition to responding, for argument's sake, more directly to issues raised by the respondents. John Paul Stevens wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion,</b> as did Antonin Scalia, who would have used a different test he had proposed in an earlier case to reach the same result.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari {{to review}} the Sixth Circuit's decision, and {{additionally}} directed the parties to brief and argue {{on the issue of}} whether the plaintiff had the standing to challenge the investment tax credit in federal court. [...] The Court unanimously vacated the Sixth Circuit in part, ruling that it had improperly reached the merits of the case without first determining the issue of standing. [...] In a decision delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by seven justices, the Court held that the status of an individual as a state taxpayer does not establish the standing required by Article III of the United States Constitution for a challenge to state tax laws to be heard in federal court. [...] Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In June 2017, Brown {{authored}} {{an opinion}} for the D.C. Circuit panel that heard, Ahmed Salem Bin Ali Jaber v. United States, dismissing {{the action on}} the basis that the judicial branch did not have the power to question executive decisions in the particular instance of military affairs. The case specifically regarded the unavailability of any constitutional avenue of recourse for the families of those, who though they may be innocent, are killed in targeted drone strikes. However she wrote a <b>separate</b> <b>concurring</b> <b>opinion</b> that criticized this lack of oversight, which is barred by precedent, concluding, [...] "The political question doctrine, and the state secrets privilege confer such deference to the Executive in the foreign relations arena that the Judiciary has no part to play. These doctrines may be deeply flawed." ...|$|E

50|$|The Iowa Law Review {{has been}} widely cited for its legal research, theory, and analysis. Recent notable {{citations}} include the Iowa Supreme Court's citation of an Iowa Law Review student note in its April 2009 decision of Varnum v.

Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa Law Review 735, 775 (1995). Shortly thereafter the United States Supreme Court cited Jenny Roberts, Ignorance Is Effectively Bliss: Collateral Consequences, Silence, and Misinformation in the Guilty-Plea Process, 95 Iowa Law Review 119, 124 n.15 (2009), in its March 2010 decision of Padilla v.

Section 23 uses the pronoun [...] "He" [...] to describe these qualifications, which contributed to the argument that only men could be appointed to the Senate.|$|R
