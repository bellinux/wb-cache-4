5|$|In {{order to}} gather {{research}} for the series, Hoshino once visited New York as <b>she</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> city left a deep influence in her works. She also visited graveyards since she never had resources for the series. The ground zero of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks also left a big impression in her based on the guides' comments. Hoshino commented she would rather go again as {{she did not have}} much time to stay in New York.|$|E

Shetterly {{explains}} that five students have {{claimed to be}} experiencing visions of Saint Mary; <b>she</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> girls involved are unlikely candidates for divine visions, particularly the trouble-making Clare McKenna (Genele Templeton). Black speaks to the girls, who claim to have had visions during a sermon by Reverend Hanes; Hanes' son Alex refutes this. Black returns to Shetterly's office, and is met by Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who works {{with her husband in}} the Millennium Group. Means {{explains that}} the Group has explored many such reported visions.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{departure}} from parliament at the 2013 election, Gillard has remained engaged with the Labor Party. After Labor's defeat {{at the federal}} election held in September 2013, Gillard penned an op-ed for Guardian Australia, wherein she wrote about her legacy and how <b>she</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> Labor Party ought to rebuild. In June 2015, Gillard participated in Sarah Ferguson's The Killing Season, a three-part documentary series which chronicles {{the events of the}} Rudd–Gillard years in power. The television series featured in-depth interviews with key Labor Party officials during the Rudd–Gillard Governments. Prior to the 2016 election campaign, Gillard offered her assistance to the Labor party, whereby a video was released of her endorsing and seeking donations for the party's education policy. She later joined former Labor Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating at Bill Shorten's Labor campaign launch on 19 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) {{continues}} {{looking into}} the mysterious woman who had a secret affair with Harry (James Remar), her and Dexter's father. An old informant of Harry takes Debra to the woman's house, which Debra recognizes as the house of Brian Moser. Moser was the Ice Truck Killer, the main villain from the first season who was engaged to Debra, then tried to kill her.

The police discovered the real identity of Trinity, and at Arthur's house, Debra confronts Dexter, who feigns surprise and fears Debra is close to realizing his secret life as a serial killer.

5|$|To Rae's displeasure, {{her school}} is soon merged with Newt's. She rebuffs his {{attempts}} to talk to her, and after gaining employment at the local diner, is further dismayed to find that Newt works there. She tries to have him fired, but eventually accepts that they must work together. After she is locked in a cupboard by Lauren, Rae reveals that she is claustrophobic and believes she is cursed.

5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but <b>she</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E
25|$|Even {{those who}} oppose Crossan’s theory, like Deconick, find {{themselves}} confused when attempting to locate the possible source for Thomas.

Allred stated <b>she</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> defense will try to use the deposition against Shapiro to find discrepancies in the upcoming criminal trial. Cosby attorney Angela Agrusa is opposing this motion. The Judge in the civil case is expected to rule on November 4 on whether or not the deposition will take place.|$|E

Gervaise goes anyway, and Constance follows him. Daniel, Mandy and Fergus rush after them on mountain bikes.

500|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear, {{author of}} Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature [...] observes that Potter had great affection for Peter Rabbit, but the sequels never held {{quite the same}} appeal for her because neither sprang to life from story and picture letters to {{children}} {{in the manner of}} Peter Rabbit. <b>She</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> sequels lack the sort of vitality that distinguishes Peter.|$|E
500|$|Pound's {{antisemitism}} has soured {{evaluation of}} his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism {{is perceived as}} apologetic. <b>She</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> positioning of Pound as [...] "National Monster" [...] and [...] "designated fascist intellectual" [...] made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the Holocaust possible by aiding or standing by.|$|E

A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook.

500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous and {{valuable}} writing {{on the walls of}} the church is a Cyrillic inscription on the south wall of the premises south of the narthex, conventionally known as the baptistery. The inscription was clumsily written on top of a mortar putty and says in translation: [...] "Church of Saint John, built by chartophylax Paul". Despite being dated to the 10th century and its mention of the church's dedication and its potential donor, it cannot be described a classic donor's inscription because of its unnatural location and clumsy writing. Nikolova considers it more likely that the author of the inscription was a literate person who served under chartophylax Paul and desired to spread his fame. <b>She</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> text may refer to the construction of the narthex only rather than the whole church, because she is of the opinion that the narthex may have been added after the building of the rotunda.|$|E
