5000|$|Common manual <b>safeties</b> for {{shotguns}} include button <b>safeties</b> {{located near}} or {{in front of}} the trigger guard and tang <b>safeties</b> located at the top rear (or [...] "tang") of the receiver.

5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and <b>safeties</b> (S). <b>Safeties</b> are themselves divided into free <b>safeties</b> (FS) and strong <b>safeties</b> (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while <b>safeties</b> line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. <b>Safeties</b> are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Safeties</b> can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} subtypes such as internal <b>safeties</b> (which typically do not receive input from the user) and external <b>safeties</b> (which typically allow the user to give input, for example, toggling a lever from [...] "on" [...] to [...] "off" [...] or something similar). Sometimes these are called [...] "passive" [...] and [...] "active" [...] <b>safeties</b> (or [...] "automatic" [...] and [...] "manual"), respectively.|$|R
5|$|A {{follow-up}} {{study found that}} the optimum duration for the deep <b>safety</b> stop under the experimental conditions was 2.5 minutes, with a shallow <b>safety</b> stop of 3 to 5 minutes. Longer <b>safety</b> stops at either depth did not further reduce PDDB.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the Chinese authorities found that the plant had been lacking any major <b>safety</b> features and was severely below regulation benchmarks, with the direct cause of the accident being attributed to inappropriate use of substandard equipment. The investigation also concluded that the various other <b>safety</b> failings at the facility were contributing factors. The report went on to criticize <b>safety</b> standards all throughout the Chinese steel industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} Cover 4 scheme {{involves}} 2 CBs and 2 <b>safeties.</b> Upon snap, the CBs work for depth, backpedaling into their assigned zone. Both <b>safeties</b> backpedal towards their assigned zone.|$|R
500|$|In American football, {{intentionally}} conceded <b>safeties</b> are {{an uncommon}} strategy. Teams have utilized elective <b>safeties</b> to gain field {{position for a}} punt when pinned deep in their own territory and, when ahead {{near the end of}} a game, to run down the clock so as to deny the other team a chance to force a turnover or return a punt. Teams have also taken intentional <b>safeties</b> by kicking a loose ball out the back of their end zone, with the intent of preventing the defense from scoring a touchdown.|$|R

5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{disaster}} nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring <b>safety</b> standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off <b>safety</b> measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's <b>safety</b> if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's <b>safety,</b> saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E

The Institution runs sea and beach <b>safety</b> sessions for young people, particularly in inner-city areas; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach <b>safety,</b> and over 800 children a week receive training. 500 children were taught to swim in 2014. In {{an effort to reduce}} the estimated 400,000 drownings a year worldwide, {{more than half of them}} children, the RNLI extends practical or strategic <b>safety</b> advice to lifesaver organisations overseas, in some cases providing training at the Lifeboat College.|$|E

5|$|Occupational {{health and}} <b>safety</b> {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling {{a variety of}} toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous <b>safety</b> program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included <b>safety</b> off the job, in homes and in the schools. <b>Safety</b> indoctrination was included in job training, and <b>safety</b> training courses were held. <b>Safety</b> posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National <b>Safety</b> Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to <b>Safety</b> in recognition of its <b>safety</b> record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic <b>Safety</b> Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road <b>safety</b> record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E

5000|$|Doug’s {{best season}} came in 1983, when he {{recorded}} 13 sacks and two <b>safeties,</b> making him {{only one of}} 17 NFL players to record two <b>safeties</b> in a single season. That year, the Lions won the NFC Central Division title with a 9-7 mark, and lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 24-23, in the divisional round. Upon the arrival of new coach Darryl Rogers in 1985, English was moved to nose tackle in the team’s new 3-4 defensive alignment. His career ended after that season due to a serious neck injury. He finished his career with 59 sacks, which still places him sixth on the Lions’ all-time list. He was named All-Pro three times (1981, 1983-84) and went to four Pro Bowls (1979, 1982-84). English had 4 <b>safeties</b> throughout his career, tying him with Ted Hendricks and Jared Allen for the most <b>safeties</b> in NFL history.|$|R

5|$|<b>Safety</b> {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple <b>safety</b> systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car <b>safety</b> systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a <b>safety</b> precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This <b>safety</b> feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
