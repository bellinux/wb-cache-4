The authors propose that <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> are required to deliberately establish and maintain positive relationships with their teachers while also developing a positive school culture. The framework demonstrates the strong influence that <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> have on their relationships with teachers, and in turn the interconnectedness between these relationships and the school culture. It also shows how a positive school culture enables <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> to create opportunities and support teachers to develop both personally and professionally, and grow as leaders from within their schools.

2500|$|The {{general idea}} of value added {{modeling}} {{has also been}} extended to consider principals and school leaders. [...] While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion {{about the importance of}} school leaders, there has been very little systematic research into the impact of them on student outcomes. [...] Recent analysis in Texas has provided evidence about the effectiveness of leaders by looking at how the gains in student achievement for a school change after the principal changes. [...] This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. [...] The early research in Texas finds that principals have a very large impact on student achievement. [...] Conservative estimates indicate that an effective <b>school</b> <b>leader</b> improves the performance of all students in a school, with the magnitude equal on average to two months additional learning gains for the students in each school year. [...] These gains come at least in part through the principal's impact on selecting and retaining good teachers. [...] Ineffective principals, however, have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important with respect to school leadership as they are for teachers.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not tell}} anyone of her new {{interest}} in life. Strongest in that student community, she had used her power with good-nature enough to win the popularity of a <b>school</b> <b>leader,</b> and occasionally with unscrupulousness enough to secure the privileges of a school bully. Popularity and privilege, however, only satisfied {{her when she was}} in the mood for them. Girls, like men, want to be petted, pitied, and made much of, when they are diffident, in low spirits, or in unrequited love. These are services which the weak cannot render to the strong and which the strong will not render to the weak, except when there is also a difference of sex. Agatha knew by experience that though a weak woman cannot understand why her stronger sister should wish to lean upon her, she may triumph in the fact without understanding it, and give chaff instead of consolation. Agatha wanted to be understood and not to be chaffed. Finding herself unable to satisfy both these conditions, she resolved to do without sympathy and to hold her tongue. She had often had to do so before, and she was helped on this occasion by a sense of the ridiculous appearance her passion might wear in the vulgar eye. Her secret kept itself, as she was supposed in the college to be insensible to the softer emotions. Love wrought no external change upon her. It made her believe that she had left her girlhood behind her and was now a woman with a newly-developed heart capacity at which she would childishly have scoffed a little while before. She felt ashamed of the bee on the window pane, although it somehow buzzed as frequently as before in spite of her. Her calendar, formerly a monotonous cycle of class times, meal times, play times, and bed time, was now irregularly divided by walks past the chalet and accidental glimpses of its tenant.|$|E

Identifying the agency of <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> in enacting policy imperatives to 'know Asia' creates space to imagine localised narrative possibilities that negotiate and potentially challenge policy agendas. Accounts of policy work by <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> are heteroglossic and densely intertextual in their mobilisation and collocation of discourses. A metaphor of a frog in a well is taken up to translate policy in locally specific ways that make it {{much more than a}} template of externally devised policy.

The population of school-aged Hispanic children is already the largest ethnic group, and the sheer number and rate of increase of these linguistically and culturally different students creates unfamiliar cultural challenges for <b>school</b> <b>leaders.</b> <b>School</b> districts are confronted with diversity-related issues and <b>school</b> <b>leaders,</b> who are predominantly white and middle class, are often ill-prepared to meet the challenges. Effective professional development aimed at preparing <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> to better understand the social and academic needs of culturally diverse students is a topic receiving much attention in recent years. Studying the social, cultural, and political circumstances of diversity in its natural setting offers particular advantages that other methods cannot replicate. One suggestion is for <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> to spend time in the local communities of their Hispanic students. Another option for learning about culture, albeit a more difficult and costly one to achieve, is to have <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> visit the home country of their Hispanic students and immerse themselves in the local culture for a short period of time.

Public data within the district indicated increasing incidents of students 2 ̆ 7 antisocial behaviors. However, perceptions of <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> regarding this problem were not known.

Using an instrumental case study, the research questions explored <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> 2 ̆ 7 experiences in working with students who failed to manage their behavior and who exhibited antisocial behavior. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 13 <b>school</b> <b>leaders</b> in the district, and an iterative, inductive process of data collection, open coding, and thematic analysis was used.
