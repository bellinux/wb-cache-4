50|$|A Turing switch {{consists}} of a switched fabric, one or more ingress interfaces (also referred to as sources), one or more egress interfaces (sinks), and a decision procedure to determine an egress interface given an ingress interface. Interfaces are {{sometimes referred to as}} ports. A packet (cell or switched unit) arrives at an ingress interface, the appropriate egress interface is determined by the decision procedure, and the packet is then transported across the switching fabric to the egress interface. A packet is a symbol or sequence of 1's and 0's. An ingress interface is connected to an ingress <b>line</b> and an <b>egress</b> interface to an <b>egress</b> <b>line.</b> The ingress line is said to feed the ingress interface; the egress interface feeds the <b>egress</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} examples, the line cards hold a full {{copy of the}} supervisor's routing tables locally, {{as well as its}} own L2 adjacency table (i.e. MAC addresses). This eliminates the need for any connection to the classic bus or requirement to use the shared resource of the supervisor. In this instance, an ingress packet is queued, but its destination looked up locally. The packet is then sent across the switch fabric, queued in the <b>egress</b> <b>line</b> card before being sent.|$|R

50|$|This {{method of}} {{forwarding}} was first introduced with the Supervisor 2 engine. When used in combination with a switch fabric module, each line card has an 8Gbit/s connection to the switch fabric and additionally {{a connection to the}} classic bus. In this mode, assuming all line cards have a switch fabric connection, an ingress packet is queued as before and its headers are sent along the dBus to the supervisor. They are looked up in the PFC (including ACLs etc.) and then the result is placed on the rBus. The initial <b>egress</b> <b>line</b> card takes this information and forwards the data to the correct line card along the switch fabric. The main advantage here {{is that there is a}} dedicated 8 Gbit/s connection between the line cards. The receiving line card queues the egress packet before sending it from the desired port.|$|R

40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of Internet traffic {{has created an}} acute demand for networks of ever increasing throughput. Besides raw throughput, modern mutlimedia applications also demand Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Both of these requirements result in {{a new generation of}} switches and routers, which use specialized hardware to support high speeds and advanced QoS. This thesis studies one of the subsystems of such switches/routers, namely queue management in the ingress and <b>egress</b> <b>line</b> cards at OC- 192 (10 Gbps) line rate. The provision of QoS guarantee usually requires flow isolation, which is often achieved using per-flow queueing. The implementation of a queue manager, supporting thousands of flows and operating at such high speed, is challenging. We study thoroughly this issue and we show that the queue manager implementation is feasible by using advanced hardware techniques, similar to those employed in the supercomputers of the 60 's and in modern microprocessors. We use DRAM technology for buffer memory in order to provide large buffer space. To effectivel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Combined input-crosspoint {{buffered}} (CICB) packet <b>switches</b> with <b>dedicated</b> crosspoint buffers {{require a}} {{minimum amount of}} memory in the buffered crossbar of N 2 × k × L, where N {{is the number of}} ports and k is the crosspoint buffer size, which is defined by the distance between the line cards and the buffered crossbar, to achieve 100 % throughput under highspeed data flows. A long distance between these two components can make a buffered crossbar costly to implement. In this paper, we study a shared-memory crosspoint buffered packet switch that uses small crosspoint buffers and no speedup to support differentiated services and long distances between the line cards and the buffered crossbar in practical implementations. The proposed switch requires a buffer memory of 1 of that in a m CICB <b>switch</b> with <b>dedicated</b> crosspoint buffers to achieve similar throughput performance to that of a CICB switch.

50|$|And finally {{you need}} the fabric cabling that will carry the actual data or payload between the line card chassis and the switch fabric chassis. For the {{interconnection}} the system uses 8 fabric planes, numbered 0 to 7. In combination with that it uses a 3 components or stages. When a packet arrives via an interface on a linecard in a LCC (the ingress FCC) it is on stage 1, then goes to the switch-fabric (stage 2) {{and then to the}} destination line-card (stage 3).It is of course possible that the linecard of the ingress resides in the same shelf as the <b>egress</b> <b>line</b> card, but this same 3 stage model is being used.In the LCC's you use stage 1 and 3 cards: S13 cards. In a SFC you have stage 2 cards S2. In a single SFC setup all 8 S2 cards reside in the single SFC, in a multi SFC setupthe S2 cards are distributed over the SFC's. For the communication based on two line-card chassis you will need 72 fibres (3(S1,2,3) x 8(#planes) x 3(2xLCC+1FCC). Even when you have more than one SFC you still use 72 cables: in a two SFC setup 50% of the fibres from LCC connect to SFC1 and 50% to SFC2 and similar to a 4 node system).These cables can be ordered in lengths of 10-100 meters in steps of 5 meters, and come in sets of 24. Thus to interconnect a system you need 3 sets of the required length In the future configurations with more than two LCC's will be supported, but currently a multi-shelf configuration supports two line card chassis and 1,2 or 3 switch fabric chassis.|$|R
