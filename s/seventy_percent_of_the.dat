5|$|Dian was conquered {{during a}} {{military}} campaign launched by Han Wudi in 109 BCE, and the Yizhou commandery {{was established in}} the former kingdom. Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian's imperial seal inscribed by the Han, confirming Dian's surrender and status as a subject of the Han. The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–35 BCE. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9-23 CE, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. <b>Seventy</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers in one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and with double the supplies, was not fruitful. Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176.|$|E

The debt was borrowed by the private company that was given a concession to operate a toll plaza on the Inderøy side. Including interest, NOK80 million was collected, and the bridge was paid off three years before schedule. The Vanvikan-based company was disestablished following the closure of the plaza. Until only a few years before the closing, it was the only toll plaza in Nord-Trøndelag. There were several price increases during the toll period. The bridge was free for pedestrians and cyclists, but all motor vehicles were charged, although discounts were available for frequent travelers. The plaza was manned, and did not take into use Autopass, like many other plazas.|$|E
5|$|In Cabo San Lucas, Jimena {{produced}} little damage. However, {{the entire}} town of Punta Chivato were flooded and damaged, with some being destroyed. In addition, 75% of homes were damaged in Puerto San Carlos, and power was lost in many areas including Comondú and Loreto. In the town of Puerto Lopez Mateos, half of the cannery buildings were destroyed and every wood home was destroyed, thus leaving {{a quarter of the}} population homeless. Nearby, the storm nearly destroyed two isolated villages, Punta Abreojos village and Laguna San Ignacio. Both areas got hit by Jimena at its first landfall. Although in Bahia Asuncion damages was minor, the villages of Abreojos and San Ignacio Lagoon were badly damaged. <b>Seventy</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electric network form Santa Rosalía to Ciuadad Constitución was damaged due to power outages. In both of the towns, the Mexican Red Cross branches received some damage. The roads from San José del Cabo to Tijuana was affected because any nearby creeks overflowed their banks. The airports in Los Cabos, La Paz and Loreto and ports were briefly closed, but were later re-opened after the storm passed since the airports received only minimal damage.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade {{carried out}} a brigade-sized {{parachute}} landing during Operation Dragoon. On 15 August 1944 the brigade's pathfinders landed {{in the south of}} France and set up Eureka beacons to guide the main brigade force to their drop zones. Despite the pathfinders' success at marking the drop zones, only seventy-three planes placed their parachutists in the correct location. The brigade commanding officer and eighty men were landed near Fayence, as were the 5th (Scottish) Battalion's commanding officer, with half of battalion headquarters, 'C' Company, and 'D' Company. Other men were landed as far away as Cannes. The dispersed landings resulted in only about forty percent of the 4th Battalion making it to the brigade forming-up point. Only <b>seventy</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6th (Welch) Battalion and only a single company of the 5th (Scottish) Battalion had arrived. The brigade headquarters was established at Le Mitan with the 5th (Scottish) Battalion company by 04:00, and by 07:30 the 4thBattalion had occupied the heights at Le Muy. The 6th (Welch) Battalion occupied La Motte and, when the Germans at Clastron surrendered, moved a company into the village. Le Serres was captured by 'C' Company, 4th Battalion, as was the bridge over the River Naturby on the road to Le Muy.|$|E

Material and methods : Twenty subjects with chronic upper patellar tendinopathy benefited from 1 infiltration <b>of</b> PRP. <b>The</b> follow-up (up to 1 year) was assessed by means of a Visual Anologue Scale (VAS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form and <b>the</b> Victorian Institute <b>of</b> Sport Assessment (VISA-P) score.

Before the 1980s, about <b>seventy</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipality’s population was dedicated to agriculture. The major shift away from this occurred in the 1980s, because of the complex, but the trend continues. Eighty eight percent of workers who are not self-employed work in manufacturing.

According to the Singapore Pork Merchants' Association, about <b>seventy</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pork-consuming population preferred fresh to frozen pork at the time of the campaign. The Frozen Pork Hotline was deemed a failed project, with virtually nobody calling it.

25|$|From 1000 to 1300 the {{population}} increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300 <b>seventy</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land {{was owned by}} the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times {{and not being able}} to repay. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.|$|E

High-quality paper by known artisans can sell for as high as USD $500 on the international market. The dependence on local wholesalers led to socio-economic stratification in the town, with the wholesalers receiving more profit off the paper than the producers. It is estimated that today about fifty percent of production ultimately goes to Nahua painters, with about <b>seventy</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting paintings sold in Mexico.
