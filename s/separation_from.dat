He opposed allocating men or supplies for George Rogers Clark's proposed attack upon the Spanish at New Orleans. The attack was promoted by Edmond-Charles Genêt, and Marshall accused sitting governor Isaac Shelby of complicity in the matter.|$|E

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> {{the mother is}} {{characteristic}} of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> the care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sudden {{onset of}} a cue {{triggers}} visual attention, which then enhances visual processing {{in the zone}} near the cue. This enhancement causes a motion illusion in subsequent stimuli presented near the cue. At greater <b>separations</b> <b>from</b> the cue, the illusory motion reverses direction, indicating prolonged processing speed. Measurements of the strength and direction of illusory motion at increasing <b>separations</b> <b>from</b> the cue reveal an attentional ‘perceptive field’ with an excitatory center at the locus cued and an inhibitory surround subtending the remaining visual field. These findings help explain the traditional attentional ‘benefits’ and ‘costs’ of attention...|$|R

5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt <b>separation</b> <b>from</b> caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
