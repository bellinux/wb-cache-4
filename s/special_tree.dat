40|$|With {{the help}} of various square principles, we obtain results {{concerning}} the consistency strength of several statements about trees containing ascent paths, <b>special</b> <b>trees,</b> and strong chain conditions. Building on a result that shows that Todorčević's principle (κ) implies an indexed version of (κ,λ), we show that for all infinite, regular cardinals λ<κ, the principle (κ) implies {{the existence of a}} κ-Aronszajn tree containing a λ-ascent path. We then provide a complete picture of the consistency strengths of statements relating the interactions of trees with ascent paths and <b>special</b> <b>trees.</b> As a part of this analysis, we construct a model of set theory in which ℵ_ 2 -Aronszajn trees exist and all such trees contain ℵ_ 0 -ascent paths.

40|$|For a fixed digraph H, the H-coloring {{problem is}} the problem of {{deciding}} whether a given input digraph G admits a homomorphism to H. The CSP dichotomy conjecture of Feder and Vardi is equivalent to proving that, for any H, the H-coloring problem is in in P or NP-complete. We confirm this dichotomy for a certain class of oriented trees, which we call <b>special</b> <b>trees</b> (generalizing earlier results on special triads and polyads). Moreover, we prove that every tractable <b>special</b> oriented <b>tree</b> has bounded width, i. e., the corresponding H-coloring problem is solvable by local consistency checking. Our proof relies on recent algebraic tools, namely characterization of congruence meet-semidistributivity via pointing operations and absorption theory.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the Aronszajn and <b>special</b> Aronszajn <b>trees,</b> their {{existence}} and nonexistence. We introduce {{the most common}} definition of <b>special</b> Aronszajn <b>tree</b> {{and some of its}} generalizations and we examine the relations between them. Next we study the notions of the tree property and the weak tree property at a given regular cardinal κ. The tree property means that there are no Aronszajn trees at κ and the weak tree property means that there are no <b>special</b> Aronszajn <b>trees</b> at κ. We define and compare two forcings, the Mitchell forcing and the Grigorieff forcing, and we use them to obtain a model in which the (weak) tree property holds at a given cardinal. At the end, we show how to use the Mitchell forcing to construct a model in which the (weak) tree property holds at more than one cardinal. ...|$|R
