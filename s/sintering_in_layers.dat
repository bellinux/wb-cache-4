Normal emittance spectra in 2. 5 - 25 μm wavelength region and total normal emittance are measured on four kinds of ash at 600 ~ 1100 K in heating and cooling processes. Ash layers are opaque for infrared radiation in the heating process of the powder. Emittance increases with an increase of wavelength and temperature, irrespective of chemical composition. Total emittance decreases with an increase of temperature. Emittance of sintered layers is higher after the <b>sintering.</b> <b>In</b> an ash <b>layer,</b> semi-transparency occurs with the sintering.

Sandia is currently developing a process called Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS~) to fabricate filly dense metal parts dwectly from computer-aided design (CAD) solid models. The process is similar to traditional laser-initiated rapid prototyping technologies such as stereolithography and selective laser <b>sintering</b> <b>in</b> that <b>layer</b> additive techniques are used to fabricate physical parts directly from CAD data. By using the coordinated delivery of metal particles into a focused laser beam apart is generated. The laser beam creates a molten pool of metal on a substrate into which powder is injected. Concurrently, the substrate on which the deposition is occurring is moved under the beam/powder interaction zone to fabricate the desired cross-sectiwal geometry. Consecutive layers are additively deposited, thereby producing a three-dmensional part. This process exhibits enormous potential to revolutionize the way in which metal parts, such as complex prototypes, tooling, and small-lot production parts, are produced. The result is a comple~ filly dense, near-net-shape part. Parts have been fabricated from 316 stainless steel, nickel-based alloys, H 13 tool steel, and titanium.

5000|$|Material {{is put on}} a <b>sinter</b> machine <b>in</b> two <b>layers.</b> The bottom <b>layer</b> {{may vary}} <b>in</b> {{thickness}} from 30 to 75 mm. A 12 to 20 mm sinter fraction is used, {{also referred to as}} the hearth layer. The second, covering layer consists of mixed materials, making for a total bed height of 350 to 660 mm. The mixed materials are applied with drum feeders and roll feeders, which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sinterring machine [...] The upper layer is smoothed using a leveler. The material, also known as a charge, enters the ignition furnace into rows of multi-slit burners. In the case of one plant, the first (ignition) zone has eleven burners. The next (soaking/annealing) zone typically offers 12 burners. Air is sucked {{from the bottom of the}} bed of mixed material throughout the sintering machine. Fire penetrates the mixed material gradually, until it reaches the hearth layer. This end point of burning is called burn through point (BTP). The hearth layer, which is nothing but <b>sinter</b> <b>in</b> smaller size, restricts sticking of hot sinter with pallets. BTP is achieved in a certain zone of sinter machine, to optimize the process, by means of several temperature measuring instrument placed throughout the sinter machine. After completion of burning, the mix converts into sinter, which then breaks into smaller size by sinter breaker. After breaking into small sizes, it cools down in cooler (linear or circular) by means of forced air. At discharge of sinter cooler, temperature of sinter is maintained as low, so that the hot sinter can be transported by a conveyor belt made of rubber. Necessary precautions are taken to trace any existence of fire in the belt and necessary extinguishing is done by spraying water. Then this product is being passed through a jaw-crusher, where the size of sinter is further reduced (~ 50 mm) into smaller size. Then the complete mixture is being passed through two screens. Smallest sinter fines (< 5 mm) are stored in proportioning bins and reused for preparing sinter again through mixing and nodulizing drum and fed to sinter machine for burning. A part of the smaller one ( [...] 5 - 20 mm) is used for hearth <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> <b>sinter</b> machine and the rest is taken to the blast furnace along with the biggest sized sinters.|$|R

40|$|The major aim of {{this study}} is to assess the effects of {{sintering}} of initially porous material on the thermal evolution of planetesimals, and to constrain the values of basic parameters that determined the structure and evolution of the H chondrite parent body. A new code is presented for modeling the thermal evolution of ordinary chondrite parent bodies that initially are highly porous and undergo sintering by hot pressing as they are heated by decay of radioactive nuclei. The pressure and temperature stratification in the interior of the bodies is calculated by solving the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and energy transport. The decrease of porosity of the granular material by hot pressing due to self-gravity is followed by solving a set of equations for the sintering of powder materials. For the heat conductivity of granular material we combine recently measured data for highly porous powder materials, relevant for the surface layers of planetesimals, with data for heat conductivity of chondrite material, relevant for the strongly <b>sintered</b> material <b>in</b> deeper <b>layers.</b> To demonstrate the capability of our new model, the thermal evolution of the H chondrite parent body was reconstructed. The model starts with a porous body that is later compacted first by 'cold pressing' at low temperatures and then by 'hot pressing' for temperatures above ≈ 700 K, i. e., the threshold temperature for sintering of silicates. The thermal model was fitted to the well constrained cooling histories of the two H chondrites Kernouve (H 6) and Richardton (H 5). Comment: 19 pages 12 figures submitted to A&...|$|R
40|$|Austenitic, {{ferritic}} and {{duplex stainless}} steels obtained through powder metallurgy technology were <b>sintered</b> <b>in</b> vacuum. Powders were compacted at 650 or 750 MPa and <b>sintered</b> <b>in</b> vacuum with two sinter-cooling rates (furnace- and water-cooling). Mechanical properties, using tensile testing and hardness measurements were evaluated. A full microstructural {{study of the}} three types of stainless steels was performed. The mechanical behavior was a function of the sinter-cooling rate and the chemical composition. Duplex stainless steel showed the best mechanical behavior. The use of high compaction pressure and water-cooling process promoted the best mechanical results for all compositions. 2030 - 01 - 012030 - 01 - 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{sintering}} {{behavior of}} 17 - 4 PH stainless steel feedstock for {{metal injection molding}} was investigated in the temperature range of 6502 ̆ 0131050 0 C.

Results showed that when <b>sintered</b> <b>in</b> the hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere, the 17 - 4 PH feedstock was oxidized over the temperature range of investigation. The degree of oxidization increased with the sintering temperature. The main oxidization product was Cr 2 O 3 as revealed by X-ray diffraction and composition analysis.

The samples were sintered via the conventional method of heating, in the field of microwave radiation and spark plasma. The experimental data indicates that a microwave field and spark plasma have a stimulating effect on zirconia ceramics <b>sintering.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the microwave sintering, spark plasma sintering provides ceramics with improved properties at similar time-temperature annealing modes. Moreover, the properties of the ceramics under spark plasma sintering at T= 1300 °C are similar to the properties of the ceramics <b>sintered</b> <b>in</b> a microwave field at T= 1400 °C...|$|R
