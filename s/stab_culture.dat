40|$|The {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Proteus is still to some extent controversial, although recent investi-gations have clarified the position considerably. The basis of the modern work was the demonstration by Moltke (1927) that 194 Proteus strains all rapidly hydrolysed urea. For {{the purposes of this}} paper, the genus Proteus includes all motile, Gram-negative, straight rods which do not ferment lactose, do ferment glucose, and hydrolyse urea rapidly. (With a <b>stab</b> <b>culture</b> in a solid urea-containing medium a positive result is obtained in less than four hours.) On such a basis, Rustigian and Stuart (1943) proposed to include in the genus four species: P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morgani, * and P. rettgeri, which can be readily differentiated {{on the basis of a}} few simple biochemical reactions. Cook (1948) studied the cultural characteristics of the genus more fully and showed the relative frequency of the four species.

40|$|Bacterial subclones {{recovered}} {{from an old}} <b>stab</b> <b>culture</b> of Escherichia coli K- 12 revealed {{a high degree of}} genetic diversity, which occurred in spite of a very reduced rate of propagation during storage. This conclusion is based on a pronounced restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) detected upon hybridization with internal fragments of eight resident insertion sequences (IS). Genetic diversity was dependent on the IS considered and, in many cases, a clear consequence of IS transposition. IS 5 was particularly active in the generation of variation. All subclones in which IS 30 had been active testify to a burst of IS 30 transposition. This was correlated with a loss of prototrophy and a reduced growth on rich media. A pedigree of the entire clone could be drawn from the RFLP patterns of the subclones. Out of 118 subclones analyzed, 68 different patterns were found but the putative ancestral population had disappeared. A few patterns were each represented by several subclones displaying improved fitness. These results offer insights into the role of IS elements in the plasticity of the E. coli genome, and they further document that enzyme-mediated DNA rearrangements do occur in resting bacterial cultures...|$|E

In addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5 -year-old children in 5 - to 7 -year follow-up studies. A total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin typed by the <b>stab</b> <b>culture</b> technique. Mutacin was produced by 88 % of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus pyogenes.

40|$|Authors: Yuri G. Strukov and Andrew S. Belmont This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Development of Mammalian Cell Lines with lac Operator-Tagged Chromosomes,” Chapter 25, in[*Live Cell Imaging*]([URL] Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins to label chromosomal proteins has yielded basic structural information as well as insights into dynamics that were previously inaccessible. This protocol describes a method for tagging specific chromosome sites using the *lac* operator/repressor system, wherein direct repeats of bacterial operator sequences are coupled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged proteins that recognize these sequences. Direct *lac* operator repeats are generated by directional cloning. Although the use of direct repeats, as opposed to inverted repeats, reduces recombination within the bacterial host at high copy number, even the direct repeats are unstable, requiring the use of special bacterial hosts and low-copy-number plasmids for cloning. The introduction of the *lac* operator repeats into eukaryotic cells uses traditional transformation methods. Techniques for the isolation of stable cell clones with varying transgene copy numbers are described in the protocol, as are several methods for visual screening {{of large numbers of}} stable cell clones to isolate rare clones containing labeled chromosomal regions with desired features. ### RELATED INFORMATION In principle, chromosome tagging can be accomplished through the use of any repetitive sequence to which a specific protein binds. The first application of this approach used the bacterial lac operator and Lac repressor combination. The lac operator/Lac repressor-labeling system has been successfully adapted for tagging chromatin in live bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells (Fig. 1), as well as in multicellular organisms including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, and *Arabidopsis*. Subsequent approaches have used tet operator or glucocorticoid receptor element repeats. Recently, the lac operator system has been used in combination with the bacteriophage viral replicase translational operator and several color variants of GFP to label DNA, RNA, and protein in living cells. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Examples of different stable cell lines with lac operator-tagged chromosome regions visualized by GFP-Lac repressor in vivo expression.

Agarose gel (0. 7 %) - Ampicillin (add at 100 μg/mL to both LB medium and LB agar plates) - Bacteria (e. g., Stbl 2 competent cells; Invitrogen/GIBCO) - CaCl 2 (250 mM) - Cells for transfection: CHO DG 44 - DNA preparation kits (e. g., QIAGEN miniprep and maxiprep kits) - Ethanol (70 %; ice-cold 100 %) - Fetal bovine serum (FBS), defined and dialyzed (HyClone Lab) - Fluorescein-labeled methotrexate (FMTX) (Molecular Probes) - Glycine (100 μM) - Hypoxanthine (30 μM) - LB medium (liquid and agar plates) - Media for cells used for transfection - F- 12 (HAM) medium (Invitrogen/GIBCO) supplemented with 10 % defined FBS: for growth of DG 44 cells - F- 12 medium, lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, with 10 % dialyzed FBS: for selection and further passaging of stably transfected cells - Phosphate-buffered saline, calcium- and magnesium-free (CMF-PBS) - Restriction enzymes SalI and XhoI - Sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) - TE buffer (optional; see Step 4. vii) - Thymine (30 μM) - TR buffer - Trypsin - Vector (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32) and appropriate insert (e. g., 256 -copy lac operator repeat) (see Steps 1 and 2) ### Equipment 1. Dry ice - Equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis - Filter paper - Flasks (25 -cm 2 tissue culture; 75 -cm 2) - Fluorescence-activated cell sorter - Forceps (sharp-tipped) - Incubator preset to 30 °C - Inoculation loops - Marker (permanent) - Microcentrifuge - Microcentrifuge tubes (1. 5 mL) - Micropipette tips (sterile 200 -μL) (1 mL) (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Microscope - Petri dishes (150 -mm) - Pipette - Plastic hose (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Plates for growing bacterial cultures - Plates (96 -well) - Shaking platform - Tubes for transfection ### METHOD **Preparing Vector DNA Containing Large Direct Repeats** 1. Clone the lac operator repeat into a vector. - *This protocol is based on preparations from our laboratory using the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat*. - i. Use Stbl 2 competent cells grown at 30 °C to help maintain full-length lac operator repeats. - ii. Clone the lac operator repeats into low-copy-number vectors (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32). - *Having too many copies in a cell increases the possibility of recombination*. - Purify vector DNA as follows: - The purification of vector DNA should take no more than 3 d to complete (4 d if the optional second minipreps are performed in Step 2. viii). Recombination may occur if plates or cultures from Step 1 are allowed to stand at 4 °C; thus it is important to complete this procedure without delay. However, the plasmid DNA, once prepared from the cells, is stable. Because low-copy-number plasmids are used, expect low yields at every purification step. - i. Streak bacteria from a <b>stab</b> <b>culture</b> onto an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Store the <b>stab</b> <b>culture</b> in the dark at room temperature. - ii. Incubate the inoculated LB plate for 24 h at 30 °C. - *Even after this length of time, the colonies will be small*. - iii. Inoculate at least 10 3 -mL cultures of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with well-isolated colonies. Incubate the cultures on a shaker overnight at 30 °C. - iv. Prepare DNA using a miniprep procedure (e. g., QIAGEN) from 1. 5 mL of each culture. Store the remainder of each culture at 4 °C. - v. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI. Separate the DNA fragments on an agarose gel (0. 7 %). - *At this step, it is critical to be very discerning. Any bands present other than those expected could indicate recombination of the plasmid (in the case of the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat, expect 10 -kb and 5 -kb fragments) *. - vi. Prepare and freeze a glycerol stock, or prepare a <b>stab</b> <b>culture</b> of each positive clone (from the stored cultures in Step 2. iv). - vii. Inoculate 500 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with the remaining culture from one of the positive clones. Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking. - *It may be preferable to prepare two 500 -mL cultures, each from a different positive clone, in the event that one clone is lost during large-scale growth*. - viii. (Optional) Before proceeding with the maxiprep DNA isolation, isolate DNA from an aliquot of the 500 -mL culture by repeating Steps 2. iv- 2. v. While preparing the miniprep DNA, centrifuge the 500 -mL culture. Discard the supernatant, and freeze the bacterial pellet until ready to use. Use positive cultures for the following step: - ix. Isolate DNA from the 500 -mL culture using a maxiprep procedure. If using QIAGEN maxipreps with Qiafilters, double the volume of P 1, P 2, and P 3 added to each pellet, and then split the prep into two Qiafilters. This prevents the Qiafilter from clogging. - *The yield of DNA will be low. A good yield is ~ 125 μg of DNA per 500 -mL culture*. - x. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI to confirm that only DNA fragments of the expected size are present. **Making Stable Cell Lines Containing lac Operator Repeats** 3. Grow cells for transfection for ~ 1 wk. - *CHO DG 44 cells are derivatives of CHO K 1 cells and are doubly deleted for the DHFR locus. The product of the DHFR gene is necessary for intermediary metabolism of thymidylates and purines. An imbalance of nucleotides in cells may be the cause of both insert instability due to gene amplification and an abnormal cell cycle due to interference with replication timing*. 4. Purify plasmid DNA for transfection as follows: - i. Transfer 300 μL of vector DNA solution (~ 100 μg/mL) into a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube. - ii. Add 33 μL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) to the DNA, and thoroughly mix the solution with a pipette. - iii. Add 660 μL of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the tube, and mix the contents by inverting the tube several times. Let the tube stand on dry ice for 5 min. - *At this step, white fibers of DNA precipitate should be visible*. - iv. Centrifuge the reaction in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For convenience, label the location of the pellet inside the tube with a permanent marker. - v. Remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol at 4 °C by inverting the tube several times. Centrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. - *Carry out all subsequent steps in a sterile environment*. - vi. Remove the supernatant, and immerse the entire open tube in 70 % ethanol for 10 sec. Remove the supernatant. Air-dry the DNA pellet for 10 - 15 min. - vii. Dissolve the dried DNA in 200 μL of sterile H 2 O or TE buffer. - viii. Aliquot DNA dissolved in H 2 O and freeze at - 20 °C for short-term storage. DNA dissolved in TE buffer is stable for at least several weeks at 4 °C. - ix. Remove an aliquot of the DNA, and estimate the concentration and purity of the DNA. 5. Transform cells using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA. *Use only chemical transformation with competent cells, not electroporation, because increased recombination following electroporation has been observed. The efficiency of transfection using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA strongly depends on the growth state of recipient cells, concentration of calcium and phosphates, concentration of DNA, pH, temperature, and duration of the precipitation reaction. It is advisable to prepare several buffers with slightly different pH values (see Step 5. iii below) *. - i. Plate CHO DG 44 cells in three 75 -cm 2 flasks the day before transfection. - ii. Replace the medium in the flasks with fresh medium 4 h before transfection. Cells should be 50 %- 80 % confluent and be in the log phase of growth for efficient transfection. - iii. Prepare three reaction tubes. In each one, dilute 7 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA (from Step 4. vii) in 0. 5 mL of CaCl 2 (250 mM), mixed with 0. 5 mL of TR buffer, varying only in its pH value (6. 95, 7. 05, or 7. 10). Incubate the reactions for 30 min at room temperature. - iv. Add each DNA mixture dropwise to a flask of cells (from Step 5. ii). Incubate the flasks for 24 h. - v. Replace the transfection medium with F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with 10 % defined FBS, and incubate the cells for an additional 24 h. - vi. Replace the medium with selective medium (F- 12 medium lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, but containing 10 % dialyzed FBS). Stable transformants are obtained after 2 wk of selection. **Enrichment of Stable Cells with Large-Copy-Number Inserts Using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting** *This procedure describes the selection of CHO cells expressing high amounts of exogenous DHFR from a pool of stably transformed cells using cell sorting, a strategy to enrich for cells harboring large chromosome insertions of the DHFR-containing transgene. Selection is based on binding a fluorescent cell-permeable DHFR inhibitor to the pool of cellular DHFR. Cells with high fluorescence show a high total expression of DHFR, which correlates roughly with copy number (as well as chromosome position effects) *. 6. Select and sort the cells as follows: - i. Grow cells in 25 -cm 2 tissue culture flasks until they are in log phase. - ii. Replace the growth medium with fresh F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with FBS (10 %) and FMTX (20 μM). Add glycine (100 μM), hypoxanthine (30 μM), and thymine (30 μM) to the medium to relieve the toxic effects of FMTX. Incubate the cells for 8 h. - iii. Harvest cells by trypsinization, and keep them in sterile PBS on ice. - *Because FMTX is retained in cells at concentrations high enough to cause damage, cells are viable in PBS on ice only for several hours*. - iv. Sort the cells into flasks or 96 -well plates. - v. Grow enough cells for freezing, and freeze them after screening. 7. Prepare a large number of clones for screening or subcloning as follows: - i. Plate cells produced in Step 6 onto a Petri dish at a low density, ideally, 20 - 100 cells per 150 -mm dish. To minimize cross-contamination among neighboring colonies, make sure that the density of plating is low enough and that the colonies are spread out. Use several Petri dishes, titrating the cell concentration by factors of 2 - 3 between dishes, to ensure optimal cell density. - *The action of the trypsin (Step 6. iii) must have progressed enough to ensure the absence of cell clumping and the predominance of single cells in suspension. This is aided by mechanical agitation or by vigorous pipetting of the culture*. - ii. Return the cells to the incubator, and if possible, avoid moving the dishes (particularly after the first few days) for ~ 10 d to allow good-size colonies to form. - *Movement of the dishes will cause cells to dislodge and form satellite colonies and/or a lawn of dispersed cells, increasing cross-contamination*. - iii. Allow the cells to grow until the colonies are well-defined and visible by eye while avoiding overgrowth to minimize colony cross-contamination. Mark individual isolated colonies {{on the bottom of the}} plate with a permanent marker. View the colonies under low magnification to check for the presence of undesirable smaller colonies growing in the vicinity of any colony of interest. 8. If visual screening of the clones is unnecessary, then pick and harvest a large number of colonies from the 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish (from Step 7), using one of the subcloning methods described below. If live visual screening is desired, refer to the Discussion regarding subcloning stable transformants. **Trypsin Method for Picking Colonies** - i. Cut filter paper into small squares, each with an area of ~ 4 mm 2. Use sharp-tipped forceps to place the squares together in a glass Petri dish. Cover them and sterilize by autoclaving. - ii. Aspirate the medium from the Petri dish containing the marked colonies (from Step 7. iii above). - iii. Wash the cells with sterile calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (CMF-PBS), and remove excess liquid. - iv. Dispense trypsin solution into a small sterile Petri dish. Using the sterile forceps, dip a sterile filter paper (from Step 8. i) in trypsin, blot it to remove excess trypsin, and place it over a colony. - v. Repeat Step 8. iv for each of the colonies. Return the Petri dish containing the cells to the incubator for ~ 5 min. - vi. Transfer each filter paper into a separate well of a 96 -well microtiter plate containing 0. 1 mL of tissue culture medium per well. If visual screening will be performed, use a glass-bottom 96 -well plate. Duplicate plating can be accomplished by dipping the filter paper into one well to dislodge some cells, and then dropping the filter paper into a well of a second 96 -well plate. - *The efficiency of colony duplication by this method is close to 100 %. Do not leave the cells without buffer for more than 15 - 20 min or they will dry out. Also, CMF-PBS may induce rounding of cells and/or detachment after prolonged treatment (see Steps 8. x and 8. xi) *. - vii. Grow the collected cells in the 96 -well plates for 1 - 2 d. - viii. Remove the filter paper pieces from the wells, taking care to avoid cross-contamination. One method for doing this is to attach a plastic hose to a vacuum system with an in-line trap. Insert the larger end of a 1 -mL micropipette tip into the hose. Cut the other end of the tip to accommodate a sterile 200 -μL micropipette tip. Next, insert the 200 -μL tip into the bottom of a well. The vacuum will cause the filter paper to adhere to the tip. Withdraw the tip, and discard both the filter paper and the 200 -μL pipette tip. Finally, repeat with the remaining wells, using a fresh sterile 200 -μL tip each time. - ix. Continue to grow the cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. **Micropipette Tip Method for Picking Colonies** *This method works well with more densely packed colonies, and it is faster than the trypsin method (Steps 8. i- 8. ix). A few hundred colonies can be easily transferred within a couple of hours. Once this method is optimized, efficiency is near 100 %, although the number of cells transferred per colony into the well may be somewhat lower*. - x. Mark the colonies that are less likely to be cross-contaminated with cells from other colonies. Rinse the cells twice with CMF-PBS (10 mL per 150 -mm dish). Add a small amount of CMF-PBS (~ 4 - 6 mL), just sufficient to cover the surface of the dish, and return the dish to the incubator. - xi. After ~ 5 min, look at the cells under a microscope to see if cells in colonies have rounded. If not, incubate further. Once the cells in the colony have rounded, but are still attached, they can be picked. - xii. Use a permanent marker to circle small groups of colonies on the bottom of the dish. This helps to keep track of which colonies have already been harvested. - xiii. Using a fresh 200 -μL pipette tip per colony, scrape two to three times over the colony while aspirating 10 μL into the pipette tip. Insert the pipette tip into the well of a 96 -well plate, pipetting medium from the well several times into the tip to wash the cells off into the well. - xiv. Grow cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. ### DISCUSSION In general, screening of clones uses either a visual, microscope-based screen (if possible) or a molecular or biochemical screen. In some cases, both might be combined, either as two sequential screens or one parallel screen. An example from our work is a screen of a set of 96 subclones transfected with a nonfluorescent VP 16 transcriptional activator fusion protein. A visual immunofluorescence assay was used to test directly for expression of the activator, and a transient transfection expression assay was run to test the capability of each clone to activate a luciferase reporter gene. The intersection of these two screens yielded a clone that induced chromosome repositioning after induction of VP 16 targeting. A starting point for subcloning is to determine roughly what fraction of stable transformants show the desired properties. If this fraction is large, then we typically carry out the initial transformation in a single flask, followed by subsequent subcloning of the mixed stable transformant pool by serial dilution cloning into 96 -well plates. A range of dilutions should be used to ensure success. The advantage of serial dilution is that the investigator can more easily verify whether the cells in a given well actually arise from a single clone. If the fraction of desired cells is small (a few percent or less), and if a visual screen is possible, we prepare a single coverslip from the mixed pool of stable transformants and obtain an initial estimate of exactly how many clones need to be screened. One approach is to initially subclone in pools of clones (e. g., five to 10 per well). In theory, this should allow cloning of even rare transformants through several stages of subcloning. Often, however, the desired subclones are rare because of a selective bias against growth of these clones. In this case, if the pool size is too great, the percentage of desired cells can drop in the culture prior to the next stage of subcloning, producing diminishing returns. A better approach, where possible, is cell sorting with flow cytometry to enrich the cell population with cells containing the desired expression levels (see Step 6 above). When large numbers of clones are required, and if visual screening is unnecessary, we simply pick large numbers of colonies from a 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish, using either small, trypsin-soaked pieces of filter paper (Steps 8. i- 8. ix above) or micropipette tips (Steps 8. x- 8. xiv above). These are used to deposit clonal cells into 96 -well plates. Both methods are very rapid but have a high risk of clone contamination, due to the use of a single Petri dish. Any clones selected, based on a secondary screen, must go through an additiona...|$|E

Diffusion of CO 2 from the central column of growth into the medium was observed to show lower concentrations where bacteria were absent. CO 2 profiles developed {{in a manner similar to}} those in Cheddar cheese and O 2 was undetectable at similar depths. Gases were analysed in Cheddar cheese over a maturation period of 200 d. O 2 was detectable to depths of 13, 6 and 2. 5 mm on days 2, 9 and 15, respectively, but then became undetectable at depths of 2. 5 – 3 mm. CO 2 concentrations measured within the cheese increased 10 -fold from day 2 to day 200 to reach a value of around 15 mM. The progress of measured CO 2 concentration over time at a given depth in cheese shows a hyperbolic type increase. Coefficient of regression values increase with depth to a maximum value of R 2 = 0. 93. In both systems, reductions and increases in CO 2 were due to the absence or presence of bacterial growth, respectively. Confocal scanning laser and scanning electron microscopy was used to show spatial heterogeneity of microcolonies within the cheese ecosystem. This information can potentially be used as a non-sensory evaluation of cheese maturity status.

Resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents is an emerging global problem that has serious impact on the treatment of disease. There are many factors associated with the emergence of resistance. Most important of them is the acquisition and further transmission and spread of resistance markers among various bacterial species. Therefore, we conducted this study to characterize the resistance plasmids in terms of their transferability and stability among Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Methods: Six multidrug-resistant S. Typhi isolates were evaluated for the stability and transfer of resistance markers. The resistance plasmids were also checked for the presence of RepHI 1 A replicon. Results: All resistance markers were found to be transferred to the recipient through conjugation and transformation, except for nalidixic acid. None of the resistance plasmid was found to harbour RepHI 1 A replicon and therefore, did not belong to incompatibility group IncHI 1. Resistance markers were found to be highly stable in all the isolates during serial passages and storage as <b>stab</b> <b>cultures</b> at different temperatures for different time periods. Interpretation & conclusions: Resistance markers for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, streptomycin and trimethoprim were transferred through conjugation as well as transformation whereas that for nalidixic acid was not transferred in any of the isolates. Markers for chloramphenicol and streptomycin resistance were found to be most stable during various storage conditions. Presence of small-sized non-IncHI 1 resistance plasmids is a matter of concern due to their capability to exist inside the host, thereby increasing the possibility of their transmission and spread among S.

With the facultatively anaerobic bacteria of the genera Klebsiella and Enterobacter, the best substrate was sucrose, followed by fructose and mannitol, whereas among the organic acids, only malic and fumaric acids supported any activity. With the obligately aerobic bacteria of the genera Azospirillum and Pseudomonas, disaccharides were not utilized for nitrogen fixation, but several organic acids were accepted in addition to monosaccharides and polyols; malate and glucose were the best substrates. The patterns of the carbon sources utilized for nitrogen fixation were coherent within the species, {{with the exception of one}} Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Enterobacter agglomerans strain, both isolated from the same individual grass plant, which were unable to utilize lactose. Anaerobic conditions (pO 2 value of ≤ 0. 002) were required for maximum nitrogenase activity with the facultatively anaerobic bacteria, with the exception of one strain of E. agglomerans, which required atmospheric oxygen (pO 2 value of 0. 21). Also, the obligately aerobic diazotrophs required atmospheric oxygen for maximum nitrogenase activity. The maximum specific nitrogenase activities (expressed as micromoles of C 2 H 4 · milligram of bacterial protein− 1 · hour− 1) noted during the exponential growth phase of the bacteria were the following: 2. 68 with Azospirillum lipoferum on malate, 2. 41 with K. pneumoniae and 1. 58 with E. agglomerans on sucrose, and 0. 95 with Pseudomonas sp. on malate...|$|R

However, {{in the case of}} red colony-forming cells of the strain # 2922, the author's findings were slightly different from the description of Seligmann and Saphra. They reported that white colony variants appeared very rarely from red colony formers, i. e. once after oral administration to mice and once on subcultures which were made frequently from agar slant culture during 8 weeks. Experiments were conducted to study the cause of the above difference, and {{it was found that the}} white colony variants can easily be obtained when the red colony formers were cultured under anaerobic conditions. From the strain 3534 a lactose (rapid) fermenter and a non fermenter were obtained.

The intermediate type of cells between lactose fermenter and non-fermenter as reported by Seligmann and Saphra, was not isolated when single cell cultures were made by mieromanipulation.

Results We found that samples of the E. coli K- 12 strain MC 4100 TF exchanged on three separate occasions by mail between our laboratories became heterogeneous. Reconstruction studies indicated that LB-stabs exhibited mutations previously found in GASP studies in stationary phase LB broth. At least 40 % of reconstructed stocks and an equivalent proportion of actually mailed stock contained these mutations. Mutants with low RpoS levels emerged within 7 days of incubation in the stabs. Sequence analysis of ten of these segregants revealed that they harboured each of three different rpoS mutations. These mutants displayed the classical phenotypes of bacteria lacking rpoS. The genetic stability of MC 4100 TF was also tested in filter disks embedded in glycerol. Under these conditions, GASP mutants emerge only after a 3 -week period. We also confirm that the intrinsic high RpoS level in MC 4100 TF is mainly due to the presence of an IS 1 insertion in rssB. Conclusions Given that many E. coli strains contain high RpoS levels similar to MC 4100 TF, the integrity of such strains during transfers and storage is questionable. Variations in important collections may be due to storage-transfer related issues.
