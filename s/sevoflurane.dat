5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and <b>sevoflurane,</b> the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or <b>sevoflurane)</b> however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or <b>sevoflurane.</b> They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and <b>sevoflurane)</b> is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic, {{and so is}} {{generally}} not used alone in general anaesthesia, but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as <b>sevoflurane</b> or desflurane. It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.46. The use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia, however, can {{increase the risk of}} postoperative nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|An inhalational {{anaesthetic}} is {{a chemical}} compound possessing general anaesthetic properties {{that can be}} delivered via inhalation. They are administered by anaesthetists (a term which includes anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, and anaesthesiologist assistants) through an anaesthesia mask, laryngeal mask airway or tracheal tube connected to an anaesthetic vaporiser and an anaesthetic delivery system. Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include volatile anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane, <b>sevoflurane</b> and desflurane, and anaesthetic gases such as nitrous oxide and xenon.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} is {{a disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, <b>sevoflurane,</b> desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, <b>sevoflurane</b> and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|In mice, mERG and KCNQ1, another Kv α subunit {{regulated}} by KCNE2, are neither influential nor highly expressed in adult ventricles. However, Kcne2-/- mice exhibit QT prolongation at baseline at 7 months of age, or earlier if provoked with a QT-prolonging agent such as <b>sevoflurane.</b> This is because KCNE2 is a promiscuous regulatory subunit that forms complexes with Kv1.5 and with Kv4.2 in adult mouse ventricular myocytes. KCNE2 increases currents though Kv4.2 channels and slows their inactivation. KCNE2 {{is required for}} Kv1.5 to localize to the intercalated discs of mouse ventricular myocytes. Kcne2 deletion in mice reduces the native currents generated in ventricular myocytes by Kv4.2 and Kv1.5, namely Ito and IKslow, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesia {{of exotic}} animals (guinea pigs, rabbits, birds) is {{challenging}} {{and the higher}} peri-anesthetic mortality in these species compared to dogs and cats, attests to this fact. These animals are challenging to anesthetize {{for a number of}} reasons: very little research has been carried out on safe and effective drug doses for specific species; exotic pets often 'hide' {{the fact that they are}} sick and by the time owners realize how sick the pet is the course of the disease is far advanced; the unique anatomy and physiology of exotic pets poses challenges for anesthetic management. For example, the anatomy of the respiratory system of birds, Guinea pigs, and reptiles makes it difficult to induce and maintain anesthesia solely with inhalation agents such as isoflurane and <b>sevoflurane.</b> Injectable drugs such as sedatives or tranquilizers are often used in these patients to facilitate induction and maintenance of anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Although current {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} {{in a controlled}} hospital setting, many hospitals are ill-suited for a situation involving mass casualties among civilians. Inexpensive positive-pressure devices {{that can be used}} easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, allopurinol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention. Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as insulin, dopamine, and allopurinol have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the AANA Journal discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as <b>sevoflurane,</b> {{to be used as a}} bronchodilator that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation. Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. Mechanistic information based on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy. Mechanistic studies may also aid in the development of new diagnostic approaches. Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract.|$|E
500|$|Tricyclics {{and other}} pre-1980s {{antidepressants}} had several side effects {{due to their}} non-selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target; the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective {{and one of the}} first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the [...] citalopram, its isomer escitalopram, and fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects. These include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Fluorine also finds use in steroids: fludrocortisone is a blood pressure-raising mineralocorticoid, and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids. The majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated; the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers <b>sevoflurane</b> and desflurane are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood, allowing faster waking times.|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. [...] Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, <b>sevoflurane</b> and desflurane.

2500|$|The ideal {{anesthetic}} drug {{would provide}} hypnosis, amnesia, analgesia, and muscle relaxation without undesirable changes in blood pressure, pulse or breathing. [...] In the 1930s, physicians started to augment inhaled general anesthetics with intravenous general anesthetics. [...] The drugs used in combination offered a better risk profile {{to the person}} under anesthesia and a quicker recovery. [...] A combination of drugs was later shown to result in lower odds of dying in the first 7 days after anesthetic. For instance, propofol (injection) {{might be used to}} start the anesthetic, fentanyl (injection) used to blunt the stress response, midazolam (injection) given to ensure amnesia and <b>sevoflurane</b> (inhaled) during the procedure to maintain the effects. [...] More recently, several intravenous drugs have been developed which, if desired, allow inhaled general anesthetics to be avoided completely.|$|E
2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, acepromazine, and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. Alfaxalone is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and guaifenesin. [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane, although desflurane and <b>sevoflurane</b> are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sevoflurane</b> [...] "has an {{excellent}} safety record", but is under review for potential neurotoxicity, especially relevant to administration in infants and children, and rare reports similar to halothane hepatotoxicity. <b>Sevoflurane</b> {{is the preferred}} agent for mask induction due to its lesser irritation to mucous membranes.|$|E

5000|$|Concern {{regarding}} {{the safety of}} anaesthesia is especially acute with regard to children and infants, where preclinical evidence from relevant animal models suggest that common clinically important agents, including <b>sevoflurane,</b> may be neurotoxic to the developing brain, and so cause neurobehavioural abnormalities in the long term; two large-scale clinical studies (PANDA and GAS) were ongoing as of 2010, in hope of supplying [...] "significant further information" [...] on neurodevelopmental effects of general anaesthesia in infants and young children, including where <b>sevoflurane</b> is used.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sevoflurane</b> (1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-(fluoromethoxy)propane; synonym, {{fluoromethyl}} hexafluoro{{isopropyl ether}}), is a sweet-smelling, nonflammable, highly fluorinated methyl isopropyl ether {{used as an}} inhalational anaesthetic for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.
