40|$|The large {{quantities}} of sewage sludge that are currently generated require new alternatives for its recycling and final destination, beyond already known methods in the agriculture and cement industry. The use of this sludge as raw material {{for the production of}} structural ceramics, such as clay bricks, may become an interesting alternative, both from an industrial and environmental point of view. This chapter is focused on the use of solid wastes, such as for example sewage sludge or forest residues, to serve as additive raw materials for the production of clay bricks. It is based on our experience with the Ecobrick material and our subsequent research on producing some raw materials from WWTP <b>sludge</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> the ceramic industry.

40|$|Globally, alum sludge is an easily, {{locally and}} largely {{available}} by-product from water treatment plants where aluminium sulphate {{is used as}} the coagulant for raw water purification. Owing to the high content of Al ions (29. 7 Â± 13. 3 % dry weight) in alum sludge and the strong affinity of Al ions to adsorb various pollutants especially phosphorus (P), alum sludge (in the form of dewatered cakes) has been investigated {{in recent years as}} a low-cost alternative substrate in constructed wetland (CW) systems to enhance the treatment efficiency especially for high strength P-containing wastewater. Long-term trials in different scales have demonstrated that the alum sludge-based CW is a promising technique with a two-pronged feature of using 'waste' for wastewater treatment. Alum sludge cakes in CW can serve as a medium for wetland plant growth, as a carrier for biofilm development and as a porous material for wastewater infiltration. After the intensive studies of the alum sludge-based CW system, this paper aims to address the key issues and concerns pertaining to this kind of CW system. These include: (1) Is alum <b>sludge</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> reuse in CWs? (2) Is Al released from the sludge a concern? (3) What is the lifespan of the alum sludge in CWs?

40|$|Background and purpose: Disposing sludge from {{industrial}} {{wastewater treatment plants}} (IWWTPs) is a serious issue because it can affect human and animals health, and also environmental quality. In this study, sludge from an IWWTP was analyzed regarding its physicochemical characteristics and disposal options. Materials and Methods: Grab sampling was used to collect 12 sludge samples biweekly (May-October 2012). One sample T-test was applied to analyze the obtained data. Canadian Soil Quality Guidelines (CSQG) and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Soil Cleanup Criteria (NJDEPSCC) were used to discuss the generated sludge disposal fate.

40|$|Background: Bacterial {{cellulose}} (BC) is {{a highly}} crystalline and mechanically stable nanopolymer, which has excellent potential as a material in many novel applications, especially {{if it can be}} produced in large amounts from an inexpensive feedstock. Waste fiber sludge, a residue with little or no value, originates from pulp mills and lignocellulosic biorefineries. A high cellulose and low lignin content contributes to making the fiber <b>sludge</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> bioconversion, even without a thermochemical pretreatment step. In this study, the possibility to combine production of BC and hydrolytic enzymes from fiber sludge was investigated. The BC was characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis, and its mechanical properties were investigated. Results: Bacterial cellulose and enzymes were produced through sequential fermentations with the bacterium Gluconacetobacter xylinus and the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. Fiber sludges from sulfate (SAFS) and sulfite (SIFS) processes were hydrolyzed enzymatically without prior thermochemical pretreatment and the resulting hydrolysates were used for BC production. The highest volumetric yields of BC from SAFS and SIFS were 11 and 10 g/L (DW), respectively. The BC yield on initial sugar in hydrolysate-based medium reached 0. 3 g/g after seven days of cultivation. The tensile strength of wet BC from hydrolysate medium was about 0. 04 MPa compared to about 0. 03 MPa for BC from a glucose-based reference medium, while the crystallinity was slightly lower for BC from hydrolysate cultures. The spent hydrolysates were used for production of cellulase with T. reesei. The cellulase activity (CMCase activity) in spent SAFS and SIFS hydrolysates reached 5. 2 U/mL (87 nkat/mL), which was similar to the activity level obtained in a reference medium containing equal amounts of reducing sugar. Conclusions: It was shown that waste fiber <b>sludge</b> is a <b>suitable</b> raw material <b>for</b> production of bacterial cellulose and enzymes through sequential fermentation. The concept studied offers efficient utilization of the various components in fiber sludge hydrolysates and affords a possibility to combine production of two high value-added products using residual streams from pulp mills and biorefineries. Cellulase produced in this manner could tentatively be used to hydrolyze fresh fiber sludge to obtain medium <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> production of BC in the same biorefinery...|$|R

40|$|Coagulation-flocculation is a physical-chemical process {{responsible}} for producing the largest amount of sludge in the purification of natural raw water. Conventionally, aluminum sulfate or alum {{has been used}} as a coagulant. However, disposal of the sludge produced has been problematic for the environment due to excess aluminum. Currently, the convenience of using natural coagulants such as seed extracts from Moringa oleifera (MO) is being studied, although, the properties of sewage sludge produced and its possible reuse are unknown.

40|$|Alum sludge {{refers to}} the {{by-product}} from the processing of drinking water in Water Treatment Works. In this study, groups of batch experiments were designed to identify the characteristics of dewatered alum sludge for phosphorus adsorption. Air-dried alum sludge (moisture content 10. 2 %), which was collected from a Water Treatment Works in Dublin, was subjected for artificial P-rich wastewater adsorption tests using KH 2 PO 4 as a model P source. Adsorption behaviours were investigated {{as a function of}} amount and particle size of alum sludge; pH of solution; and adsorption time. The results have shown that pH plays a major role not only in the adsorption process but also in the adsorption capacity. With regard to adsorption capacity, this study reveals the Langmuir adsorption isotherm being the best fit with experimental data (R 2 = 0. 98 - 0. 99). The maximum adsorption capacities range from 0. 7 to 3. 5 mg-P/g when the pH of the synthetic P solution was varied from 9. 0 to 4. 3, accordingly.

30|$|Doped Si wafers {{are widely}} used in Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI) and {{photovoltaic}} industries. To produce wafers, Si ingots are mechanically sliced, and polished. In the mechanical slicing process, some Si parts are crushed into particles by grits and carried away by aqueous slurry and eventually forming Si sludge. This is defined as Si kerf-loss (Moeller 2006). Compared with other Si byproducts, Si sludge not only retains {{the properties of the}} Si ingot matrix, such as satisfactory purity and resistivity, but also has several features for making novel material. Si sludge particles already have sub-micrometer dimensions, with D 50 of approximately 1 â 2 Â Âµm (Drouiche et al. 2014). During the sawing process, Si cleavages actually occur on crystal structures and mostly become the flake shape. Most importantly, the particles retain the electrochemical properties of Si, but have a more active surface area than a bulk substrate does. Mass production of photovoltaic wafers causes considerable solid pollution because of Si <b>sludge,</b> however, <b>suitable</b> applications <b>for</b> this waste material are under development.|$|R

The ultrasound is an alternative method among other methods, but because of its high energy requirement it should be optimized before utilization. This work gives the optimized parameters such as sonication time, sonication power (these parameters are the two factors which play part for energy calculations), type of sludge, cooling requirements and solid content in the sludge solution. Even if the previous researchers prefer to use the energy (specific energy usually), we have found out that both the sonication time and the sonication power have individual importance. For municipal sludge the main conclusion can be summarized as: âhigh power-short retention timeâ is more effective than âlow power-long retention timeâ. As this phenomenon may alter from sludge to sludge, various combinations of power and retention time should be tried while keeping the volume small and the concentration below a certain level.

In this work, sludge samples drawn from sludge treatment units have been digested and analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for metal evaluation. Samples were also extracted and analyzed by microcoulometric titrations, following modified DIN 38414 T 17 standard, for EOX analysis. Analytical results showed a slight enrichment {{of the contents of}} certain metals (Cd < 2 mg/kg, Cr < 51. 5 mg/kg, Cu < 105. 8 mg/ kg, Hg < 1. 4 mg/kg, Ni < 35. 9 mg/kg, Pb < 58. 7 mg/kg, Zn < 410. 1 mg/kg, Ba < 317. 1 mg/kg, Co < 1 mg/kg, Mo < 5 mg/kg, Mn < 106. 7 mg/kg), so almost all of the <b>sludge</b> would be <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> agricultural use following Italian and European regulations.

No information on pathogen densities in Australian sludges was found so risks were assessed using pathogen densities in other countries and infection rates in Western Australia. Based on information from other countries it was estimated that an individual handling sludge and ingesting 0. 1 g of sludge would have a greater than 1 % chance of becoming infected with Giardia, less than 25 % chance of contracting a helminth infection, approximately 1 % chance of becoming infected with an enteric virus and less than 1 % chance of contracting a Salmonella infection. However a qualitative risk assessment based on reported infection rates in Western Australia suggested that enteric viruses in wastewater sludge pose the most risk followed by Salmonella and Giardia.

Accordingly, the content of soluble salt in sludge compost is usually much higher than most seedlings can tolerate. To determine whether <b>sludge</b> compost is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> use as a nursery substrate, some experiments were conducted. Reduction of the electrical conductivity (EC) value could improve seed germination in saturated extract from sludge compost. In addition, water elution and mixing dilution with raw soil were all shown {{to be able to}} alleviate saline inhibition on seed germination and seedling growth, including stem diameter, seedling height, and above-ground weight. Overall, salinity is a crucial problem when sewage sludge compost is reused as a nursery substrate, and some effective and convenient approaches to reduce salt should be served prior to its reuse.

A chemical cleaning of the membrane was performed at intervals of approximately 3 Â months. Variable influent volume flows did not affect the membraneâs performance in processing municipal wastewater. COD removal was greater than 95 % with a maximum effluent COD value of 27 Â mg/l. Similarly BOD removal was more than 98 % with an average effluent BOD of 2 Â mg/l. The effluent turbidity was less than 0.1 NTU and the TSS was very low. The TKN removal was more than 95 % and the total nitrogen removal efficiencies were greater than 80 %. Total phosphorus removal ranged from 50 to 90 %. Assimilation was the main mechanism for TP removal. The membrane bioreactor has shown to meet requirements at all times and has demonstrated a high reliability.
