500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E

For me it was the suffering of addiction, violence and crime which opened me at a young age, 17 years old.

[...] —Trey Parker [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] is a satire on political correctness and religious sensitivity, particularly in its portrayal of the characters organizing [...] "The Happy, Non-Offensive, Non-Denominational Christmas Play" [...] to avoid offending anyone of any religious backgrounds. While many Christmas specials focus on the religious, spiritual and moral values of the Christmas holiday rather than the commercial aspects, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] actually embraces commercialism in Christmas, suggesting viewers should enjoy those elements of the holiday without taking religion too seriously. York University Professor Alison Halsall said of {{this aspect of the}} episode, [...] "Again, Parker and Stone blur the sacred and the profane, in this instance, to gut holidays of their traditional meanings." ...|$|E

My helmet was bouncing around - I really don't have a clear memory of ejecting, however, I do <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> a dream - I can kind of imagine pulling the handle the F4 had between your legs." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I also ejected so I must have done it. I could hear loud booms, like the canopy blowing off. And I felt the wind. The next thing I knew, my parachute was opening. When I got down low, I could see people running around {{on the ground in}} a little village. I could see a guy off to the right.

[...] Executive producer Damon Lindelofon developing Walt When the Lost producers were developing the character of Walt, they initially intended for him to display supernatural powers by summoning animals—in the episode [...] "Special", it is suggested that Walt is able both to cause a bird to fly into a window and make a polar bear attack him through telepathy. This is also alluded to in [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", when Ben describes Walt as being [...] "more than Others could handle". Kelley himself was also under the impression that his character possessed [...] "magic powers", but after he had aged significantly enough for him to look no longer ten years old, the writers' plans were changed, and Walt was written {{out at the end of}} season two.|$|E

[...] He continues: [...] "When I created the fable of this girl who lived by the sea and whose father is a captain, and eventually she would be taken away and go sailing off, I wanted to hide in the relationship. I wanted to <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> the cocoon of this relationship to just stay sort of insulated from the world. And she was ready to move out into the world and was... you know, the relationship had broken up. Thats the ... reality that was going on in my life.

5000|$|For {{the second}} album, Evergreen, Volume 2, the songs were in {{more of a}} rock vein; and Linda was moved firmly into the lead vocalist position, with only {{occasional}} harmony vocals. The album includes the band's only hit song, [...] "Different Drum". The original recording by The Stone Poneys of [...] "Different Drum" [...] was quite similar to the recorded version by The Greenbriar Boys from their 1966 album Better Late than Never!; but as Kenny Edwards recalls: [...] "That's when Nik Venet sort of took an executive position and went, 'This could be a hit song, {{and we need to}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> an arranger arrange it.' So none of us actually played on the record version of that." [...] (A live performance of [...] "Different Drum" [...] in the earlier style survives though). The original album version of [...] "Different Drum" [...] from 1967 had a slightly longer run time (2:46) from the single edit (2:35), owing to a repeat of the harpsichord break {{in the middle of the}} song. All versions of the song reissued after that time have been the single edit although listed with the longer run time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sound of}} the album was {{described}} by the band as [...] "more organic and mellower" [...] than A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, as well as unintentionally and coincidentally similar to music of The Beatles, in both songwriting and scope. [...] "We all like all of that, from Rubber Soul to The White Album and all of that, but even before, we were into that theatrical element of things. We didn't {{want to do a}} Sgt. Pepper's thing," [...] explained Ross. The band never had the intention of music similar to The Beach Boys and The Beatles, according to both Ross and Walker. [...] "It was like before we were writing these songs, we were writing things that were almost entirely orchestrated - and it kind of carried over into this stuff," [...] continued Ross. [...] "And I do think that half this record does <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> that kind of 'fantastical instrumentation' thing, but we were just trying to fit the mood of each song. And in some cases, we just thought, 'We've got to have this.'

5000|$|Inspiration for {{the soundtrack}} came from Kanye West's 2013 album Yeezus. According to music {{supervisor}} Randall Poster, [...] "One {{of the great}} creative breakthroughs we had was that we, talking to Neil Burger the director, really looked at Kanye's Yeezus record and 'Black Skinhead' in particular and said, 'You know what, musically this sounds like the world of Dauntless, obviously, the lyrical topicality {{was not going to}} work for us and so doing some exploration we sort of landed on this DJ producer Gesaffelstein who worked with Kanye West." [...] Randall further talked about the soundtrack album, [...] "I {{think that one of the}} challenges for a movie like this is that it's set in the future and so you <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> to figure out, 'OK, what might music in the future sound like?' The film is actually set not in a perfected future, but actually kind of in a future world that is deteriorating. And so we wanted to create a musical element that had reflected on current music sounds, but also felt kind of time-forward and had a certain futuristic element. Really our notion was to find music that was dangerous, tribal and had electronic elements without really being dance-y." ...|$|E
