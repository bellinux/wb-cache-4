5000|$|Mount Velain (...) is a 750 m tall {{mountain}} with an isolated, black triangular summit showing {{through its}} <b>snow</b> <b>mantle,</b> {{standing in the}} northeast part of Adelaide Island. It was first charted by the French Antarctic Expedition 1903-05, under Charcot, and named by him for Charles Velain, a French geologist, geographer, and professor of physical geography at the Sorbonne.|$|E

500|$|The Ourika River {{valley is}} located about [...] south of Marrakesh. The [...] "silvery {{valley of the}} Ourika river curving north towards Marrakesh", and the [...] "red heights of Jebel Yagour still capped with snow" [...] to the south are sights in this area. David Prescott Barrows, who {{describes}} Marrakesh as Morocco's [...] "strangest city", describes the landscape in the following terms: [...] "The city lies some fifteen or twenty miles [...] from {{the foot of the}} Atlas mountains, which here rise to their grandest proportions. The spectacle of the mountains is superb. Through the clear desert air the eye can follow the rugged contours of the range for great distances to the north and eastward. The winter <b>snows</b> <b>mantle</b> them with white, and the turquoise sky gives a setting for their grey rocks and gleaming caps that is of unrivaled beauty." ...|$|R

50|$|One myth tells that Poliʻahu {{had come}} from Mauna Kea with her friends to attend sled races down the grassy hills south of Hamakua. Pele came {{disguised}} as a beautiful stranger and was greeted by Poliʻahu. However, Pele became jealously enraged at the goddess of Mauna Kea. She opened the subterranean caverns of Mauna Kea and threw fire from them towards Poliʻahu, with the snow goddess fleeing towards the summit. Poliʻahu {{was finally able to}} grab her now-burning <b>snow</b> <b>mantle</b> and throw it over the mountain. Earthquakes shook the island as the <b>snow</b> <b>mantle</b> unfolded until it reached the fire fountains, chilling and hardening the lava. The rivers of lava were driven back to Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Later battles also led to the defeat of Pele and confirmed the supremacy of the snow goddesses in the northern portion of the island and of Pele in the southern portion.|$|E
5000|$|Lambert Nunatak (...) is a rock nunatak that {{protrudes}} {{through the}} <b>snow</b> <b>mantle</b> {{of the southeastern}} Coulter Heights, near the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1959-65, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Paul A. Lambert, U.S. Navy, Senior Quartermaster on the , 1961-62.|$|E
5000|$|Matikonis Peak (...) is a small, rather {{isolated}} rock peak that protrudes {{through the}} <b>snow</b> <b>mantle</b> {{of the central}} Coulter Heights, near the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1959-65, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for William P.

6000|$|From {{height of}} noon, remote and still, [...] The sun shines {{on the empty}} hill. [...] No mist, no wind, above, below; [...] No living thing strays to and fro. [...] No bird replies to bird on high, [...] Cleaving the skies with echoing cry. [...] Like dreaming water, green and wan, [...] Glassing the <b>snow</b> of <b>mantling</b> swan, [...] Like a clear jewel encharactered [...] With secret symbol of line and word, [...] Asheen, unruffled, slumbrous, still, [...] The {{sunlight}} streams on the empty hill.|$|R
6000|$|Slow and sure! He has the day, perchance the week, before him, and {{may take}} his own time to {{accomplish}} Nature's burial in <b>snow.</b> A smooth <b>mantle</b> is scarcely yet thrown over the withered grass-plat, and the dry stalks of annuals still thrust themselves through the white surface {{in all parts of}} the garden. The leafless rose-bushes stand shivering in a shallow snow-drift, looking, poor things! as disconsolate as if they possessed a human consciousness of the dreary scene. This is a sad time for the shrubs that do not perish with the summer; they neither live nor die; what they retain of life seems but the chilling sense of death. Very sad are the flower shrubs in midwinter! The roofs of the houses are now all white, save where the eddying wind has kept them bare at the bleak corners. To discern the real intensity of the storm, we must fix upon some distant object,--as yonder spire,-and observe how the riotous gust fights with the descending snow throughout the intervening space. Sometimes the entire prospect is obscured; then, again, we have a distinct, but transient glimpse of the tall steeple, like a giant's ghost; and now the dense wreaths sweep between, as if demons were flinging snowdrifts at each other, in mid-air. Look next into the street, where we have seen an amusing parallel to the combat of those fancied demons in the upper regions. It is a snow-battle of school-boys. What a pretty satire on war and military glory might be written, in the form of a child's story, by describing the snowball-fights of two rival schools, the alternate defeats and victories of each, and the final triumph of one party, or perhaps of neither! What pitched battles, worthy to be chanted in Homeric strains! What storming of fortresses, built all of massive snowblocks! What feats of individual prowess, and embodied onsets of martial enthusiasm! And when some well-contested and decisive victory had put a period to the war, both armies should unite to build a lofty monument of snow upon the battle-field, and crown it with the victor's statue, hewn of the same frozen marble. In a few days or weeks thereafter, the passer-by would observe a shapeless mound upon the level common; and, unmindful of the famous victory, would ask, [...] "How came it there? Who reared it? And what means it?" [...] The shattered pedestal of many a battle monument has provoked these questions, when none could answer.|$|R
5000|$|David Prescott Barrows (June 27, 1873 - September 5, 1954) was an American anthropologist, explorer, and educator. Born in Chicago in 1874, {{his family}} moved to California. He showed a keen {{interest}} in the life and customs of the American Indians, and was said to have [...] "spent almost every summer during the period 1890-1899 in research work among the tribes of southern California and in the Colorado Desert." [...] He later became President of the University of California. He went on many travels, publishing works of his findings in countries such as Morocco and the Philippines. He described Marrakesh as Morocco's [...] "strangest city", and wrote of it [...] "The city lies some fifteen or twenty miles from the foot of the Atlas mountains, which here rise to their grandest proportions.

40|$|The {{search of}} {{improvement}} of protective techniques against natural phenomena such as snow avalanches continues to use classic methods for calculating flexible structures. This paper {{deals with a}} new method to design avalanche protection nets. This method {{is based on a}} coupled analysis of both net structure and <b>snow</b> <b>mantle</b> by using a Discrete Element Method. This has {{led to the development of}} computational software so that avalanche nets can be easily designed. This tool gives the evolution of the forces acting in several parts of the work as a function of the snow situation...|$|E
