5|$|A 1977 BBC {{television}} debate discussed {{arguments for}} and against Myra Hindley's release, with Lord Longford on the side who argued that Hindley should be released and Ann West (the mother of Lesley Ann Downey) on the side arguing against any suggestion of Hindley being released and threatening to kill her if <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> got out of prison.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> need to go into hiding. She assumes {{that he would have}} given Bodnar, who he viewed as a son, the same advice.|$|E
5|$|In retirement, the Goodmans {{enjoyed a}} rich family life, visiting often with son Theodore ("Ted") {{and his wife}} Carol, and {{daughter}} Lydia Ann ("Ann") and son-in-law Bob. To his unabashed delight, Urner and Louise Goodman had nine grandchildren. Their son George was killed in action in France during World War II, however. Upon hearing the news in December 1944, Goodman was deeply grieved, and Louise, his wife of 60 years, {{said it was the}} only time <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> saw him cry.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he {{thought he was going to}} die that night. It was the only time <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> saw Ochs cry.|$|E
5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
5|$|Again {{disappointed}} with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed {{for nearly three}} years. In addition to appearing in four films she toured Scotland and Ireland {{as part of a}} vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film Java Head (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, {{one of the most famous}} stars of the Beijing Opera. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> visited China.|$|E

5|$|As Madge and {{her family}} turns to {{celebrate}} Christmas, the Doctor attempts to slip away, but Madge catches him, and as she sees the TARDIS realises {{that he is the}} man in the space suit from three years before. She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to go to see them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex"). They invite him to have Christmas dinner, as they had always set him a place at the dinner table. Unseen by them, the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy.|$|E
5|$|Davos Seaworth confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre {{admits to}} burning Shireen alive, but {{points out that}} she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was {{defeated}} anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her {{to admit that she}} was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon Snow to execute Melisandre, but she counters that she will be useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon exiles Melisandre from the North and threatens to execute her if <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> returns. Later, Jon and Sansa Stark discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal {{attention from the}} Bradley family than her mother could give each of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with the Bradley family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time for dance. At fifteen years old, Copeland won {{first place in the}} Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland said {{it was the first time}} <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. She {{was never able to}} walk, nor did <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation at a time when some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes {{that a lot of}} her exploits are poorly documented, and it is not always possible to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not certain <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E
5|$|Vanguard {{was laid}} down on 2 October 1941 by John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland, with the yard number of 567. After the Japanese {{invasion}} of Malaya in December, {{the ship was}} given an A1 priority {{in the hope of}} finishing her by the end of 1944 and construction of the light cruiser HMS Bellerophon, as well as some merchant shipping, was halted to expedite the ship's completion. This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of skilled labour. As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched. Princess Elizabeth presided over this ceremony, the first ship <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> launched, and was presented with a diamond rose brooch to commemorate the event.|$|E

5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but will avoid putting innocents in danger, Olivia has Fringe Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes {{this to be the}} only way to force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew the next day and confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin sample that, should <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> need it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E
5|$|Later {{she goes}} on a night out to The Loft nightclub and threatens Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki). She says that she will kill Lau if <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> goes near Jake again, making viewers realise that Loretta had changed her {{personality}} and her behaviour since her absence. Loretta pretends she had Leukaemia but Jake finds out the truth and ends their relationship. She later convinces Steph that Jake lied when he told Steph that Loretta had said she was ill and she makes Frankie and Steph believe Jake is losing his mind again. She send messages from Jake's mobile phone and plants defaced pictures of her and Jake in his coat {{to make it look}} real. Loretta reveals to Steph that she was sexually abused as a child. Jake gets back together with Loretta to stop her from getting him put back into a mental health clinic. Nancy finds out the truth about Loretta from Adam, she confronts Loretta who pushes her over and Nancy is badly hurt. Jake saves Nancy and she agrees not to go to the police. Loretta reveals she did not lie when she was sexually abused and Jake asks her to get help and will stand by her. Loretta is last seen admitting herself into the hospital.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if <b>she</b> <b>ever</b> decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E
