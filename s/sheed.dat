5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (<b>sheed).</b> The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E

40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{clinically}} effective antiviral agent for the prevention or treatment of ocular adenoviral infections. Using a paired-eye, masked design, we tested the antiviral efficacy of topical 0. 1 % (S) - 1 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine in the New Zealand rabbit ocular model after topical and intrastromal inoculation with 100 microliters (4 x 10 (5) plaque-forming units per eye) of adenovirus type 5 McEwen, a clinical isolate. Prevention studies involved pretreatment (six times a day) 1 day before inoculation and continuing for 4 additional days. Compared with the control eyes, the pretreated eyes showed {{a significant reduction in}} the peak viral eye titers on days 3, 4, 5, and 7 after treatment (p < 0. 03 - 0. 005), and a reduction in the duration of viral <b>sheeding</b> (p < 0. 02). Rebound increase in adenoviral titers was detected in five of 20 eyes (25 %) after cessation of treatment, suggesting a therapeutic effect and a need for further studies to optimize the treatment regimen. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Author: Petra Burešová Title of thesis: Effect of high soluble endoglin {{levels on}} the liver {{morphology}} in mice Bachelor thesis Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové Study course: Medical laboratory technician Endoglin (CD 105) {{is an integral}} transmembrane protein with total weight of 180 kDa. It is characterised by its participation in the signaling cascade of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) due to {{its role as a}} co-receptor of this factor. In addition, a soluble form of endoglin (sol-Eng) which is produced by proteolytical <b>sheeding</b> from the extracellular part of membrane bound endoglin into circulation was demonstrated. Recently, it was shown, that endoglin is crucial factor in the development of both, cardiac fibrosis in the failing myocardium and liver fibrosis. The aim of our work was to detect liver fibrosis in transgenic mice. Using basic histological techniques and collagen staining we evaluated development of liver fibrosis in transgenic mice overexpressing human soluble endoglin on chow and high fat diet in comparison with control mice with low levels of human soluble endoglin. Our histological results show that high soluble endoglin levels have no effect on the development of fibrotic changes in the liver. However, it will be very interesting to evaluate [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Ferret {{tracheal}} organ cultures prepared {{from animals}} previously infected intranasally with influenza A virus required approximately 130 times more homologous virus (A/PR/ 8 / 34 (HON 1) or A/Port Chalmers/ 1 / 73 (H 3 N 2)) to become infected in vitro than similar cultures from normal ferrets. Also, these cultures from convalescent ferrets required 9 times more heterologous virus (A/PR/ 8 / 34 (HON 1) or Sendai) to become infected in vitro than similar cultures from normal animals challenged in vitro with the hererologous virus. We conclude that these tracheal rings are specifically immune. Once tracheal rings are infected, {{they continue to}} shed viruses for at least 60 days, the longest period any cultures were kept. Virus <b>sheeding</b> in the intact ferret lasts normally 5 - 7 days. Thus recovery in the intact ferret seems to be dependent upon factors which are not present, {{or at least not}} functional, in the tracheal explant. This is consistent with the hypothesis that recovery is dependent upon systemic rather than local phenomena. Bladder tissue from normal and previously infected ferrets was also cultured and challenged with homologous and heterologous virus. The bladder from previously infected ferrets exhibited specific immunity, although the immunity was more varible...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a commercially {{available}} Polyphenolic Vegetable Extract (PVE) from Schinopsis lorentzii (Bioquina) for the reduction of coccidiosis in broiler chicks was evaluated. Day-of-hatch male broiler chicks were obtained from a local hatchery and randomly assigned to three experimental groups consisting of 8 chickens per group with four replicates per treatment: Group 1, PVE 10 % - challenged; Group 2, untreated - challenged and Group 3, -untreated, non-challenged. Heated brooder batteries were used for housing and chicks were allowed ad libitum access to unmedicated broiler rations and water {{for the duration of}} the experiment. On day 21 post-hatch, all birds in groups 1 and 2 were challenged by oral gavage with 3 mL of a mixed suspension of freshly sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella (50, 000 oocyst/mL), E. maxima (50, 000 oocyst/mL) and E. avervulina (50, 000 oocyst/mL). Group 3 was sham inoculated with 3 mL of PBS. Body weight gain was obtained seven days after coccidia challenge. Oocyst <b>sheeding</b> was performed at 5, 7 and 10 days PI. Intestinal macroscopic lesions and histological morphometric analysis was performed 7 days PI. No significant differences were observed in terms of total mortality or lesion scores. Supplementation of PVE significantly increased body weight gain, crypt:villi ratio and decreased oocyst excretion (p Eimeria challenge.

40|$|The {{circulation}} in the South Atlantic Ocean has been simulated within a global ocean general circulation model. Preliminary {{analysis of the}} modelled ocean {{circulation in}} the region indicates a rather close agreement of the simulated upper ocean flows with conventional notions of the large-scale geostrophic currents in the region. The modelled South Atlantic Ocean witnesses the return flow and export of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at its northern boundary, the inflow of a rather barotropic Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) through the Drake Passage, and the inflow of warm saline Agulhas water around the Cape of Good Hope. The Agulhas leakage amounts to 8. 7 Sv, within recent estimates of the mass transport shed westward at the Agulhas retroflection. Topographic steering of the ACC dominates the structure of flow in the circumpolar ocean. The Benguela Current is seen to be fed by a mixture of saline Indian Ocean water (originating from the Agulhas Current) and fresher Subantarctic surface water (originating in the ACC). The Benguela Current is seen to modify its flow and fate with depth; near the surface it flows north-westwards bifurcating most of its transport northward into the North Atlantic Ocean (for ultimate replacement of North Atlantic surface waters lost to the NADW conveyor). Deeper in the water column, more of the Benguela Current is destined to return with the Brazil Current, though northward flows are still generated where the Benguela Current extension encounters the coast of South America. At intermediate levels, these northward currents trace the flow of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) equatorward, though even more AAIW is seen to recirculate poleward in the subtropical gyre. In spite of the model's rather coarse resolution, some subtle features of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence are simulated rather well, including the latitude at which the two currents meet. Conceptual diagrams of the recirculation and interocean exchange of thermocline, intermediate and deep waters are constructed from an analysis of flows bound between isothermal and isobaric surfaces. This analysis shows how the return path of NADW is partitioned between a cold water route through the Drake Passage (6. 5 Sv), a warm water route involving the Agulhas Current <b>sheeding</b> thermocline water westward (2. 5 Sv), and a recirculation of intermediate water originating in the Indian Ocean (1. 6 Sv) ...|$|R
