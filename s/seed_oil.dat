40|$|Background: Lead and cadmium are toxic {{heavy metals}} found as major {{contaminants}} in food products and edible oils. The aims {{of this study}} were to investigate the lead and cadmium contaminations in <b>seeds</b> and extracted <b>oils</b> from Brassica napus L and Carthamus tinctorius grown in the vicinity of industrial sites (Isfahan Zobe Ahan) near Isfahan province/Iran. Methods: In this study, the seeds of B. napus and C. tinctorius were randomly sampled from the farms. The <b>oils</b> of <b>seeds</b> were provided by factory and extracted as well in our laboratory. The two series of washed and unwashed seeds digested with nitric acid and the amount of elements in <b>seeds</b> and <b>oils</b> were measured using GF-AA spectrometer equipped with Zeeman Effect. Results: Cadmium was found in all samples below the Method Detection Limit (MDL, 0. 04 μg/L). Lead contaminations were found in all <b>seeds</b> and <b>oils</b> except washed B. napus seeds. The highest levels of lead contaminations were observed in oils of C. tinctorius and B. napus with the amount of 24. 74 μg/L and 11. 85 μg/L, respectively. The level of lead in unwashed <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> were significantly higher than washed <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The contamination rate of cadmium compared with lead was very low. The higher lead contaminations in unwashed <b>seeds</b> <b>oils</b> compared with washed <b>seeds</b> <b>oils</b> indicated that the contaminant should have been be transferred through the air. Although these observations suggest that the levels of contaminations in edible oils are below the toxic level, long-term exposure may lead to potential health risks. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> {{of seven}} Trifolium species (Leguminosae) were {{investigated}} for their protein, tannin contents and fatty acid compositions. The fatty acid compositions of these seven different species {{were determined by}} gas chromatography of the methyl esters of their fatty acids. The seed protein contents {{were found to be}} between 23. 57 and 36. 60 %. The seed tannin contents were found to be between 0. 77 and 1. 73 %. The <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> of Trifolium species contain palmitic and stearic acids as the major component fatty acids, among the saturated acids, {{with a small amount of}} myristic, pentadecanoic, arachidic and behenic acids. The major unsaturated fatty acids found in the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> were oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. In this study, Total Saturated Fatty Acids (TSFA) of Trifolium species were between 18. 5 and 24. 4 % while Total Unsaturated Fatty Acids (TUSFA) were between 71. 1 and 80. 3 %. The results revealed that the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> of Trifolium species studied with a substantial amount of very long chain fatty acids might have attracted attention because of their value of nutritional, industrial and renewable resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} and commercial exploitation of Allanblackia (Clusiaceae) <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> is of current interest. The favorable physicochemical characteristics of Allanblackia oil (solid at room temperature; high stearic acid content) lend food products that contain it (i. e., vegetable-based dairy products, ice cream, spreads) health advantages over others that contain {{higher levels of}} lauric, myristic, and/or palmitic acids, which can increase blood cholesterol levels. Such considerations are important for individuals prone to cardiovascular disease or with hypercholesterolemia. Domestication projects of several Allanblackia species in tropical Africa are underway, but wildcrafting of fruits to meet the seed demand still occurs. Proper species authentication is important, since only authenticated oil can be deemed safe for human consumption. The chemical constituency of Allanblackia <b>seed</b> <b>oils,</b> and potential roles of these phytochemicals in preventive strategies (e. g., {{as part of a}} healthy diet) and as pharmacological agents used to treat chronic disease were examined in this review. The primary and secondary metabolite constituency of the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> of nearly all Allanblackia species is still poorly known.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{a new family}} of {{homogeneous}} metathesis catalysts has been developed that will tolerate most organic functionalities as well as water and air. These homogeneous catalysts are finding numerous applications in the pharmaceutical industry {{as well as in}} the production of functional polymers. In addition the catalysts are being used to convert <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> into products that can substitute for those that are now made from petroleum products. <b>Seed</b> <b>oils</b> are unsaturated, contain double bonds, and are a ready source of linear hydrocarbon fragments that are specifically functionalized. To increase the number of applications in the area of biomaterial conversion to petrol chemicals, the activity and efficiency of the catalysts need to be as high as possible. The higher the efficiency of the catalysts, the lower the cost of the conversion and a larger number of practical applications become available. Active supported catalysts were prepared and tested in the conversion of <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> and other important starting materials. The outcome of the work was successful and the technology has been transferred to a commercial operation to develop viable applications of the discovered systems. A biorefinery that converts <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> is under construction in Indonesia. The catalysts developed in this study will be considered for the next generation of operations...|$|R
