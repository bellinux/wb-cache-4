40|$|International audienceAbove {{the glass}} {{transition}} temperature, a <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymer</b> can behave like an elastomer or a stiff polymer {{according to the}} crystal content. For a reliable design of such polymeric materials, it is of prime importance to dispose a unified constitutive modeling able to capture the transition from thermoplastic-like to elastomeric-like mechanical response, as the crystal content changes. This work deals with polyethylene materials containing {{a wide range of}} crystal fractions, stretched under large strains at room temperature and different strain rates. A large-strain viscoelastic-viscoplastic approach is adopted to describe the mechanical response of these polymers. In order to identify the model parameters, an analytical deterministic scheme and a practical, "engineering-like", numerical tool, based on a genetic algorithm are developed. A common point of manipulated constitutive models is that the elementary deformation mechanisms are described by two parallel resistances; one describes the intermolecular interactions and the other deals with the molecular network stretching and orientation process. In a first approach, the semi-crystalline polymers are considered as homogeneous media; at each crystal content, the <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymer</b> is thus considered as a new material and a new set of model parameters is provided. In a second approach, the <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymer</b> is seen as a two-phase composite, and the effective contribution of the crystalline and amorphous phases to the overall mechanical response is integrated in the constitutive model, which allows simulating the transition from thermoplastic-like to elastomeric-like mechanical response. In this case, one set of model parameters is needed, the only variable being the crystal volume fraction. The identification results obtained using deterministic and numerical methods are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{constitutive}} modelling of <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymers</b> {{seeks to}} obtain reliable predictive tools {{for a wide}} range of their mechanical responses. Such efforts have continued to occupy computational material scientists. Although significant advances have been made regarding amorphous polymers, thanks to works by Buckley [1], Boyce [2], and Govaert [3], there is significant research scope for developing similar predictive modelling fidelity for <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymers.</b> The presence of crystalline and amorphous phases in <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymers</b> presents interesting constitutive modelling challenges. In this study, a physically based, three-dimensional constitutive model has been developed for simulating a wide range of features observed in deformation and processing of <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymers.</b> The constitutive mathematics is based on a one-process Grass-Rubber model for amorphous polymers proposed by Buckley and colleagues [1]. The model philosophy exploits the presence of multiple relaxation processes associated with the different mechanics of the crystalline, amorphous and pseudo-amorphous parts of the polymer. The model development reasoning is inspired by a well-known physical framework of rate-dependent deformation that establishes a correlation between the observed transition in flow stress of a material and the secondary β-transition of the viscoelastic behaviour. Here, two dominant relaxation processes were identified - the α- and the β-processes. Each process was modelled using the bond-stretching and conformational stresses constitutive mathematics of the Glass-Rubber model. The model has been implemented numerically into a commercial finite element code through a user-defined material subroutine (UMAT) and validated against compression test results carried out on an isotactic polypropylene across an unusually wide range of strain rates [4]. In this study, the model predicts quite well the experimentally observed nonlinear mechanical responses like: temperature and rate-dependence, adiabatic heating effects, structural rejuvenation and post-yield de-ageing of polypropylene. It provides a viable modelling tool that can be utilized for design involving semicrystalline polymers at room temperature as well as exploring the processing response at elevated temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The grained {{patterns}} of <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymer</b> thin films are of great scientific and industrial importance. They strongly affect polymer material properties specially the functionality in optical and electronic applications. The formation of grained pattern {{is the result}} of the nucleation-growth process. Nucleation and growth and their evolution have received much interest in the physics, materials and polymer science and engineering community. Typically domain growth associated with first order non-equilibrium phase transitions occurs via spinodal decomposition or nucleation and growth. However, the details of nucleation-growth are not well understood. The grain structure of <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymer</b> systems has not been studied so far and was very poorly understood. In this work, systematic experiments have been carried out to elucidate the polymer spherulite growth mechanism, the spatio-temporal evolution of nucleation-growth and grain formation. We take spatial correlation into account and describe both geometrical and topological characteristics of the structural evolution in nucleation and growth. Physical models, computational and direct imaging methods have been developed and integrated for prediction and characterization of the microstructure formation in the <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymer</b> thin films. Novel domain-spatial correlation functions and structure functions are proposed and evaluated with experimental data. Scaling relationships for nucleation-growth are explored with experimental data from both FFT imaging and the domain-spatial correlation function.

A specific damage characterization method using Digital Image Correlation is proposed {{for a wide range}} of strain rates considering tensile tests with hydraulic jacks as well as Hopkinson's bars. This damage measurement is obtained by using and adapting the SEE method [1] which was developed to characterize the behaviour laws at constant strain rates of polymeric materials in dynamic. To validate the characterization process, various damage measurement techniques are used under quasi-static conditions before to apply the procedure in dynamic. So, the well-known damage characterization by loss of stiffness technique under quasi-static loading is applied to a polypropylene. In addition, an in-situ tensile test, carried out in a microtomograph, is used to observe the cavitation phenomenon in real time. A good correlation is obtained between all these techniques and consequently the proposed technique is supposed suitable for measuring the ductile damage observed in semi-crystalline polymers under dynamic loading. By applying it to the <b>semi-crystalline</b> <b>polymer</b> at moderate and high speed loadings, the damage evolution is measured and it is observed that the damage evolution is not strain rate dependent but the failure strain on the contrary is strain rate dependent...|$|E
