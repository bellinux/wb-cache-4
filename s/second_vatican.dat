5|$|In 1960, Pope John XXIII {{appointed}} Lefebvre to the Central Preparatory Commission for the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council. Lefebvre {{took part}} in the discussions about the draft documents to be submitted to the bishops for consideration at the Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{one of the}} {{principal}} documents of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, the dogmatic constitution Dei verbum (Latin for Word of God), emphasized the use of Lectio divina and on the 40th anniversary of Dei verbum in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, the cathedral underwent a series of renovations. The roof—which was previously made of timber—was replaced with a concrete one in 1952 due to damage from termites. The reordering of the sanctuary took place in 1969 after the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, in which the main altar was moved to the cathedral's crossing. In 1988, air conditioning was installed and the roof underwent reparation.|$|E
5|$|Agagianian was {{elevated}} to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. He was Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) from 1958 to 1970. A theological liberal, linguist, and {{an authority on}} the Soviet Union, he served {{as one of the}} four moderators at the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council and was twice considered a serious papal candidate, during the conclaves of 1958 and 1963.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{after two}} centuries, the Holy See re-assessed the issue. Pope Pius XII issued a decree on December 8, 1939, authorizing Chinese Catholics {{to observe the}} ancestral rites and {{participate}} in Confucius-honoring ceremonies. The general principle of sometimes admitting native traditions even into the liturgy of the church, provided that such traditions harmonize with the true and authentic spirit of the liturgy, was proclaimed by the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–65).|$|E
5|$|When this happened, Soegijapranata was in Europe {{to attend}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council {{as part of the}} Central Preparatory Commission; he was one of eleven diocesan bishops and archbishops from Asia. He was able {{to attend the}} first session, where he voiced {{concerns}} about declining quality of pastoral work and called for the modernisation of the Church. He then returned to Indonesia, but his health, poor since the late 1950s, quickly declined.|$|E
5|$|Agagianian {{sat on the}} Board of Presidency of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (Vatican II), {{which took}} place from 1962 to 1965. He was {{appointed}} by Pope Paul VI {{as one of the}} four moderators who directed the course of the debates, along with Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius Döpfner, and Giacomo Lercaro. Agagianian {{was the only one of}} these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches. He had a special role in the preparation of the missionary decree Ad gentes and Gaudium et spes, the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World.|$|E
5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} both a Licentiate of Sacred Theology (1956) and Doctorate of Canon Law (1961) {{from the}} Gregorian, and after doing pastoral and curial {{work in the}} Diocese of Harrisburg, {{he served as a}} peritus, or expert, and secretary to Bishop George Leech at the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–1965). He attended all four sessions. Keeler worked for the Council Digest, a communications service used to bring people in the United States day-to day news of the Council.|$|E
5|$|Pope John XXIII, on October 4, 1962, {{became the}} first pope to use the Vatican railway during his pilgrimage to Loreto and Assisi one week before the {{beginning}} of <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council using the Italian presidential train; the trip was broadcast on the Eurovision Network. Prior to John's trip in 1962, Pope Pius IX had been both the last pope to visit Loreto (as the head of the Papal States) and the last pope to travel by train. John XXIII also arranged for the major relics of Pope Pius X to be transferred to Venice using the Vatican railway.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Europe he was elected Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers and {{assigned}} {{to participate in the}} drafting and preparation of documents for the upcoming <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–65) announced by Pope John XXIII, and was a major leader of the conservative bloc during its proceedings. He would later take the lead in opposing certain changes within the Church associated with the Council. Refusing to implement council-inspired reforms demanded by its members, he resigned from the leadership of the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1968.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for modernization and reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become impossible for him to remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or listened to him.|$|E
5|$|Music in {{religious}} rituals, especially Roman Catholic, {{manifests itself in}} a number of ways. Parish bands, for example, are quite common throughout Italy. They may be as small as four or five members to as many as 20 or 30. They commonly perform at religious festivals specific to a particular town, usually in honor of the town's patron saint. The historic orchestral/choral masterpieces performed in church by professionals are well-known; these include such works as the Stabat Mater by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Verdi's Requiem. The <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council from 1962 to 1965 revolutionized music in the Roman Catholic Church, leading to {{an increase in the number}} of amateur choirs that perform regularly for services; the Council also encouraged the congregational singing of hymns, and a vast repertoire of new hymns has been composed in the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Roman Missal, {{published}} {{a few months before}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V {{at the request of the}} Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} of native Catholics expanded greatly {{in the years following}} his consecration, Soegijapranata was soon faced with numerous trials. The Empire of Japan invaded the Indies beginning in early 1942, and during the ensuing occupation numerous churches were seized and clergymen were arrested or killed. Soegijapranata was able to resist several of these seizures, and {{spent the rest of the}} occupation serving the Catholics in his vicariate. After President Sukarno proclaimed the country's independence in August 1945, Semarang was overcome with unrest. Soegijapranata helped broker a ceasefire after a five-day battle between Japanese and Indonesian troops and called for the central government to send someone to deal with the unrest and food shortages in the city. However, these problems continued to grow, and in 1947 Soegijapranata moved his seat to Yogyakarta. For the remainder of the national revolution Soegijapranata worked to promote international recognition of Indonesia's independence. Soon after the Dutch, who had returned in late 1945, recognised the country's independence, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. During the post-revolution years he wrote extensively against communism and expanded the church; he also served as a mediator between several political factions. He was made an archbishop on 3January 1961, when Semarang was elevated to an ecclesiastical province. At the time he was in Europe, participating in the first session of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council. Soegijapranata died in 1963, in Steyl, the Netherlands. His body was flown back to Indonesia, where he was made a national hero and interred at Giri Tunggal Heroes' Cemetery in Semarang.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, he left New Orleans for Vatican City {{to attend}} the first session of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council.|$|E
25|$|By {{the apostolic}} {{constitution}} Indulgentiarum doctrina of 1 January 1967, Pope Paul VI, responding to suggestions {{made at the}} <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, substantially revised the practical application of the traditional doctrine.|$|E
25|$|He {{was opposed}} to the reforms of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council and criticised the Church that emerged from it. He was often {{critical}} of Archbishops Basil Hume and Derek Worlock.|$|E
25|$|The Pontifical Commission for Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law that Pope Benedict XV {{established}} on 5 September 1917 continued in existence until replaced on 18 March 1963 by Pope John XXIII's Pontifical Commission for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law, a revision {{called for by}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council. Pope Paul VI {{established on}} 11 July 1967 the Pontifical Commission for Interpretation of the Decrees of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council and, two years later, extended its mandate to the interpretation also of the documents issued by the Holy See to implement those decrees.|$|E
25|$|Over the centuries, {{the use of}} {{complete}} Psalms in the liturgy declined. After the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council (which also permitted the use of vernacular languages in the liturgy), longer psalm texts were reintroduced into the Mass, during the readings. The revision of the Roman Missal after the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council reintroduced the singing or recitation of a more substantial section of a Psalm, in some cases an entire Psalm, after the first Reading from Scripture. This Psalm, called the Responsorial Psalm, is usually sung or recited responsorially, although the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 61 permits direct recitation.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not {{the liturgical}} changes (together with the other changes in the Church that {{followed}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council) have caused the loss of faith that has occurred in Western countries is disputed.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, Jesuits have founded {{many schools}} {{with the special}} purpose of serving the poor or marginalized, as among the Dalits in India and the Cristo Rey Network in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Baptiste Urrutia (born 6 November 1901, Les Aduldes, Basses-Pyrénées, France – died 15 January 1979, Montbeton, France) was a French Roman Catholic missionary {{from the}} Paris Foreign Missions Society. He was an {{attendee}} at the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council.|$|E
25|$|No {{longer a}} {{residential}} see, Seleucia in Isauria has {{been included in}} the list of titular sees of the Catholic Church, which has made no new appointments of a titular bishop to this eastern see since the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council.|$|E
25|$|About {{the time}} of his {{departure}} from the Blue Army, Schuckardt began giving lectures throughout the United States, promoting devotion to the Virgin Mary as well as speaking out against the various doctrinal changes that were, he claimed, the result of the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, {{the order}} renewed its Constitutions {{starting}} with its 1968 general chapter at Majadahonda, Madrid, {{a process which}} was concluded in 1987.

25|$|Following the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, the Catholic Church's Roman Rite {{simplified}} the {{observance of}} the canonical hours {{and sought to}} make them more suited to the needs of today's apostolate and accessible to the laity, hoping to restore their character as the prayer of the entire Church.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>Second</b> <b>Vatican</b> Council, (specifically the Sacrosanctum Concilium) {{permitted}} the universal prayers to {{be translated into}} vernacular languages, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines {{was one of the}} first to translate the Roman Missal into Tagalog. The Roman Missal in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.|$|E
