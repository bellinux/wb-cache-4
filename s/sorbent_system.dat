In its application for the sorption-enhanced steammethane reforming process (SE-SMR), CO 2 is captured in a sorption mode through the formation of CaCO 3, at which stage, the conversion of CH 4 to H 2 is also enhanced.

To better assess the potential advantages of solid sorbents for post-combustion CO 2 capture, this paper presents preliminary results of an analysis of two representative sorbents in an integrated model for estimating plant-level performance and costs for a new, supercritical pulverized coal (PC) power plant. A probabilistic comparison is then made between two solid sorbents and a commercial amine-based liquid solvent system. Our results show that for a 90 % CO 2 removal efficiency, the solid sorbent provides an expected net plant efficiency of 32 % (higher heating value basis) for a metal-organic framework solid and 29 % efficiency for a solid amine-based sorbent, versus 28 % net efficiency with a liquid amine- based system using the same reference plant assumptions.

40|$|Lipophilic nucleosides and oligonucleotides {{have been}} found to have an {{extensive}} range of applications. They have shown a wide variety of antiviral and antitumour activities and represent a new class of drug carriers for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Lipophilic nucleosides and oligonucleotides are involved in the formation of monolayer films, micelles and/or vesicles, organogels or multilamellar layers and have a wide variety of biotechnological (eg. chip technology) and chromatographic applications. The objective of this project was to synthesize hydrophobically modified nucleotide analogs and incorporate them into oligonucleotides with the objective of achieving enhanced chromatographic separations. The synthesis of these analogs was achieved by introducing lipophilic functionalities at the 5 '- position of deoxythymidine, a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside, commonly called thymidine. The scheme that evolved over the course of synthesis involved TBS-protection of commercially available Thymidine at both the 3 ' and 5 ' hydroxyl groups, selective 5 '-deprotection, 5 '-tosylation, substitution of tosyloxy group by primary amines (CH 3 (CH 2) nNH 2, where n = 3, 7, 11, 17), acylation of the resulting 5 '-amino 5 '-deoxythymidine analogs with palmitoyl chloride and conversion of each of these analogs into their corresponding 3 '-phosphoramidite derivatives. This was followed by incorporating these modified phosphoramidite analogs into an oligomeric sequence at the 5 '-end by carrying out solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. The oligomeric sequence chosen for incorporation of the modified thymidine phosphoramidite analogs was the human telomere nucleotide sequence, namely the telomeric repeat: 5 '-TTAGGG- 3 ' resulting in a heptameric sequence of T'TTAGGG where T' stands for the hydrophobically modified deoxythymidine analogs. Thus, the synthesis of four different lipophilically modified heptameric oligonucleotides was achieved and their characterization established using mass spectrometry. The lipophilic oligomers, which have structural similarity to an amphiphile, are proposed to have a reversible non-covalent interaction with the reverse phase surface of the C 18 -modified <b>sorbent</b> <b>system</b> by insertion of their lipophilic tails into the hydrophobic surface of the sorbent. Both solution and solid phase hybridization/binding studies were carried out. Solution phase binding/hybridization studies showed an interaction/binding between the modified oligonucleotides and their normal complementary strands by recording a decrease in absorbance at 260 nm(A 260) with decrease in temperature. Retention/Adsorption properties of the modified as well as normal oligonucleotides on reverse phase sorbent systems were studied. ENVI-C 18 discs were used and subsequently abandoned as the <b>sorbent</b> <b>system</b> of choice because they retained both the modified and normal oligonucleotides in equal measure and showed no selectivity. Also the glass microfiber discs lost their physical integrity when exposed to the analyte solution. Reverse Phase ZipTips were used as an alternative sorbent phase and {{it was found that the}} percent retention/adsorption of the lipophilic (modified) oligonucleotide under a given condition of temperature and/or ionic strength is appreciably greater than the percent retention of the normal unmodified complementary strand. Also, it was found that the increase in percent retention/adsorption of the modified oligomers with increase in temperature and/or ionic strength was greater than the increase observed with the normal unmodified complementary strands. It was observed that the RP sorbent phase preloaded with the modified oligomer showed a greater percent retention of the normal complementary strand under given conditions of temperature and/or ionic strength relative to the percent complementary strand retained when the RP sorbent phase is preloaded with the unmodified control oligomer. It was also observed that the modified oligomer analog with the longest hydrophobic chain length showed greatest percent retention on the reverse phase <b>sorbent</b> <b>system,</b> namely the RP ZipTips...|$|E

S., a total of 19 million tons of disposable FGD byproduct are produced, transported and disposed of in landfills annually. The use of regenerable sorbent technologies has the potential to reduce or eliminate solid waste production, transportation and disposal. In a regenerable <b>sorbent</b> <b>system,</b> the sulfur dioxide in the boiler flue gas is removed by the sorbent in an adsorber. The S 0 {sub 2 }s subsequently released, in higher concentration, in a regenerator. All regenerable systems produce an off-gas stream from the regenerator that must be processed further in order to obtain a salable byproduct, such as elemental sulfur, sulfuric acid or liquid S 0 {sub 2 }...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum {{kinetics}} using bicarbonate dialysate {{with the}} <b>sorbent</b> <b>system.</b> In the REDY system a sorbent cartridge {{is used to}} regenerate the spent hemodialysate so that only six liters of dialysate are required for a treatment. The manufacturer claims that the cartridge {{can be used to}} remove aluminum from the dialysate and that it does not add aluminum to the dialysate. This claim for acetate dialysate is supported by the literature, but there are few data available relative to bicarbonate dialysate. The present study evaluates the use of bicarbonate dialysate and the REDY system in regard to aluminum kinetics both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the sorbent cartridge removed aluminum from dialysate prepared from water containing as much as 470 µg/liter of aluminum, giving a dialysate containing less than 10 µg/liter. The first 500 ml of effluent contained 13 µug/liter of aluminum but after filtration decreased to below 10 µg/liter. Thus, it is unnecessary, as recommended, to discard the first effluent since this unfilterable aluminum will not pass through a dialysis membrane. In vivo, in a crossover study comparing the REDY with single pass, {{there were no significant differences}} between the pre- and post-plasma aluminum concentrations, and the dialysate aluminum remained below 4 µg/liter during the dialysis. In a second in vivo study the effect of dialysate from tap water on plasma aluminum using the predialysis purification procedure was evaluated. There was no differences between the pre- and post-plasma aluminum concentration. The aluminum levels were comparable to those of the crossover study. The dialysate remained below 4 µg/liter during the dialysis...|$|E
40|$|Aminocyclopyrachlor (6 -amino- 5 -chloro- 2 -cyclopropyl- 4 -pyrimidinecarboxylic acid), a new herbicide, was {{approved}} by US-EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) in September 2010 for the control of broadleaf weeds, grasses, vines and woody species in non-crops, turf, sod farms and residential areas. At typical soil pH levels, aminocyclopyrachlor is anionic. Anionic pesticides are generally weakly retained by most soil and sediment components and are subject to potential transport offsite. One strategy {{to minimize the risk}} of offsite transport associated with weakly sorbed, highly mobile pesticides is the application of these chemicals supported on a sorbent, such as modified clay minerals which contain exchangeable inorganic and organic cations. The aim was to determine the ability of unmodified and modified clay minerals to sorb aminocyclopyrachlor. Two montmorillonites (Ca-Arizona montorillonite (SAz- 1) and Na-Wyoming montmorillonite (SWy- 2)) were used as unmodified clay minerals and were also modified with an inorganic cation (Fe 3 +), soil constituents (ferrihydrite, humic acid) and organic cations (hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA), hexadimethrine, spermine). Greater sorption of aminocyclopyrachlor was observed in the sorbent-solution systems with lower pH values, presumably because of protonation of the herbicide anion at low pH and subsequent sorption of molecular species and cationic species. FeSWy- 2 (SWy- 2 montmorillonite saturated with Fe 3 +; system pH = 4. 6) was the best sorbent for aminocyclopyrachlor (86 % of applied). The best organo-clay (SA-HDTMA) (system pH = 6. 1) sorbed 53 % of the applied herbicide. Binary and ternary model sorbents (system pH > 6. 7) did not sorb aminocyclopyrachlor. At the lowest pH value studied (2. 8), the organo-clay SW-Sper was the best <b>sorbent</b> <b>system</b> for aminocyclopyrachlor. Our recommendation for the best adsorbent is the clay mineral modified with Fe 3 +, although at pH values < 3, the use of the organo-clay SW-Sperm could be also convenient. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Challenges {{exist for}} the study of time {{dependent}} sorption processes for heterogeneous systems, {{especially in the case of}} dispersed nanomaterials in solvents or solutions because they are not well suited to conventional batch kinetic experiments. In this study, a comparison of batch versus a one-pot setup in two variable configurations was evaluated {{for the study of}} uptake kinetics in heterogeneous (solid/solution) systems: (i) conventional batch method; (ii) one-pot system with dispersed adsorbent in solution with a semi-permeable barrier (filter paper or dialysis tubing) for in situ sampling; and (iii) one-pot system with an adsorbent confined in a semi-permeable barrier (dialysis tubing or filter paper barrier) with ex situ sampling. The <b>sorbent</b> <b>systems</b> evaluated herein include several cyclodextrin-based polyurethane materials with two types of phenolic dyes: p-nitrophenol and phenolphthalein. The one-pot kinetics method with in situ (Method ii) or ex situ (Method iii) sampling described herein offers significant advantages for the study of heterogeneous sorption kinetics of highly dispersed sorbent materials with particles sizes across a range of dimensions from the micron to nanometer scale. The method described herein will contribute positively to the development of advanced studies for heterogeneous sorption processes where an assessment of the relative uptake properties is required at different experimental conditions. The results of this study will be advantageous for the study of nanomaterials with significant benefits over batch kinetic studies for a wide range of heterogeneous sorption processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{epidemic of}} {{chronic kidney disease}} {{shows no signs of}} abating in the near future. Current dialysis forms of renal replacement therapy (RRT), even though successful in sustaining life and improving quality of life somewhat for patients with ESRD, have many limitations that result in still unacceptably high morbidity and mortality. Transplantation is an excellent option but is limited by the scarcity of organs. An ideal form of RRT would mimic the functions of natural kidneys and be transparent to the patient, as well as affordable to society. Recent advances in technology, although generally in early stages of development, might achieve these goals. The application of nanotechnology, microfluidics, bioreactors with kidney cells, and miniaturized <b>sorbent</b> <b>systems</b> to regenerate dialysate makes clinical reality seem closer than ever before. Finally, stem cells hold much promise, both for kidney disease and as a source of tissues and organs. In summary, nephrology is at an exciting crossroad with the application of innovative and novel technologies to RRT that hold considerable promise for the near future.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The 491 U. S. coal-fired power plants are the largest unregulated industrial source of mercury emissions nationwide, annually emitting about 48 tons of mercury [...] a toxic element that poses health threats, including neurological disorders in children. In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that mercury emissions from these sources should be regulated, but the agency has not set a maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standard, as the Clean Air Act requires. Some power plants, however, must reduce mercury emissions to comply with state laws or consent decrees. After managing a long-term mercury control research and development program, the Department of Energy (DOE) reported in 2008 that <b>systems</b> that inject <b>sorbents</b> [...] powdery substances to which mercury binds [...] into the exhaust from boilers of coal-fired power plants were ready for commercial deployment. Tests of <b>sorbent</b> injection <b>systems,</b> the most mature mercury control technology, were conducted {{on a variety of}} coal types and boiler configurations [...] that is, on boilers using different air pollution control devices. This testimony provides preliminary data from GAO's ongoing work on (1) reductions achieved by mercury control technologies and the extent of their use at coal-fired power plants, (2) the cost of mercury control technologies in use at these plants, and (3) key issues EPA faces in regulating mercury emissions from power plants.
