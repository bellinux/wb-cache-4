40|$|Word <b>Sense</b> Disambiguation aims {{to label}} the <b>sense</b> {{of a word}} that best applies in a given context. Graded word <b>sense</b> {{disambiguation}} relaxes the single label assumption, allowing for multiple <b>sense</b> labels {{with varying degrees of}} applicability. Training multi-label classifiers for such a task requires substantial amounts of annotated data, which is currently not available. We consider an alternate method of annotating graded <b>senses</b> using Word <b>Sense</b> Induction, which automatically learns the <b>senses</b> and their features from corpus properties. Our work proposes three objective to evaluate performance on the graded <b>sense</b> annotation task, and two new methods for mapping between <b>sense</b> inventories using parallel graded <b>sense</b> annotations. We demonstrate that <b>sense</b> induction offers significant promise for accurate graded <b>sense</b> annotation. ...|$|R

5000|$|Abstract <b>sense</b> data is <b>sense</b> data without human judgement, <b>sense</b> data without human {{conception}} and yet evident to the <b>senses,</b> found in aesthetic experience. As opposed to; imaginary <b>sense</b> data {{which is more}} like a quasi substance and does not really exist; Imaginary <b>sense</b> data is abstract <b>sense</b> data as presented from the aestheticized <b>senses</b> to consciousness; i.e. imagination, power of reason and inner subjective states of self-awareness including: emotion, self-reflection, ego, and theory. The theory of abstract and imaginary <b>sense</b> data operates on the tacit definition of imagination as [...] "a power mediating between the <b>senses</b> and the reason by virtue of representing perceptual objects without their presence". Imaginary <b>sense</b> data are 'imaginary' per Immanuel Kant's analysis that imagination is the primary faculty of mind capable of synthesizing input from the <b>senses</b> into a world of objects.

Unsuper-vised estimates of <b>sense</b> frequency {{have been shown to}} be very useful for WSD due to the skewed nature of word <b>sense</b> distri-butions.

We demonstrate the effective-ness of the method over the tasks of pre-dominant <b>sense</b> learning and <b>sense</b> distri-bution acquisition, and also the novel tasks of detecting <b>senses</b> which aren’t attested in the corpus, and identifying novel <b>senses</b> in the corpus which aren’t captured in the <b>sense</b> inventory. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{dissociation}} of <b>sense</b> {{of agency}} and <b>sense</b> of ownership is for sure, but how these two <b>senses</b> {{interact with each}} other is not clear enough. Data from behavioral experiments support the additive model, which indicates that <b>sense</b> of agency seems to promote the integration of the <b>sense</b> of ownership, pure <b>sense</b> of ownership is fragmentary, and <b>sense</b> of agency can integrate different body parts into a continuum and form a unified body awareness (Tsakiris, Prabhu, & Haggard, 2006; Synofzik et al, 2008; Stein, 1964). However, brain imaging experiments are more supportive of the independent model, according to which <b>sense</b> of agency and <b>sense</b> of ownership are essentially different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and using different brain networks, there is no direct overlap (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). From our point of view, such inconsistency may lie in the experimental design. Since we usually experience <b>sense</b> of agency with <b>sense</b> of ownership, the role of these two types of experiences may not be separated in normal behavioral experiments. Through our research, we can find that when <b>sense</b> of agency and <b>sense</b> of ownership were properly separated, the results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by the independent model. However, our findings do not support claims that <b>sense</b> of agency and <b>sense</b> of ownership have no interactions. The interaction of modality and synchronicity {{had a significant impact on}} <b>sense</b> of ownership rather than <b>sense</b> of agency, indicating <b>sense</b> of agency seems to increase <b>sense</b> of ownership but not vice versa.|$|R
40|$|Residential {{satisfaction}} is important as {{it contributes to}} a person‟s psychological wellbeing and quality of life. Residential satisfaction develops due to physical {{factors such as the}} provision of parks and amenities within a community, social factors such as a feeling of belongingness to the community and social support within the community and personal factors such as homeownership and length of residence. <b>Sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place also influence residential satisfaction; however, the extent that these contribute is unclear. As a result, this study investigated the contribution of these constructs to the development of residential satisfaction in the planned community of Ellenbrook, designed to promote these concepts. Additionally, this study investigated the relationship between residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place as well as the factors that comprise of these constructs. A quantitative approach was utilised in which 300 residents completed published questionnaires measuring residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of place and <b>sense</b> of belonging. to examine the extent that social, physical and personal predictors contributed to the development of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place, a Kruskal-Wallis analysis was undertaken. The findings indicated that the social and physical factors: feelings of belongingness, community attachment, community participation, minimal fear of crime, community layout and design and housing density contribute to the experience of high levels of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place. Regarding personal factors: age, ethnicity, homeownership, length of residence and educational level did not {{contribute to the development of}} residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place. However, marital status contributed to the development of <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place but not residential satisfaction. Household income and number of people known in the community contributed to the development of <b>sense</b> of community and <b>sense</b> of belonging, while gender contributed to the development of residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of community. These findings indicate that a community developed with sensitivity to people‟s social and personal needs as well as specific spatial planning elements, contribute to the development of residential satisfaction. The interrelation of <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place and their impact on residential satisfaction was explored through factor analysis. Results showed nine factors to emerge. One factor consisted of several residential satisfaction items along with the attraction to neighbourhood components of <b>sense</b> of community, and the place attachment components of <b>sense</b> of place, indicating the communality of these items. Despite efforts to use distinctive measures of these concepts, there is to a certain degree, an inseparable nature of the dimensions of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community and <b>sense</b> of place. The <b>sense</b> of belonging items emerged as a separate factor indicating it to have a unique identity from residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of place and <b>sense</b> of community. Additionally, three of the four place identity items emerged on one factor, as did the residential satisfaction items referring to feelings of dissatisfaction, suggesting the uniqueness of these items. To examine the relationship between residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place, regression analyses were performed. There was a significant positive relationship between residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of community χ 2 (1, 300) = 40. 127, p 3 ̆c. 05; residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of place χ 2 (1, 300) = 56. 805, p 3 ̆c. 05 and residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of belonging χ 2 (1, 300) = 25. 848, p 3 ̆c. 05. This indicates that <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place contribute to the development of residential satisfaction, supporting previous research. The examination of these concepts in conjunction is a new concept. As a result, this research provides a theoretical understanding of the interrelation, as well as the uniqueness, of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place. Practically, this research assists policy makers and planners to develop communities that encompass these concepts to avoid issues faced by unplanned communities...|$|R

Pre-exposing subjects to a polysemous relation did not increase categorization of word <b>senses</b> that had that relation. Finally, induction from one <b>sense</b> of a word to a different <b>sense</b> was also weak. The results are consistent with the view that polysemous <b>senses</b> are represented separately, often with little semantic overlap, helping to explain previous results that using a word in one <b>sense</b> interferes with using it in another <b>sense,</b> even if the <b>senses</b> are related.
