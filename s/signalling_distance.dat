40|$|The new time-organized map (TOM) is {{presented}} {{for a better}} understand-ing of the self-organization and geometric structure of cortical signal representations. The algorithm extends the common self-organizing map (SOM) from the processing of purely spatial signals to the processing of spatiotemporal signals. The main additional idea of the TOM compared with the SOM is the functionally reasonable transfer of temporal <b>signal</b> <b>distances</b> into spatial <b>signal</b> <b>distances</b> in topographic neural representa-tions. This is achieved by neural dynamics of propagating waves, allow-ing current and former signals to interact spatiotemporally in the neural network. Within a biologically plausible framework, the TOM algorithm (1) reveals how dynamic neural networks can self-organize to embed spa-tial signals in temporal context in order to realize functional meaning-ful invariances, (2) predicts time-organized representational structures in cortical areas representing signals with systematic temporal relation, and (3) suggests that the strength with which signals interact in the cortex de-termines the type of signal topology realized in topographic maps (e. g., spatially or temporally defined signal topology). Moreover, the TOM al-gorithm supports the explanation of topographic reorganizations based on time-to-space transformations (Wiemer, Spengler, Joublin, Stagge, &...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{aspects of}} doctor-patient communication and presents a preliminary analysis of doctor-patient interactions in Italy. The {{aim is to}} gain information on how (mis) communication between doctors and patients may affect the doctor-patient relationship and may lead patients to lack trust in their doctors. The authors use a corpus of existing audio-video materials on Italian doctor-patient interactions, and analyse doctors’ use of verbal and nonverbal expressions in their exchanges with their patients. The analysis is aimed to identify which features may engender communication problems –leading to misunderstandings {{and the perception of}} doctors as distant or unreliable. The preliminary findings reveal that patients’ lack of trust in doctors may also be the result of doctors’ use of culture-specific patterns of verbal and nonverbal expressions, for example certain sentences used for minimizing patients’ fears, specific postures and gestures <b>signalling</b> <b>distance</b> or closure. These findings will be used for planning future investigations of doctor-patient interactions based on the collection and analysis of audio-visual material.

40|$|By {{means of}} novel 3 D-visualization and {{analysis}} techniques the present work explores morphological properties of mechanosensory systems {{in order to}} make predictions about functional consequences of the morphological traits. Chapter I - Most sensory systems need to cope with stimuli of highly variable intensity and temporal characteristics. In many systems nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to modulate responses to sensory stimuli and since NO is synthesized in mechanosensory neuropils of Locusta migratoria, {{it has been suggested that}} NO could act as a modulator. Using immunocytochemsitry I labelled the main NO source (NO-synthase/ NOS) and subsequently analyzed the spatial relationship between a wind-sensitive interneuron (A 4 I 1) and NOS- immunoreactivity (NOS-IR). NOS-IR occurred in low densities close to axonal arborisations of the A 4 I but in high densities close to its dendrites. Estimates in the literature of the effective signalling range of NO vary between synapse-specificity to more than 100 µm. I therefore mapped NOS-IR in defined volumes outlining different distances from the A 4 I 1 surface. Marked differences occurred when mapping NOS-IR onto the dendritic surface already using distances ranging from 0, 5 - 5 µm. These results suggest a very short <b>signalling</b> <b>distance</b> of the diffusible messenger NO. Pharmacological experiments demonstrated that the NO donor (DEA) as well as an inhibitor of the NO dependent guanylyl cyclase (ODQ) are both modulating the spiking response of the A 4 I 1 interneuron. These results suggest that endogenous NO counteracts habituation and thus maintains a high response level during phases of high activity load, e. g. during flight. Chapter II - During metamorphosis of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta the dendritic tree of an identified motorneuron (MN 5) retracts its dendrites and re-growths again. This study aims to reveal possible structural changes of dendritic filopodia in their natural cellular assembly during early pupal stages. In general filopodia underwent a morphogenic reduction in length and branching complexity. However, filopodia at dendritic shaft segments and those at the tip of the outgrowing dendrites differed significantly in length, density and stage dependent growth suggesting differences of regulatory mechanisms acting in different dendritic areas. Chapter III - Until now, the A 4 I 1 was the only identified interneuron within the central nervous system belonging to the prothoracic wind sensitive network of the locust. This study provides first evidence that information about airflow is processed by a complex network of interneurons with unique morphological characteristics and different response properties. Particular branching patterns might enable processing information of different classes of receptor neurons in different neuronal compartments. During postembryonal development the axonal arborisations of receptor neurons undergo striking structural changes. However, the emerging projection pattern could not yet be explained by the wind response of the A 4 I 1 interneuron. In contrast to the A 4 I 1 one type of interneuron (ProWIn 2) branches bilaterally within the prothoracic ganglion. On the basis of the ProWIn 2 response a wiring scheme is proposed that explains how postembryonic changes might enhance the contrast of the directional response...|$|E
40|$|Both sexes of the turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota superciliosa) {{perform a}} wag-display in the {{presence}} of predators, whereby their long racketed tail is repeatedly rocked side-to-side in a pendulous fashion. I tested 3 hypotheses for the function of the predator-elicited wag-display: 1) pursuit-deterrent signal, 2) warning alarm signal, and 3) self-preservation alarm signal. These hypotheses were evaluated by testing whether the presence of potential receivers (kin, conspecifics, mate) modified {{the way in which the}} wag-display was performed. Data on wag-display were collected when I experimentally presented predators to motmots and when naturally occurring predators were observed at nesting colonies. The wag-display was performed by male and female motmots who were 1) alone and not within <b>signaling</b> <b>distance</b> of conspecifics, 2) unpaired and therefore not signaling to a mate, and 3) paired but away from their mate. Motmots in these contexts performed the wag-display with similar probability and in a similar manner as individuals that were within <b>signaling</b> <b>distance</b> of conspecifics, paired birds, and paired birds who were near their mate. These results support the hypothesis that the predator-elicited wag-display is directed to the predator and functions as a pursuit-deterrent signal.
