5|$|Part I {{opens in}} 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum-bound {{book with a}} woodcut of a dragon in the center {{associated}} with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study carrel {{when he was a}} graduate <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E

5|$|Hoffman's second role of {{the year}} came {{opposite}} Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in John Patrick Shanley's Doubt, where he played Father Brendan Flynn– a priest accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old African American <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with the play and appreciated the opportunity {{to bring it to}} the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to a priest who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E

5|$|I was as <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixties, {{engaged in}} the civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

30|$|There {{were more}} {{significant}} differences in help-seeking behavior between conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic year sample population compared to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer sample population. <b>Students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic year sample population may have had less prior knowledge than <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer sample population, which led them to ask for more help to complete <b>the</b> Skill Builder. <b>Students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HE condition were naturally more likely to ask for regular hints because they had early access to hints. However, <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHE condition asked for significantly more bottom-out hints than <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HE condition who could also see bottom-out hints after asking for all available regular hints. This implies that <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HE condition may have learned from their early hint access, requiring fewer hints and answers later.|$|R

Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E

5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position of analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely {{new insights into the}} meaning of the text.|$|E

5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted {{that he was the}} Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Ebert spent a {{semester}} as a master's <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois {{for two more}} semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including {{an article on the}} death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the Sun-Times in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the Sun-Times for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun-Times in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.|$|E
5|$|Following {{news of his}} father's {{premature}} death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and he withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time he continued his studies as a day <b>student</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal over a year, living {{at the home of}} his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée's family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant, and by early 1866 he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in Chicago, Illinois, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine; also that he was then for a time employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River Settlement on 26 July 1868.|$|E

30|$|Students {{from the}} summer sample {{population}} might have found the problem easier to solve compared to <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic year sample population. First, <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer sample probably had more sufficient prior knowledge as described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous discussion. Second, the Skill Builder {{would have been easier}} for <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer sample population because they had around 3 months to complete the Skill Builder compared to <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic year sample who only had around 1 week to complete it. Third, although there were no differences in attrition between conditions for the individual studies, there were significantly more <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic year sample population who did not complete the Skill Builder compared to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer sample population. More <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic year sample population may have struggled with the Skill Builder, which led them not to complete it. Moreover, the problems may have been more difficult for <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHE condition of the academic year sample population, causing them to ask for hints and answers in more problems compared to <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HE condition. This may have suggested that <b>students</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HE condition were learning from their early hint usage, while those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHE condition were not as well assisted by the bottom-out hints and therefore continued to need additional assistance in later problems. Differences in this kind of behavior between conditions were not seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer sample population.|$|R
