(LDH-C 4) is a key enzyme, distributed specifically in testis and is highly immunogenic, function of which relates to energy metabolism and capacitation of the sperm. Therefore, in this study, we observed the effect of purified native PH- 20 and LDH-C 4 antigens on sperm function and morphology in dog. Native PH- 20 (46, 32 kDa) and LDH-C 4 (36, 30, 28) <b>sub</b> <b>units,</b> purified from dog sperm SDS- extracts were used to test as immunocontraceptive candidates in stray dog.

High titre of 3200 - 6400 was achieved in all dogs after three boosters.
