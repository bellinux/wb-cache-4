50|$|Anogeio is the {{homeland}} of the Rentzaioi clan, {{two members of}} which achieved notoritey through being chief suspects {{for one of the}} biggest bank robberies {{in the history of the}} region. The event took place in the turbulent years following the liberation of Epirus from the Ottoman Empire in 1913. On the 12 June 1926, a National Bank of Ioannina vehicle was held up at the location of Petra (on the Ioannina to Preveza highway). 15million drachmas, a substantial sum for the time, were stolen from the vehicle and 8 members of the <b>security</b> <b>crew</b> were found murdered at the scene. The robbery was reputedly the most high-profile act in a number of murders, kidnappings and higwhay robberies with which the Rentzaioi brothers (Thymios and Ioannis) were associated. Their story and the manhunt across Albania, Italy and the Balkans to their eventual arrest in Varna, Bulgaria are recorded in Greek national newspapers of the time (including Kathimerini), archives of the period held in the National Library of Greece, the University of Ioannina, and local oral tradition. They were tried and executed for their crimes on 5 March 1930 in Corfu jail. Clan rivalry, and banditry were endemic in the mountains of Greece during the late 19th and early 20th century as attested in numerous sources. The bandits were often tolerated and supported by the local populace. Petty local officialdom and state authority were held in general disregard, a phenomenon accentuated by the remoteness of the mountain settlements.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{match of}} the evening saw Dr. Wagner Jr. {{defending}} the AAA Latin American Championship against L.A. Park. Wagner Jr. was accompanied to the ring by his son, while Park was accompanied by Octagón. Before {{the start of the}} match, Toscano, another former CMLL, who had recently left the promotion, made an appearance and declared that [...] "they" [...] were better than AAA, raising the ire of Wagner Jr. After being punched down by Wagner, Toscano was carried out of the arena by members of the AAA <b>security</b> <b>crew.</b> During {{the early part of the}} brawl, the competitors tore each others masks apart. While Park distracted the referee Copetes Salazar, Octagón entered the ring to attack Wagner Jr. This led to Octagóncito making an appearance and attacking Octagón. When Wagner Jr. his Park with a sitout powerbomb, the rudo Salazar refused to perform a three count, faking an arm injury. Salazar then attempted to pull Wagner off Park, but was accidentally hit by a dive from Park. Wagner performed a La Casita on Park, but there was no referee to make the count. As Wagner was trying to wake Salazar up, Park hit him with a low blow. When a replaced referee, Piero, ran to the ring, Park performed a double knee gutbuster, but after it resulted in only a two count, Park took out his frustration on Piero, throwing him out of the ring. Wagner then hit Park with a DDT and a top rope double knee facebreaker, but again there was no referee to make the count. Octagón then threw brass knuckles to Park, which led to El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. entering to ring to clothesline him. Octagón then entered the ring and attacked El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., but was quickly taken out himself by Wagner Jr.s Wagner Driver. In the commotion, Park got his hands on the brass knuckles, hit Wagner Jr. with them and pinned him to become the new AAA Latin American Championship, after Copetes Salazar performed a fast count.|$|E

40|$|Class of 2008 Objectives: To {{determine}} the number of senior communities within the Tucson area that have access to automated external defibrillators (AED). Methods: Publicly available internet search engines were used to identify a number of various senior communities within the Tucson area. The various communities included senior apartment communities, recreational vehicle parks, and manufactured home parks. A representative employee of the community was interviewed to determine if an AED was accessible to the residents of the community. Results: Thirty senior apartments, eight manufactured home, and twelve RV communities were identified. The communities ranged in size from 22 to 1576 units, with the average being 222 units per community and the mean 232 units per community. IF the 50 senior communities identified only 2 of them had an AED on the premises. Both of the communities that had an AED on premise were RV parks that had a paid <b>security</b> <b>crew</b> that was trained {{in the use of the}} AED. Conclusions: In the Tucson senior communities there is a gross under availability of access to life saving equipment in a population that has a higher risk heart attacks and could benefit from having access to an AED...|$|E

Westland Irrigation District is the contractor of record. Job sites that are covered: Three Mile Right, Three Mile Left, Three Mile Adult Spawning, WEID Sampling Facility, Maxwell Screen Site, Westland Screen Site/Ladder/Juvenile Sampling Facility, Feed Canal Ladder/Screen Site, Stanfield Ladder/Screen Site, Minthorn Holding Facility, Thornhollow Acclimation Site, Imeques Acclimation Site, Pendleton Acclimation Site, and South Fork Walla Walla Spawning Facility. O & M personnel coordinate with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) personnel in performing tasks under this contract including scheduling of trap and haul, sampling, acclimation site maintenance, and other related activities as needed. The input from ODFW biologists Bill Duke and Ken Loffink, and CTUIR biologist Preston Bronson is indispensable {{to the success of}} the project, and is gratefully acknowledged. All tasks associated with the project were successfully completed during the fiscal year 2008 work period of October, 2007 through September, 2008. The project provides operations and maintenance throughout the year on five fish screen sites with a total of thirty-four rotating drum-screens, and four fish ladders in the Umatilla River Basin; additionally, periodic operations and maintenance is performed at holding, acclimation, and spawning sites in the Basin. Three people are employed full-time to perform these tasks. The FY 08 budget for this project was $ 492, 405 and actual expenditures were $ 490, 267. 01. Selected work activities and concerns: (1) Feed Dam Passage Improvement Project - A project to improve fish passage over the short term at the Feed Canal Diversion Dam site (Umatilla River mile 28. 7) was implemented with local U. S. Bureau of Reclamation field office personnel coordinating project activities. Operation and Maintenance Project personnel assisted with labor, materials, and equipment to ensure the project was completed as planned. Discussions are under way to determine feasible alternatives for longer term solutions to passage issues at the site. (2) Three Mile Right (east bank) Facilities - The pump for supplying water to the fish handling facility holding pond was reconstructed successfully to achieve the desired increase in flow output necessary when increased quantities of fish are present. (3) Fish Screen Rehab at Stanfield Canal Diversion - Working with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife screen shop personnel, three rotating drum screens at the Stanfield Canal diversion site (Umatilla River mile 33. 3) were serviced and overhauled with new bearings, seals, paint, and reinforcing bars. Work was completed, and screens reinstalled prior to water diversions beginning in the spring. (4) O & M personnel performed daily, weekly, and monthly operations and maintenance duties at the screen and ladder sites including, but not limited to, desilting of mud and debris, lubrication of mechanical parts, replacement of screen seals and screen motor components, adjustment of ladder gates, removal of large trees and woody debris deposited during high river flow conditions, servicing of pumps and screens for fish handling operations and sampling studies, in addition to general site clean-up, vegetative control, and <b>security.</b> <b>Crew</b> members responded as needed during evenings and after-hours according to weather conditions, river flows, and fish passage facility needs...|$|E
