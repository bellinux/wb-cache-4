50|$|Gölsdorf axles {{work in this}} way. Two of {{the five}} axles cannot move {{sideways}} relative to the frame because their axle boxes fix them rigidly to the frame. The other axles, however, are fitted into their bearings and attached to their drives {{in such a way}} that they can be moved sideways during curve running, depending on the sideways forces acting on them. In addition the connecting and coupling rods, through which the steam pressure and linear forces from the <b>steam</b> <b>pistons</b> are translated into the rotation of the wheels via the crank pins, also have to be able to move sideways.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the beam}} engines, the main {{force of the}} piston is {{transmitted}} to the air cylinder by a purely reciprocating action and the flywheels are there merely to smooth {{the action of the}} engine. To permit adjustment though, the <b>steam</b> <b>piston</b> rod only goes as far as the crosshead and above this there are twinned rods to the air piston. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the <b>steam</b> <b>piston,</b> the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards to make this a return connecting rod engine.|$|E

50|$|Locomotives {{with high}} {{chimneys}} and low footplates had the additional advantage of keeping smoke and condensing steam above the engine driver's field of vision. Grade limitations of railways through hilly terrain required tunnels and overhead bridges imposing a loading gauge limiting {{the height of}} chimneys. Increasing the velocity of steam exhaust tended to both accelerate airflow through the firebox and lift the smoke higher above {{the end of the}} chimney. By the 1830s steam exhaust was directed through a contracted nozzle called a blastpipe to achieve desired velocity through the chimney. Pressure drop through the blastpipe nozzle was subtracted from the boiler pressure available to the <b>steam</b> <b>pistons.</b> Robert Stephenson estimated some locomotives lost half their power through blastpipe back pressure.|$|R

5000|$|French Army Captain Cugnot {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{successfully}} employ a device for converting the reciprocating motion of a <b>steam</b> <b>piston</b> into a rotary motion by means of a ratchet arrangement. A small version of his three-wheeled fardier à vapeur ("steam [...] ") was made and used in 1769 (a fardier was a massively built two-wheeled horse-drawn cart for transporting very heavy equipment, such as cannon barrels).|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} time in Germany, the {{construction}} was characterized by a new bow design called Runeberg-bow. This new bow design broke the ice using a novel method. It was not broken by the weight of the ship but by a sharp cutting edge. Future development of icebreakers was influenced by this bow form.Although diesel-engines were already in wide use by 1933, Stettin was equipped with a <b>steam</b> <b>piston</b> engine. Unlike diesel engines, <b>steam</b> <b>piston</b> engines can be reversed within {{a very short period of}} approximately 3 to 4 seconds. This was important during manoeuvres of the ship under icey conditions in order to liberate the ship if it were to get stuck. The icebreakers of Stettin were handled by the shipping company Braeunlich, which ran a seaside resort ferry service along the coast during the summer. Its other ships had similar engines, so a single technical staff could be employed year round. Stettin was run by a crew of 22 men. This system was in place until the end of World War II.|$|E
50|$|After Diesel's death, {{the diesel}} engine {{underwent}} much development {{and became a}} very important replacement for the <b>steam</b> <b>piston</b> engine in many applications. Because the diesel engine required a heavier, more robust construction than a gasoline engine, it was not widely used in aviation (but see aircraft diesel engine). The diesel engine became widespread in many other applications, however, such as stationary engines, agricultural machines, submarines, ships, and much later, locomotives, trucks, and in modern automobiles.|$|E

Many fairs are held in Glynllifon Park carpark, especially steam and craft fairs.|$|R
50|$|While in Marburg in 1690, having {{observed}} the mechanical power of atmospheric pressure on his 'digester', Papin built {{a model of}} a <b>piston</b> <b>steam</b> engine, the first of its kind.|$|R

He worked with Newcomen in {{introducing}} the engine to the Midlands, operating under the patent of Thomas Savery. The engine they created was {{a variation on the}} current technology using a combination of <b>steam</b> cylinders, <b>pistons,</b> surface condensation, and the separation of parts that were usually placed together to create this new technology.|$|R
