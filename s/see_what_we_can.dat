Ono refused as {{she thought it was}} too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer at a press conference in April 1990, explaining that Ono [...] "actually said 'I think we can get it for 5.'

500|$|Downey {{has been}} {{a close friend of}} Mel Gibson since they starred in Air America. Downey defended Gibson during the {{controversy}} surrounding The Passion of the Christ, and said [...] "nobody's perfect" [...] in reference to Gibson's DUI. Gibson said of Downey: [...] "He {{was one of the first}} people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do to work on ourselves.'" [...] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] was {{originally}} written by Natalie Hemby and Blu Sanders in 2008. The idea of writing the song came from Hemby. She explained [...] "My friend Blu Sanders and I were together, and he goes, ‘Have you ever met Lindsay Champan?’ And I was like, ‘Nope!’ Basically he was like, ‘Why don’t we write with her? She has an absolutely gorgeous R voice.’ He was like ‘Let’s {{get together and}} <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> develop." [...] Hemby also admitted that the song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time. She added, [...] "It had an Al Green-ish feel with a '70s throwback kind of vibe, and that's kind {{of what we were}} going for with her sound." [...] Once the collaboration was completed, the song was never recorded and Hemby said that it [...] "just kind of fell by the wayside". Being a good friend with Clarkson, Sanders decided to take the initiative to send the song with a few other songs to the singer.|$|E

500|$|While Nintendo did not {{formally}} announce {{plans for a}} Metroid title for the Wii U, Animal Crossing producer Katsuya Eguchi mentioned in an interview how such a title could {{make use of the}} console's tablet controller to perform actions such as scanning enemies and retrieving information. A demo program for the Wii U, titled Battle Mii, showed Mii characters dressed in Varia Suits, as well as Samus's gunship from Other M; this was later revealed as a mini-game called [...] "Metroid Blast", which is featured in Nintendo Land. Nintendo Land producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who was also involved with the Prime trilogy, has declared that this minigame reflects his ideas for future Metroid titles, while also displaying the series is [...] "a franchise that we value and we certainly want to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do with it in the future". Miyamoto added that Retro is [...] "a very high priority" [...] in the development of more Metroid games. In 2014, a former artist from Next Level Games revealed his company had interest in developing a 3DS Metroid game, going as far as building a prototype, before Nintendo asked them to do [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, {{director}} Joe Johnston {{indicated that}} he planned to start filming in April 2010. In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: [...] "Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California.... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [...] <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> afford. The film, he said, will begin [...] "in 1942, 1943" [...] during World War II. [...] "The stuff in the '60s and '70s [...] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now." [...] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in [...] "the entire second half" [...] of the film, leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name, and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included. Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was [...] "called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E

[...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we will <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do with Bully." ...|$|E
