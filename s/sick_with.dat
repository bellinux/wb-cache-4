5|$|As Baghdad {{raised the}} spectre of an {{extensive}} network of British spies, the group again split. Pratap and von Hentig's party left on 1 June 1915 {{to make their}} way towards the Persian border. Eight days later they were received by the Turkish military commander Rauf Orbay at the Persian town of Krynd. Leaving Krynd, the party reached Turkish-occupied Kermanshah on 14 June 1915. Some members were <b>sick</b> <b>with</b> malaria and other tropical diseases. Leaving them under the care of Dr. Becker, von Hentig proceeded towards Tehran to decide on the subsequent plans with Prince Heinrich Reuss and Niedermayer.|$|E

Winston also created a baby Triceratops for Ariana Richards to ride on, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons.

40|$|SUMMARY The effects ofDDD (fully automatic) and VVI (ventricular demand) pacing modes on {{exercise}} tolerance, symptom diary cards, and Holter monitoring were investigated in a randomised double blind crossover study of 16 {{patients who had}} had DDD pacemakers implanted because of frequent syncope. Eight patients presented <b>with</b> <b>sick</b> sinus syndrome and, with one exception, retrograde atrioventricular conduction and eight age and sex matched patients presented with 2 : 1 or complete atrioventricular block.

5|$|Wiggins' family {{initially}} attributed {{his death}} to lung cancer {{that had led}} to respiratory failure. Family members {{said that he had}} gotten <b>sick</b> <b>with</b> a cough and that his condition had worsened quickly. Wiggins weighed under 75 pounds {{at the time of his}} death. Several days later, a physician disclosed that Wiggins' health problems were complications of AIDS. Wiggins stated that he had contracted the disease via intravenous drug use. He became the first baseball player known to have died from AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Also in that year, Barbara Kepler {{contracted}} Hungarian spotted fever, {{then began}} having seizures. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell <b>sick</b> <b>with</b> smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in Württemberg and Padua. At the University of Tübingen in Württemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived Calvinist heresies {{in violation of}} the Augsburg Confession and the Formula of Concord prevented his return. The University of Padua—on the recommendation of the departing Galileo—sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 U.S. Championships, the {{de facto}} Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but pulled up to win the free skate, {{finishing}} second overall. He {{was named to the}} 2006 Winter Olympic team along with Johnny Weir and Matthew Savoie. At the Olympics, following a 10th-place finish in the short program, Lysacek became <b>sick</b> <b>with</b> the stomach flu. Unable to practice, he stayed in bed at the Olympic village, receiving fluids from IVs. After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate. He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on Olympic Ice the next day with Scott Hamilton and Mary Carillo.|$|E

5|$|Big Hill {{was first}} used for the 1916 Winter Carnival, in which Nelsen set a hill record at 56meters (183ft). He beat his own record several times and kept the hill record until 1921. The tournament was {{gradually}} expanded, and by 1921 it cost $5,800 to arrange. That year, Henry Hall set a world length record in the hill, jumping 70meters (229ft). Three thousand spectators watched the games, in which many of the world's elite skiers competed. To accommodate the extra spectators, Canadian Pacific Railway stationed sleeping cars at Revelstoke to supplement the hotels. In 1922, Isabel Coursier debuted as Big Hill's first women jumper. In 1923, the tournament climaxed with 99 participating ski jumpers. In 1925, while <b>sick</b> <b>with</b> the flu, Nelsen beat Hall's world record by jumping 73meters (240ft). The record would remain until 1930.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Robinson married Millie Wiggins Bruce and {{the couple}} settled in Los Angeles. When Robinson was <b>sick</b> <b>with</b> his various ailments, his son accused Robinson's wife of keeping him under the {{influence}} of medication to manipulate him. According to Ray Robinson Jr., when Sugar Ray's mother died, Sugar Ray could not attend his mother's funeral because Millie was drugging and controlling him. However, Robinson had been hospitalized the day before his mother's death due to agitation which caused his blood pressure to rise. Robinson Jr. and Edna Mae also claimed that they were kept away from Robinson by Millie during the last years of his life.|$|E

However, he was persuaded by an envoy of the Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, sister of the Prince of Orange, to go instead to The Hague and to present the children to her, as official guests of the court. After the party's landing at Calais there was a month's delay at Lille, as first Wolfgang fell <b>sick</b> <b>with</b> tonsillitis, then Leopold suffered prolonged dizziness attacks. Early in September the family moved on to Ghent, where Wolfgang played on the new organ at the Bernardines chapel; {{a few days later}} he played on the cathedral organ at Antwerp. On 11 September the family finally reached The Hague.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} occupational {{factors associated}} <b>with</b> <b>sick</b> leave over a 4 -year period in Australian employees. Methods: Longitudinal data (self-report) from 2861 Australian full-time employees (69. 4 % male) were used. Occupational factors and relevant covariates were assessed at baseline <b>with</b> <b>sick</b> leave assessed yearly over a 4 -year period. The {{data were analyzed}} using multinomial logistic regression models. Results: Job strain and longer commuting time were associated <b>with</b> long <b>sick</b> leave, whereas long work hours were inversely associated <b>with</b> long <b>sick</b> leave. Conclusions: These results provide further evidence that certain aspects of work are associated <b>with</b> <b>sick</b> leave, whereas other work aspects such as long work hours are inversely associated <b>with</b> <b>sick</b> leave. Organizations need to understand and address these factors to improve the well-being of employees and increase workplace productivity...|$|R
