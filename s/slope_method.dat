The calibration was performed at three different power levels: low power (3. 6  kW), half power (15  kW), and full power (30  kW). Two methods were used in the calibration, namely, slope and heat balance methods. The thermal power obtained by the heat balance method at low power, half power, and full power was 3. 7  ±  0. 2  kW, 15. 2  ±  1. 2  kW, and 30. 7  ±  2. 5  kW, respectively.
