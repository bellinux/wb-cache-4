While recruiting, Newton sought to educate those around him about the legality of self-defense. One of the reasons, he argued, why black people continued to be persecuted was their lack of knowledge of the social institutions that could be made to work in their favor. In Newton's autobiography Revolutionary Suicide, he writes, [...] "Before I took Criminal Evidence in school, I had no idea what my rights were." [...] Newton also wrote in his autobiography, [...] "I tried to transform many of the so-called criminal activities going on in the street into something political, although this had to be done gradually." [...] He attempted to channel these [...] "daily activities for survival" [...] into <b>significant</b> <b>community</b> <b>actions.</b> Eventually, however, the illicit activities of a few members would be superimposed on the social program work performed by the Panthers, and this mischaracterization would lose them support in both the white and black communities.|$|R
