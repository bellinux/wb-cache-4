40|$|The {{present state}} of {{research}} and development into optical fibre systems for applications in telecommunications is reviewed and some of the principal problems remaining are discussed. Attenuations close to the intrinsic limits of the materials available have been reached in laboratory fibres and losses in optical cables installed under normal working conditions are below 5 dB/km. Bandwidths available range from 20 MHz km, in <b>step-index</b> <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> with light emitting diode sources, to 10 GHz km with single-mode fibres and semiconductor lasers. If a truly monochromatic laser source operating in the region of minimum material dispersion becomes available then individual fibre capacities up to, or beyond, 100 GHz km are feasible. The major problems in cabling have already been largely overcome but further improvements in fibre strength, homogeneity and reproducibility are awaited. The difficulties are technological rather than fundamental and will succumb to good innovative engineering within the next few years. The same may be said of the requirements for such mundane, but vitally important, components as splices, connectors, couplers and even the lowly jack plug. Excellent and encouraging progress is being made with all of these items. Of the major hurdles remaining, that of a suitable optical source {{is by far the most}} difficult. The lifetime and reliability of existing semiconductor lasers are improving only slowly and need to be increased by at least an order of magnitude. It would also be an advantage if their line width, coherence and beam quality could be made to approximate more closely those of an ideal laser. Fortunately light emitting diodes can also be used if adequate lasers do not become available, but at the expense of system bandwidth and repeater spacing. Technological forecasting is fraught with hazards for the unwary but it is reasonable to expect systems to be operating in the telephone network in the 1980 s at capacities from 140 Mbit/s to 500 Mbit/s at repeater spacings of at least 5 km and perhaps as high as 20 km. Serious study of the application of optical fibres to underwater cables will also have begun. If simple fibre cables can be made cheaply enough for use in installations to individual subscribers a wide range of new developments become possible, but these problems are more relevant to the 1990 s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A Radio-over-Fibre {{system to}} {{distribute}} wireless LAN signals over <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> {{has been designed}} and analysed. The system employs a novel frequency multiplication technique, to surmount modal-dispersion-induced bandwidth limitation in <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> in general and in Graded Index Polymer Optical Fibre (GIPOF) in particular. This is achieved by frequency modulating the optical signal at the source, and then periodically filtering the received signal at the remote station prior to direct detection by the photodiode. Data modulation is added by intensity modulating the frequency modulated optical signal. While {{the frequency of the}} modulating signal at the source is limited by the fibre’s modal bandwidth, the frequency of the generated electrical microwave signal is not. The frequency of the generated electrical signal is determined by optical parameters such as the optical frequency deviation impressed at the source, and the free spectral range of the periodic filter at the remote station. Simulation results show that the system is capable of generating high purity electrical carriers at 5. 4 GHz, and higher microwave and millimetre wave frequencies, which are several orders of magnitude beyond the bandwidth of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> for link lengths of up to 500 m. In addition, the system can handle both linear and constant envelop modulated data such as ASK, PSK and QAM at capacities beyond 56 Mbps per carrier. The use of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> and especially GIPOF in the wireless LAN feeder network instead of standard single-mode fibre greatly reduces installation and maintenance costs while offering more capacity than the present copper-based infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed system has the potential to make high-density broadband wireless LANs of the future, economically and technically feasible...|$|R
