5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid,</b> zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is flower-rich wet grassland. Flora include common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids,</b> cuckooflowers, meadowsweets, marsh-marigolds and ragged-robins. There {{are also}} grass snakes and birds such as blackcaps.|$|R

5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchid</b> (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade.

50|$|Cadbury Hill is a {{designated}} Local Nature Reserve. In 2009, a 19th-century agricultural stock pond - previously hidden by undergrowth - was restored by the Yatton & Congresbury Wildlife Action Group (YACWAG). The Local Nature Reserve comprises ancient semi-natural woodland, scrub and unimproved grassland. Species of interest include marsh tit, noctule bat, slow worm, wood anemone, bluebell, betony, small scabious, rock rose, small leaved lime. On the northern limestone slope grow hundreds of common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> The hill fort itself has many ant hills, which are visited by green woodpeckers.|$|R
50|$|The first {{development}} {{following the}} formation of the trust in 1980 was the establishment of England's first urban nature reserve at Brandon Hill, bringing hay meadows, wildlife ponds and butterfly gardens into a formal city park. In 1981 Stockwood Open Space came under the trust's management to encourage a range of wildlife and have been particularly successful with common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> Other early work in the 1980s included taking over the management of Littleton Brick Pits near Littleton-upon-Severn, an artificial lagoon once the site of clay extraction for brick making, and reintroducing reedbeds close to the Severn Estuary, as a feeding and resting place for migrating birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} also home to many species of plants {{including}} the bee orchid, pyramidal orchid, Marsh Helleborine, Bee <b>orchid</b> and common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids.</b> There is an Interpretative Centre {{at the end of the}} causeway on the right hand side which has displays and information on the flora and fauna of the island, and there are also information signs to either side of the causeway access, and on the roundabout where the causeway road approaches the beach. The Centre was opened in 1986 and provides a base for many schools and educational groups to visit the Island. It was funded by the European Commission and the Dublin Rotary Club.|$|R

It is owned by Bristol City Council and managed as a nature reserve {{in partnership with the}} Avon Wildlife Trust. cowslip, Dyer's greenweed, common <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids</b> and bird's-foot trefoil are amongst the flowers to be found, and numerous butterflies include meadow brown, marbled white and large skipper. The wood known as Ilsyngrove is very old and the home of bluebell, yellow archangel and the rare Bath asparagus. Birds including whitethroats, kestrels and sparrowhawks are often seen. Two farm ponds are homes for frogs, toads and newts.|$|R
50|$|Thelymitra ixioides, {{known as}} the <b>Spotted</b> Sun <b>Orchid</b> is a common plant in eastern and {{southern}} Australia. Leaves are thin or lanceolate, up to 20 cm long. A small plant with spotted flowers, forming from August to January. Usually blue, but sometimes violet. It grows in eucalyptus woodland or heathland.|$|R
25|$|The Back common, {{although}} not as species-rich as the Site of Special Scientific Interest {{to the south of}} the Cromer Road (AI49) is home to a great many plants and insects. Around the damper fringes <b>spotted</b> <b>orchids</b> can be found and in some years bee orchids are present along with the occasionally appearance of the southern marsh orchid. In the late spring and early summer the common is as mass of buttercups. Along the edges of Beeston Beck and Sheringham Loke, monkey musk grows in abundance and until to a few years ago dittander, a rare plant, was present, although this may have since been lost due to the mowing regime. On the drier areas of the common, trefoils and clovers are present which attract common blue butterflies and the longer grass areas and buttercups are frequented by meadow brown and ringlet butterflies.|$|R
