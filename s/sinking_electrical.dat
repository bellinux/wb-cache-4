40|$|AbstractAs {{a method}} of {{processing}} cemented carbide, <b>sinking</b> <b>electrical</b> discharge machining (EDM) is generally used. However, typical surface defects, such as cracks, microcraters and recast layer, lead to a decreased surface integrity, probably resulting in a short tool life. Under the present situation, the recast layer is removed by polishing. However, this process extends the machining time and increases the cost of production of metal molds. Therefore, it is desirable to eliminate these surface defects by some methods. Thus, an on-the-machine surface modification technology in EDM, for the complete elimination of surface defects, was developed in this study. The surface defects are eliminated using a <b>sinking</b> <b>electrical</b> discharge machine by introducing surface integrity machining for EDM (SIME) after applying finishing EDM. SIME is conducted by applying voltage to the constant gap between electrode and workpiece in deionized water. It can be considered that a recast layer including cracks is selectively eliminated by the dissolution of cobalt based on the electrolytic action during SIME. As a result, the surface defects generated by EDM could be completely eliminated by incorporating SIME into EDM...|$|E

In this work, mathematical models have been developed for relating the Surface Roughness, Material Removal Rate and Tool Wear Rate to machining parameters like discharge current, pulse-on time and pulse-off time. The developed models predict the machining conditions from rough machining region to finish conditions within the experimenral domain. Response Surface Methodology has been applied for developing the models using the techniques of Design of Experiments and multi linear regression analysis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} dielectric fluid in the die <b>sinking</b> <b>electrical</b> discharge machining (EDM) process. Different methods were developed to investigate the fluid dynamics of the dielectric and particles. Both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental tests were performed. The most important achievement of this project is the improvement of the evacuation of the waste particles within the gap workpiece-electrode. An exhaustive understanding of the processes was crucial to obtain a uniform particles distribution which leads to a more efficient discharging and particle evacuation. A CFD analysis was used to figure out the characteristics for the electrode, such as its shape and dimensions and its kinematic properties. In particular, different combinations of axis Jerk, acceleration, speed and movement of the electrode were studied in detail. Different dielectric liquids were also considered. The experimental tests on full scale and increased scale models were performed at the AgieCharmilles laboratory and at the CMEFE laboratory in Geneva, in order to validate the CFD results. A test rig was built to perform study at a scale of 50 : 1 has been built, and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) was developed in order to study the effect of the fluid flow.

Experimentation has been carried out on EDM of AISI 1045 tool Steel.

According to the correlation coefficients diagram it was concluded that the ANN tool gives us the best possible predictions for the data we have trained. Also we are getting ANN MRR results very much closer to our experimental MRR values. This shows the values that are very much possible to correlate amongst one another apart from taking experiments and finally the values of experimental TWR and predicted TWR are nearly correlating with one another.

This work shows the use of wafer-level batch fabrication to develop advanced electrical and fluidic three-dimensional interconnect networks in a 3 D stack. Fabrication results are shown for the integration of microchannels and electrical through-silicon vias (TSVs). A compact physical model is developed to determine the design trade-offs for microchannel heat <b>sink</b> and <b>electrical</b> TSV integration. An experimental thermal measurement test-bed for evaluating a 3 D inter-layer liquid cooling platform is developed. Experimental thermal testing results for an air-cooled chip and a liquid-cooled chip are compared. Microchannel heat sink cooling shows a significant junction temperature and heat sink thermal resistance reduction compared to air-cooling. The on-chip integrated microchannel heat sink, which has a thermal resistance of 0. 229 °C/W, enables cooling of > 100 W/cm² of each high-power density chip, while maintaining an average junction temperature of less than 50 °C.
