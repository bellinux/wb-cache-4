500|$|After the Pixies {{broke up}} in 1993, Santiago {{had stayed in}} touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: [...] "He called me on my {{cellphone}} and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'" [...] Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and {{by the summer of}} 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, [...] "worked it up a bit in Joey's Pro Tools thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|In October 1891, {{upon the}} {{formation}} of the first constitutional government in Zanzibar, Mathews was appointed First Minister, despite some hostility from Sultan Ali bin <b>Said.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> capacity Mathews was [...] "irremovable by the sultan" [...] and answerable only to the Sultan and the British Consul. [...] His position was so strong that one missionary on the island is quoted as saying that his powers defied [...] "analytical examination" [...] and that Mathews really could say [...] "L'état est moi" [...] (...) [...] [...] Mathews was also known as the [...] "Strong man of Zanzibar". [...] The principal departments of government were mostly run by Britons or British Indians and Mathews' approval was required before they could be removed from office. [...] Mathews was rewarded by the Zanzibar government for his role with his appointment as a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar, which he was granted licence by Queen Victoria to accept and wear on 17 May 1886. [...] Mathews used his position to suppress slavery in the country and in 1889 convinced the Sultan to issue a decree purchasing the freedom of all slaves who had taken refuge in his dominions and, from 1890, the prohibiting the slave trade. On 1 February 1891 Mathews was appointed Her Majesty's Commissioner and Consul-General to the British Sphere of Influence in East Africa. [...] He never took up the post and instead chose to remain in Zanzibar.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, {{writing in}} the New York Daily News, stated {{that the idea of}} putting Monk in New York [...] "sound great" [...] on paper but it did not take {{advantage}} of what could be [...] "a delightful study in contrasts." [...] Bianculli called it a [...] "misstep", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it [...] "too outrageous." [...] A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a [...] "stunt episode" [...] and its humor [...] "uncharacteristically forced", saying it [...] "really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms." [...] Steve Johnson of Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, [...] "the writers {{go out of their way}} to play the city against his condition." [...] He continued by saying it [...] "wouldn't be so bad" [...] if he went to solve crimes [...] "but Friday's first case is a real stretch." [...] Although excited for the episode's premise prior its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode [...] "the producers have him [...] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient." [...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions [...] "caricature". Stasi wrote, [...] "It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain." [...] As Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes [...] "predictable" [...] and said [...] "If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may strike you as altogether shopworn." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1805 {{mandolin}} method, Anweisung die Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen Uebungsstucken von Bortolazzi, Bartolomeo Bortolazzi popularised the Cremonese mandolin, {{which had}} four single-strings and a fixed bridge, {{to which the}} strings were attached. Bortolazzi <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> book that the new wire strung mandolins were uncomfortable to play, {{when compared with the}} gut-string instruments. Also, he felt they had a [...] "less pleasing...hard, zither-like tone" [...] as compared to the gut string's [...] "softer, full-singing tone." ...|$|E
2500|$|This melancholy song has {{fairly simple}} lyrics. Journalist Benoît Cachin <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> song, [...] "Farmer {{pays tribute to}} the words which have enabled her to write her songs, which are also used to express her love". About the song, French {{magazine}} Instant-mag made the following analysis: [...] "On an air melody and worthy flights of Boutonnat, the two voices, paradoxical but complementary, tell us the difficulty communicating and the immense power of words. Where the beautiful voice of Farmer will force up to the break, that of Seal evokes a quiet and sensual strength". One of the verses of [...] "Les Mots" [...] ("And to lives that stoop to notice mine", sung by Seal) resumed the first verse of the Farmer's song [...] "Nous souviendrons-nous" [...] ("Aux vies qui s'abaissent à voir la mienne") which is on her third studio album L'Autre.... The work by Emily Dickinson was also {{a source of inspiration}} for the song. Indeed, the phrase [...] "I will tell you how the sun rose", sung by Seal, is the title of her poem No. 318.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015 Elliott, {{along with}} two [...] collaborators, Don Sebesky and Christofer Austin, won a Tony Award for his {{orchestration}} in the Broadway musical, An American in Paris. The production attracted attention because its direction and choreography were done by a ballet choreographer with no previous experience directing musicals. The production had already been performed in Paris for four months when Elliott was hired to adapt the music to better suit Broadway. [...] "I {{was brought in to}} re-do some of the songs in a more theatrical way," [...] Elliott <b>said.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> process, the directors carefully study the audience responses during preview shows, then fine-tune the show based on what the director feels the audience responds to. Changes in a dance routine require the music for that dance to be re-written. Elliott used his same routine here that he used with film — [...] studying videos of the action. He worked on nearly half of the [...] music in the final show. He said, [...] "It is more than just taking notes and assigning them to a instrument, but rather bringing emotions to life that are trying to be there. He said, [...] "I felt like I was hired to put the 'American' in An American in Paris." ...|$|E
