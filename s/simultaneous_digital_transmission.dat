5000|$|Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{is a set}} of {{communication}} standards for <b>simultaneous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book. [...] Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces, such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time that MP3 audio coding was being developed, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) was also being launched. ISDN was {{designed}} to deliver <b>simultaneous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the telephone network. Church was able to combine MP3 audio coding with ISDN technology to create a high-quality digital audio dialup service for broadcasters.The result was the Telos Zephyr, a point-to-point audio codec which made it possible for radio and television stations, networks, and recording studios to link studio quality audio paths over long distance digital telephone lines. The Zephyr revolutionized remote broadcasting, and in some ways, programming, by enabling the use of spontaneous interviews for morning drive shows and newscasts.|$|E
40|$|Integrated Services for Digital Network (ISDN) {{is a set}} of {{communication}} standards for <b>simultaneous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> of data, voice, video, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book. Before ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice and some special services available for data. The main feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines thus adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. There are various kinds of access interfaces to ISDN defined as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN). In a broad sense ISDN can be considered a suite of digital services existing on the layers 1, 2, and 3 of the OSI model. ISDN is designed to provide access to voice and data services simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|The signal trasmultiplexation system {{implemented}} to <b>simultaneous</b> <b>digital</b> data <b>transmission</b> from measurement sensors {{is presented in}} the paper. In general, those can be data from any type of sensor generating digital data on location, force, acceleration, pressure, etc. The issue dealt with in the paper is important as devices manufactured at present contain ever-growing number of sensors. Increasing the volume of sensor wiring is a non-optimal solution. Instead, multiplexers are used, which alternately place elements of successive signal samples in successive time slots. The proposed solution based on the use of transmultiplexers involves combining measurement signal samples into one signal that is transmitted over a single path. If properly designed, FIR type filters make it possible to obtain the signal that is scattered both in time and frequency domains. Coefficients of filter banks of the order I= 16 were determined numerically with the accuracy Qmin= 2, 962. 10 - 6 for 4 -input system. Frequency characteristics of filters are shown in Fig. 3. The characteristics do not resemble those of known filters (low pass, high pass) as they are distributed in the same frequency band. If properly designed, they make it possible to almost ideally reconstruct measurement signals from a complex signal. The latter combines all independent input signals thus making one entity. Each sample of the complex signal contains a fragment of the information of all input signals. It is preliminarily encoded and thus resistant to individual transmission errors. The filter order is virtually arbitrary, with the restriction that it should at least be equal to the number of input signals. It was noted that for real measurement signals, transmultiplexation in which filter coefficients were determined numerically and rounded to 4 significant places turned out to be sufficient. V příspěvku je prezentována implementace signálového transmultiplexního systému pro přenos digitálních paralelně souběžných dat z měřicích senzorů. Obecně se může jednat o jakýkoliv typ senzoru generující digitální výstup, např. síla, zrychlení, tlak atd. Řešení navrženým systémem prezentovaným v tomto příspěvku je důležité především v současnosti pro zařízení s neustále rostoucím počtem senzorů...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Modern IP network {{services}} {{provide for the}} <b>simultaneous</b> <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> of data, voice, and video. These services require congestion control algorithms and protocols which can solve the packet loss parameter can be kept under control. Congestion control is therefore, {{the cornerstone of the}} packet switching networks. It should prevent congestion collapse, provide fairness to competing flows and optimize transport performance indexes such as throughput, loss and delay. In this paper we propose a congestion control mechanism with application to Packet Loss in networks with P 2 P traffic is proposed. In this new method the edge and the core routers will write a measure of the quality of service guaranteed by the router by writing a digital number in the Option Field of the datagram of the network packet. This is called as “token”. The token is read by the path routers and then interpreted as its value will give a measure of the congestion especially at the edge routers. Based on the token number, the edge router at the source’s edge point will shape the traffic generated by the source, thus reducing the congestion on the path...|$|E

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of the high cost in the GPRS {{communication}} and the limit transmission distance of WiFi, a transmission scheme for distant agriculture image acquisition was designed based on <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio in this paper. However, the majority of current <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio was designed for a small amount of data transmission. It could get a greater transmission distance {{with the help of the}} <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio, but the signal interference increased heavily when the <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio was used for image transmission. A fault-tolerant transmission protocol for agriculture image (FTTP-AI) based on <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio was designed in this paper. Packet verification was used to reduce the data errors caused by the signal interference of the <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio. At the same time, overtime retransmission and the lost packet retransmission were used to overcome the problem of packet loss. Experiments showed that the FTTP-AI could send the agriculture image to a remote computer center successfully in the field. With the help of the FTTP-AI, the rate of accuracy of data transmission was up to 99. 2 %, the success rate of image transmission was up to 95. 8 %, the costless distant transmission can achieve several kilometers. This scheme could satisfy the requirement of the low-cost for distant agriculture images transmission reliably.  ...|$|R
