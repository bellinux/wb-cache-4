60|$|The {{occasion}} {{of my first}} meddling with this matter was as followeth:-Upon a certain first-day, I being together with my brethren in our prison chamber, they expected that, according to our custom, something should be spoken out of the Word for our mutual edification; {{but at that time}} I felt myself, it being my turn to speak, so empty, spiritless, and barren, that I thought I should {{not have been able to}} <b>speak</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> so much as five words of truth with life and evidence; but at last it so fell out that providentially I cast mine eye upon the eleventh verse of the one and twentieth chapter of this prophecy; upon which, when I had considered a while, methought I perceived something of that jasper in whose light you there find this holy city is said to come or descend; wherefore having got in my eye some dim glimmerings thereof, and finding also in my heart a desire to see farther thereinto, I with a few groans did carry my meditations to the Lord Jesus for a blessing, which he did forthwith grant according to his grace; and helping me to set before my brethren, we did all eat, and were well refreshed; and behold also, that while I was in the distributing of it, it so increased in my hand, that of the fragments that we left, after we had well dined, I gathered up this basketful. Methought the more I cast mine eye upon the whole discourse, the more I saw lie in it. Wherefore setting myself to a more narrow search, through frequent prayer to God, what first with doing, and then with undoing, and after that with doing again, I thus did finish it.|$|E
6000|$|Charles Doe, who {{manifested}} most laudable anxiety to {{hand down}} {{the works of}} Bunyan to posterity, bears honourable testimony to his conduct while in prison. 'It was by making him a visit in prison that I first saw him, and became acquainted with him; and I must profess I could not but look upon {{him to be a}} man of an excellent spirit, zealous for his master's honour, and cheerfully committing all his own concernments unto God's disposal. When I was there, there were about sixty Dissenters besides himself there, taken but a little before at a religious meeting at Kaistoe, in the county of Bedford; besides two eminent Dissenting ministers, Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Dun (both very well known in Bedfordshire, though long since with God[249]), by which means the prison was very much crowded; yet, {{in the midst of all}} that hurry which so many new-comers occasioned, I have heard Mr. Bunyan both preach and pray with that mighty spirit of faith and plerophory of divine assistance that has made me stand and wonder.'[250] Here they could sing, without fear of being overheard; no informers prowling round. The world was shut out; and, in communion with heaven, they could forget their sorrows, and have a rich foretaste of the inconceivable glory of the celestial city. It was under such circumstances that Bunyan preached one of his most remarkable sermons, afterwards published under the title of The Holy City or the New Jerusalem, 1665. 'Upon a certain first-day, being together with my brethren in our prison-chamber, they expected that, according to our custom, something should be spoken out of the Word for our mutual edification. I felt myself, it being my turn to speak, so empty, spiritless, and barren, that I thought I should not have been able to <b>speak</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> so much as five words of truth with life and evidence. At last I cast mine eye upon this prophecy, when, after considering awhile, methought I perceived something of that jasper in whose light you find this holy city descended; wherefore, having got some dim glimmering thereof, and finding a desire to see farther thereinto, I with a few groans did carry my meditations to the Lord Jesus for a blessing, which he did forthwith grant, and helping me to set before my brethren, we did all eat, and were well refreshed; and behold, also, that while I was in the distributing of it, it so increased in my hand, that of the fragments that we left, after we had well dined, I gathered up this basketful. Wherefore, setting myself to a more narrow search, through frequent prayer, what first with doing and then with undoing, and after that with doing again, I thus did finish it.'[251] To this singular event the religious public are indebted for one of Bunyan's ablest treatises, full of the striking sparkles of his extraordinary imagination. It was a subject peculiarly adapted to display his powers--the advent of New Jerusalem, her impregnable walls and gates of precious stones, golden streets, water of life, temple, and the redeemed from all nations flocking into it.[252] ...|$|E

He gives, as grounds of {{his knowledge of}} Logan’s guilt, certain conversations among Logan’s intimates, yeomen or ‘bonnet lairds,’ or servants, from which he inferred that Logan was engaged in treason. Again, just before Logan’s death in July 1606, he was delirious, and raved of forfeiture. But Logan had been engaged in various treasons, so his ravings need not refer to the Gowrie affair. He had been on Bothwell’s enterprises, and had privy dealings with ‘Percy,’ probably Thomas Percy, who, in 1602, secretly visited Hume of Manderston, a kinsman of Logan. That intrigue was certainly connected merely with James’s succession to the English crown. But one of Logan’s retainers, when this affair of Percy was <b>spoken</b> of <b>among</b> <b>them,</b> said, according to Sprot, that the Laird had been engaged in treason ‘nearer home.’ ...|$|R

The writer wanted to know in details communication strategies used by third semester students to deliver their ideas in the target language (English). The {{purpose of this study}} were to describe and know the communication strategies employed by the third semester students in speaking III class at English Department in University of Muhammadiyah Malang. The design of this study was descriptive research because the writer wanted to describe and know the communication strategies employed by the third semester students in speaking III class at English Department in University of Muhammadiyah Malang. The subject of this study was all students’ activity speaking III in class A and C. The instrument was nonparticipant observation. Based on the observation, the writer classified the kind of communication strategies by Dornyei (1995, in Brown 2000 : 128). The data collected in fourth times in speaking III class at English Department of UMM. The writer not only found nine strategies, out of thirteen strategies, but also two additional strategies namely self correction and repetition used by third semester students at English Department in UMM. The most communication strategy used by third semester students is stalling or time gaining strategy. They used it almost in every conversation while joining the activity in the classroom. However, students sometimes combine this strategy with other eight communication strategies. As a matter of fact, the students did not easily give up and they need some time to think about they want to say...|$|R

This study also aimed to identify students’ competency in Arabic language communication skills, Arabic language speaking practices and the usage of Arabic language among Muslim students in secondary schools. The study utilized survey method where questionnaires were administered to 100 secondary school students who learned Arabic language.

Many respondents received low socio-educational support in learning Arabic language at a school level. Findings also showed that the weakness in the social support system in learning Arabic language has affected the Arabic language speaking practices.

The men all thought that Angela had been shamefully treated, the elder and most intensely respectable ladies for the most part inclined {{to the other side of}} the question. It not being their habit to look at matters from the same point of view in which they present themselves to a man's nicer sense of honour, they could see no great harm in George Caresfoot's stratagems. A man so rich, they argued, was perfectly entitled to buy his wife. The marriage had been arranged, like their own, on the soundest property basis, and the woman who rose in rebellion against a husband merely because she loved another man, or some such romantic nonsense, deserved all she got. Gone mad, had she?--well, it was a warning! And these aristocratic matrons sniffed and turned up their noses. They felt that Angela, by going mad and creating a public excitement, had entered a mute protest against the recognized rules of marriage sale- and-barter as practised in this country--and Zululand. Having daughters to dispose of, they resented this, and poor Angela was for years afterwards <b>spoken</b> of <b>among</b> <b>them</b> as that [...] "immoral girl." ...|$|R

Introduction: Many {{years before}} Marlowe {{produced}} his first works, that is {{during the reign}} of “Richard the First or Lionhearted,” the Jew played, perhaps, his greatest part in English history; and, though banished from England a little later than this, several historians say there were Jews in England at the time of Marlowe and of Shakespeare who played a great part in English history and from the daily lives or characters of whom both writers might have taken some thoughts upon which to found their productions. The fact is that at that time there was a Jewish Doctor, Lopez by name, who being of Spanish blood and able to <b>speak</b> several tongues, <b>among</b> <b>them</b> Portuguese, became interpreter for a Portuguese refugee who had fled from justice in Spain to England for protection and whom, through hatred for Spain, Elizabeth accepted and playfully termed “King Antonio. ” Lopez, owing to his position as interpreter and his relation to Elizabeth, to the refugee and to the Earl of Essex became a close friend of the queen and revealed to her one of the political intrigues which the earl was about to undertake...|$|R
