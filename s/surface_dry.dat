25|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>dry</b> suit {{users can}} face a similar {{inversion}} problem. The problem is more acute when {{not wearing a}} personal flotation device (life vest) over the dry suit. For <b>surface</b> <b>dry</b> suit users, the inversion can be much more critical if no one is nearby to assist, since the wearer may be held upside down and unable to breathe, and may also have water run down into their nose while inverted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>dry</b> suits do not {{normally}} have exhaust valves, but the wearer may vent excess air by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the neck seal.|$|E

25|$|Dry {{suits are}} often worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a breathable membrane material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type <b>surface</b> <b>dry</b> suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because they will lose most of their insulating properties.|$|E
25|$|In {{broadest}} terms, flies are {{categorized as}} either imitative or attractive. Imitative flies resemble natural food items. Attractive flies trigger instinctive strikes by employing {{a range of}} characteristics that do not necessarily mimic prey items. Flies can be fished floating on the <b>surface</b> (<b>dry</b> flies), partially submerged (emergers), or below the surface (nymphs, streamers, and wet flies). A dry fly is typically thought to represent an insect landing on, falling on (terrestrials), or emerging from, the water's surface as might a grasshopper, dragonfly, mayfly, ant, beetle, stonefly or caddisfly. Other surface flies include poppers and hair bugs that might resemble mice, frogs, etc. Sub-surface flies are designed to resemble {{a wide variety of}} prey including aquatic insect larvae, nymphs and pupae, baitfish, crayfish, leeches, worms, etc. Wet flies, known as streamers, are generally thought to imitate minnows, leeches or scuds.|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{a problem}} for {{close-fitting}} neoprene suits, or hybrid suits with neoprene bottoms, which prevent air from easily moving into the legs of the suit. Wearers of baggy <b>surface</b> <b>dry</b> suits can mitigate the problem by venting out as much excess air as possible before entering the water. This is typically done by crouching down and leaning forward, wrapping the arms around the knees, and then having an assistant zip the suit shut while it is stretched out tightly. Excess air can also be [...] "burped" [...] out of the neck or cuff seal.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the lamina is dark green; the lower <b>surface</b> <b>dries</b> brown, as seen in {{herbarium}} material. Upper pitchers have a yellowish-green exterior and a red peristome. The underside of the lid is either flushed with red or red speckled.|$|R
50|$|Diaper rash can be {{considered}} a form of intertrigo, that is an area of skin irritation that occurs when there is excessive moisture between two opposing skin surfaces. The key is the excessive moisture. As such, anything that keeps the skin <b>surfaces</b> <b>dry</b> will end the problem.|$|R
25|$|Properly curing {{concrete}} leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the <b>surface</b> <b>dries</b> out prematurely. Care {{must also be}} taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the exothermic setting of cement. Improper curing can cause scaling, reduced strength, poor abrasion resistance and cracking.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>dry</b> suits {{may have}} socks or ankle seals fitted. Socks are {{normally}} made from latex rubber {{or from a}} breathable material similar {{to the rest of}} the suit. An outer boot or shoe would normally be worn over these socks to protect them from wear and the risk of puncture. The outer boot also provides more warmth than the thin layer of latex. A regular sock (e.g. a woollen sock) would normally be worn inside the drysuit sock for comfort. Latex rubber ankle seals are sometimes fitted in place of socks and can allow better foot control of water skis and surfboards. Survival suits may have neoprene socks of the same material as the suit, with tougher soles and ankle ties to keep them on the feet, as the [...] "one-size fits all" [...] socks must be too big for most users.|$|E

5000|$|Saturated <b>surface</b> <b>dry</b> (SSD) {{is defined}} as the {{condition}} of an aggregate in which the surfaces of the particles are [...] "dry" [...] (i.e., surface adsorption would no longer take place), but the inter-particle voids are saturated with water. In this condition aggregates will not affect the free water content of a composite material.|$|E

50|$|Covering bánh hỏi tightly reduces <b>surface</b> <b>drying,</b> {{which can}} make it sour, so market sellers put fresh bánh hỏi in bamboo baskets with banana leaves, and usually leave it open to air. For {{convenience}} or sanitary reasons, there are dried, packaged bánh hỏi, similar to dried, packaged rice vermicelli, {{for people who want}} to cook it themselves instead of buying fresh bánh hỏi from the markets.|$|R
50|$|In some situations, such as {{interior}} house paint, {{the orange}} peel texture is desirable. In this case, a texture paint is generally applied with a spray gun. The texture is then painted {{over with the}} appropriate color. When painting walls, orange peel can also develop by using a roller with too little paint or too thick a paint and the <b>surface</b> <b>dries</b> before the texture can level.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{low-water}} crossing can {{be constructed}} with culverts. Culverts (often concrete pipes) are used to carry {{the water in a}} stream keeping the crossing <b>surface</b> <b>dry</b> for most of the year. High flows, e.g. spring runoff or flash floods, flow {{over the top of the}} crossing, as the culverts are not large enough to carry these flood-type runoff events.|$|E
50|$|The Turpan Depression or Turfan Depression is a fault-bounded trough located {{around and}} south of the city-oasis of Turpan, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in far western China, about 150 km {{southeast}} of the regional capital Ürümqi. It includes the fourth lowest exposed point on the Earth's <b>surface</b> (<b>dry</b> Lake Ayding, −154 m), after the Dead Sea, Sea of Galilee, and Lake Assal (Djibouti). It is entirely below sea level. By some measures, it is also the hottest and driest area in China during the summer.|$|E
50|$|The Seymour aquifer may be locally {{confined}} under clay-rich {{soils and}} sediments. In {{the southern part}} of the city, the distribution and nature of the aquifer is consistent with one hosted by Pleistocene and/or Holocene fluvial channel deposits. The depth to water (hydrostatic head) averages 14 feet below the surface, closely correlated with topography. The water is likely sourced in coarse sands and gravels 10-19' below the <b>surface.</b> <b>Dry</b> holes in this same area contain no typically sand-gravel layers within the first 22 feet. The horizontal distribution of this shallow aquifer is irregular; dry holes may be adjacent to those with water yields.|$|E

5000|$|The test {{surface is}} cleaned {{to remove any}} dirt, paint, oil, grease or any loose scale that could either keep {{penetrant}} out of a defect, or cause irrelevant or false indications. Cleaning methods may include solvents, alkaline cleaning steps, vapor degreasing, or media blasting. The end goal of this step is a clean surface where any defects present {{are open to the}} <b>surface,</b> <b>dry,</b> and free of contamination. Note that if media blasting is used, it may [...] "work over" [...] small discontinuities in the part, and an etching bath is recommended as a post-blasting treatment.|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} {{water-resistant}} zipper {{is similar in}} construction to a standard toothed zipper, but includes a molded plastic ridge seal similar to the mating surfaces on a ziploc bag. Such a zipper is easier to open and close than a clipped version, and the slider has a gap above the zipper teeth for separating the ridge seal. This seal is structurally weak against internal pressure, and can be separated by pressure within the sealed container pushing outward on the ridges, which simply flex and spread apart, potentially allowing air or liquid entry through the spread-open ridges. Ridge-sealed zippers are sometimes used on lower-cost <b>surface</b> <b>dry</b> suits.|$|E
25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer <b>surfaces</b> <b>dry</b> out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the setting}} and tensile {{strength}} development of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) {{at a very}} early age was investigated by performing the penetration resistance test (ASTM C 403), as well as the direct tensile test using the newly developed test apparatus, and taking ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) measurements. In order to determine the optimum surface treatment method for preventing rapid <b>surface</b> <b>drying</b> of UHPC, four different methods were examined: plastic sheet, curing cover, membrane-forming compound, and paraffin oil. Based on the test results, the use of paraffin oil was found to be the best choice for measuring the penetration resistance and the UPV, and attaching the plastic sheet to the exposed surface was considered to be a simple method for preventing the rapid <b>surface</b> <b>drying</b> of UHPC elements. An S-shaped tensile strength development {{at a very early}} age (before 24 h) was experimentally obtained, and it was predicted by a power function of UPV. Lastly, the addition of shrinkage-reducing and expansive admixtures resulted in more rapid development of penetration resistance and UPV of UHPC...|$|R
