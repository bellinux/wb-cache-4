25|$|The Swedish word <b>smörgåsbord</b> {{consists}} <b>of</b> {{the words}} smörgås (sandwich, usually open-faced) and bord (table).

Gås literally means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of butter that formed and floated {{to the surface of}} cream while it was churned. These pieces reminded the old Swedish peasants of fat geese swimming to the surface. The small butter pieces were just the right size to be placed and flattened out on bread, so smörgås came to mean buttered bread. In Sweden, the term att breda smörgåsar (to spread butter on open-faced sandwiches) has been used since at least the 16th century.|$|R

The evidence gathered suggests a kind <b>of</b> <b>smorgasbord</b> with no uniform thought. What can be deduced from the literature, however, is the fluidity of millennialism and its ability to adapt and contort to the political ideology of the era. Moreover, millennialism provided a sense of purpose for the American continent with the Great Awakening serving as the legitimizing movement which both popularized and diffused the millennium. From the 1750 s, American millennialism began its evolution from a spiritual consummation of all things to a more politicized millennium, mirroring England.

40|$|Age is a {{delicate}} matter, but the Swedish welfare state is ageing and has an increasingly larger propor-tion of elderly people, about 19 per cent (Sweden Statistics, 2014). Since the election campaign in 2006, the matter of appropriate housing and caregiving for older frail persons has been a reoccurring item on the political agenda. Governmental delegations and programmes have ventured out into the great unknown territory of architectural experiences and age-related problems. However, one existing residential care home, in the following RCH, pops up as an exemplary and universal model for architec-ture and the frail ageing process, the residential care home of Vigs Ängar. Initiated as a mutual initiative in the early 1990 s, between a local anthroposophical interest group and the municipality of Ystad, Sweden, its creation and existence describe a troublesome tension between legal frameworks, managerial systems for eldercare, facility management and idealistic visions for fu-ture-oriented caregiving. Despite a 20 year existence, this exemplary model has resulted in few similar facilities, both architecture-wise and eldercare-wise. Instead, {{a large number of}} national and interna-tional study visits have turned the building along with caregiving into an open <b>smorgasbord</b> consisting <b>of</b> architectural elements or therapeutic approaches, subject to free sampling and tasting. To some extent, the anthroposophical label has clouded the resilient approach in architectural design and care-giving for the frail stages in life. The focus of this paper was to go behind semantics and unravel the generating images that constitute the fundamental reason for the exemplary status of the RCH in question. Critical analysis has been applied as a research method in order to scrutinize documents and drawings that originate from the design process. Random conversations and interviews with various informants associated with the RCH, among which the architect, have been executed over the period 2007 - 2013. This study suggests that the key factor in this successful realization of an RCH is the solid idea for a resilient architecture. This idea encompasses both ephemeral and tangible experiences of space that structure both the older person’s quality in life as well as the individual staff member’s satisfaction with the work envi-ronment. In that sense, the RCH of Vigs Ängar is more of a spatial sensation than an anthroposophical epiphany. QC 20150123 </p...|$|R

40|$|Far {{more deeply}} {{than most of}} us realize, the media (in {{particular}} film, but also television, magazines, newspapers, and, more recently, the internet) has been intrinsic to the history of medicine and public health. For many of us, what we know about public health, medicine, and disease has come to us through the media. The medical profession, and public health policies, came into being in their modern forms during {{the second part of the}} nineteenth century, as medicine professionalized and as public health became defined, codified and embodied in government bureaucracies as well as public and private institutions. These developments have coincided with, and relied upon, the growth of popular media that reached audiences of a variety of classes and backgrounds. Images of physicians, as well as images of health and disease, are disseminated through the modern media. In fact while we know a great deal about the way images have functioned in the history of health and medicine, much remains to be explored with respect to the role of the media in the history of health and medicine. In addition to providing diversion and entertainment, the media provide us with messages about health and disease (as every newspaper and magazine editor knows, these stories are read by the public with great interest). Public health officials have often aimed to mimic the way the media entices the public by presenting health information in ways that are entertaining. The medical profession itself has only a limited influence on these representations. As a consequence, medical and media understandings of health and disease do not always coincide. 	This volume offers a <b>smorgasbord</b> exploration <b>of</b> some of the issues arising from the at times amicable and at other times rather strained relationship between medicine and the media over the past century in the only-just-postcolonial zone of Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. It carries us from the health education movies made for Indonesians in the 1930 s and Maoris in the 1950 s to the sex education movies for the white Australian public catching up with the sexual revolution of the 1970 s. Its authors analyse portrayals of physicians and medical knowledge in contemporary film and television, such as the depiction of a physician diagnosing homosexuality in Heavenly Creatures and a troubled female medical student in Charlene Does Med at Uni. As a result, the articles in this volume stimulate us to explore the relationship between health and medicine and the media in much greater detail...|$|R
