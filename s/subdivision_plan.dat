2500|$|The first <b>subdivision</b> <b>plan</b> for the {{community}} of Killarney was registered with the Alberta Land Titles Office in 1906, and the lands were formally annexed by the City in 1910. Development before the Second World War was slow; most houses built {{at the time were}} one-storey clapboard structures. The community was filled out in the post-war era, when developers erected hundreds of small stucco and clapboard bungalows on the 25- and [...] wide lots. Since approximately 2002, developers have been replacing the older structures with low- and medium-density infill housing on a piecemeal basis.|$|E

2500|$|There is also {{an unwritten}} form of {{easement}} referred to as an implied easement or easement by implication, arising from the original subdivision of the land for continuous and obvious use of the adjacent parcel (e.g., for access to a road, or to a source of water) such as the right of lot owners in a subdivision to use the roadway on the approved <b>subdivision</b> <b>plan</b> without requiring a specific grant of easement to each new lot when first conveyed. An easement by necessity is distinguished from an easement by implication in that the easement by necessity arises only when [...] "strictly necessary", whereas the easement by implication can arise when [...] "reasonably necessary". Easement by necessity is a higher standard by which to imply an easement.|$|E
2500|$|Like all of Vancouver, the West End was {{originally}} a forested wilderness. The area was purchased in 1862 by John Morton, Samuel Brighouse, and William Hailstone, three men {{known as the}} [...] "Three Greenhorn Englishmen," [...] or just the [...] "Three Greenhorns," [...] owing {{to the belief that}} the naive men paid too much for the remote land. The men had plans to establish a brickworks on the shore of Coal Harbour, and their land claim {{was originally}} staked with the hopeful intent of mining for porcelain clays, but the grade of clay was not fine enough for that use. When those plans failed (a lack of transportation being a key factor) they sold {{a good portion of the}} area, by then known as the Brickmaker's Claim, to Victoria investors who in turn tried to promote its development as New Liverpool. The only thing that happened with that scheme was a <b>subdivision</b> <b>plan</b> registered with the Land Titles office in New Westminster. Another name used for the property was the Brighouse Estate (Brighouse as a name came to refer to a particular part of Richmond, where [...] "Greenhorn" [...] J. Morton also owned property). One of the partners, observant that brick was a valuable building commodity despite the abundance of timber in the region, moved the brick-clay operations to Sumas Mountain, establishing the community of Clayburn, now a neighbourhood of Abbotsford.|$|E
