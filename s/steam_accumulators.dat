40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes require high amounts of steam. Design {{and operation of}} steam plants are particularly complex when the steam supply is required for short periods and with a varying time schedules. To fulfil the discontinuous needs of steam users, avoiding the steam boiler oversizing to the peak value of the steam request, a thermal energy storage (TES) system can be adopted. The proper sizing of TES systems, which, in this application, is constituted by a <b>steam</b> <b>accumulator</b> vessel installed between the steam generator and the consumer, cannot {{be based on the}} sole initial and final state conditions of the steam storage, since a performance prediction of the process time-evolution is also required.

This paper puts a special emphasis on heat storage and thermo-economic evaluation. Preferable operating temperature {{of the system is}} first clarified on the basis of SE characteristics. The temperature-dependent permissible stress of steam accumulator is modelled and the capital cost is investigated. Comparison between the direct steam generation (DSG) SEGS and an indirect one using thermal oil is made at a power capacity of 1 MW and storage of 6. 5 h. The results indicate the DSG system has both thermodynamic and economic superiorities. The hot side temperature (THTH) of SORC generally does not exceed 250 °C to achieve an optimum solar thermal power efficiency. Given radiation of 750 W/m 2, the maximum efficiency (ηT,mηT,m) is 14. 3 % with a corresponding THTH around 240 °C. The material cost of pressure vessels is 2. 55 million RMB. For the indirect system, the optimal THTH is about 230 °C and ηT,mηT,m approximates to 13. 2 % and the estimated oil cost is 7. 92 million RMB.

40|$|Although steam {{is widely}} used in {{industrial}} production, there is often an imbalance between steam supply and demand, which ultimately results in steam waste. To solve this problem, <b>steam</b> <b>accumulators</b> (SAs) {{can be used as}} thermal energy storage and buffer units. However, it is difficult to promote the application of SAs due to high investment costs, which directly depend on the usage volume. Thus, the operation of SAs should be optimized to reduce initial investment through volume minimization. In this work, steam sources (SSs) are classified into two types: controllable steam sources (CSSs) and uncontrollable steam sources (UCSSs). A basic oxygen furnace (BOF) was selected {{as an example of a}} UCSS to study the optimal operation of an SA with a single BOF and sets of parallel-operating BOFs. In another case, a new method whereby CSSs cooperate with SAs is reported, and the mathematical model of the minimum necessary thermal energy storage capacity (NTESC) is established. A solving program for this mathematical model is also designed. The results show that for UCSSs, applying an SA in two parallel-operating SSs requires less capacity than that required between a single SS and its consumer. For CSSs, the proposed minimum NTESC method can effectively find the optimal operation and the minimum volume of an SA. The optimized volume of an SA is smaller than that used in practice, which results in a better steam storage effect...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{focussed}} on thermal storage technologies using phase change materials (PCMs) in the temperature range of 120 - 300 °C for {{solar thermal power}} generation and high temperature process heat. As state-of-the-art reference system a steam accumulator is described, which typically has a volume-specific thermal energy density of 20 - 30 kWh/m³. Regarding efficiency, a fundamental demand on thermal storage is the minimization of temperature differences between working fluid and storage medium. This requires isothermal storage systems for processes using water/steam. An obvious solution is, therefore, the application of PCMs. The selection of the PCMs depends strongly on the operation conditions of the respective application. At present, the main emphasis is directed to alkali metal nitrates and nitrites and their mixtures. For example, the eutectic mixture of the binary system KNO 3 -NaNO 3 {{has been identified as}} an excellent system to be used for processes using saturated steam at around 25 bar. At around 5 bar the ternary system KNO 3 -NaNO 2 -NaNO 3, commonly used as heat transfer fluid, can also be used as a PCM. To overcome the low thermal conductivity of the salt systems, approaches of increased surfaces area and increased thermal conductivity using expanded graphite (EG) have been investigated. Using EG/PCM-composites the effective thermal conductivity can be increased from below 0. 5 W/(mK) to 3 - 20 W/(mK). Three design concepts have been developed. In the macro-encapsulated design, the PCM is enclosed in metal tubes, giving a short distance for heat transfer and increasing the heat transfer area. In the second design, the heat exchanger tubes are embedded in EG/PCM-composite storage material. The third design option uses graphite foils arranged perpendicularly onto the heat exchanger tubes and a suitable salt system filled in between. The upgrade of existing <b>steam</b> <b>accumulators</b> using these PCM concepts is also proposed. ...|$|E

The aim was to calculate theannual electricity production {{taking into account the}} weather conditions as well as some steam storage. At first, a steam accumulator model was developed with Excel, in order to estimate the pressureevolution in the tanks during the charging, storage and discharging processes. The data obtained withthis model was then integrated to the thermodynamic cycle model, programmed with Excel, whichcalculated the electrical power production knowing the thermal power available in the solar field. Theelectricity production calculations were made every 600 seconds during one year. To improve the results accuracy, the influence of the plant location slope was estimated, calculating theequivalent azimuth and elevation angles in a new spherical coordinates system. For an average slope of 4. 21 ° at the plant location, the annual thermal energy gain is 14. 4 % (with a gain up to 60 % duringwinter days) and the annual electricity production is increased by 12. 59 %. The influence of frost on themirrors during cold and humid nights was also estimated with a simple model of the energy needed toheat up a constant layer of ice. Depending on the assumptions, the electricity production losses werebetween 1. 27 and 2. 84 % of annual electricity production. The losses due to plant shutdowns set by theelectrical network manager RTE during the snowmelt months were also estimated. The annualelectricity production could decrease by 8. 02 to 11. 57 % because of the load management, dependingon the days during which the plant is shutdown.

This paper conducts a review of how to optimize the {{concentrated solar power}} plant by increasing the stored energy capacity or by stabilizing the absorptance and emittance in the solar absorber.

The primary aim of this study was to formulate the strategies to reduce the water footprint in the palm oil production based on the best practice criteria. Both quantitative and qualitative research was conducted to get the value blue water (volume of surface or groundwater evaporated) and grey water (dilution volume to dilute pollutants according to agreed water quality standards). The values of water footprint in palm oil production obtained were used to represent the existing water use and were utilized as the basis for formulating strategies in reducing water use in the palm oil milling processes which was compared with the best practice criteria.

40|$|KERENA is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} concept with passive safety systems (Generation III+) of AREVA. The reactor is an evolutionary design of operating BWRs (Generation II). In order to verify the functionality and performance of the KERENA safety concept required for the transient and accident management, the test facility "Integral Teststand Karlstein" (INKA) was built at Karlstein (Germany). It is a mock-up of the KERENA boiling water reactor containment, with integrated pressure suppression system. The complete chain of passive safety components is available. The passive components and the levels are represented in full scale. The volume scaling of the containment compartments is approximately 1 : 24. The reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is simulated via the <b>steam</b> <b>accumulator</b> of the Karlstein Large Valve Test Facility. This vessel provides an energy storage capacity of approximately 1 / 6 of the KERENA RPV and is supplied by a Benson boiler with a thermal power of 22 MW. With respect to the available power supply, the containment- and system-sizing of the facility {{is by far the}} largest one of its kind worldwide. From 2009 to 2012, several single component tests were conducted (Emergency Condenser, Containment Cooling Condenser, Core Flooding System etc.). On March 21 st, 2013, the worldwide first large-scale only passively managed integral accident test of a boiling water reactor was simulated at INKA. The integral test measured the combined response of the KERENA passive safety systems to the postulated initiating event was the "Main Steam Line Break" (MSLB) inside the Containment with decay heat simulation. The results of the performed integral test (MSLB) showed that the passive safety systems alone are capable to bring the plant to stable conditions meeting all required safety targets with sufficient margins. Therefore the test verified the function of those components and the interplay between them as response to an anticipated accident scenario. The test provided evidence that the INKA is worldwide the first large scale test facility to perform integral verification tests of passive safety concepts under plant-like scaling and thermodynamic conditions. Hence, the test facility also shows that it is capable to perform containment response tests for existing Generation II BWRs (with active safety systems) and advanced (passive) reactor designs besides KERENA. These test results can be used to strengthen existing containment codes with regard to heat transfer, natural circulation, gas- and temperature stratification and others.
