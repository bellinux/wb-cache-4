Government and public sector websites publish enormous amount of data for sharing the data among their departments and also to public for research. Sensitive information {{of individuals}}, whose data are published must be protected. Privacy is challenged through two kinds of attack namely attribute disclosure and identity disclosure. Early Research contributions were made in this direction and new methods namely k-anonymity, ℓ-diversity, t-closeness are evolved. K-anonymity method preserves the privacy against identity disclosure attack alone. It fails to address attribute disclosure attack. ℓ-diversity method overcomes the drawback of k-anonymity method.

Training medical {{students}} in tobacco {{prevention and treatment}} skills is critical ifwearetohavecompetentphysicianspreparedtoaddress thegrave levelsofmorbidityandmortalityas-sociated with tobacco use. Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Education at US Medical Schools (PACE), a National Cancer Institute funded project, was launched to assess and improve curriculum contentandteachingat 12 USmedical schools. Methods. The 2003 surveywascompletedby facultyand administrators. The survey was divided into four main sections: tobacco content and skills, curricular evaluation, faculty perceptions of barriers and promoters, and educational vision. Results. Thirty-six percent of all medical school courses had some tobacco-related content. Five schools provided a total of between 4 and 8 hours of teaching, 5 schools provided 10 - 13 hours, and 2 schools provided 17 and 18 hours of teaching. Of the 12 schools, 8 had fewer hours devoted to tobacco teaching in the clerkships than during the 1 st-year courses. Only 2 schools noted any tobacco content for Obstetrics/Gynecology clerkships, and only 4 schools provided teaching in the pediatric <b>setting</b> (<b>range</b> 5 - 201 minutes). Conclu-sion. In comparison to earlier studies, it appears that more tobacco content is now integrated into medi-cal school courses. More improvement is necessary, however, particularly in tobacco use prevention.

In this scheme, {{with the knowledge of}} the number of traveling trains between two traction substations and the value of current which is drawn from each substation, the occurrence of short circuit fault is detected. The aforementioned data can be extracted and transmitted from railway traffic control system. Recently DDL (2 ̆ 7 Détection Défaut Lign in French 2 ̆ 7, which means 2 ̆ 7 Line Fault detection 2 ̆ 7) protection method is used in supply line protection. In this paper, the electrical system of railway system is simulated using the data obtained from Tabriz (located in Iran) Urban Railway Organization. The performance of the conventional and proposed protection schemes is compared and the simulation results are presented and then the practical measures and requirements of both methods are investigated.
