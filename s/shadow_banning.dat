50|$|Stealth banning (also called <b>shadow</b> <b>banning,</b> {{ghost banning}} or comment ghosting) is {{the act of}} {{blocking}} a user from an online community such that the user does not realize {{that they have been}} banned. By making a problem user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope is that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site. If the user never becomes aware that they were banned, it will not occur to them to attempt to circumvent that ban.|$|E
5000|$|The game is {{the first}} in the series to feature online {{multiplayer}}, with players having access to a massively multiplayer persistent world, as well as an online-only single player mode. Open Play gameplay is similar to EvE Online in that many actions which would be considered griefing in other multiplayer games are generally permitted here, so long as a valid roleplaying reason is attached. Examples include (but are not limited to) stealing from other players, extortion, and blocking off star systems via blockade or similar means. However, some actions, like [...] "mob mentality" [...] persecution, abusing exploits (such as so-called [...] "Combat Logging," [...] the act of quitting the game {{in the middle of a}} fight to avoid death) and cursing are still not allowed, and could eventually result in a <b>shadow</b> <b>ban,</b> meaning to lose access to the main server.|$|R
50|$|Team sponsor Franco Ambrosio's {{initials}} {{were used}} in the name of Arrows' first car, the Arrows FA1. Shadow sued for copyright infringement, claiming that the FA1 was a copy of the Shadow DN9. Arrows designed a greatly revised car, the Arrows A1, in 52 days. It was shown the day after the High Court of Justice in London upheld <b>Shadow's</b> claim and <b>banned</b> the team from racing the FA1.|$|R
50|$|From late December 1999 to January 2001, Tymoshenko was the Deputy Prime Minister for {{the fuel}} and energy {{sector in the}} cabinet of Viktor Yushchenko. She officially left {{parliament}} on 2 March 2000. Under her guidance, Ukraine's revenue collections from the electricity industry grew by several thousand percent. She scrapped the practice of barter in the electricity market, requiring industrial customers {{to pay for their}} electricity in cash. She also terminated exemptions for many organizations which excluded them from having their power disconnected. Her reforms meant that the government had sufficient funds to pay civil servants and increase salaries.In 2000, Tymoshenko's government provided an additional 18 billion Hryvna for social payments. Half of this amount was collected due to withdrawal of funds from <b>shadow</b> schemes, the <b>ban</b> on barter payments and the introduction of competition rules to the energy market.|$|R
