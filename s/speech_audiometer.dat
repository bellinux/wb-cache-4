40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{measurement}} accuracy of pure-tone and speech audiometers, in 1988 an extensive test system was built up in Germany for all those audiometers used in medical treatment, involving about 16 000 instruments in this country. This test system served {{as a model for}} the subsequent development of OIML recommendations for audiometers and features the following points: each new type of pure-tone or <b>speech</b> <b>audiometer</b> must pass a type-approval test, each individual audiometer must pass a conformity test before being delivered to the user, each audiometer must be serviced once a year. The aim of the present PTB report is to compile the characteristic data of the sound transducers most commonly used in German audiometry. This should make the tasks of designers of new audiometers, of maintenance services and of verification offices much easierAvailable from TIB Hannover: RO 3132 (27) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of increased intensity on the bone conducted speech discrimination ability of normal listeners utilizing standard audiological equipment. The NU- 6 word lists were utilized to test the bone conducted speech discrimination skills of ten normal hearing subjects, 21 to 30 years of age, on standard clinical equipment. Both the hearing levels (dB HL) and the sensation levels (dB SL) of the test administration were considered. In general, it was recommended that 100 dB Hl is the most appropriate dial setting for the administration of bone conducted speech discrimination tests even though comparable speech discrimination scores may be obtained with a 95 dB HL dial setting. This study indicates that the most appropriate sensation levels for the administration of bone conducted speech discrimination tests are 55 and 60 dB SL. Most normal listeners can be expected to achieve a 55 dB sensation level at the limits of the <b>speech</b> <b>audiometer</b> (100 dB HL). Additionally, it was found that when bone conducted speech discrimination tests are administered at levels of less than 55 dB SL, the results may be compromised by variances that occurred in this normal hearing sample. Therefore, the clinical audiologist should accept bone conducted speech discrimination results as valid only when the scores obtained at 40, 45 and 50 dB sensation levels are within the limits of clinical normality (90 % or better). Recommendations for further research are discussed...|$|E
