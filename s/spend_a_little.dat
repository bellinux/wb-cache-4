At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. There's good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. So you need that dissenting voice, and you need to understand it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it meant we could <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} fast days varies {{from year to}} year, but in general the Orthodox Christian can expect to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over half the year fasting at some level of strictness. There are spiritual, symbolic, and even {{practical}} reasons for fasting. In the Fall from Paradise mankind became possessed by a carnal nature; that is to say, became inclined towards the passions. Through fasting, Orthodox Christians attempt {{to return to the}} relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Paradise in their own lives, by refraining from carnal practices, by bridling the tongue (...) , confession of sins, prayer and almsgiving.|$|E
2500|$|Webcomic Diesel Sweeties {{released}} a DRM-free PDF e-book on author R Stevens's 35th birthday, leading {{to more than}} 140,000 downloads in the first month, according to Stevens. He followed this with a DRM-free iBook specifically for the iPad, using Apple's new software, which generated more than 10,000 downloads in three days. That led Stevens to launch a Kickstarter project – [...] "ebook stravaganza 3000" [...] – to fund the conversion of 3,000 comics, written over 12 years, into a single [...] "humongous" [...] e-book to be released both for free and through the iBookstore; launched 8 February 2012, {{with the goal of}} raising $3,000 in 30 days, the project met its goal in 45 minutes, and went on to be funded at more than 10 times its original goal. The [...] "payment optional" [...] DRM-free model in this case was adopted on Stevens' view that [...] "there is a class of webcomics reader who would prefer to read in large chunks and, even better, would be willing to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|A primary {{consideration}} for the game was the cost of entry to enjoy the new features of the game particularly in Pro mode; both {{the cost of the}} new keyboard and Pro guitars (ranging from $80 to 280) and the time investment to learn these aspects was considered high and may only cater to niche players. The Metro noted that if one does not purchase any of the additional hardware controllers, [...] "it's not much different to Rock Band 2". Goldstein commented that the amount of investment into the game will affect one's perception of the game's value: [...] "either something completely new and challenging or just more tracks to rock out to". Goldstein further noted that with the cost and time spent on the Pro guitar models, [...] "why not <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more and buy the real thing". Several reviewers commented that the buttoned Mustang Pro guitar is not as sturdy as other instruments and does not have the same tactile feel as a real guitar. Specifically, the reviewers noted that the width of the button impressions do not vary in width as real guitar strings would, and there is no tactile feedback as one would have with a fretboard. These reviewers suggested that players, if dedicated to the Pro guitar mode, to wait for the stringed Fender Squier which had more favorable reviews.|$|E

60|$|They {{talked and}} planned, though in truth it was Euchre who planned, Duane who listened and agreed.
